one thing I want to point out is

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.820 
one thing I want to point out is
actually<00:00:05.520> left<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.839> part<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.379> said<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.680> was

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
actually left the part that I said I was

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.160 
actually left the part that I said I was
gonna<00:00:08.210> take<00:00:09.210> off<00:00:10.400> only<00:00:11.400> because<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:12.300> figured

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
gonna take off only because I figured

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:21.620 
gonna take off only because I figured
that<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:17.119> that<00:00:18.119> hose<00:00:18.390> back<00:00:18.690> there<00:00:20.630> right

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
that that that hose back there right

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.970 
that that that hose back there right
there<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.010> middle<00:00:23.220> yeah<00:00:23.430> it's<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.859> it's<00:00:25.859> a

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
there in the middle yeah it's so it's a

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.160 
there in the middle yeah it's so it's a
grip<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.310> onto<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.119> metal<00:00:27.720> port<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
grip it onto that the metal port in the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.700 
grip it onto that the metal port in the
middle<00:00:28.470> host<00:00:28.680> heart<00:00:29.240> so<00:00:30.240> tightly<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.869> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
middle host heart so tightly that you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.380 
middle host heart so tightly that you
know<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.859> would<00:00:32.489> have<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.790> probably<00:00:33.000> have<00:00:33.300> to

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
know I would have to probably have to

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.330 
know I would have to probably have to
cut<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> off<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.739> he<00:00:34.920> goes<00:00:35.160> into<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.090> I

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
cut it off and he goes into the the I

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.010 
cut it off and he goes into the the I
think<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.520> heater<00:00:38.760> core<00:00:39.090> inside<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
think it's a heater core inside the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.979 
think it's a heater core inside the
engine<00:00:40.379> bay<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.890> should<00:00:41.879> be<00:00:42.030> sorry

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
engine bay and should be sorry

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.549 
engine bay and should be sorry
the<00:00:43.200> cab<00:00:43.410> itself<00:00:44.539> and<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:46.050> really<00:00:46.289> don't<00:00:46.440> want

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the cab itself and I really don't want

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.440 
the cab itself and I really don't want
to<00:00:46.620> mess<00:00:47.100> around<00:00:47.309> with<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.700> replaced<00:00:48.329> it

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
to mess around with that I replaced it

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.380 
to mess around with that I replaced it

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
right there so this is a thermostat

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.859 
right there so this is a thermostat
housing

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
housing

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.410 
housing
I'm<00:01:25.200> gonna<00:01:25.320> go<00:01:25.530> ahead<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.950> well<00:01:26.850> I'm<00:01:26.939> actually

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
I'm gonna go ahead and well I'm actually

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.550 
I'm gonna go ahead and well I'm actually
might<00:01:27.540> leave<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> thermostat<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.290> right<00:01:28.409> now

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
might leave the thermostat in right now

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.330 
might leave the thermostat in right now
but<00:01:28.710> I'm<00:01:28.829> definitely<00:01:28.979> gonna<00:01:29.220> replace<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.820> just

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
but I'm definitely gonna replace it just

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.969 
but I'm definitely gonna replace it just
I<00:01:32.570> don't<00:01:33.570> wanna<00:01:33.930> mess<00:01:34.409> around<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.770> too

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
I don't wanna mess around with it too

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.740 
I don't wanna mess around with it too
much<00:01:35.159> other<00:01:35.610> than<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:36.060> labeling<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.630> and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
much other than just labeling it and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.240 
much other than just labeling it and
making<00:01:36.900> sure<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.560> gets<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.860> right<00:01:37.979> spot

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
making sure it gets in the right spot

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.210 
making sure it gets in the right spot
but<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:39.079> think<00:01:40.079> that's<00:01:40.229> pretty<00:01:40.740> good<00:01:40.860> right<00:01:41.159> now

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
but I think that's pretty good right now

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.560 
but I think that's pretty good right now
for<00:01:41.790> what<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:43.020> was<00:01:44.009> for<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.759> engine<00:01:45.119> as

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
for what I have was for this engine as

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.050 
for what I have was for this engine as
you<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.079> mean<00:01:46.590> he'll<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.369> did<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.759> lot

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
you can see I mean he'll I I did a lot

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.289 
you can see I mean he'll I I did a lot
today<00:01:48.720> getting<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.500> off<00:01:49.939> getting<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.090> off

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
today getting that off getting that off

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.050 
today getting that off getting that off
me<00:01:51.710> now<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:53.040> actually<00:01:53.280> see<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
me now we can actually see the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.030 
me now we can actually see the
individual<00:01:54.630> heads<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.290> just<00:01:55.470> not<00:01:55.680> cover<00:01:55.950> it

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
individual heads and just not cover it

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.200 
individual heads and just not cover it
up<00:01:56.100> with<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> bunch<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.640> stuff<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:59.460> yeah<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.820> think

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
up with a bunch of stuff so yeah I think

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.990 
up with a bunch of stuff so yeah I think
I'm<00:02:00.329> going<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.770> go<00:02:01.770> ahead<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.280> do<00:02:02.820> some

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
I'm going to go ahead and do some

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.770 
I'm going to go ahead and do some
research<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.750> next<00:02:04.020> steps<00:02:04.700> I<00:02:05.700> really<00:02:06.689> do

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
research on the next steps I really do

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.270 
research on the next steps I really do
think<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.259> exhaust<00:02:07.530> manifold<00:02:07.979> but<00:02:08.190> it

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
think it's the exhaust manifold but it

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.680 
think it's the exhaust manifold but it
might<00:02:08.429> also<00:02:08.459> be<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:08.970> getting<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.300> rocker

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
might also be just getting the rocker

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.850 
might also be just getting the rocker
covers<00:02:10.110> off<00:02:10.379> too

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.160 

in<00:02:13.860> order<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.190> get<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.720> get<00:02:15.840> these<00:02:15.930> heads

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
in order to get this you get these heads

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.380 
in order to get this you get these heads
off<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.320> get<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.620> good<00:02:16.830> evaluation<00:02:17.490> on<00:02:18.060> higher

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
off and get a good evaluation on higher

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.500 
off and get a good evaluation on higher
things<00:02:18.420> one<00:02:19.430> okay<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:21.060> think<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.360> might

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
things one okay so I think I might

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.690 
things one okay so I think I might
actually<00:02:21.570> call<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.230> for<00:02:22.530> today<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:22.800> might<00:02:23.520> come

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
actually call it for today I might come

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.270 
actually call it for today I might come
back<00:02:23.880> down<00:02:24.060> here<00:02:24.210> today<00:02:24.680> it's<00:02:25.680> only<00:02:25.770> like<00:02:26.010> five

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
back down here today it's only like five

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.180 
back down here today it's only like five
o'clock<00:02:26.840> so<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.870> might<00:02:28.260> come<00:02:28.470> down<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.860> evening

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
o'clock so I might come down the evening

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.370 
o'clock so I might come down the evening
a<00:02:29.370> little<00:02:29.640> more<00:02:29.820> but<00:02:30.030> I'm<00:02:30.330> pretty<00:02:30.570> actually

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
a little more but I'm pretty actually

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.260 
a little more but I'm pretty actually
kind<00:02:31.740> of<00:02:31.800> hungry<00:02:32.010> right<00:02:32.100> now<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.890> yeah<00:02:35.040> I'll

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
kind of hungry right now so so yeah I'll

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
kind of hungry right now so so yeah I'll
take<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.330> look<00:02:36.480> at<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.630> see<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:36.930> do<00:02:37.050> some<00:02:37.230> more

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
take a look at the see and do some more

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.570 
take a look at the see and do some more
research<00:02:37.500> on<00:02:37.710> what<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.920> next<00:02:38.220> steps<00:02:38.460> are

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
research on what the next steps are

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.330 
research on what the next steps are
right
