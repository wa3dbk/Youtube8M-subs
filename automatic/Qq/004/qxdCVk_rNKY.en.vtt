00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.650
 we are a claudio tagliafraschi director 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:16.320
 tc bisenzio technician who will have the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.270
 big responsibility to start this 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.990
 grand tennis lesson course 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.820
 so we will see so many masters at work 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.010
 which explain a small aspect 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.289
 specific to training la 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.550
 preparation of the resistance since 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.660
 tournaments still begin a few months 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.970
 tell us a little about what we will see today 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.970
 obviously just never anticipated if 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.530
 alexio no these pedestrian girls 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.149
 then they will do in a couple of nights then 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.250
 they are now giving a speech bite 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.739
 precisely both on and off the field 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.559
 this morning just maybe two 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.360
 exercises with oneself one in the basket and one in 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.880
 dribble would not just have a case 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.550
 not even players about their act 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:02.629
 exercise but it's ok they even know they have 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:06.330
 a starting point for which are the objectives 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.250
 I am just as anticipated to work 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.150
 a lot of guys work on this one 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.310
 conditional therefore residence together 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.400
 Two technicians can have many 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.290
 variations that may not be from the various 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.780
 strokes cuts 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.510
 from the various episodes in the field 1 st on the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.100
 re-enter each side step or step 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.370
 twisted and anyway after see a 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.740
 the writer will be on the dribble there are 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.800
 of changes of direction to the 20th perhaps 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.690
 bigger than the direction where exactly 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.470
 on fundamentals limbo the research case 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.600
 of the supports and of crude number it is exited 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.460
 his first exercise then meanwhile 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.410
 with these guys they are working are 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.020
 speech of resistance there 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.940
 given that in tournaments they will have between 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.160
 a couple of months so now doing a 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.869
 class decided to basket where not to hit 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.240
 by right, but they always direct me 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.160
 of the coup naples to 100 however we have them 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.710
 forcing to return instead the 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.040
 short classic concert step 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.750
 all players but enough 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.070
 wanted quotes do it for then lasts 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.200
 even more hard working I 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.420
 mostly with the legs are forced 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.780
 to always go back steps with la 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.310
 evening this made me precisely for 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.620
 go to work more on the part 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.150
 so now on the athletic part 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.610
 technically there is a big job of 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.260
 resistance that clearly between some 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.300
 Liguria but the boy was doing it 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.450
 same exercise on reverse c 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.209
 explainable the importance of the first step 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.880
 then step alternately instead of step a 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.140
 legs I wonder how the difference 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.610
 difference because point is that in 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.700
 any tender action on one 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.620
 side shift enough a hundred 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.870
 want any type of player to 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.340
 high level take the first step 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.470
 cross I didn't alternate in this 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.820
 way four installments of the backhand standing 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.090
 by doing so now he had it 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.650
 because it affects politics 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.420
 crossing the left foot this e 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.940
 earn more time last less in fact 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.670
 they more quickly 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.820
 have in this nation in any 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.260
 type 18 hours precisely to cheer a 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.630
 level therefore for this is the reason 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.730
 so precisely at this moment he goes with 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.760
 you can work it in two ways and 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.320
 no strips already have this thing 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.330
 the acquired year that can go then 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.220
 re on resistance by having it done 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.200
 a contrary thing is obvious that a 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.120
 kid in the early years or can 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.680
 10 11 year old kids will work up 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.920
 other aspects not on this aspect 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.269
 quite 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.709
 complex and important where if 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.739
 collaborate a part faces that 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.110
 she is doing alone the actress is precisely 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.540
 the step from what you do 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.549
 no training by hits and every 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.140
 return with the user however speaks of 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.450
 can arrive more or less angled from 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.370
 always enter this side steps 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.099
 in this case he is working 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.980
 very much bond becomes very hard and 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.290
 very low with legs and I repeat 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.060
 only in the breeding phase the return 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.090
 correct what we will see instead 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.500
 from abroad to the perfect now 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.930
 instead at this time doing that 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.909
 which one to do properly for 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.889
 just explain the difference e 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.420
 the action of legs 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.069
 every time you hit a step first 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.989
 from some showers between left leg 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.180
 will cross the right leg and 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:17.859
 therefore it will gain much more time and lasts 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.859
 especially less much less effort 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.510
 meanwhile luis is pleased to thank you and 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.960
 present that of your own 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:30.900
 your high voltage also for 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.430
 the opportunity nothing our tc bisenzio 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.970
 telling the story of the circle us 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.940
 we have a tennis school where 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.410
 we manage to be some media users 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.370
 farms in the morning as far as 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.919
 concerns the agonists 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.509
 we have three four circles are 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.759
 remarkable and come slowly of ad 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.320
 train more young second ones 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.699
 we heard them choirs and offenses a 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.770
 rigors and however clearly going to 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.199
 school will be the afternoon then the school 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.500
 tennis continues to have always great 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.389
 numbers 130 boys including agonists 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.550
 in all the years and maybe nothing 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.560
 the known staff of Sono are presented 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.510
 to work the fable as director 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.850
 but then there is already the other batons 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.180
 c4 the small fat brands paltracca 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.970
 it will be a fairly large number 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.139
 tommassini all abroad but on the dog 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.930
 because under warning 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.270
 it is necessary to specify and in addition between two 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.820
 athletic trainers also local where 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.099
 cites massara col si Ã¨ ri voices and mi 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.479
 seems to have been enough now not 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:29.460
 we work more at the trash we are 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.539
 always working on the field 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.590
 resistance 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.169
 can you explain what they are 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.180
 making girls that yara in this 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.800
 moment we talk about time 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.960
 but in dribbling you can work either 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.570
 in this case no technically and 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.160
 especially on changes of direction 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.710
 important in this action that they do 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.150
 always pay attention to the supports to do 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.409
 be very careful of the contributions you make 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.180
 rhythm is not very high 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:52.169
 to the logic retiree 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.740
 make as little mistakes as possible 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.370
 hit the ball 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.979
 always in fallacious the fundamental neighbor 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.830
 this is my instrument that is beatrice 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.419
 in that the direction is changing 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.870
 practically paint remains firm in a 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:10.270
 corner and the game two balls always long 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.650
 is the third the fiom ha crossed e 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.569
 so alessia is right now 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.000
 moving to the right torment forever 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:17.710
 the same area because he understands now is 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.300
 make two speak diagonally now 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.349
 tons upwind so why you do it 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.030
 stop for ten exchanges while at it 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:27.610
 moves that in fact in this moment 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.919
 precisely of malaysia plays blows 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.360
 lungolinea now and beatrice has changed 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:35.199
 in the dialect now the straight past 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.960
 crusader continues to cross east g20 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:42.419
 at the center even now the actress changes 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.419
 the long line again
