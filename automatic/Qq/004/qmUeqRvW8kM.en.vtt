in<00:00:00.210> a<00:00:00.269> week<00:00:00.480> filled<00:00:00.780> with<00:00:01.020> sci-fi<00:00:01.310> inventions

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
in a week filled with sci-fi inventions

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.649 
in a week filled with sci-fi inventions
being<00:00:02.550> made<00:00:02.700> universities<00:00:03.360> around<00:00:03.480> the

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
being made universities around the

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.960 
being made universities around the
country<00:00:03.720> we<00:00:04.110> have<00:00:04.230> one<00:00:04.410> from<00:00:04.680> NYU<00:00:05.100> and<00:00:05.520> they

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
country we have one from NYU and they

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.089 
country we have one from NYU and they
have<00:00:06.089> built<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.509> real-life<00:00:07.080> tractor<00:00:07.620> beam<00:00:07.799> uh

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
have built a real-life tractor beam uh

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.400 
have built a real-life tractor beam uh
not<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:08.940> big<00:00:09.150> one<00:00:09.360> unfortunately<00:00:10.050> it's<00:00:10.200> pretty

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
not a big one unfortunately it's pretty

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.959 
not a big one unfortunately it's pretty
tiny<00:00:10.620> yet<00:00:10.950> but<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.370> might<00:00:11.580> be<00:00:11.610> able<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.880> be

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
tiny yet but it might be able to be

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.249 
tiny yet but it might be able to be
scaled<00:00:12.240> up<00:00:12.360> in<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.570> future<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:12.990> let<00:00:13.080> me<00:00:13.139> give

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
scaled up in the future so let me give

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.049 
scaled up in the future so let me give
some<00:00:13.410> details<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.860> coming<00:00:14.160> from<00:00:14.280> NYU

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
some details is coming from NYU

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.210 
some details is coming from NYU
physicist<00:00:15.690> David<00:00:16.080> ruffner<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.650> David<00:00:16.949> Greer

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
physicist David ruffner and David Greer

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.250 
physicist David ruffner and David Greer
and<00:00:17.520> what<00:00:18.029> they've<00:00:18.180> used<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.840> something

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
and what they've used is something

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.529 
and what they've used is something
called<00:00:19.500> out<00:00:19.830> they've<00:00:20.130> used<00:00:20.279> Bessel<00:00:20.699> beams<00:00:20.910> uh

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
called out they've used Bessel beams uh

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.599 
called out they've used Bessel beams uh
and<00:00:22.020> what<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.619> basically<00:00:22.650> does<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.400> it

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
and what it basically does is it

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.170 
and what it basically does is it
combines<00:00:24.000> two<00:00:24.810> beams<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:26.250> cause<00:00:26.519> like<00:00:26.910> to

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
combines two beams that cause like to

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.779 
combines two beams that cause like to
move<00:00:27.390> around<00:00:27.570> an<00:00:27.960> object<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.769> then<00:00:29.279> because

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
move around an object and then because

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.730 
move around an object and then because
it's<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> opposite<00:00:30.630> side<00:00:30.900> if<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.380> object

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
it's on the opposite side if the object

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.990 
it's on the opposite side if the object
is<00:00:31.800> small<00:00:32.099> enough<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.399> we're<00:00:32.579> talking<00:00:32.700> about

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
is small enough and we're talking about

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.060 
is small enough and we're talking about
like<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.690> particles<00:00:34.079> basically<00:00:34.680> like<00:00:34.829> tiny

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
like like particles basically like tiny

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.130 
like like particles basically like tiny
little<00:00:35.160> things<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.910> actually<00:00:36.239> forms<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.930> sort

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
little things it actually forms a sort

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.319 
little things it actually forms a sort
of<00:00:37.260> light<00:00:37.710> conveyor<00:00:38.309> belt<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.730> moves<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
of light conveyor belt that moves the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.389 
of light conveyor belt that moves the
object<00:00:39.450> back<00:00:39.989> towards<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> source<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
object back towards the source of the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.060 
object back towards the source of the
beams<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.690> hypothetically<00:00:43.350> if<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.860> scale

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
beams and so hypothetically if you scale

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.920 
beams and so hypothetically if you scale
that<00:00:44.280> up<00:00:44.340> you'd<00:00:44.610> be<00:00:44.730> able<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.090> move<00:00:45.270> objects

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
that up you'd be able to move objects

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.299 
that up you'd be able to move objects
toward<00:00:46.320> something<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.860> much<00:00:47.010> bigger<00:00:47.190> scale

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
toward something in a much bigger scale

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.150 
toward something in a much bigger scale
now<00:00:48.210> why<00:00:48.510> would<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:49.020> useful<00:00:49.410> as<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.010> can

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
now why would this be useful as you can

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.500 
now why would this be useful as you can
see<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.489> while<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:50.789> zoom<00:00:50.969> out<00:00:51.120> will<00:00:51.300> show<00:00:51.420> you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
see it while we zoom out will show you

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.389 
see it while we zoom out will show you
that<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.899> image<00:00:52.079> there<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
that the image there this is like a

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.639 
that the image there this is like a
sci-fi<00:00:53.640> staple<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> idea<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.620> was

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
sci-fi staple the idea of the that was

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.860 
sci-fi staple the idea of the that was
that<00:00:55.920> said<00:00:56.160> affixing<00:00:56.550> my<00:00:56.579> IV<00:00:57.059> okay<00:00:57.510> I'm<00:00:57.690> we'll

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
that said affixing my IV okay I'm we'll

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.660 
that said affixing my IV okay I'm we'll
make<00:00:58.050> sure<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.199> see<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.129> here<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.640> see

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
make sure we see that so here you see

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.490 
make sure we see that so here you see
from<00:00:59.969> Star<00:01:00.180> Trek<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.629> been<00:01:00.870> Star<00:01:01.170> Wars<00:01:01.379> as

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
from Star Trek it's been Star Wars as

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.830 
from Star Trek it's been Star Wars as
well<00:01:01.680> i'm<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.489> space<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:03.030> need<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> be<00:01:03.660> able<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
well i'm in space we need to be able to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.050 
well i'm in space we need to be able to
move<00:01:03.989> things<00:01:04.320> uh<00:01:04.920> what<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:05.670> needed<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.939> move

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
move things uh what if we needed to move

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.850 
move things uh what if we needed to move
like<00:01:06.360> an<00:01:06.570> asteroid<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.439> was<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> collision

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
like an asteroid that was on a collision

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.649 
like an asteroid that was on a collision
course<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.580> space<00:01:08.850> station<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.420> with<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
course with a space station or with the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.440 
course with a space station or with the
earth<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:10.049> something<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:11.330> Syrians<00:01:12.330> I

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
earth or something like that Syrians I

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.450 
earth or something like that Syrians I
thought<00:01:12.659> you're<00:01:12.869> gonna<00:01:13.020> say<00:01:13.260> an<00:01:13.500> astronaut's

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
thought you're gonna say an astronaut's

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.010 
thought you're gonna say an astronaut's
kidding<00:01:16.070> he's<00:01:17.070> coming<00:01:17.400> wrong<00:01:17.549> cause<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:18.210> not

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
kidding he's coming wrong cause it's not

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.429 
kidding he's coming wrong cause it's not
like<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.350> would<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:22.020> would<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.259> useful

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
like you would like that would be useful

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.899 
like you would like that would be useful
to<00:01:22.770> know<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.369> that's<00:01:23.520> why<00:01:23.640> I'm<00:01:23.670> laughing

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
to know but that's why I'm laughing

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.840 
to know but that's why I'm laughing
exactly<00:01:24.720> now<00:01:24.930> there<00:01:25.439> there's<00:01:25.710> again<00:01:26.189> caveats

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
exactly now there there's again caveats

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.850 
exactly now there there's again caveats
and<00:01:27.060> all<00:01:27.210> these<00:01:27.360> sci-fi<00:01:27.570> stories

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
and all these sci-fi stories

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.080 
and all these sci-fi stories
unfortunately<00:01:28.860> it's<00:01:29.070> difficult<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.820> scale

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
unfortunately it's difficult to scale

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.310 
unfortunately it's difficult to scale
this<00:01:30.299> up<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.170> energy

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
this up because of the energy

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.289 
this up because of the energy
requirements<00:01:31.979> now<00:01:32.400> maybe<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.210> future

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
requirements now maybe in the future

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.929 
requirements now maybe in the future
we'll<00:01:34.110> have<00:01:34.290> energy<00:01:35.159> sources<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.640> are<00:01:35.700> much

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
we'll have energy sources that are much

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.940 
we'll have energy sources that are much
more<00:01:36.150> powerful<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:37.259> they<00:01:37.380> say<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:37.829> you

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
more powerful but they say that if you

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.230 
more powerful but they say that if you
were<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> scale<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.579> up<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.850> move<00:01:39.000> something

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
were to scale this up to move something

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.789 
were to scale this up to move something
like<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> Borg<00:01:39.780> cube<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.259> amount<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.560> energy

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
like a Borg cube the amount of energy

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.310 
like a Borg cube the amount of energy
required<00:01:41.220> would<00:01:42.060> actually<00:01:42.390> crush<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.869> object

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
required would actually crush the object

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.139 
required would actually crush the object
so<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.220> would<00:01:44.310> come<00:01:44.460> towards<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.030> it

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
so it would come towards you but it

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.090 
so it would come towards you but it
would<00:01:45.240> be<00:01:45.270> crushed<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.770> you're<00:01:46.920> trying

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
would be crushed so that you're trying

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.789 
would be crushed so that you're trying
to<00:01:47.189> go<00:01:47.310> into<00:01:47.430> me<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.030> you're<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.329> oh<00:01:48.799> you

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
to go into me and you're like oh you

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.469 
to go into me and you're like oh you
don't<00:01:50.090> but<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.299> still<00:01:51.479> be<00:01:51.570> good<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:54.270> are

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
don't but that can still be good so are

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.359 
don't but that can still be good so are
you<00:01:54.630> excited<00:01:54.750> about<00:01:55.170> tractor<00:01:55.710> beams<00:01:55.950> or<00:01:56.219> just

you excited about tractor beams or just

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.450 
you excited about tractor beams or just
moving<00:01:56.729> cookies<00:01:57.619> okay<00:01:58.619> my<00:01:58.860> immediate<00:01:59.159> thought
