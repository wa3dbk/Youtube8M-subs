 Hello dear friends followers 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:19.230
 of my channel with you i'm eugene king and 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.400
 today we talk about the portal to heaven yes 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.860
 portal to paradise 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.840
 how to build it and what for us 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.929
 will it be needed and can it be built in 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.630
 normal minecraft so let's first 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:35.040
 build we need luminous stone 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.250
 with gustav and gold lighter gold 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.960
 lighter we need to be sure 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.449
 so as you already understand in usually 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.360
 my map is impossible to build 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.430
 only with auto mods in simple in 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.640
 court I think you will not find such 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.970
 here's a golden lighter and so how is he 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.390
 it is built as well as 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.180
 normal portal to hell only glowing 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.890
 of our stone 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.890
 in such a way get settled and 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.570
 sets fire to the golden lighter and here 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.549
 such beautiful bubbles from him 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.720
 comes and this is my first look at paradise i 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:19.410
 never there was not yet seen seen 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.410
 try that there well let's go 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.930
 let's see what we have there 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.390
 I was curious to make this video about 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.480
 volume on rate watched a couple of videos on 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.970
 youtube where it was said that you can 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.300
 build in normal minecraft portal in 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.760
 paradise 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:41.190
 and after that a couple of minutes of viewing I already 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.729
 I understood that this is just a hoax or people 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.100
 then in this portal was flooded with water and not 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.950
 We went there because we knew that 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.590
 nothing happens and just sort of 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.170
 They said that the type of game will fly away from me 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.220
 either i will not log me all for 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.100
 lags 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.060
 either try to build it yourself and all 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.760
 will see 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.030
 so this simple deception is not necessary 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.910
 kill your time on a cube like this 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.710
 and cheats and waste your nerves out of you there 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.100
 something will not turn out to be and 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.110
 it seems to me that you can freak out 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.780
 something wrong doing there they invent 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.530
 such schemes still with a groan there which 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.120
 generally here 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.770
 week so do n't even try normally 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.350

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:36.300

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.980
 download and walk and then walk in paradise 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.180

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:46.660

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:33.480
