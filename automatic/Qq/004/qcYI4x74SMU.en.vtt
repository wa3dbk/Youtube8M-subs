00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.920
 Hi there really players 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.040
 To the end 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:15.410
 Thanks for fighting well and working hard 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.440
 I think that the latter seems to have been able to win the horse guard fence 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.970
 Many supporters 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.850
 For rushing to support this Saitama Stadium 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.100
 After all that supporter 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.500
 I was able to give a title 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.630
 I am really happy 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.890
 When it becomes it does you what 02 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.840
 While I think that Na Ne have 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.840
 I thought I did it but I think- 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.329
 Mr. Nishimura 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:52.800
 Before the game, I told Iwashita that I told you 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.110
 Only the red guard in the same house says please forgive me 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.480
 It is and will ask 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.650
 I entered the game 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:07.630
 And me taking pk early 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:09.830
 It is to Toka clear bis Well then still say I car Mr. me a little temper 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.210
 If by now and 02 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:18.740
 I thought it was a tough game , but after all 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:22.650
 The end this time after all the team was firmly organized 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:26.820
 I was able to return one tax mark because it was big 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.480
 In a team-like atmosphere in the end 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.480
 Half Big Fool 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.880
 I think it seems that I was able to get a good deal 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:44.080
 Omori is very aggressive from the start of the second half 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.600
 After playing and catching up with the tie again 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.020
 The whole team is good 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.050
 With the same momentum 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.790
 3 In the form of what is called a final 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:02.670
 I think it seems that it was huge to keep doing ci . 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:08.410
 If Usami and Patrick are as defensive as that, aren't they? 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:13.230
 It's really easy, but did you just do it during the finals ? 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.650
 What about the Reds game on January 22nd? 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.819
 It is for a little trouble from now on again 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.140
 Just that 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:26.440
 It was a story of mine that I could not reach 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:33.550
 I was able to take the title 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:39.370
 Thanks to those great players, there is also a great staff here 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:41.110
 I think Fu that thanks to who have supported up to club me really support the team 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.490
 Thanks 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.670
 In this way 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:51.660
 Team that came up from j 2 is first 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.660
 Will Nde I think Fu that was able to take and take as the title of the score up 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.120
 Well about today 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.540
 Happy with everyone 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.540
 Also 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.420
 You should take a rest and refresh 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.260
 Toward a Rig Battle 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.069
 I think the Fu that I want continue to firmly preparation 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.069
 Thank you very much
