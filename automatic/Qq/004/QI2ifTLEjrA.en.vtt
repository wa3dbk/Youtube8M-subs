00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hear colleagues because yesterday around 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.660
 7 o'clock in the afternoon after it was 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.599
 fired from his position as coach of 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.910
 the national team miguel herrera gave 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.679
 a press release a statement 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.269
 short press that we are going to read 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.740
 here that seems very similar to the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.510
 lectures I gave after the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.070
 matches I will tell you why this 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.660
 conduit told me so 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.430
 happened in the last hours I want 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.779
 offer a public apology to the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.430
 hobby technical staff players 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.590
 Mexican Football Federation 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.330
 managers and media by 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.189
 my conduct in the painful incident that 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.170
 I had with a commentator does not mention that 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.760
 commentator it is clear to me that it is not the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.860
 attitude that a coach should take 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.870
 the national team of mexico 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.969
 despite having received all kinds of 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.160
 offensive criticism and ridicule towards me 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.809
 family and my person to the great hobby 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.270
 mexicana I appreciate all the support during 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.160
 my process as a coach to the fmf 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.930
 the support received during my administration 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.270
 understanding that the decision is made 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.920
 but he accepted the same 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.390
 it saddens me deeply to leave the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.770
 technical selection position by 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.480
 this unfortunate cause because the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.970
 sports results were in his 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.570
 positive majority within the 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.250
 traced objectives took the opportunity to give 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.050
 thanks to all the means of 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.870
 communication for their collaboration during 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.360
 my process I hope you understand the moment 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.060
 what I'm going through I'll take advantage of 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.970
 to enjoy my big family and 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.910
 rest a while later I'll go back 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.070
 being the same ay what scare will they get 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.350
 with me as always the doors 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.509
 open there are two things for you good 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.630
 from my point of view 31 does not mention 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.710
 cristian that you have to mention it no 2 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.330
 this says that it is not the attitude that 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.090
 a coach must have and ask 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.890
 sorry but they made fun of him 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.280
 made mockery of his family is 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.860
 say that the referee's fault is a 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.659
 again not when you also 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.490
 You may like one of the christian style 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.800
 martinoli that is independent but 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.170
 cristian criticized the work the peo 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.259
 run to hamas and the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:06.060
 matches 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:08.009
 that's false and that's another story and 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.390
 as well as you say for you not 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.420
 I would expect that after a lesson of 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.959
 this size said I'll try to go back 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.610
 being better not being the same myself 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.750
 I collect bad person miguel herrera 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.640
 not much less I had the opportunity 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.170
 to interview his wife and talk 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.850
 several times with it seems to me with a 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.980
 Nice woman but I do think she's a guy 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.690
 that at this moment is blinded by the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.300
 courage for the popularity of doing something 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.090
 of course but if it's a fact that 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.150
 it has to be treated as soon as 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.790
 to the control of anger and rage that 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.770
 drives him to do foolish and mediates a 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.810
 anyone who does 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.480
 a public work is exposed to the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.760
 we criticize and we are and the more 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.650
 public is more critical you will drop the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.240
 that the more they criticize you the more 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.730
 public are you therefore are you doing 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.470
 well your work almost always here is 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.720
 He slipped and he has to recognize that 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.700
 the question and recognize it not the most of 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.250
 this but of everything that has happened in 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.010
 a few years to here to see where is the 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.860
 interview that we have we recover some 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.220
 interviews of linked stories 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.720
 where michelle the daughter of the 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.520
 louse who I do not think I organized 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.820
 bad, much less wrong trying 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.050
 defend your dad wrongly but 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:26.810
 I do not know that she also has that 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.810
 explosive character like the natural dad 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.150
 so they educated her this is not a pretext 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.850
 can have the character that one wants 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.620
 there are moments and places that you grab 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.690
 your character what is said to the verification 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.400
 the amin and yesterday it seems to me that the 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.590
 president the mexican soccer operation 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.630
 of the week he did it perfectly 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.890
 football is not over when the 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.510
 match 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.950
 an institution the size as the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.040
 national coach has to 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.500
 behave at the height always but 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.510
 inside and outside the court or in the 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.000
 airport in the shopping center where 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.810
 is an influence the daughter of the louse 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.810
 few yesterdays ago 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.060
 but I'm the same as I live for quite 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.400
 enter I'm half abrupt you have the 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.220
 character of your dad yes good and of my 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.019
 mom then yes I am was half 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.420
 complicated the matter because my mom 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.209
 It also has very strong character 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.630
 so yes he did in the middle of the bonus me 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.640
 I was controlling but yes 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.020
 and it exploded all of a sudden this is the moment 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.850
 in which the daughter of Miguel Herrera 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.640
 claim luís garcía 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.530
 ass cheek I saw it clearly there 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.750
 for you it must also be 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.330
 complicated I do not say because they listen 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.830
 criticism as well as many you cheers to 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.440
 please your dad can hear you 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.170
 many criticisms yes clear but when I 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.760
 I think that in following the family we 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.700
 prepared from the america for the selection 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.490
 because it is a very controversial team and you 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:56.540
 They love and they hate you and they tell you about everything 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.190
 they love and I think it was like 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.590
 a good team before grabbing the 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.020
 selection 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.240
 for giving to soak with for 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.280
 prepare with the media and everything to 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.430
 us to begin to endure the 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.430
 critics 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:15.070
 they do not have it easy 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:18.640
 we also have the louse interview 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.680
 I told you to call the coach and so 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:26.500
 you will not be able to keep playing everything you do not 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:28.540
 they left without many years because also not 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.790
 only to enter strong and to put 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.800
 with everything I claimed a lot that will be 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.990
 date I keep doing it then they came 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.450
 the functions for more to kick 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.880
 by a claim then they were already scolding 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.080
 was to finish not playing many dates 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.370
 for being suspended 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.379
 and that really cost me a lot of 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.180
 move faster in the race not a 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:53.870
 irascible person 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:58.520
 suddenly fires with torch no no 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:00.050
 I am not a person that I have gone 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.810
 evolving before it seems to me that if I 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.509
 heated and reacted then not after 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:09.520
 how have you gotten that you do not have to 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:09.520
 have done this but today not today 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.810
 the footballers have a psychologist 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:24.260
 then it serves psychologists some but 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.910
 I think I was never more help me 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.610
 blows that gave me those things to go 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:31.250
 being more measured more more more more 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.830
 calm and go moderating that is that 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.260
 character 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:38.920
 good interview the one of mónica heron the 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:42.250
 louse on that occasion but the curious thing about 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:44.710
 the issue knowing that his character had 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:48.190
 modified a lot 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:51.430
 the important pain of his career because 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:53.710
 not again can you still do it 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.170
 because he will come back to train in some 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.720
 frightened moment said that in a year more 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.790
 or less and we can not lose the floor to 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.040
 me the running foot is a good coach and 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.630
 what led to the medical championship 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.310
 for me he did interesting things with the 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.890
 selection may discuss or not be brought 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.740
 the cup as you want it or not 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.750
 way of doing this kind of thing is the 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.820
 part being national coach 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.510
 It has a lot of bonanza, you become famous 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.510
 people love you 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:26.620
 a special and also because you will have a lot 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.570
 wool for the ads not good but 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.310
 has a responsibility part where it does not 

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.740
 you can behave badly where you have to 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:35.170
 be an example where you have to learn 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.720
 to manage success and that part manuel not 

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:39.490
 he knew how to control he lived the bonanza he lived 

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.169
 the money that good for him 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.120
 but the liability part does not 

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:45.580
 he knew how to control of enduring zero rod 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.099
 what you can not do when you have that 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.539
 amount of angel if you do not get ready 

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:52.050
 you can become a devil what is 

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:52.050
 what happened
