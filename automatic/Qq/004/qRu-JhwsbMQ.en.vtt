stuff<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.040> then<00:01:20.430> there's<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> second

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
stuff so then there's the second

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.840 
stuff so then there's the second
screenshot<00:01:21.750> way<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.259> see<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.830> bunch<00:01:23.729> of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
screenshot way you can see a bunch of

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.280 
screenshot way you can see a bunch of
skins<00:01:24.090> which<00:01:24.210> are<00:01:24.330> hard<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:24.780> except<00:01:25.200> on

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
skins which are hard to see except on

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.719 
skins which are hard to see except on
the<00:01:25.380> left<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.830> looks<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.159> some<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.460> beaver
