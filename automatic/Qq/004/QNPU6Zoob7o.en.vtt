00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
and Goku and it starts off pretty even

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.030 
and Goku and it starts off pretty even
and<00:03:43.590> then<00:03:43.769> reason<00:03:44.760> starts<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.030> get<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.269> edge

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.040 
and then reason starts to get the edge
but<00:03:47.040> Goku<00:03:47.430> Goku<00:03:47.850> is<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.060> smart<00:03:48.390> fighter<00:03:48.600> so<00:03:48.840> even

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
but Goku Goku is a smart fighter so even

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.870 
but Goku Goku is a smart fighter so even
if<00:03:49.140> he's<00:03:49.290> even<00:03:49.500> when<00:03:49.890> he<00:03:50.010> wasn't<00:03:50.190> super<00:03:50.550> saiyan

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
if he's even when he wasn't super saiyan

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.180 
if he's even when he wasn't super saiyan
he<00:03:51.480> always<00:03:51.660> found<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.930> way<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.140> kind<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:53.100> I

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
he always found a way to kind of and I

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.130 
he always found a way to kind of and I
think<00:03:53.400> that's<00:03:53.550> why<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:54.120> lot<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.720> times<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:55.080> think

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
think that's why a lot of times I think

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.960 
think that's why a lot of times I think
that's<00:03:55.440> why<00:03:55.620> he's<00:03:55.830> better<00:03:56.130> than<00:03:56.580> Vegeta

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
that's why he's better than Vegeta

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.120 
that's why he's better than Vegeta
obviously<00:03:57.959> he's<00:03:58.200> more<00:03:58.380> powerful<00:03:58.590> than<00:03:58.950> him

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
obviously he's more powerful than him

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.850 
obviously he's more powerful than him
but<00:03:59.820> I<00:03:59.880> also<00:04:00.180> de<00:04:00.780> visita<00:04:01.050> this<00:04:01.350> fights<00:04:01.560> dumb

use it uh they can't use it directly on
Crillon<00:06:08.400> and<00:06:08.639> um<00:06:10.190> goku<00:06:11.190> so<00:06:11.550> what<00:06:11.820> vegeta<00:06:12.210> does

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
Crillon and um goku so what vegeta does

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.260 
Crillon and um goku so what vegeta does
this<00:06:12.630> tells<00:06:12.900> them<00:06:13.110> to<00:06:13.520> use<00:06:14.520> it<00:06:14.729> to<00:06:14.880> wish<00:06:15.030> them

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
this tells them to use it to wish them

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.769 
this tells them to use it to wish them
back<00:06:15.479> to<00:06:15.870> the<00:06:16.830> station<00:06:17.099> their<00:06:18.090> spirits<00:06:18.599> and

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:18.779 
back to the station their spirits and

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.019 
back to the station their spirits and
then<00:06:18.900> I<00:06:18.930> believe<00:06:19.380> they<00:06:19.560> use<00:06:19.800> the<00:06:20.219> pomona

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:21.029 
then I believe they use the pomona

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:23.360 
then I believe they use the pomona
dragon<00:06:21.450> because<00:06:22.440> he<00:06:22.620> can<00:06:22.800> keep<00:06:22.979> doing<00:06:23.010> it

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
dragon because he can keep doing it

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.050 
dragon because he can keep doing it
multiple<00:06:23.760> times

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
multiple times

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.700 
multiple times
and<00:06:24.150> but<00:06:24.780> this<00:06:24.900> is<00:06:25.080> where<00:06:25.230> they<00:06:25.320> find<00:06:25.560> out<00:06:25.650> that

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
and but this is where they find out that

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.129 
and but this is where they find out that
go<00:06:25.980> who's<00:06:26.220> not<00:06:26.370> actually<00:06:26.730> dead<00:06:26.940> so<00:06:27.690> then<00:06:28.020> they

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
go who's not actually dead so then they

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.780 
go who's not actually dead so then they
try<00:06:28.290> to<00:06:28.350> which<00:06:28.530> Goku<00:06:28.889> back<00:06:29.100> to<00:06:29.250> earth<00:06:29.400> and<00:06:29.639> he

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
try to which Goku back to earth and he

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.760 
try to which Goku back to earth and he
refuses<00:06:30.210> to<00:06:30.419> come<00:06:30.600> back<00:06:30.810> and<00:06:31.139> then<00:06:31.530> that's

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
refuses to come back and then that's

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.500 
refuses to come back and then that's
pretty<00:06:32.010> much<00:06:32.130> how<00:06:32.520> they<00:06:32.700> left<00:06:32.910> season<00:06:33.270> three

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
pretty much how they left season three

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.360 
pretty much how they left season three
and<00:06:33.540> then<00:06:33.930> you<00:06:34.139> don't<00:06:34.320> find<00:06:34.500> out<00:06:34.680> later<00:06:35.040> into<00:06:35.340> a

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
and then you don't find out later into a

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.629 
and then you don't find out later into a
season<00:06:35.760> for<00:06:36.500> how<00:06:37.500> he<00:06:37.560> got<00:06:37.860> back<00:06:37.919> and<00:06:38.460> what

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 
season for how he got back and what

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:40.970 
season for how he got back and what
happened<00:06:39.060> in<00:06:39.210> the<00:06:39.300> whole<00:06:39.450> nine<00:06:39.660> yards<00:06:40.080> so<00:06:40.350> but

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
happened in the whole nine yards so but

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.860 
happened in the whole nine yards so but
you<00:06:41.070> know<00:06:41.100> overall<00:06:41.460> look<00:06:41.880> like<00:06:42.450> i<00:06:42.540> said<00:06:42.750> the

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
you know overall look like i said the

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.800 
you know overall look like i said the
highlights<00:06:43.230> of<00:06:43.380> it<00:06:43.970> super<00:06:44.970> saiyan<00:06:45.210> that<00:06:45.690> was

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810 
highlights of it super saiyan that was

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.310 
highlights of it super saiyan that was
great<00:06:46.520> vegeta's<00:06:47.520> moment<00:06:47.940> where<00:06:48.630> he<00:06:48.660> confesses
