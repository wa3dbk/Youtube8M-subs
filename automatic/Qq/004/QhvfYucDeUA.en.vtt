00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.690 

today<00:00:08.530> I'm<00:00:08.650> going<00:00:08.799> to<00:00:08.860> show<00:00:09.070> you<00:00:09.099> how<00:00:09.370> I<00:00:09.400> make<00:00:09.670> a

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
today I'm going to show you how I make a

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.299 
today I'm going to show you how I make a
paper<00:00:10.000> model<00:00:10.450> of<00:00:10.629> a<00:00:10.719> sculpture<00:00:11.170> the<00:00:12.070> first

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
paper model of a sculpture the first

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.070 
paper model of a sculpture the first
problem<00:00:12.730> of<00:00:12.820> course<00:00:13.090> is<00:00:13.299> coming<00:00:13.779> up<00:00:13.869> with<00:00:13.990> the

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
problem of course is coming up with the

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.230 
problem of course is coming up with the
idea<00:00:14.350> what<00:00:14.619> to<00:00:14.740> make<00:00:14.889> that's<00:00:15.730> hard<00:00:15.939> to<00:00:16.029> explain

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
idea what to make that's hard to explain

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.390 
idea what to make that's hard to explain
so<00:00:16.660> I'm<00:00:16.750> skipping<00:00:17.020> over<00:00:17.170> that<00:00:17.320> we'll<00:00:18.160> just

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
so I'm skipping over that we'll just

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.609 
so I'm skipping over that we'll just
start<00:00:18.670> with<00:00:18.730> this<00:00:18.939> design<00:00:19.300> you<00:00:20.140> can<00:00:20.350> see<00:00:20.470> there

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
start with this design you can see there

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.230 
start with this design you can see there
are<00:00:20.740> lots<00:00:20.949> of<00:00:21.100> loops<00:00:21.340> on<00:00:21.490> the<00:00:21.579> outside<00:00:21.939> and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
are lots of loops on the outside and

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.509 
are lots of loops on the outside and
maybe<00:00:22.749> you<00:00:22.839> can<00:00:23.019> also<00:00:23.199> see<00:00:23.560> small<00:00:23.619> circular

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:24.519 
maybe you can also see small circular

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.370 
maybe you can also see small circular
openings<00:00:24.909> on<00:00:25.060> the<00:00:25.089> inside<00:00:25.509> but<00:00:26.199> what's

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
openings on the inside but what's

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.229 
openings on the inside but what's
especially<00:00:26.619> interesting<00:00:26.980> to<00:00:27.490> me<00:00:27.609> is<00:00:27.820> that

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:28.239 
especially interesting to me is that

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.450 
especially interesting to me is that
everything<00:00:28.539> is<00:00:28.779> made<00:00:28.960> up<00:00:29.140> from<00:00:29.320> 60<00:00:29.829> identical

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
everything is made up from 60 identical

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.060 
everything is made up from 60 identical
flat<00:00:30.880> components<00:00:31.599> so<00:00:32.230> I<00:00:32.259> can<00:00:32.470> someday<00:00:32.860> make

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
flat components so I can someday make

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.340 
flat components so I can someday make
this<00:00:33.190> from<00:00:33.430> steel<00:00:33.760> or<00:00:34.060> plywood<00:00:34.540> but<00:00:35.140> today

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
this from steel or plywood but today

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.400 
this from steel or plywood but today
we'll<00:00:35.530> just<00:00:35.710> use<00:00:35.860> paper<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.870> is<00:00:38.050> the<00:00:38.170> part

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
we'll just use paper this is the part

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.470 
we'll just use paper this is the part
shape<00:00:38.620> everything<00:00:39.610> joins<00:00:39.940> together<00:00:40.300> with

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
shape everything joins together with

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.050 
shape everything joins together with
these<00:00:40.600> seven<00:00:40.990> slots<00:00:41.290> so<00:00:42.190> in<00:00:42.340> theory<00:00:42.580> it<00:00:42.850> just

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
these seven slots so in theory it just

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.400 
these seven slots so in theory it just
slides<00:00:43.360> together<00:00:43.570> like<00:00:43.930> a<00:00:43.960> giant

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
slides together like a giant

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.100 
slides together like a giant
construction<00:00:44.710> kit<00:00:45.270> I'm<00:00:46.270> gonna<00:00:46.540> lay<00:00:46.750> out<00:00:46.780> eight

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
construction kit I'm gonna lay out eight

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.110 
construction kit I'm gonna lay out eight
parts<00:00:47.620> on<00:00:47.800> each<00:00:48.190> sheet<00:00:48.490> of<00:00:48.610> paper

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
parts on each sheet of paper

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.990 
parts on each sheet of paper
this<00:00:49.660> makes<00:00:49.870> them<00:00:50.020> about<00:00:50.230> six<00:00:50.560> inches<00:00:50.890> long

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
this makes them about six inches long

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.130 
this makes them about six inches long
I'll<00:00:52.000> need<00:00:52.180> to<00:00:52.330> cut<00:00:52.510> out<00:00:52.630> eight<00:00:52.840> of<00:00:53.020> these

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
I'll need to cut out eight of these

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.170 
I'll need to cut out eight of these
sheets<00:00:53.380> to<00:00:53.890> have<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.160> sixty<00:00:54.550> pieces<00:00:54.700> I<00:00:54.970> need

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
sheets to have the sixty pieces I need

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.160 
sheets to have the sixty pieces I need
and<00:00:55.390> a<00:00:55.810> few<00:00:56.020> spares<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:58.390> loops<00:00:58.600> in<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:58.870> design

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
and a few spares the loops in the design

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.290 
and a few spares the loops in the design
looks<00:00:59.470> something<00:00:59.650> like<00:00:59.800> waves<00:01:00.160> so<00:01:00.970> they<00:01:01.090> look

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
looks something like waves so they look

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.900 
looks something like waves so they look
good<00:01:01.450> in<00:01:01.510> this<00:01:01.750> acid-free<00:01:02.440> blue<00:01:02.890> cardstock<00:01:03.579> I

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
good in this acid-free blue cardstock I

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.330 
good in this acid-free blue cardstock I
could<00:01:04.780> print<00:01:05.019> onto<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.409> paper<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:05.860> cut<00:01:06.250> the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
could print onto the paper and cut the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.249 
could print onto the paper and cut the
parts<00:01:06.579> by<00:01:06.700> hand<00:01:06.729> but<00:01:07.689> that<00:01:07.750> would<00:01:07.960> be<00:01:07.990> a<00:01:08.079> lot<00:01:08.229> of

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
parts by hand but that would be a lot of

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.860 
parts by hand but that would be a lot of
scissor<00:01:08.560> work<00:01:08.770> for<00:01:09.040> me<00:01:09.159> so<00:01:09.760> instead<00:01:10.150> I'm<00:01:10.540> using

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
scissor work for me so instead I'm using

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.530 
scissor work for me so instead I'm using
a<00:01:11.080> robotic<00:01:11.500> paper<00:01:12.040> cutter<00:01:12.250> it's<00:01:13.120> a<00:01:13.270> handy

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
a robotic paper cutter it's a handy

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.180 
a robotic paper cutter it's a handy
device<00:01:13.659> which<00:01:14.110> takes<00:01:14.409> my<00:01:14.590> drawing<00:01:14.890> and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
device which takes my drawing and

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.220 
device which takes my drawing and
controls<00:01:15.760> a<00:01:15.909> small<00:01:16.270> knife<00:01:16.510> that<00:01:16.810> cuts<00:01:17.020> along

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
controls a small knife that cuts along

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.440 
controls a small knife that cuts along
the<00:01:17.409> locus<00:01:17.830> my<00:01:18.580> little<00:01:18.820> cutter<00:01:19.030> can't<00:01:19.330> go

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
the locus my little cutter can't go

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.330 
the locus my little cutter can't go
through<00:01:19.630> heavy<00:01:19.870> cardboard<00:01:20.170> but<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.100> paper

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
through heavy cardboard but the paper

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.160 
through heavy cardboard but the paper
that<00:01:21.520> isn't<00:01:21.820> too<00:01:21.940> thick<00:01:22.150> it's<00:01:22.720> a<00:01:22.900> great

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
that isn't too thick it's a great

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.280 
that isn't too thick it's a great
time-saver<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:25.300> paper<00:01:25.570> is<00:01:25.780> carried<00:01:26.140> on<00:01:26.229> the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
time-saver the paper is carried on the

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.950 
time-saver the paper is carried on the
sticky<00:01:26.740> backing<00:01:26.979> sheet<00:01:27.370> after<00:01:27.760> cutting<00:01:28.540> you

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
sticky backing sheet after cutting you

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.080 
sticky backing sheet after cutting you
pull<00:01:29.200> off<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.350> parts<00:01:29.760> usually<00:01:30.760> I<00:01:30.790> have<00:01:30.909> to

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
pull off the parts usually I have to

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.580 
pull off the parts usually I have to
separate<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.510> few<00:01:31.810> spots<00:01:32.080> where<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.409> knife

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
separate a few spots where the knife

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.039 
separate a few spots where the knife
skipped<00:01:33.150> then<00:01:34.150> I'll<00:01:34.270> make<00:01:34.479> sure<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.810> notches

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
skipped then I'll make sure the notches

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.230 
skipped then I'll make sure the notches
are<00:01:35.320> cut<00:01:35.470> all<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.860> way<00:01:35.979> through<00:01:36.240> sometimes

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
are cut all the way through sometimes

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.090 
are cut all the way through sometimes
they<00:01:37.570> aren't<00:01:37.720> quite<00:01:37.900> perfect<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.560> I<00:01:38.830> can<00:01:38.979> open

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
they aren't quite perfect and I can open

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.520 
they aren't quite perfect and I can open
them<00:01:39.310> with<00:01:39.400> a<00:01:39.460> small<00:01:39.790> knife<00:01:40.000> it's<00:01:40.810> much<00:01:41.140> easier

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
them with a small knife it's much easier

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.960 
them with a small knife it's much easier
to<00:01:41.560> do<00:01:41.799> this<00:01:41.920> when<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.190> pieces<00:01:42.370> are<00:01:42.640> separate

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
to do this when the pieces are separate

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.350 
to do this when the pieces are separate
then<00:01:43.479> when<00:01:43.600> is<00:01:43.720> half<00:01:43.960> assembled<00:01:44.440> later<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:46.210> now

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
then when is half assembled later so now

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.969 
then when is half assembled later so now
I<00:01:46.390> have<00:01:46.630> 64<00:01:47.170> pieces<00:01:47.560> ready

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
I have 64 pieces ready

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.090 
I have 64 pieces ready
each<00:01:48.310> has<00:01:48.610> seven<00:01:48.970> slots<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:50.470> little<00:01:50.710> inside

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
very close together which also make a

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.650 
very close together which also make a
three-way<00:02:12.739> connection<00:02:13.220> this<00:02:13.819> joint<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.300> small

three-way connection this joint is small

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.570 
three-way connection this joint is small
and<00:02:14.870> tight<00:02:15.110> so<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.709> takes<00:02:15.890> some<00:02:16.069> vending<00:02:16.430> to

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
and tight so it takes some vending to

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.309 
and tight so it takes some vending to
put<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:16.819> together<00:02:16.940> but<00:02:17.599> then<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:17.870> holds<00:02:18.260> really

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
put it together but then it holds really

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.150 
put it together but then it holds really
well<00:02:18.650> in<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:20.390> end<00:02:20.540> all<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.470> pieces<00:02:21.830> connect

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
pentagonal opening it gets trickier now

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.979

up<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.349> you<00:02:54.680> have<00:02:54.799> to<00:02:54.920> weave<00:02:55.130> things<00:02:55.370> around

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
up and you have to weave things around

up and you have to weave things around
each<00:02:55.880> other<00:02:56.060> but<00:02:56.660> if<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.840> can<00:02:57.019> visualize<00:02:57.290> the

each other but if you can visualize the
form<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.280> can<00:02:58.400> get<00:02:58.549> everything<00:02:58.910> into<00:02:59.090> place

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209

this<00:03:00.140> continues<00:03:00.590> on<00:03:00.769> for<00:03:00.980> some<00:03:01.130> time

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
this continues on for some time

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.420 
this continues on for some time
you<00:03:01.880> just<00:03:02.120> have<00:03:02.239> to<00:03:02.269> be<00:03:02.450> systematic<00:03:03.430> initially

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
you just have to be systematic initially

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.339 
you just have to be systematic initially
it<00:03:04.519> was<00:03:04.610> pretty<00:03:04.790> flexible<00:03:05.030> but<00:03:05.870> as<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.110> go<00:03:06.260> along

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
it was pretty flexible but as I go along

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.180 
it was pretty flexible but as I go along
it<00:03:06.829> gets<00:03:06.980> more<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.250> more<00:03:07.370> solid<00:03:09.010> after<00:03:10.010> giving

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
it gets more and more solid after giving

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.979 
it gets more and more solid after giving
that<00:03:10.370> a<00:03:10.400> minute<00:03:10.730> for<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.000> glue<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.150> dry<00:03:11.299> I'll

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
that a minute for the glue to dry I'll

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.110 
that a minute for the glue to dry I'll
continue<00:03:12.319> with<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.650> same<00:03:12.829> idea<00:03:13.250> still<00:03:13.790> using

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
continue with the same idea still using

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.520 
continue with the same idea still using
little<00:03:14.329> dots<00:03:14.510> of<00:03:14.660> glue<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.959> keep<00:03:15.109> the<00:03:15.260> slots

little dots of glue to keep the slots

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.330 
little dots of glue to keep the slots
together<00:03:17.109> here's<00:03:18.109> the<00:03:18.290> first<00:03:18.530> complete<00:03:18.980> three

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
together here's the first complete three

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.220 
together here's the first complete three
full<00:03:19.519> joint<00:03:19.850> I<00:03:20.120> don't<00:03:20.600> need<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.870> glue<00:03:20.959> these

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
full joint I don't need to glue these

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.789 
full joint I don't need to glue these
they<00:03:21.859> lock<00:03:22.069> together<00:03:22.220> securely<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:24.470> now<00:03:24.620> it's

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
they lock together securely so now it's

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.590 
they lock together securely so now it's
half<00:03:25.010> done<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.489> I<00:03:25.700> can<00:03:25.850> tell<00:03:26.060> I'm<00:03:26.150> gonna<00:03:26.329> love

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
half done and I can tell I'm gonna love

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.550 
half done and I can tell I'm gonna love
it<00:03:26.720> it's<00:03:26.930> exactly<00:03:27.139> what<00:03:27.709> I<00:03:27.739> envisioned<00:03:27.980> I<00:03:29.560> need

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
it it's exactly what I envisioned I need

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.750 
it it's exactly what I envisioned I need
to<00:03:30.680> bend<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:30.950> pieces<00:03:31.310> I'm<00:03:31.459> inserting

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
to bend the pieces I'm inserting

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.940 
to bend the pieces I'm inserting
together<00:03:32.269> them<00:03:32.389> around<00:03:32.569> each<00:03:32.720> other<00:03:32.959> but<00:03:33.739> once

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
together them around each other but once

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.199 
together them around each other but once
they're<00:03:34.160> correctly<00:03:34.579> in<00:03:34.670> place<00:03:34.700> they're

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
they're correctly in place they're

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.440 
they're correctly in place they're
always<00:03:35.389> planar<00:03:36.549> so<00:03:37.549> now<00:03:37.730> with<00:03:37.940> five<00:03:38.150> modules

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
always planar so now with five modules

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.840 
always planar so now with five modules
to<00:03:38.840> go<00:03:38.989> it's<00:03:39.290> really<00:03:39.530> solid<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:40.370> weaving<00:03:40.730> is

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
to go it's really solid the weaving is

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.990 
to go it's really solid the weaving is
trickier<00:03:41.209> but<00:03:41.750> everything<00:03:42.170> fits<00:03:42.440> perfectly

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
trickier but everything fits perfectly

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.150 
trickier but everything fits perfectly
for<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.090> last<00:03:44.329> module<00:03:44.600> I'm<00:03:45.019> sliding<00:03:45.650> in<00:03:45.889> three

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
for the last module I'm sliding in three

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.009 
for the last module I'm sliding in three
pieces<00:03:46.549> individually<00:03:46.700> than<00:03:47.510> joining<00:03:47.780> them

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
pieces individually than joining them

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.770 
pieces individually than joining them
together<00:03:48.139> on<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.530> inside<00:03:49.150> now<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.180> can<00:03:50.480> see<00:03:50.660> it

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
together on the inside now I can see it

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.360 
together on the inside now I can see it
from<00:03:50.930> different<00:03:51.109> points<00:03:51.380> of<00:03:51.530> view<00:03:51.709> and<00:03:51.950> see

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
from different points of view and see

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.640 
from different points of view and see
all<00:03:52.579> the<00:03:52.730> symmetry<00:03:53.180> I<00:03:53.380> think<00:03:54.380> it's<00:03:54.500> pretty

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
all the symmetry I think it's pretty

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.830 
all the symmetry I think it's pretty
cool<00:03:54.889> I<00:03:55.220> really<00:03:55.670> like<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.299> swirling<00:03:56.720> effect

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
cool I really like the swirling effect

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.559 
cool I really like the swirling effect
of<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.410> five<00:03:57.620> way<00:03:57.799> openings<00:03:58.250> you<00:03:58.549> have<00:03:59.420> to

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
of the five way openings you have to

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.970 
of the five way openings you have to
study<00:03:59.810> it<00:03:59.989> for<00:04:00.139> some<00:04:00.290> time<00:04:00.319> to<00:04:00.769> fully

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
study it for some time to fully

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.890 
study it for some time to fully
appreciate<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:01.549> structure<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.569> see<00:04:02.720> how<00:04:02.840> the

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
appreciate the structure to see how the

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.559 
appreciate the structure to see how the
20<00:04:03.319> holes<00:04:03.530> on<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:03.829> inside<00:04:04.220> each<00:04:04.700> lie<00:04:05.090> under<00:04:05.450> an

20 holes on the inside each lie under an

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.960 
20 holes on the inside each lie under an
outer<00:04:05.780> three-way<00:04:06.260> joint<00:04:06.620> and<00:04:06.859> to<00:04:07.700> see<00:04:07.849> how

outer three-way joint and to see how

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.479 
outer three-way joint and to see how
flat<00:04:08.269> pieces<00:04:08.660> connect<00:04:09.019> one<00:04:09.230> 3-way<00:04:09.680> joint<00:04:09.950> to

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
flat pieces connect one 3-way joint to

another one two hops away of course this
paper<00:04:14.090> model<00:04:14.480> is<00:04:14.599> just<00:04:14.810> practice<00:04:15.260> stay<00:04:16.160> tuned

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
paper model is just practice stay tuned

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.640 
paper model is just practice stay tuned
for<00:04:16.760> a<00:04:16.820> future<00:04:17.209> video<00:04:17.359> when<00:04:18.109> I<00:04:18.140> try<00:04:18.409> to<00:04:18.440> make

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
for a future video when I try to make

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.710 
for a future video when I try to make
the<00:04:18.769> same<00:04:19.039> design<00:04:19.459> from<00:04:19.909> three<00:04:20.299> foot<00:04:20.570> long

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
the same design from three foot long

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.009 
the same design from three foot long
cardboard<00:04:21.320> pieces

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
cardboard pieces

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.020 
cardboard pieces
so<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.620> whole<00:04:22.770> thing<00:04:23.069> should<00:04:23.340> be<00:04:23.430> about<00:04:23.610> six

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
so the whole thing should be about six

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:36.140 
so the whole thing should be about six
feet<00:04:24.240> in<00:04:24.479> diameter<00:04:24.830> I'm<00:04:25.830> ready

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.210
