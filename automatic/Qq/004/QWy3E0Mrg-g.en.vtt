questions that we got from someone that

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.549 
questions that we got from someone that
was<00:00:11.910> on<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.120> website<00:00:12.300> so<00:00:12.870> this<00:00:13.140> is<00:00:13.320> my<00:00:13.410> wife

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:16.439 
Marty kept standing and the quick answer

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.230 
Marty kept standing and the quick answer
is<00:00:16.800> who<00:00:16.950> when<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.160> shoot<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.610> hard<00:00:17.849> is<00:00:18.029> it

is who when you shoot it hard is it

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.390 
is who when you shoot it hard is it
depends<00:00:18.689> because<00:00:19.259> in<00:00:19.710> tennis<00:00:20.009> there's<00:00:20.190> times

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
depends because in tennis there's times

depends because in tennis there's times
we<00:00:20.580> want<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.940> add<00:00:21.090> power<00:00:21.360> there's<00:00:21.750> science<00:00:22.050> we

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
we want to add power there's science we

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.750

want<00:00:23.940> to<00:00:23.970> decrease<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.570> power<00:00:24.690> so<00:00:25.350> today<00:00:25.710> to

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
want to decrease the power so today to

want to decrease the power so today to
show<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.369> I'm<00:00:26.550> going<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.760> show<00:00:26.850> you<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.420> game

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
show this I'm going to show you a game

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.990 
show this I'm going to show you a game
that<00:00:28.140> we<00:00:28.230> call<00:00:28.410> color<00:00:28.710> coding<00:00:29.220> now<00:00:29.760> color

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
that we call color coding now color

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.869 
that we call color coding now color
coding<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.600> by<00:00:30.960> far<00:00:31.260> my<00:00:31.470> favorite<00:00:31.920> game<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.760> do

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
coding is by far my favorite game to do

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.430 
coding is by far my favorite game to do
with<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> person<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.720> private<00:00:34.110> lesson

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
with a person in a private lesson

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.810 
with a person in a private lesson
setting<00:00:34.890> because<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.489> really<00:00:35.610> all<00:00:35.790> about

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
setting because it's really all about

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.399 
setting because it's really all about
decisions<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.659> lot<00:00:36.839> of<00:00:36.960> players<00:00:37.110> will<00:00:37.260> make

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:37.409 
decisions a lot of players will make

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:39.590 
decisions a lot of players will make
errors<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.430> they<00:00:38.820> think<00:00:39.030> they're<00:00:39.150> technical

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
errors and they think they're technical

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.240 
errors and they think they're technical
errors<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.019> I<00:00:40.050> find<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.379> lot<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.530> time<00:00:40.800> it's

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
errors and I find a lot of time it's

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.710 
errors and I find a lot of time it's
just<00:00:41.550> decision<00:00:42.000> errors<00:00:42.269> they're<00:00:42.390> trying<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
just decision errors they're trying the

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.930 
just decision errors they're trying the
wrong<00:00:42.839> thing<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.140> color<00:00:43.979> coding<00:00:44.400> goes<00:00:44.549> simple

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
wrong thing so color coding goes simple

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.049 
wrong thing so color coding goes simple
like<00:00:45.089> this<00:00:45.239> Marty<00:00:45.690> any<00:00:46.500> time<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.519> ball<00:00:47.729> comes

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
like this Marty any time the ball comes

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.670 
like this Marty any time the ball comes
and<00:00:48.360> it's<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.600> little<00:00:48.750> bit<00:00:48.960> soft<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.559> you're

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
and it's a little bit soft so you're

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.320 
and it's a little bit soft so you're
going<00:00:49.799> to<00:00:49.860> maybe<00:00:50.010> be<00:00:50.100> more<00:00:50.549> offensive<00:00:51.000> than

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
going to maybe be more offensive than

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.719 
going to maybe be more offensive than
average<00:00:51.690> you're<00:00:52.140> going<00:00:52.290> to<00:00:52.350> call<00:00:52.530> green<00:00:52.949> ok

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
average you're going to call green ok

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:55.820 
average you're going to call green ok
any<00:00:54.600> time<00:00:54.900> the<00:00:55.019> ball<00:00:55.170> comes<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.739> you're

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
any time the ball comes and you're

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.160 
any time the ball comes and you're
probably<00:00:56.280> back<00:00:56.400> here<00:00:56.729> it's<00:00:57.150> just<00:00:57.299> a<00:00:57.390> routine

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
probably back here it's just a routine

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.890 
probably back here it's just a routine
ball<00:00:59.100> you're<00:00:59.280> going<00:00:59.369> to<00:00:59.460> call<00:00:59.610> yellow<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.269> any

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
ball you're going to call yellow and any

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.689 
ball you're going to call yellow and any
time<00:01:01.140> you're<00:01:01.260> wounded<00:01:01.739> either<00:01:02.309> you're<00:01:02.519> on<00:01:02.549> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
time you're wounded either you're on the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.520 
time you're wounded either you're on the
dead<00:01:02.879> run<00:01:02.909> or<00:01:03.330> they<00:01:03.479> well<00:01:03.809> really<00:01:04.110> hard<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
dead run or they well really hard and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.920 
dead run or they well really hard and
you<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.769> shorten<00:01:05.250> your<00:01:05.369> backswing

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
you have to shorten your backswing

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.410 
you have to shorten your backswing
that's<00:01:06.930> going<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.200> be<00:01:07.290> called<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> red<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.420> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
that's going to be called the red so the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.999 
that's going to be called the red so the
better<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.810> are<00:01:09.840> at<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.289> the<00:01:10.500> sooner<00:01:10.740> you'll

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
better you are at this the sooner you'll

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.469 
better you are at this the sooner you'll
be<00:01:11.070> able<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.430> call<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.090> some<00:01:12.329> of<00:01:12.359> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
be able to call it so some of the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.670 
be able to call it so some of the
players<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.930> done<00:01:13.079> this<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.409> while<00:01:13.500> they

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
players have done this for a while they

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.230 
players have done this for a while they
can<00:01:13.829> call<00:01:14.039> it<00:01:14.219> literally<00:01:14.729> as<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.090> guys

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
can call it literally as the guys

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.120 
can call it literally as the guys
hitting<00:01:15.539> because<00:01:16.200> they're<00:01:16.649> already<00:01:16.799> reading

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
hitting because they're already reading

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.340 
hitting because they're already reading
there<00:01:17.399> they're<00:01:17.939> big<00:01:18.390> giant<00:01:18.659> swinging<00:01:19.170> or

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
there they're big giant swinging or

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.050 
there they're big giant swinging or
whatever<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.859> I<00:01:20.100> want<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.609> to<00:01:20.640> cut<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.969> out

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
whatever so I want you to cut it out

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.730 
whatever so I want you to cut it out
loud<00:01:21.329> remember<00:01:21.929> you're<00:01:22.079> not<00:01:22.200> calling<00:01:22.500> what

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
loud remember you're not calling what

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.319 
loud remember you're not calling what
you're<00:01:22.890> receiving<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.609> if<00:01:23.700> Carly<00:01:24.030> hits<00:01:24.179> a

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
you're receiving so if Carly hits a

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.319 
you're receiving so if Carly hits a
green<00:01:25.130> like<00:01:26.130> really<00:01:26.429> Wales<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> you're

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
green like really Wales on it you're

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.240 
green like really Wales on it you're
going<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.509> call<00:01:27.689> red<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.649> scale<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:28.979> 1

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
going to call red on a scale of 1

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.099 
going to call red on a scale of 1
through<00:01:29.460> 10<00:01:29.700> as<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.270> easier<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.689> for<00:01:31.049> you

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
through 10 as if it's easier to for you

percentages<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:19.989> think<00:02:20.590> that's<00:02:20.769> actually<00:02:20.950> the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
percentages I think that's actually the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.800 
percentages I think that's actually the
right<00:02:21.280> call<00:02:21.519> for<00:02:21.849> Marty<00:02:22.150> because<00:02:22.330> she<00:02:22.630> has<00:02:22.780> a

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
right call for Marty because she has a

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.750 
right call for Marty because she has a
killer<00:02:23.080> backhand<00:02:23.349> so<00:02:24.010> she<00:02:24.069> can<00:02:24.310> actually<00:02:24.640> hit

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
killer backhand so she can actually hit

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.600 
killer backhand so she can actually hit

maybe<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:28.030> normal<00:02:28.450> player<00:02:28.600> would<00:02:28.810> have<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:29.080> be

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
maybe a normal player would have to be

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.509 
maybe a normal player would have to be
inside<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.680> blue<00:02:29.890> for<00:02:30.100> them<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.310> really

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
inside the blue for them to really

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.309 
inside the blue for them to really
officially<00:02:31.000> cause<00:02:31.180> green<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:31.660> even<00:02:32.200> though

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
officially cause green so even though
