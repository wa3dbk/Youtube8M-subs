with the tower garden indoors one you

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
day you know you have to make sure that

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.620 
day you know you have to make sure that
you<00:03:27.300> have<00:03:27.770> you<00:03:28.770> know<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.010> right<00:03:29.190> pH<00:03:29.910> level<00:03:30.420> I

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
you have you know the right pH level I

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.070 
you have you know the right pH level I
did<00:03:31.110> buy<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.320> little<00:03:31.650> tester<00:03:32.190> like<00:03:32.790> this

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
did buy a little tester like this

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.620 
did buy a little tester like this
I<00:03:34.110> mean<00:03:34.650> Amazon<00:03:35.010> for<00:03:35.280> about<00:03:35.370> 12<00:03:35.730> bucks<00:03:35.970> I'll

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
I mean Amazon for about 12 bucks I'll

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.120 
I mean Amazon for about 12 bucks I'll
probably<00:03:36.870> put<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.230> link<00:03:37.470> up<00:03:37.620> for<00:03:37.650> that<00:03:37.890> so<00:03:38.100> you

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
probably put the link up for that so you

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.820 
probably put the link up for that so you
can<00:03:38.370> find<00:03:38.610> it<00:03:38.790> it's<00:03:39.780> really<00:03:40.110> worth<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.530> makes

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
can find it it's really worth it makes

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.660 
can find it it's really worth it makes
it<00:03:40.980> really<00:03:41.160> easy<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:43.190> one<00:03:44.190> other<00:03:44.340> thing<00:03:44.640> is

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
it really easy and one other thing is

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.020 
it really easy and one other thing is
it's<00:03:45.060> not<00:03:45.239> very<00:03:45.300> hot<00:03:46.050> in<00:03:46.320> here<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.940> know

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
it's not very hot in here you know

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.699 
it's not very hot in here you know
because<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.420> temperature<00:03:49.020> is<00:03:49.050> missions<00:03:49.470> time

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
because the temperature is missions time

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.370 
because the temperature is missions time
in<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.950> year<00:03:50.100> in<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.310> wintertime<00:03:50.900> were<00:03:51.900> like<00:03:52.170> at

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
in a year in the wintertime were like at

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.680 
in a year in the wintertime were like at
65<00:03:53.040> degrees<00:03:54.020> and<00:03:55.100> you<00:03:56.100> know<00:03:56.220> 68<00:03:56.760> degrees<00:03:57.120> so<00:03:57.390> I

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
65 degrees and you know 68 degrees so I

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.320 
65 degrees and you know 68 degrees so I
would<00:03:58.170> say<00:03:58.380> that<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.680> probably<00:03:59.160> does<00:03:59.760> affect

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
would say that that probably does affect

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.060 
would say that that probably does affect
the<00:04:01.430> growing<00:04:02.430> of<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.790> tower<00:04:03.030> garden<00:04:03.800> where<00:04:04.800> if

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
the growing of the tower garden where if

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.250 
the growing of the tower garden where if
you<00:04:05.250> were<00:04:05.430> indoors<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.390> it<00:04:06.540> was<00:04:06.630> a<00:04:06.660> lot<00:04:06.900> hotter

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
you were indoors and it was a lot hotter

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.100 
you were indoors and it was a lot hotter
it<00:04:07.739> would<00:04:08.220> probably<00:04:08.700> go<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:08.820> lot<00:04:09.090> faster<00:04:09.420> but<00:04:09.900> so

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
it would probably go a lot faster but so

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.390 
it would probably go a lot faster but so
far<00:04:10.489> pretty<00:04:11.489> happy<00:04:11.970> thing

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
far pretty happy thing

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.729 
far pretty happy thing
some<00:04:12.579> things<00:04:12.819> are<00:04:12.970> going<00:04:13.120> slower<00:04:13.530> some<00:04:14.530> things

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
some things are going slower some things

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.009 
some things are going slower some things
are<00:04:14.890> doing<00:04:15.040> great<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.970> know<00:04:16.120> you<00:04:16.209> do<00:04:16.479> if<00:04:16.810> you

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
are doing great you know you do if you

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.930 
are doing great you know you do if you
are<00:04:17.169> like<00:04:17.380> this<00:04:17.560> lettuce<00:04:17.859> it's<00:04:18.519> starting<00:04:18.850> to

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
are like this lettuce it's starting to

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.370 
are like this lettuce it's starting to
do<00:04:19.030> well<00:04:19.060> so<00:04:19.269> when<00:04:19.630> I<00:04:19.660> started<00:04:19.959> doing<00:04:20.079> this<00:04:20.259> I

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
do well so when I started doing this I

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.360 
do well so when I started doing this I
started<00:04:20.680> playing<00:04:20.829> some<00:04:21.160> seedlings<00:04:21.669> and<00:04:23.370> so

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
started playing some seedlings and so

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.580 
started playing some seedlings and so
that<00:04:24.580> when<00:04:24.789> I<00:04:24.820> pull<00:04:25.210> all<00:04:25.419> these<00:04:25.570> out<00:04:25.810> I'll<00:04:26.320> have

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
that when I pull all these out I'll have

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.379 
that when I pull all these out I'll have
some<00:04:26.800> new<00:04:26.830> ones<00:04:27.130> ready<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:27.520> go<00:04:27.639> in<00:04:27.850> so<00:04:28.060> you<00:04:28.150> want

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
to want to keep a cycle going all right

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.610 
to want to keep a cycle going all right
chop<00:04:33.060> okay<00:04:34.060> so<00:04:34.300> I<00:04:34.600> just<00:04:34.780> kind<00:04:35.199> of<00:04:35.259> wanted<00:04:35.530> to

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
chop okay so I just kind of wanted to

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.540 
chop okay so I just kind of wanted to
zoom<00:04:35.860> in<00:04:36.100> so<00:04:36.850> you<00:04:37.600> can<00:04:37.780> get<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:37.990> better<00:04:38.229> look

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
zoom in so you can get a better look

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.189 
zoom in so you can get a better look
they're<00:04:39.550> all<00:04:39.669> these<00:04:39.880> beautiful<00:04:40.330> vegetables

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
they're all these beautiful vegetables

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:46.080

on<00:04:41.470> here<00:04:41.949> and<00:04:43.620> I'm<00:04:44.620> I<00:04:44.830> did<00:04:45.070> add<00:04:45.310> some<00:04:45.639> more<00:04:45.880> to

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
on here and I'm I did add some more to

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.909 
on here and I'm I did add some more to
rugal<00:04:46.389> it<00:04:46.510> was<00:04:46.630> so<00:04:46.810> good<00:04:47.050> so<00:04:47.289> I<00:04:47.380> planted<00:04:47.860> some

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
rugal it was so good so I planted some

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.790 
rugal it was so good so I planted some
more<00:04:48.340> I<00:04:48.639> had<00:04:49.510> a<00:04:49.539> couple<00:04:49.810> seedlings<00:04:50.380> that<00:04:50.500> did

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
more I had a couple seedlings that did

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.490 
more I had a couple seedlings that did
not<00:04:50.979> come<00:04:51.310> up<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:53.850> so<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:55.419> the<00:04:55.780> squash<00:04:56.139> is

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
not come up and so the the squash is

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.830 
not come up and so the the squash is
really<00:04:56.740> really<00:04:57.639> doing<00:04:57.970> well<00:04:58.150> I<00:04:58.449> think<00:04:58.510> the

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
really really doing well I think the

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.719 
really really doing well I think the
reason<00:04:59.139> why<00:04:59.289> the<00:04:59.320> tomatoes<00:04:59.949> in<00:05:00.190> there<00:05:00.370> they're

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
reason why the tomatoes in there they're

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.090 
reason why the tomatoes in there they're
doing<00:05:01.030> okay<00:05:01.389> but<00:05:02.169> I<00:05:02.199> think<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:02.710> reason<00:05:03.010> why

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
doing okay but I think the reason why

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.339 
doing okay but I think the reason why
the<00:05:03.160> tomatoes<00:05:03.699> are<00:05:04.030> not<00:05:04.270> doing<00:05:04.599> so<00:05:04.810> well<00:05:05.020> is

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
the tomatoes are not doing so well is

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.040 
the tomatoes are not doing so well is
because<00:05:05.949> it's<00:05:06.370> it's<00:05:06.639> just<00:05:06.849> not<00:05:07.090> hot<00:05:07.479> enough<00:05:07.810> in

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
because it's it's just not hot enough in

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.550 
because it's it's just not hot enough in
here<00:05:08.729> but<00:05:09.729> you<00:05:10.389> know<00:05:10.449> that<00:05:10.720> one<00:05:10.900> looks<00:05:11.320> to<00:05:11.410> be

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
here but you know that one looks to be

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.749 
here but you know that one looks to be
doing<00:05:11.830> okay<00:05:12.190> and<00:05:14.130> so<00:05:15.130> I<00:05:15.160> just<00:05:15.370> wanted<00:05:15.580> to<00:05:15.639> give

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 
doing okay and so I just wanted to give

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.920 
doing okay and so I just wanted to give
you<00:05:15.880> a<00:05:15.940> quick<00:05:16.150> little<00:05:16.360> little<00:05:17.050> shot<00:05:17.320> here<00:05:17.349> and

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
you know I know that if you on your

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.170 
you know I know that if you on your
website<00:05:22.449> it<00:05:23.050> tells<00:05:23.500> you<00:05:23.740> that<00:05:23.770> you<00:05:24.550> know<00:05:25.090> you

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
website it tells you that you know you

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.909

should have vegetables in about five or

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.980 
should have vegetables in about five or
six<00:05:27.070> weeks<00:05:27.340> which<00:05:27.699> you<00:05:28.240> know<00:05:28.360> some<00:05:28.690> of<00:05:28.840> them

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
six weeks which you know some of them

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.820 
six weeks which you know some of them
you<00:05:29.139> will<00:05:29.349> and<00:05:30.210> but<00:05:31.210> I<00:05:31.690> would<00:05:32.229> say<00:05:32.409> a<00:05:32.440> lot<00:05:32.710> of

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
you will and but I would say a lot of

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.730 
you will and but I would say a lot of
these<00:05:32.919> is<00:05:33.250> probably<00:05:33.400> going<00:05:33.639> to<00:05:33.699> be<00:05:33.760> more<00:05:34.740> you

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
these is probably going to be more you

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.830 
these is probably going to be more you
know<00:05:35.800> maybe<00:05:36.130> a<00:05:36.280> month<00:05:36.639> less<00:05:36.909> than<00:05:36.940> an<00:05:37.360> actual

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
know maybe a month less than an actual

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.750 
know maybe a month less than an actual
grown<00:05:38.199> cycle<00:05:38.770> if<00:05:38.830> you<00:05:38.889> can<00:05:39.159> plant<00:05:39.430> them<00:05:39.669> in

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
grown cycle if you can plant them in

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.580 
grown cycle if you can plant them in
dirt<00:05:40.060> unless<00:05:40.930> you<00:05:41.080> have<00:05:41.229> the<00:05:41.349> right

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
dirt unless you have the right

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.070 
dirt unless you have the right
environment<00:05:41.800> with<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.729> humidity<00:05:43.360> and<00:05:43.599> maybe

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
environment with the humidity and maybe

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.950 
environment with the humidity and maybe
even<00:05:44.380> a<00:05:44.530> little<00:05:44.770> mini<00:05:44.949> greenhouse<00:05:45.960> effect

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
even a little mini greenhouse effect

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.740 
even a little mini greenhouse effect
would<00:05:47.169> make<00:05:47.409> this<00:05:47.620> go<00:05:48.340> a<00:05:48.370> lot<00:05:48.669> faster<00:05:48.880> but<00:05:49.479> I'm

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
would make this go a lot faster but I'm

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.479 
would make this go a lot faster but I'm
pretty<00:05:50.199> happy<00:05:50.470> so<00:05:50.620> far<00:05:51.130> all<00:05:51.760> right<00:05:52.000> ciao
