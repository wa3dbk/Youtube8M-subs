00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.079
 at bruno's tour training 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.310
 slow sugars vitamins minerals 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:29.510
 to play it helps to win too 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.510
 bruno people that suits you 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.320
 hello and welcome to agen with the tv 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.180
 so this is a rehearsal match for the 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.090
 group but for you too how 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.800
 addresses this displacement mark to why 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.769
 but we only deal with a lot of seriousness 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.570
 because it's for block matches 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.850
 or contains 4 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.220
 so that's not how to make fun 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.780
 can be reduced what bourgoin one 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.280
 sees it shows in years one 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.470
 know that it's very complicated to go 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.220
 win there so all week has 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.399
 summer was studious we worked well 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:09.720
 we stayed focused on Monday since 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.720
 until now until the match 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.229
 we will have the preparation was 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.210
 normal as every week we have 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.460
 prepared this match as we prepared the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.690
 matches before and as we prepare when 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.820
 we are preparing the upcoming matches 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:29.740
 good corner it's a big team in the 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:32.320
 style yeah we could see that the big ones 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.110
 teams dropped there for the 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.470
 rochelle memoria but also small 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.180
 teams 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.420
 finally the teams that pretend months 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.799
 mounts like albi who have managed to 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.030
 to make a shot in need we know that 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.890
 big teams in quotation marks 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.810
 those who are on the top of the table 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.150
 are eagerly awaited so we get ready 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.880
 also to sand so as you say if 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.979
 it's all there is a complicated blog 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.640
 three trips can we 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.640
 17th meeting 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.549
 yes very important because here we go 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.840
 really measure yourself because that's the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.750
 high level with fight of 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.519
 aggression in time that is not 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.940
 favorable for the rugby game so 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.500
 it'll be okay I think the more taxing 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.099
 front game where there will be a lot of 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.420
 grouping of mussels all that stuff 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.810
 very important walk to see where we 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.310
 is in our curriculum and you title 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:32.270
 personal but it's a return 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.670
 waited i explained game 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.990
 show what I can do better 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.320
 that I was able to do when I returned 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.760
 against beziers so I'm going to give everything 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.350
 what does the best of me do 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.350
 even for the team and for the group
