00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
mean as we know the class is pretty deep

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.229 
mean as we know the class is pretty deep
but<00:00:54.559> for<00:00:55.559> everybody<00:00:55.739> harps<00:00:56.550> about<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.030> every

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
but for everybody harps about it every

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.549 
but for everybody harps about it every
time<00:00:57.420> as<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.870> know<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.020> star<00:00:58.260> super

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
time as you know the star super

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.310 
time as you know the star super
important<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.420> going<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.449> focus<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.260> and

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
important so going to focus on that and

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.070 
important so going to focus on that and
then<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.920> think<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:03.449> tracks<00:01:03.719> would<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:03.960> good

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.219 
the tracks I wouldn't say they're easy
but<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.040> know<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.220> doesn't<00:01:29.280> take<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.229> lot

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
but you know it doesn't take like a lot

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.870 
but you know it doesn't take like a lot
of<00:01:31.380> knowledge<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.950> kind<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.189> pick<00:01:32.460> through<00:01:32.670> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
of knowledge to kind of pick through and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.700 
of knowledge to kind of pick through and
figure<00:01:33.240> out<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.509> fast<00:01:33.720> way<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.619> know

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
figure out the fast way but you know

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.170 
figure out the fast way but you know
think<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.130> second<00:01:35.490> half<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.700> season<00:01:35.909> with

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
think this second half the season with

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.760 
think this second half the season with
me<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.840> new<00:01:36.960> new<00:01:37.290> bike<00:01:37.470> riding<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
me on the new new bike riding the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.560 
me on the new new bike riding the
kawasaki<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.369> year<00:01:38.579> over<00:01:38.759> from<00:01:39.299> what<00:01:39.420> i<00:01:39.450> had

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
kawasaki this year over from what i had

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.030 
kawasaki this year over from what i had
last<00:01:39.720> year<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.140> kind<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.740> getting<00:01:40.860> things

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
last year and kind of getting things

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.260 
last year and kind of getting things
sorted<00:01:41.250> out<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.490> beginning<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> season

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
sorted out the beginning of the season

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.999 
sorted out the beginning of the season
and<00:01:42.540> i<00:01:42.750> think<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> second<00:01:43.439> half<00:01:43.560> here<00:01:43.740> will

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
and i think the second half here will

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.490 
and i think the second half here will
definitely<00:01:44.520> show<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.780> know<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.200> hard<00:01:46.350> work
