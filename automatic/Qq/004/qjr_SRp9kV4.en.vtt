00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.350
 so her her spine it 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.320
 left to add 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.320
 head 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.709
 bones for head m 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:21.829
 remove 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.829
 front fsin smaller forces 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.179
 they are the slightest 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.179
 bond improve 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.920
 federation fund than good 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.310
 need 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.310
 so here alas 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.010
 worth it removes money pressed total 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.300
 so 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.300
 front fine let's do a little less 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.430
 so here you need 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
 slightly reduce 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400
 to evaluate was not so 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.580
 but before you do better 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.080
 hungry 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.080
 we need to do something 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.490
 when we created patkar buildings that is 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.610
 here they are understood 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.220
 to our spline 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.870
 under control create these key frames 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.840
 keyframes we need to delete 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.210
 allocated 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.520
 push day 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.520
 so for each item 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.940
 you can do it right when you 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.040
 create while moods after 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.150
 just delete it 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.580
 these keyframes and those he creates 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.790
 immediately they come back to this 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.430
 then how are we doing now 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.430
 hit so transition 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.420
 so create bones for the head 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.600
 sisin collection laos 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.239
 when I'm at your point on this bone 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.409
 then we have such a census it 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.329
 means that the next bones are 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.350
 will create 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.630
 create automatic reception 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.090
 course to this last bunch to 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.859
 we did not have this 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.859
 create them 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.159
 somewhere else 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.180
 so we look 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.459
 their orientation is the same 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.459
 so go to the blond ulus 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:49.119
 donald tusk 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:52.969
 so turn on the front 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:55.889
 for all 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.899
 as we see that we have reserves in 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:00.409
 the other side is significant hours before 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.059
 fix including the city of toulouse 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:05.759
 about affirms that we have chosen here 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:08.729
 such an icon and making brother and where 

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:11.069
 with this included in his message 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.069
 do the opposite 180 degrees 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:17.719
 like this 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:19.349
 disable 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.209
 my debt 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.609
 so now 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.339
 and it was a bit early disconnected. 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:31.339
 align this bone to this 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.319
 select her Alexei 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.790
 but also honoring attitude orientation 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.959
 from June 3 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.279
 now a little bit 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:54.479
 adjust from there he 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.889
 this bone is turned off 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.689
 front of firms 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.689
 these also fund finam include 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:08.399
 we copy ours 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:10.699
 control object 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.699
 now the storm 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:17.989
 speaking of him and his orientation on this 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.989
 plane them 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.419
 and cops 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.969
 position disable not only orientation 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:30.099
 alignable 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.270
 both cues 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.180
 so now slyunkov him 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.620
 it's a bone 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.720
 with the last spine bones six 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.720
 spine 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:49.039
 there is 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.590
 do not assign 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.199
 raids lattice sharp 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.539
 do you understand this mood 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.539
 the oldest who is 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.930
 the future 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.350
 the bones are gone old benesova 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.779
 polsat 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:12.939
 another worth it 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:15.550
 oldest worthy 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.419
 to our ruling facility the remaining 50 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.900
 on 50 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.199
 We select this bone they are closer to 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.629
 dignity 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:26.319
 rent decides to leave 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.319
 and ties so look 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.389
 all a 3 people 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.449
 we have benesh head 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.449
 rotates as you like 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.509
 we finished spine 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:49.509
 finished head 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.310
 and all tied up the most important thing is necessary 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:54.930
 here this object to bind 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.529
 naturally with control objects 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:00.529
 our whole character 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:03.770
 like this 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.770
 all the last stage we were left and hands 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:08.919
 we will do the next lesson
