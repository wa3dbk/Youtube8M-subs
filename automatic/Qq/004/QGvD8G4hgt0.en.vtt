00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
irrelevant and I could be completely

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.190 
irrelevant and I could be completely
wrong<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:48.059> everything<00:00:48.480> i'm<00:00:48.600> guessing<00:00:48.989> or<00:00:49.110> it

that case for about a month and I took

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.500 
that case for about a month and I took
it<00:04:18.440> off<00:04:18.530> once<00:04:18.860> just<00:04:19.160> to<00:04:19.250> see<00:04:19.640> what<00:04:20.330> it<00:04:20.390> feels

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
it off once just to see what it feels

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.640 
it off once just to see what it feels
like<00:04:20.690> without<00:04:20.900> it<00:04:21.080> because<00:04:21.350> you<00:04:21.470> know<00:04:21.560> you

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
like without it because you know you

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.800 
like without it because you know you
like<00:04:21.860> to<00:04:22.040> have<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.670> like<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.330> feeling<00:04:23.660> of<00:04:23.720> it

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
like to have it like the feeling of it

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.230 
like to have it like the feeling of it
being<00:04:24.050> naked<00:04:24.470> I<00:04:24.560> guess<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:24.950> I<00:04:25.700> noticed

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
being naked I guess and I noticed

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.580 
being naked I guess and I noticed
there's<00:04:26.390> all<00:04:26.540> scratched<00:04:26.840> up<00:04:26.990> so<00:04:27.140> I<00:04:27.170> never<00:04:27.320> put

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
there's all scratched up so I never put

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.250 
there's all scratched up so I never put
it<00:04:27.680> back<00:04:27.800> on<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:28.390> it's<00:04:29.390> been<00:04:29.660> fine<00:04:29.930> ever<00:04:30.140> since

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
it back on and it's been fine ever since

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.630 
it back on and it's been fine ever since
I've<00:04:30.590> never<00:04:30.770> got<00:04:30.950> a<00:04:30.980> scratch<00:04:31.100> on<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.460> or

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
I've never got a scratch on it or

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.870 
I've never got a scratch on it or
anything<00:04:31.670> and<00:04:33.160> yeah<00:04:34.160> so<00:04:34.310> I'm<00:04:34.400> hoping<00:04:34.670> that<00:04:34.820> the

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
anything and yeah so I'm hoping that the

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.030 
anything and yeah so I'm hoping that the
new<00:04:35.000> one<00:04:35.120> has<00:04:35.270> a<00:04:35.330> better<00:04:36.080> camera<00:04:36.380> I'm<00:04:36.800> hoping

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
new one has a better camera I'm hoping

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.960 
new one has a better camera I'm hoping
like<00:04:37.370> 8<00:04:37.580> megapixels<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.740> I'm<00:04:39.740> maybe<00:04:40.250> 1080p

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
like 8 megapixels and I'm maybe 1080p

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.030 
like 8 megapixels and I'm maybe 1080p
maybe<00:04:41.900> some<00:04:42.140> better<00:04:42.320> zoom<00:04:42.560> on<00:04:42.710> it<00:04:42.740> too<00:04:42.950> because

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
maybe some better zoom on it too because

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.860 
maybe some better zoom on it too because
the<00:04:43.220> iphone<00:04:43.490> 4<00:04:43.730> it<00:04:43.850> has<00:04:44.000> basically<00:04:44.420> knows<00:04:44.690> him

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
the iphone 4 it has basically knows him

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.690 
the iphone 4 it has basically knows him
it's<00:04:45.020> got<00:04:45.110> digital<00:04:45.470> zoom<00:04:45.680> and<00:04:46.310> that's<00:04:46.580> just

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
it's got digital zoom and that's just

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.700 
it's got digital zoom and that's just
awful<00:04:47.090> I<00:04:47.330> don't<00:04:47.930> think<00:04:47.990> they<00:04:48.200> can<00:04:48.260> even<00:04:48.500> do

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
awful I don't think they can even do

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.800 
awful I don't think they can even do
optical<00:04:49.160> zoom<00:04:49.190> on<00:04:49.550> here<00:04:49.880> but<00:04:50.060> it'd<00:04:50.570> be<00:04:50.600> nice<00:04:50.780> if

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
optical zoom on here but it'd be nice if

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.900 
optical zoom on here but it'd be nice if
there's<00:04:51.080> a<00:04:51.170> little<00:04:51.380> better<00:04:51.530> zoom<00:04:51.860> and<00:04:52.160> nicer

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
there's a little better zoom and nicer

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.820 
there's a little better zoom and nicer
camera<00:04:53.240> in<00:04:53.360> general<00:04:53.720> I'm<00:04:54.320> hoping<00:04:54.500> that<00:04:54.740> the

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
camera in general I'm hoping that the

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.590 
camera in general I'm hoping that the
screen<00:04:55.040> is<00:04:55.100> also<00:04:55.430> a<00:04:55.460> tad<00:04:55.820> bit<00:04:56.060> bigger<00:04:56.240> I<00:04:56.480> would

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
screen is also a tad bit bigger I would

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.350 
screen is also a tad bit bigger I would
say<00:04:56.750> maybe<00:04:56.780> four<00:04:57.680> inches<00:04:57.890> instead<00:04:58.310> of<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.640> 3.5

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
say maybe four inches instead of the 3.5

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.510 
say maybe four inches instead of the 3.5
and<00:04:59.690> the<00:05:00.110> half-inch<00:05:00.620> makes<00:05:00.860> a<00:05:00.980> big<00:05:01.160> difference

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
and the half-inch makes a big difference

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.040 
and the half-inch makes a big difference
on<00:05:01.610> a<00:05:01.670> little<00:05:01.940> phone<00:05:02.120> so<00:05:02.390> that<00:05:02.420> I<00:05:02.660> think<00:05:02.870> that'd

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
on a little phone so that I think that'd

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.590 
on a little phone so that I think that'd
be<00:05:03.110> pretty<00:05:03.260> cool<00:05:03.760> another<00:05:04.760> thing<00:05:05.000> is<00:05:05.150> I<00:05:05.300> heard

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
be pretty cool another thing is I heard

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.640 
be pretty cool another thing is I heard
that<00:05:05.690> it's<00:05:05.840> going<00:05:05.930> to<00:05:05.990> be<00:05:06.110> tapered<00:05:06.530> design

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
that it's going to be tapered design

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.290 
that it's going to be tapered design
where<00:05:07.190> it's<00:05:07.340> thicker<00:05:07.670> at<00:05:07.850> the<00:05:07.880> top<00:05:08.150> and

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
where it's thicker at the top and

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.210 
where it's thicker at the top and
thinner<00:05:08.480> at<00:05:08.600> the<00:05:08.690> bottom<00:05:08.990> even<00:05:09.680> in<00:05:09.830> its<00:05:09.980> the

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
thinner at the bottom even in its the

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.350 
thinner at the bottom even in its the
whole<00:05:10.400> thing<00:05:10.580> is<00:05:10.700> still<00:05:10.880> going<00:05:11.000> to<00:05:11.060> be<00:05:11.120> thinner

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
whole thing is still going to be thinner

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.110 
whole thing is still going to be thinner
than<00:05:11.540> the<00:05:11.660> iphone<00:05:11.930> 4<00:05:12.230> I<00:05:12.260> heard<00:05:12.680> but<00:05:13.430> it's<00:05:13.730> just

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
than the iphone 4 I heard but it's just

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.340 
than the iphone 4 I heard but it's just
going<00:05:14.240> to<00:05:14.270> be<00:05:14.330> thinner<00:05:14.600> at<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:14.870> bottom<00:05:15.170> a

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
going to be thinner at the bottom a

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.960 
going to be thinner at the bottom a
little<00:05:15.950> thinner<00:05:16.250> and<00:05:16.460> I<00:05:16.550> think<00:05:16.730> that'd<00:05:16.850> be

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
little thinner and I think that'd be

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.970 
little thinner and I think that'd be
kind<00:05:17.390> of<00:05:17.480> cool<00:05:17.690> as<00:05:18.290> long<00:05:18.350> as<00:05:18.590> like<00:05:18.740> if<00:05:18.860> your

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
kind of cool as long as like if your

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.730 
kind of cool as long as like if your
docking<00:05:19.400> your<00:05:19.790> iPhone<00:05:20.240> it<00:05:20.900> doesn't<00:05:21.230> like<00:05:21.470> put

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
docking your iPhone it doesn't like put

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.500 
docking your iPhone it doesn't like put
too<00:05:21.860> much<00:05:21.980> weight<00:05:22.190> on<00:05:22.250> that<00:05:22.400> little<00:05:22.670> area<00:05:22.970> I

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
too much weight on that little area I

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.950 
too much weight on that little area I
don't<00:05:24.020> know<00:05:24.110> and<00:05:24.710> I<00:05:25.670> also<00:05:25.880> heard<00:05:26.210> that<00:05:26.540> the

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
don't know and I also heard that the

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.570 
don't know and I also heard that the
back<00:05:27.200> is<00:05:27.440> going<00:05:27.620> to<00:05:27.680> have<00:05:27.830> more<00:05:28.040> of<00:05:28.160> a<00:05:28.250> finish

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
back is going to have more of a finish

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.750 
back is going to have more of a finish
kind<00:05:28.790> of<00:05:28.850> like<00:05:28.970> the<00:05:29.150> iPad<00:05:29.660> where<00:05:30.410> it<00:05:30.710> is<00:05:30.920> I

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
kind of like the iPad where it is I

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.900 
kind of like the iPad where it is I
think<00:05:32.510> it's<00:05:32.630> called<00:05:32.840> coerced<00:05:33.410> or<00:05:33.890> some<00:05:34.670> it's

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
think it's called coerced or some it's

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.790 
think it's called coerced or some it's
like<00:05:35.060> course<00:05:35.390> aluminum<00:05:36.200> I<00:05:36.320> think<00:05:36.530> that's<00:05:36.680> what

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
like course aluminum I think that's what

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.960 
like course aluminum I think that's what
i<00:05:36.830> call<00:05:36.979> it<00:05:37.070> i'm<00:05:37.190> not<00:05:37.220> sure<00:05:37.490> don't<00:05:37.700> quote<00:05:37.820> me<00:05:37.940> on

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
i call it i'm not sure don't quote me on

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.930 
i call it i'm not sure don't quote me on
that<00:05:38.060> but<00:05:38.740> i<00:05:39.740> don't<00:05:40.190> know<00:05:40.250> what<00:05:40.460> the<00:05:40.520> backing

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
that but i don't know what the backing

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:41.380 
that but i don't know what the backing
is<00:05:41.060> but

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
is but

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.940 
is but
the<00:05:41.480> reason<00:05:41.720> I<00:05:41.750> love<00:05:41.870> the<00:05:41.990> iphone<00:05:42.080> 4<00:05:42.500> back<00:05:42.710> is

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
the reason I love the iphone 4 back is

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.530 
the reason I love the iphone 4 back is
it's<00:05:43.340> also<00:05:43.580> the<00:05:43.820> gorilla<00:05:44.060> glass<00:05:44.270> so<00:05:44.510> it

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
it's also the gorilla glass so it

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.660 
it's also the gorilla glass so it
doesn't<00:05:44.900> scratch<00:05:45.050> and<00:05:45.650> I<00:05:46.010> know<00:05:46.070> the<00:05:46.310> ipad

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:46.670 
doesn't scratch and I know the ipad

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.870 
doesn't scratch and I know the ipad
backing<00:05:47.330> can<00:05:47.750> scratch<00:05:48.140> it's<00:05:48.440> not<00:05:48.880> as

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
backing can scratch it's not as

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.080 
backing can scratch it's not as
resilient<00:05:50.210> as<00:05:50.600> like<00:05:50.780> the<00:05:50.900> iphone<00:05:51.200> 4<00:05:51.850> but<00:05:52.850> i

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
resilient as like the iphone 4 but i

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.540 
resilient as like the iphone 4 but i
just<00:05:53.780> like<00:05:53.930> not<00:05:54.770> having<00:05:54.950> to<00:05:55.070> worry<00:05:55.130> about<00:05:55.310> it

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
just like not having to worry about it

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.350 
just like not having to worry about it
getting<00:05:55.640> scratched<00:05:56.120> so<00:05:56.600> that's<00:05:57.590> my<00:05:57.710> little

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
getting scratched so that's my little

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.720 
getting scratched so that's my little
quick<00:05:59.360> opinions<00:05:59.870> on<00:06:00.140> what<00:06:00.980> I<00:06:01.010> think<00:06:01.340> Apple<00:06:01.670> is

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
quick opinions on what I think Apple is

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.980 
quick opinions on what I think Apple is
going<00:06:01.760> to<00:06:01.880> be<00:06:02.000> doing<00:06:02.240> there's<00:06:02.540> probably<00:06:02.780> be

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
going to be doing there's probably be

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.110 
going to be doing there's probably be
some<00:06:03.140> more<00:06:03.290> stuff<00:06:03.560> there<00:06:03.800> but<00:06:03.830> watch<00:06:04.610> my<00:06:04.850> video
