can help develop plug-ins for a smaller
server<00:01:01.440> well<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.609> initially<00:01:03.120> learned<00:01:03.539> how<00:01:03.719> to

developer on the bucket forums I'll

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.000 
developer on the bucket forums I'll
check<00:01:06.240> out<00:01:06.360> open<00:01:06.780> source<00:01:06.990> github<00:01:07.380> projects<00:01:07.830> i

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
check out open source github projects i

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.350 
check out open source github projects i
would<00:01:08.130> check<00:01:08.250> out<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.549> resources<00:01:08.729> section

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
would check out the resources section

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.140 
would check out the resources section
and<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:10.409> would<00:01:10.590> see<00:01:10.830> patterns<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.000> would

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
and I would see patterns and I would

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.460 
and I would see patterns and I would
look<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.570> how<00:01:12.810> these<00:01:13.020> things<00:01:13.049> were<00:01:13.290> put

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
look for how these things were put

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.399 
look for how these things were put
together<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.850> would<00:01:15.030> learn<00:01:15.990> from<00:01:16.200> there

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
together and I would learn from there

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.530 
together and I would learn from there
but<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.340> was<00:01:17.460> not<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.610> best<00:01:17.790> way<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.030> learn<00:01:18.240> I

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
but that was not the best way to learn I

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.420 
but that was not the best way to learn I
started<00:01:19.200> really<00:01:19.380> learning<00:01:19.619> when<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.189> took<00:01:20.250> my

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
started really learning when I took my

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.999 
started really learning when I took my
university<00:01:21.119> courses<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.869> programming<00:01:22.350> so

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
university courses and programming so

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.770 
university courses and programming so
once<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.610> started<00:01:24.060> getting<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> real

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
once I started getting to a real

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.819 
once I started getting to a real
environment<00:01:25.250> with<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> professor<00:01:26.820> then<00:01:27.829> that's

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
environment with a professor then that's

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.999 
environment with a professor then that's
where<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> really<00:01:29.640> started<00:01:29.850> picked<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.119> up<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
where I really started picked it up and

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.920 
where I really started picked it up and
can<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.130> suggest<00:01:32.340> anyone<00:01:32.850> who<00:01:33.360> will<00:01:33.540> develop

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
can I suggest anyone who will develop

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.990 
can I suggest anyone who will develop
for<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> smaller<00:01:34.710> server<00:01:35.040> all<00:01:35.400> right<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:35.970> I

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
for a smaller server all right so I

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.940 
for a smaller server all right so I
don't<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.390> any<00:01:36.570> one<00:01:36.750> specific<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.500> recommend

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
don't have any one specific to recommend

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.319 
don't have any one specific to recommend
because<00:01:38.250> most<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.610> my<00:01:38.790> friends<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:39.180> busy

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
because most of my friends are busy

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.039 
because most of my friends are busy
working<00:01:40.110> at<00:01:40.470> other<00:01:40.650> networks<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:42.049> honestly

if you're looking to have many games

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.340 
if you're looking to have many games
made<00:01:45.030> or<00:01:45.509> something<00:01:45.840> along<00:01:45.930> those<00:01:46.200> lines

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
made or something along those lines

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.679 
made or something along those lines
you're<00:01:47.070> gonna<00:01:47.189> run<00:01:47.610> up<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.850> tab<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.090> several

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
you're gonna run up a tab of several

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.120 
you're gonna run up a tab of several
hundred<00:01:49.020> dollars<00:01:49.350> depending<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:49.950> its

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
hundred dollars depending on its

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.910 
hundred dollars depending on its
complexity<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.360> if<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.810> were<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.470> would<00:01:52.890> just

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
complexity so if I were you I would just

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.580 
complexity so if I were you I would just

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
lessons well really quick on the private

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.240 
lessons well really quick on the private
lessons<00:05:25.540> I<00:05:25.690> really<00:05:26.530> don't<00:05:26.710> have<00:05:26.740> time<00:05:26.979> to<00:05:27.130> even

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
lessons I really don't have time to even

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.340 
lessons I really don't have time to even
do<00:05:27.400> Commission<00:05:27.820> work<00:05:27.940> so<00:05:28.570> private<00:05:29.020> lessons

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
do Commission work so private lessons

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.590 
do Commission work so private lessons
would<00:05:29.620> just<00:05:29.830> take<00:05:29.950> away<00:05:30.190> more<00:05:30.400> time<00:05:30.640> and<00:05:31.000> you

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
would just take away more time and you

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.909 
would just take away more time and you
like<00:05:31.780> it<00:05:31.900> a<00:05:31.930> little<00:05:32.050> bit<00:05:32.229> tricky<00:05:32.440> when<00:05:32.710> you<00:05:32.800> do

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
like it a little bit tricky when you do

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:34.710 
like it a little bit tricky when you do
taxes<00:05:33.400> and<00:05:33.550> stuff<00:05:33.640> because<00:05:33.910> that<00:05:34.180> is<00:05:34.330> kind<00:05:34.660> of

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
get me into coding well I originally

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.120 
get me into coding well I originally
approached<00:06:12.789> developers<00:06:13.450> a<00:06:13.479> long<00:06:13.900> time<00:06:14.289> ago<00:06:14.470> to

elegance for herself you know in time so

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.260 
elegance for herself you know in time so
I<00:06:32.820> did<00:06:33.630> and<00:06:34.400> before<00:06:35.400> long<00:06:35.580> I<00:06:35.850> didn't<00:06:36.090> need

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
I did and before long I didn't need

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.960 
I did and before long I didn't need
custom<00:06:37.140> plugins<00:06:37.740> from<00:06:38.070> other<00:06:38.280> developers<00:06:38.550> I

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
custom plugins from other developers I

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.970 
custom plugins from other developers I
could<00:06:39.120> make<00:06:39.240> my<00:06:39.360> own<00:06:39.390> so<00:06:40.230> that's<00:06:40.770> what<00:06:40.890> really

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
could make my own so that's what really

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.100 
could make my own so that's what really
got<00:06:41.070> me<00:06:41.220> into<00:06:41.430> coding<00:06:41.700> fun<00:06:42.270> orgy<00:06:42.510> asks<00:06:42.840> what

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
got me into coding fun orgy asks what

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.900 
got me into coding fun orgy asks what
