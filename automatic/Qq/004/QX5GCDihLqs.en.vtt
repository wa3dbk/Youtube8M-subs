a comprehensive redesign critical on BMW
now<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.230> headlining<00:00:31.590> change<00:00:32.009> was<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.579> move

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
now the headlining change was the move

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.209 
now the headlining change was the move
to<00:00:33.480> liquid<00:00:33.840> cooling<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.469> boxer<00:00:34.890> point

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
to liquid cooling for the boxer point

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.760 
to liquid cooling for the boxer point
and<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.610> difference<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.210> 15<00:00:36.840> horsepower<00:00:37.200> or

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
and the difference is 15 horsepower or

and the difference is 15 horsepower or
125<00:00:38.399> G<00:00:38.760> horsepower<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.450> when<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.140> fire<00:00:40.440> up

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
125 G horsepower and when you fire up

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.959 
125 G horsepower and when you fire up
that<00:00:40.739> boxer<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.370> twist<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> throttle

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
that boxer and you twist the throttle

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.690 
that boxer and you twist the throttle
it's<00:00:42.570> immediately<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.110> sporty<00:00:43.710> ER<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.040> more

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
it's immediately a sporty ER and more

it's immediately a sporty ER and more
visceral<00:00:45.180> ride<00:00:45.649> now<00:00:46.649> even<00:00:46.950> though<00:00:47.070> it's

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
visceral ride now even though it's

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.970 
visceral ride now even though it's
liquid<00:00:47.670> cooled<00:00:48.230> essentially<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.469> still<00:00:49.829> an

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
liquid cooled essentially it is still an

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.040 
liquid cooled essentially it is still an

air-cooled engines aged 65 percent of
the<00:00:52.140> cooling<00:00:52.469> comes<00:00:52.739> from<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> air<00:00:53.100> cooling

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
the cooling comes from the air cooling

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.569 
the cooling comes from the air cooling
it's<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.690> complete<00:00:55.110> ground-up<00:00:56.010> redesign<00:00:56.190> that

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
it's a complete ground-up redesign that

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.090 
it's a complete ground-up redesign that
powertrain<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.510> completely<00:00:57.960> different<00:00:58.170> it's

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
powertrain is completely different it's

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.250 
powertrain is completely different it's
much<00:00:59.370> more<00:00:59.550> consolidated<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.750> throttle

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
much more consolidated the throttle

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.540 
much more consolidated the throttle
bodies<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.739> intake<00:01:02.010> tracks<00:01:02.370> are

bodies and the intake tracks are
different<00:01:02.600> it<00:01:03.600> still<00:01:03.899> looks<00:01:04.140> like<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.500> boxer

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
different it still looks like the boxer

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.830

still feels like the boxer but it's a

dynamic road rain those are the three
street<00:01:18.509> modes<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.080> there's<00:01:19.200> also

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
street modes and then there's also

enduro and enduro Pro now these new

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.469 
enduro and enduro Pro now these new
driving<00:01:22.860> modes<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.060> much<00:01:24.210> different

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
driving modes that have a much different

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.050 
driving modes that have a much different
throttle<00:01:25.259> feel<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.740> each<00:01:25.830> one<00:01:26.130> they<00:01:26.939> also

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
throttle feel for each one they also

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.090 
throttle feel for each one they also
work<00:01:27.360> with<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> new<00:01:27.750> semi-active<00:01:28.259> suspension

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
work with the new semi-active suspension

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.940 
work with the new semi-active suspension
the<00:01:30.000> way<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.299> works<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.930> meters<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
the way that works is it meters the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.859 
the way that works is it meters the
damping<00:01:32.400> based<00:01:32.670> off<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> different<00:01:33.630> drive

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
damping based off of the different drive

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.380 
damping based off of the different drive
modes<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.920> also<00:01:35.250> fine-tune<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
modes you can also fine-tune it with the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.749 
modes you can also fine-tune it with the
ESA<00:01:36.990> which<00:01:37.200> returns<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:38.220> has<00:01:38.460> different

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
ESA which returns that has different

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.240 
ESA which returns that has different
settings<00:01:39.090> soft<00:01:39.630> normal<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.350> hard<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.979> it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
settings soft normal and hard and it

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.760 
settings soft normal and hard and it
also<00:01:41.400> has<00:01:41.700> two<00:01:42.000> settings<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.630> enduro<00:01:42.930> really

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
also has two settings for enduro really

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.560 
also has two settings for enduro really
what<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.009> does<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.490> makes<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.820> GS<00:01:45.240> more

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
what it does is it makes the GS more

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.179 
what it does is it makes the GS more
versatile<00:01:45.960> bike<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.560> turn<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.920> into<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
versatile bike you can turn it into a

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.789 
versatile bike you can turn it into a
soft<00:01:47.610> comfortable<00:01:48.420> touring<00:01:48.990> bike<00:01:49.200> or<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.590> can

soft comfortable touring bike or you can

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.280 
soft comfortable touring bike or you can
really<00:01:50.549> alter<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:50.970> become<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> canyon<00:01:51.869> carving

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
really alter it become a canyon carving

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.870 
really alter it become a canyon carving
