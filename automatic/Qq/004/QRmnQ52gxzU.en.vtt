00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.210 
it down that's a pretty serious problem
with<00:01:48.840> saddling<00:01:49.200> future<00:01:49.500> generations<00:01:50.040> with

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
with saddling future generations with

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.980 
with saddling future generations with
America's<00:01:50.820> power<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.329> Middle<00:01:51.540> East<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.810> lot

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
America's power in the Middle East a lot

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.450 
America's power in the Middle East a lot
weaker<00:01:52.229> we're<00:01:52.950> gonna<00:01:53.130> take<00:01:53.280> us<00:01:53.430> very

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
weaker we're gonna take us very

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.300 
weaker we're gonna take us very
seriously<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:54.240> Russia<00:01:54.479> or<00:01:54.840> China<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.950> think

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
seriously in Russia or China so I think

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.399 
seriously in Russia or China so I think
there's<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.729> very<00:01:56.850> mixed<00:01:57.390> picture<00:01:57.420> here<00:01:58.140> well

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
there's a very mixed picture here well

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.760 
there's a very mixed picture here well
we<00:01:59.040> were<00:01:59.189> losing<00:01:59.960> 750,000<00:02:00.960> jobs<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.320> month<00:02:01.350> when

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
we were losing 750,000 jobs a month when

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.800 
we were losing 750,000 jobs a month when
he<00:02:01.799> came<00:02:02.100> into<00:02:02.430> office<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:03.149> well<00:02:03.509> there<00:02:03.630> was<00:02:03.780> a

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
he came into office so well there was a

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.230 
he came into office so well there was a
crisis<00:02:04.460> probably<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> little<00:02:05.610> hard<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.000> start

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
crisis probably a little hard to start

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.200 
crisis probably a little hard to start
unemployment

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
unemployment

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.730 
unemployment
right<00:02:07.840> unemployed<00:02:08.410> how<00:02:08.800> much<00:02:08.950> did<00:02:09.160> Reagan<00:02:09.369> uh

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
right unemployed how much did Reagan uh

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.050 
right unemployed how much did Reagan uh
multiply<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:11.800> debt<00:02:12.100> I<00:02:12.250> think<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.610> was<00:02:12.730> times

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
multiply the debt I think it was times

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.540 
multiply the debt I think it was times
three<00:02:13.450> uh<00:02:13.690> Reagan's<00:02:14.590> average<00:02:14.980> debt<00:02:15.190> was<00:02:15.370> two

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
trillion five times more yeah but those

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.380 
trillion five times more yeah but those
are<00:02:20.710> nineteen<00:02:21.040> eighty<00:02:21.220> dollars<00:02:21.670> yeah<00:02:22.180> but

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
are nineteen eighty dollars yeah but

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.730

do<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.030> times<00:02:28.300> on<00:02:28.630> that<00:02:28.840> we<00:02:29.230> can<00:02:29.410> do<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.620> times

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
do the times on that we can do the times

do the times on that we can do the times
how<00:02:30.040> much<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.310> factor<00:02:30.760> in<00:02:30.850> inflation<00:02:31.150> Reagan

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
how much you factor in inflation Reagan

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.840 
how much you factor in inflation Reagan
Reagan<00:02:32.530> stats<00:02:32.950> about<00:02:33.250> two<00:02:33.400> hundred<00:02:33.520> billion

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
Reagan stats about two hundred billion

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.970 
Reagan stats about two hundred billion
dollars<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.660> if<00:02:35.080> you<00:02:35.170> factor<00:02:35.380> it<00:02:35.590> for<00:02:35.740> today

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
dollars and if you factor it for today

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.350 
dollars and if you factor it for today
would<00:02:36.160> be<00:02:36.250> about<00:02:36.430> four<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.850> five<00:02:36.880> hundred

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
would be about four to five hundred

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.840 
would be about four to five hundred
billion<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:37.840> still<00:02:38.160> Obama<00:02:39.160> still<00:02:39.489> at<00:02:39.640> twice

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
billion is still Obama still at twice

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.120 
billion is still Obama still at twice
the<00:02:39.880> rate<00:02:40.120> okay<00:02:40.930> well<00:02:41.290> I'll<00:02:41.650> check<00:02:41.709> those

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
the rate okay well I'll check those

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.570 
the rate okay well I'll check those
facts<00:02:42.400> after<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.880> show<00:02:44.040> okay<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:45.070> your<00:02:45.400> new

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
facts after the show okay so your new

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.400 
facts after the show okay so your new
movie<00:02:45.940> that<00:02:46.060> comes<00:02:46.239> out<00:02:46.480> is<00:02:46.630> called<00:02:46.810> America

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
movie that comes out is called America

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.340 
movie that comes out is called America
and<00:02:47.620> III<00:02:48.250> if<00:02:48.850> I<00:02:49.060> get<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.450> thesis<00:02:49.840> right<00:02:50.110> it's

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
and III if I get the thesis right it's

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.740 
and III if I get the thesis right it's
that<00:02:50.440> you're<00:02:51.430> mad<00:02:51.730> at<00:02:51.880> people<00:02:51.910> who<00:02:52.360> say<00:02:52.570> that

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
that you're mad at people who say that

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.050 
that you're mad at people who say that
capitalism<00:02:53.320> is<00:02:53.620> theft<00:02:54.070> is<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:54.520> is<00:02:54.850> that<00:02:55.030> a

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
capitalism is theft is that is that a

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.640 
capitalism is theft is that is that a
fair<00:02:55.780> assessment<00:02:55.810> no<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.709> think<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.310> look<00:02:57.730> um

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
fair assessment no I think that look um

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.080 
fair assessment no I think that look um
there<00:02:59.650> is<00:02:59.770> an<00:02:59.890> argument<00:03:00.100> that<00:03:00.520> is<00:03:00.700> gathered

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
there is an argument that is gathered

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.940 
there is an argument that is gathered
force<00:03:01.360> in<00:03:01.510> America<00:03:01.900> since<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.170> 60s<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:02.830> it's

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
force in America since the 60s and it's

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.380 
force in America since the 60s and it's
a<00:03:03.040> very<00:03:03.220> powerful<00:03:03.730> argument<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:04.360> don't

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
a very powerful argument I don't

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.449 
a very powerful argument I don't
downplay<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:05.170> in<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.350> slightest<00:03:05.770> it's<00:03:06.070> the
