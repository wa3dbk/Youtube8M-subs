so here we have the purl side up that's

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.080 
so here we have the purl side up that's
the<00:00:29.980> reverse<00:00:30.310> stockinette<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:32.560> row<00:00:33.090> was

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
created by ripping down and using a

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.830 
created by ripping down and using a
single-sided<00:00:38.230> tool<00:00:38.649> to<00:00:39.640> just<00:00:39.969> hook<00:00:40.449> each

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
single-sided tool to just hook each

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.720 
single-sided tool to just hook each
stitch<00:00:41.379> up<00:00:41.710> on<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:43.570> side<00:00:43.899> we<00:00:44.559> used<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.340> fixer

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
stitch up on this side we used the fixer

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.660 
stitch up on this side we used the fixer
stitch<00:00:45.969> and<00:00:46.379> because<00:00:47.379> it's<00:00:47.620> a<00:00:47.710> two-sided<00:00:48.219> tool

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
stitch and because it's a two-sided tool

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.560 
stitch and because it's a two-sided tool
we<00:00:49.390> were<00:00:49.539> able<00:00:50.079> to<00:00:50.320> include<00:00:50.980> a<00:00:51.160> twist<00:00:51.640> in<00:00:52.059> each

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.610 
we were able to include a twist in each
stitch<00:00:52.960> which<00:00:53.890> gave<00:00:54.190> us<00:00:54.219> this<00:00:54.609> very<00:00:55.030> tight
