00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
an excellent fuel economy which I think

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.440 
an excellent fuel economy which I think
that<00:04:34.000> v6<00:04:35.460> 3.5<00:04:36.460> has<00:04:36.669> a<00:04:36.700> little<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.000> little<00:04:37.360> bit

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
that v6 3.5 has a little a little bit

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.150 
that v6 3.5 has a little a little bit
over<00:04:37.630> 200<00:04:38.020> horsepower<00:04:38.289> so<00:04:38.680> it's<00:04:38.800> really<00:04:39.010> good

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
over 200 horsepower so it's really good

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.850 
over 200 horsepower so it's really good
fuel<00:04:39.430> economy<00:04:39.490> for<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:41.229> power<00:04:41.470> that<00:04:41.680> you<00:04:41.770> get

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
fuel economy for the power that you get

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.560 
fuel economy for the power that you get
out<00:04:41.979> of<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.130> engine<00:04:42.430> so<00:04:43.120> it's<00:04:43.270> a<00:04:43.330> really<00:04:43.479> good

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
out of the engine so it's a really good

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.770 
out of the engine so it's a really good
combination<00:04:43.810> of<00:04:44.229> power<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.680> fuel<00:04:44.979> economy

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
combination of power and fuel economy

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.010 
combination of power and fuel economy
