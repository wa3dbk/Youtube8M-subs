00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:05.720
 mitosis a type of cell division in which provides for the application of 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.299
 genetic material each daughter cell receives a full complement of stretches 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.189
 or more identical to that of the stem cells 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:17.080
 the mitosis of the foundation of growth in the repair of 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:17.949
 tissues 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:19.810
 and that asexual reproduction 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.810
 that feels a lot of the invertebrates that we will study 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:29.339
 In order to perform this practice we will make it contradict Goya 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.039
 The objective of this practice is to make a microscopic preparation of 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:35.880
 neris cells thematic onion root 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.410
 for her to locate and differentiate with the microscope the different phases of the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.410
 mitosis the also called 'street without light' 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.190
 the materials that we will use the spokesman microscope as object lived 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.030
 of removal fine forceps razor blade 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.080
 ethic filter paper strip type a and b 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.160
 flight of onions just finished 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
 wooden fans chew a 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.350
 we need that some activity is previously carried out 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.780
 three or four days before doing the practice we must put a volvo of 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.350
 onion in a beaker filled with water 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.610
 so that the inner part of it is in contact with it 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.540
 After three or four days, many quarrels will have formed 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.180
 Take care apex will be used and theatrical 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.550
 It is advisable to carry out the practice when you are there, they have not yet 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.960
 grown too 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.590
 with a fine-tipped scissors 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.000
 some modest people and chairs are cut trying that their length will be about 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.420
 two to three millimeters 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.340
 since in this area of ​​the root where the greater than the amount are found 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.820
 of cells in division 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.540
 this faith deposited in 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.840
 in small pieces emilio guerrero 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.360
 which have previously been dumped between 12 to 13 thousand injured and unacceptable 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.900
 already works in the softening and cell membrane 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.130
 with the help of some pieces of wood 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.719
 this video of rioja will heat the flame of the lighter for about eight 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.719
 minutes taking care that it does not boil 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.979
 the heating ends when we observe the emission of more dim 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.569
 steam 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.260
 ficon then with the fine-tipped pliers 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.470
 one of the extreme states of the roots is an apex 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.020
 and is placed on a slide by adding a gold boot is 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.309
 unacceptable 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.629
 which is left to act for a minute 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.980
 The function of this set and kate office is to complete the dyeing process 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.229
 of the chromosomes 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.279
 then we must perform the fours 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.409
 which consists of the following 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.150
 over the club and objects burned completely stopped 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.459
 some strips of filter paper are placed more or less -5 6 transits 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.700
 then it is gently pressed with the pad of the thumb doing a twist of more 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.259
 or minus 60 degrees 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:54.209
 so that the cells remain in a single plane and the 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.939
 excess coloring 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.959
 fínez égida to still remove the filter paper hits 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.039
 he also knows mind with the blunt end of a needle magnetized well with the 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:07.349
 flat end of a pencil to complete the disintegration of the 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.059
 mixed cells 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:11.029
 then observe 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:12.459
 this preparation 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.059
 with the help of microscopes 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:18.119
 starting with the objective to mine increases to then go arriving thus at a 

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:19.389
 greater increase 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.430
 in the objective of lower increase we will observe a large number of cells in 

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:24.879
 the different stages 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.059
 of doing cell division in this case half 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:32.969
 with a further increase of demolishing the various stages 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:37.139
 observing that during the interface the Tahari Attic nucleus appear 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.559
 closed inside the nuclear membrane 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:42.179
 with the perfectly differentiated nucleus 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:46.349
 and with a chromatin fiber easily observable for its ease for you 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:47.299
 same 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.309
 the Peruvian subsidiary kina contains the dn and the protein associated with it 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:55.209
 its appearance is similar to that of a skein of threads with the nato talmente 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.969
 indifference 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:01.089
 then we can err in some other cells the beginning of the profa 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:05.959
 where the chromatin suffers a progressive condensation due to the super 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.419
 packaging and superheroes rolle while the chromosomes 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.439
 this is the principle of the act facilitated 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.929
 we must bear in mind that this is a process 

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:20.249
 and then we will finally reach the end of the desecration as the 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:25.320
 the phase the chromosomes go begging individualizing c were appearing as 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:28.779
 perfectly differentiated structures within the cell nucleus 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:33.930
 this packing of chromatin is easily understandable 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.930
 has a functional point of view of the process 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.210
 indiana chromosomes continue to condense and becoming visible 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.020
 structure 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.460
 Tomatina remained 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.960
 in the cytoplasm and more specifically in the opposite pole of the same go 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.919
 organizing a microtubule-emitting centers 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.879
 the nucleus disappears and the nuclear membrane breaks and villegas 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:57.750
 in this way these microtubules can come into contact with the regions 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:59.559
 Medical center of chromosomes 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:01.419
 indigenous and metaphors 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.499
 this one has microtubules in what is called just mitotic usoc aromatic 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:09.499
 because of their shape their children 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:14.520
 raises goals pass each of the imitated korosti face chromatin starts to 

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:18.019
 capture these metro toulon as a result of that the chromosome will 

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:19.199
 move 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.310
 through the cytoplasm in movements of polarization guarín passion 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.650
 and concretion 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.770
 karasin this places to tariq labels of a pablo his brother of the opposite pole 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.720
 by arrests chromosomes in valence 1 there were other funds when the 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.980
 number of microtubules captured by each cinema tokoro brother and 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.620
 approximately equal the force arrest is balanced in the chromosome 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.759
 has to stay in the center of the ceoe 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.639
 when this phenomenon occurs in all the comms or more we say that a 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.539
 concretion of chromosomes 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.029
 in the center of the city and in the area 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:55.400
 in the middle of the week 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.190
 this concretion of all the chromosomes in the cotran plate of the cell in what 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.889
 what we call meta fas 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:04.159
 the chromosomes in addition to being in the center are oriented 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:05.590
 to the pictorially 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:06.419
 and this is 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.009
 the two frames that is oriented either by the assumptions of the ceoe 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.879
 finally during the year 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:15.999
 myth if we get to win easy 

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:17.900
 when all the chromosomes 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.120
 they are arranged on the equatorial plate 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.740
 a new signal is produced in the cell that produces kick-ass has touched 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.740
 rowing is not dragged to a town other than the cee 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:31.129
 the separation of lucimiento choirs entails the separation of the formation 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:35.709
 Germanic as we can see in the photo place the chromosome 6 end of then 

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:36.529
 with matías 

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:39.639
 and each one of them mobile migration hundred 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:43.740
 will buy chromatically and genetically and equal to his sister 

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:50.320
 every cell would be said to do every cell and we will have identical information 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.619
 in each one of them 

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:55.919
 the calafate that we call an easy one and that is characterized by the separation 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:00.229
 immigration from the camera that weeks ago to the opposite poles cellular 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.879
 then we have what is the easiest 

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:06.649
 which is when this trip to the facico culminates 

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:10.479
 having thus two opposed nuclei that identical is that they begin to go adapting 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:14.180
 the situation to start a new interface 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.030
 the chromatin then begins to condense the core of the membrane 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.819
 nuclear are rebuilt are formed two nuclei children 

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:24.080
 this is what we call easy shooting 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.229
 and actually with her finish what is properly called carlos cine fic 

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:30.909
 which is the division of the chromosomes 

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:35.039
 however next comes the cover that is called sinister tito 

00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:38.309
 in which cell division occurs 

00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:43.259
 completing fape the fader the part of the tav and still cell wall that 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:44.860
 they isolate the two nuclei 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.689
 this occurs during the appointment without success 

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:50.689
 which is really nothing more than the division of cytokines 

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:54.260
 having as well as final result 

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.550
 two daughter cells 

00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:00.479
 identical to the stem cell with the same number of chromosomes isinbayeva
