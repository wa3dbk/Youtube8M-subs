00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.340
 imagine you appear a forest somewhere in 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.490
 middle ages around you one trees 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.130
 pebbles lying around the lake near Alina 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.120
 Bunnies run around the green grass was 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.130
 yesterday superfluous 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.100
 for how did you come here 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:43.160
 in the middle of the forest in the past and even a woman 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.710
 then you will understand how and this combat woman 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.050
 but now who can shock before 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.690
 the girl was not so scared of her body 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.580
 but the guys were done in full and even 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.520
 collect nothing need to be built 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.750
 brick houses and there is and oh well if 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.780
 you at least something because of this 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.870
 interested then meet my tera 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.870
 online 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.220
 First of all, let's start by finding out. 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.200
 who creates this masterpiece and it is not 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.020
 some kind of a foreign company with 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.229
 a great budget and the usual and most importantly 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.390
 Russian guys with 20 years of experience even in 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.880
 our time it doesn't say much 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.950
 now newcomers can jump above the roof 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.759
 and the old men at the time do something 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.820
 the average 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.100
 but let's not talk about it the company calls 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.920
 yourself are drinking worlds and consists on this 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.409
 moment of eight people is not enough 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.420
 so gaining their ranks people my 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.030
 site you can see the job 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.979
 if you are fond of modeling what 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.899
 that sense tivi programming languages 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.110
 or just ready to become a moderator on 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.190
 write to the forum 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.679
 the origins of the game 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.759
 and now what is all about 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:55.159
 wild era this is a huge open sandbox 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.679
 world 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.600
 will wait for you when the game comes out now 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.329
 same and pass content with a little 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.789
 a piece of that big one and even on it 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.100
 have something to do as i said earlier we 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.819
 We appear in the center of the map in the role of some kind 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.190
 women 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.530
 probably local because very much 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.750
 she survives well such conditions and 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.030
 first thing you need to brighten yourself 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.549
 tools and choose where we will be 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.129
 you can settle about food and drink 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.200
 at first do not think hunger will come 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.750
 after the energy scale goes down 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.610
 closer to zero for this you need to run 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.500
 or according to perform some kind of work 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.989
 each hit takes you point 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.810
 endurance and also brief but about 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.060
 drinks here you can forget our 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.630
 let's call her lucia coded 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.510
 and does not use liquid at all 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.510
 Next you need to stake out your place by making 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.300
 very first bed skins and that means 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.760
 time of hunting wild wildlife and since 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.610
 our character is now naked and vulnerable 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.070
 worth kulikovu fear developers 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.100
 assert that people do not need to be afraid 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.740
 once lusia in the north stylus 1 threat 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.170
 you but at this stage of the game all some 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.470
 good psychopaths are very rare 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.860
 and even strange because around some Russians 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.500
 and we know ourselves I give it 90 percent 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.210
 that the first death will not be by hand from 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.460
 paws and paws beam 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.500
 bears boars live closer to the edges 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.570
 somewhere in the west in the north 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.220
 but the wolves filthy contrive 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.930
 run closer to the center and 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.909
 say hello to you with a big hug 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.459
 in such moments you need to feel yourself 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.890
 forest gump and run away 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.200
 the main thing is not to bump into anything now 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.659
 the game bypassing any items is terrible 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.629
 Of course you get used to time and then 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.040
 so furious but at first difficult by the way 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.900
 if you don't crash 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.930
 and will run all over the map you 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.480
 tired and die of hunger but you 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.239
 there is a chance at the coffee chest is it 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.030
 the local treasure in these chests is not 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.340
 weapons of food and resources and ready 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.459
 buildings but there is something better and 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.739
 drawings and recipes as in the good old 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.409
 grow you have a standard set 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.239
 what to craft and if you want more then 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.730
 have to run and look for 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.549
 they spawn in a random way and find 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.650
 and so just the best debit naked 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.989
 not so sad if you die 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.570
 but do not immediately run headlong and 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.639
 look for these stupid drawings of yours 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.860
 The initial set of the young engineer is 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.139
 quite a few things for the initial game with 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.870
 using this you build yourself a house and not 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.390
 small good durable fence everyones 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.790
 scourge and foundries 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.340
 private garden to chicken coop only without chickens 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.070
 on mastering everything and starting craft 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.170
 will take a couple of days, that's when you can 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.150
 go searching and nobody 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.270
 prohibits killing other players 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.590
 who needs these papers though pvp now 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.320
 not the best side of the game 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.010
 Iâ€™m going to talk about cons 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.470
 graphics 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.480
 she paused at the beginning of the two thousandth 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.910
 it was then that most of all you went 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.190
 such games and to be precise, 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.050
 he recalled the recent zombie project and 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.480
 legend fear crosser 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.700
 they are very much alike but for some reason much 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.950
 complaining and gouging eyes are not hunting 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:14.410
 coffin hunt obsolete on all fronts 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:17.080
 for 2015 but nice and it's not 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.560
 the final product developed assure that 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.360
 grafon will be delivered just need time 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.670
 better of course if they moved to 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.460
 a new engine but a question pops up 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.440
 will they have time to release their 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.660
 product to market already this year 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.670
 and we all remember what happened to us 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.800
 once there or still have a lot to do 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.230
 at least a little to go to the schedule 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.420
 fix serious flaws on this 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.080
 stage i and introduce a lot of other content 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:46.660
 and there, too, is not without problems 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.270
 play the same wild ero online now i would 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.940
 still advised everyone who likes 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.580
 such a survival genre such a top view and 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.550
 nice such graphics but early pack 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.830
 access cost 400 rubles and this is the most 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.140
 little of course now almost 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.390
 every game with early access has 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.730
 such a price tag but it's just a little bit 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.340
 a different scale and not everyone will want 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.470
 give that amount denis by freakin out 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.410
 our company you teeworld almost 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.800
 same question answered now that they 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.840
 need to 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.659
 players who will help the project 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.400
 develop and become better they need 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:24.250
 people who will relate to the game 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.409
 seriously and willing to pay it stupid 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.409
 excuse for felling money or all for 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:32.169
 it's up to you to decide the truth is not about me 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.259
 Remains good even because 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:36.849
 that she was able to me somehow 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:40.740
 delay for a few days and this 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:44.849
 It turns out a very small number of games 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:48.449
 and that's all with you was the game channel 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:50.610
 like your subscription likes and answer 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:53.069
 my question is comments need 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.020
 rubric on the channel from such projects here 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:57.770
 early access 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.770
 see you later
