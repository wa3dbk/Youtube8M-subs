00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.539
 hello we will test today 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.670
 for xbox 360 if you have this console 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:18.250
 then you surely remembered with nostalgia 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.349
 years of popularity of 8 and 16 bit 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.060
 consoles when it was considered good form 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.039
 sell a game console with two 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.840
 gamepads included now 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.849
 most games designed for one 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.529
 player or online game 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.900
 so consoles are most often sold 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.940
 with just one game controller but 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.430
 there is a mortal kombat after all 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.949
 or here for example injustice gods him us 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.170
 I'm not talking about a series of fifa games about 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.269
 nhl and other team simulators 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.339
 sports in these genres can not do without 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.960
 second gamepad what could be better 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:48.100
 what to spend the evening with friends for 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.260
 exciting game 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.299
 there is a need to purchase 2 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.460
 controller but original joysticks 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.320
 sony and microsoft are no different 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.239
 affordable prices give two with 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.309
 half a thousand for rare battles with 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.760
 not all are ready for a friend 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.199
 copies look like a logical decision 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.270
 gamepad comes packaged in almost 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.250
 no different from the original for 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.470
 comparison I took a real brand 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.659
 microsoft gamepad which i use is not 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.210
 only with the console but also in games for now 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.430
 our gamepad is wireless so there is 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.170
 battery compartment or battery all 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.510
 logos and labels copied from 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.220
 the highest level of performance if 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.500
 honestly, I donâ€™t really understand what 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.180
 it is different from the original below we 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.730
 see a proprietary connector for 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.010
 headset connection exactly the same as 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.210
 on the joystick microsoft stick stuff 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.070
 pleasant to the touch 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.170
 each has four small 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.510
 protrusion preventing slipping 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.909
 finger sticks move very smoothly without 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.710
 jerks and unpleasant twitches especially 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.810
 This is important in games that require precise 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.050
 control when any wrong move 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.780
 may cost triggers triggers bumpers and 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.150
 buttons also work out with a bang inside 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.130
 gamepad installed original chips 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.799
 microsoft is essentially the most expensive 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.690
 components this is fundamental 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.420
 value as the market is now full 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.479
 joysticks with copies of the chips in this 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.830
 the case is the original so the most important 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.629
 electronic gamepad stuffing on a hundred 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.519
 percent matched products 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:15.099
 microsoft when shaking 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.290
 gamepad it does not rattle but when compressed 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.329
 nothing squeaks so build on 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.579
 height left to check the response 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.260
 control in games I tested the gamepad 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.370
 mercilessly compared speed and accuracy 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.530
 reactions in fast slashers 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.230
 football simulators and fighting games and not 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.269
 where I have no questions 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.190
 xbox 360 gamepad vibration always 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.659
 I liked much more than dual 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.580
 shock from playstation 3 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.129
 vibromotors in it do not pull out the joystick 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.330
 from the hands of the tense moments of the game work 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.400
 soft exactly 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.560
 sometimes the vibration goes smoothly to the left 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.019
 right and so on so here this important 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.849
 the moment is also taken into account in the replica of the difference 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.129
 noticed so the thing is a decent 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.840
 considering the price this is a real find and 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.299
 A great choice for those who want to buy 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.890
 2 gamepad but does not want to pay high 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.079
 price for branded device 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.290
 Good luck to you interesting and enjoyable games 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.290
 shopping
