websites so you have to create a

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.920 
websites so you have to create a
shortcut<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> encoder<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:12.360> then<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
shortcut of the encoder and then in the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.420 
shortcut of the encoder and then in the
target<00:01:13.409> file<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.860> change<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.250> to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
target file you have to change it to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.429 
target file you have to change it to
your<00:01:14.640> song's<00:01:15.000> name<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.659> example<00:01:16.140> one<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
your song's name so example one that the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.710
