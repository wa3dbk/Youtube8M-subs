up to the side of his head because his

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.620 
up to the side of his head because his
head<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:27.229> very<00:01:28.229> long<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.970> can't<00:01:30.240> just<00:01:30.329> go<00:01:30.600> on

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
head is very long so it can't just go on

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.270 
head is very long so it can't just go on
it<00:01:30.930> has<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.140> go<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.320> sideways<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
it has to go in sideways like that and

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.890 
it has to go in sideways like that and
then<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.579> turns<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:34.700> do<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:36.030> accelerator
