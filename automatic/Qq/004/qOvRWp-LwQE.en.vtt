it<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.189> that<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.579> ink<00:03:03.090> area<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.870> exposed<00:03:04.260> you

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
it so that the ink area is exposed you

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.770 
it so that the ink area is exposed you
have<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.040> then<00:03:05.159> place<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.489> cartridge<00:03:05.790> press

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
have to then place the cartridge press

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:23.630 
have to then place the cartridge press
it<00:03:06.959> downwards<00:03:07.409> so<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.040> clip<00:03:08.340> excess<00:03:08.730> into<00:03:08.939> it

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.880 

okay<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:24.600> there's<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.960> next<00:03:25.110> section<00:03:25.500> where

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
okay and there's the next section where

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.400 
okay and there's the next section where
you<00:03:26.010> have<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.280> load<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.300> plain<00:03:27.540> paper<00:03:27.810> so<00:03:28.200> that

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
you have to load the plain paper so that

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.470 
you have to load the plain paper so that
the<00:03:28.770> testing<00:03:29.580> of<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.850> cartridges<00:03:30.240> can<00:03:30.420> be

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
the testing of the cartridges can be

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:40.550 
the testing of the cartridges can be
done<00:03:37.430> once<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.870> white<00:03:39.870> paper<00:03:40.140> is<00:03:40.230> loaded<00:03:40.320> you

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
done once a white paper is loaded you

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.350 
done once a white paper is loaded you
have<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.800> load<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.040> photo<00:03:41.340> paper<00:03:41.670> also<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:42.330> that

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
have to load a photo paper also so that

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.420 
have to load a photo paper also so that
the<00:03:42.660> testing<00:03:42.960> of<00:03:42.990> the<00:03:43.380> color<00:03:43.920> printing<00:03:44.220> is

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
the testing of the color printing is

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.150 
the testing of the color printing is
also<00:03:44.670> done<00:03:44.820> with<00:03:44.850> their<00:03:45.890> way<00:03:46.890> these<00:03:47.010> are

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
also done with their way these are

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.560 
also done with their way these are
one-time<00:03:47.490> installation<00:03:47.760> process<00:03:48.300> it<00:03:48.420> would

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
one-time installation process it would

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.970 
one-time installation process it would
take<00:03:48.750> three<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.020> half<00:03:49.230> minutes<00:03:49.560> around<00:03:49.709> three

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
take three and half minutes around three

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.220 
take three and half minutes around three
to<00:03:50.100> three<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.430> half<00:03:50.580> minutes<00:03:51.020> it<00:03:52.020> took<00:03:52.140> a

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
to three and half minutes it took a

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.850 
to three and half minutes it took a
little<00:03:52.500> earlier<00:03:52.860> like<00:03:53.040> two<00:03:53.280> minutes<00:03:53.400> for<00:03:53.700> us

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
little earlier like two minutes for us

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.230 
little earlier like two minutes for us
then<00:03:55.860> would<00:03:56.070> be<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.250> aligning<00:03:56.610> cartridges

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
then would be the aligning cartridges

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.900 
then would be the aligning cartridges
here<00:03:58.170> is<00:03:58.350> where<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.800> printing<00:03:59.520> of<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.730> paper

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
here is where the printing of the paper

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.420 
here is where the printing of the paper
would<00:04:00.060> be<00:04:00.240> done<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.980> you<00:04:01.980> can<00:04:02.130> judge<00:04:02.370> the

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
would be done and you can judge the

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.699 
would be done and you can judge the
quality<00:04:02.520> of<00:04:02.880> printing<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:03.540> along<00:04:04.410> with<00:04:04.560> that

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
quality of printing and along with that

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.229 
quality of printing and along with that
the<00:04:04.860> cartridges<00:04:05.280> are<00:04:05.430> aligned<00:04:05.730> in<00:04:05.820> a<00:04:05.910> correct

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
the cartridges are aligned in a correct
