00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.539 
the games are in practice you're
probably<00:02:55.930> doing<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.440> move<00:02:56.620> but<00:02:56.890> too<00:02:57.100> close<00:02:57.370> to

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
probably doing the move but too close to

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.759 
probably doing the move but too close to
your<00:02:57.670> body<00:02:57.910> so<00:02:58.810> if<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.019> just<00:02:59.230> keep<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.560> close

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769

it<00:03:06.880> out<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.269> reach<00:03:07.510> of<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:08.200> defender

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090
