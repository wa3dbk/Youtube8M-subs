Hello!! I am Raquel and this is Veganamente.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.560
Today I bring you a recipe that I saw on the internet, very fresh and very light,

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.000
It's a vegetable ceviche.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.580
We're going to need a red pepper cut into cubes, an onion, that I'm going to use a lodging,

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.480
an avocado that we will also cut into cubes, an orange and a lemon, 400 grams of mushrooms

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.320
and I'm going to add chili, although this is optional, a little parsley, a little oil, salt, ground ginger

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.200
and black pepper.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.420
First we clean the mushrooms.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.520
We will use 1/2 half pepper and cut it into small cubes.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.620
I will use only half an onion.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.240
We chopped it very finite.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.320
And we chop the champignon also tiny.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.680
Peel the avocado and cut it into cubes too.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.600
Now I'll pike half a chili.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.800
And now pick the parsley.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.880
We thoroughly remove all the ingredients.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.940
Now that we have mixed the ingredients, I have here the juice of the orange,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.280
Lemon juice and let's season the mixture.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.960
First I'm going to take about 4 tablespoons of orange.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.520
But this is to taste.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.420
About seven tablespoons of lemon,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.500
1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.640
a little bit of salt.,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.060
ground black pepper

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.100
and oil.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.080
and we stir well

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.400
This we let it marinate about 30 minutes, more or less, before eating it.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.380
Veganízate!!
