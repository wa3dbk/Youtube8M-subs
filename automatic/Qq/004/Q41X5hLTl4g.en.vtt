00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.420 
without detection and then power since
it's<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.690> workout<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.530> know<00:02:20.650> use<00:02:20.920> your<00:02:20.950> video

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
it's a workout you know use your video

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.340 
it's a workout you know use your video
you<00:02:22.150> would<00:02:22.240> think<00:02:22.450> power<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.990> all<00:02:23.140> about

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
you would think power is all about

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.990 
you would think power is all about
physical<00:02:23.920> appearance<00:02:24.520> what's<00:02:24.790> on<00:02:24.910> the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
physical appearance what's on the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.850 
physical appearance what's on the
outside<00:02:25.030> but<00:02:25.660> it's<00:02:26.080> more<00:02:26.350> about<00:02:26.470> what's<00:02:26.770> on

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
outside but it's more about what's on

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.500 
outside but it's more about what's on
the<00:02:26.950> inside<00:02:27.160> because<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:27.790> can't<00:02:28.000> obtain

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
the inside because you can't obtain

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.120 
the inside because you can't obtain
something<00:02:29.080> on<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.440> outside<00:02:29.800> if<00:02:29.890> you<00:02:29.980> don't

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
something on the outside if you don't

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.580 
something on the outside if you don't
first<00:02:30.400> think<00:02:30.640> in<00:02:30.760> here<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.420> that's<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.470> big

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
first think in here and that's a big

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.440 
first think in here and that's a big
part<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.100> because<00:02:33.730> how<00:02:33.880> powerful<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.420> are

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
part of it because how powerful you are

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.030 
part of it because how powerful you are
on<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.750> inside<00:02:34.780> is<00:02:35.260> what<00:02:35.530> shows<00:02:35.770> on<00:02:35.950> the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
on the inside is what shows on the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.270 
on the inside is what shows on the
outside

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.580 

really<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:40.970> think<00:02:41.090> everybody<00:02:41.660> should<00:02:41.750> but

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
really I think everybody should but

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.630 
really I think everybody should but
strong<00:02:42.980> women<00:02:43.340> are<00:02:43.459> beautiful<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:45.640> really
