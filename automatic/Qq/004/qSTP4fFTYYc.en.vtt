00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.130 
changing brushes i'm using a smaller
brush<00:03:15.459> so<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:15.760> have<00:03:16.000> more<00:03:16.180> precision<00:03:16.600> but<00:03:17.020> I'm

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
brush so I have more precision but I'm

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.540
