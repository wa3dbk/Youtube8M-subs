and four because you know on both good

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.210 
and four because you know on both good
 I<00:04:40.360> think<00:04:41.080> if<00:04:41.320> you<00:04:41.500> have<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.770> end<00:04:41.920> as

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
 I think if you have the end as

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.940 
 I think if you have the end as
first<00:04:42.850> doesn't<00:04:43.270> matter<00:04:43.420> here<00:04:44.140> do<00:04:44.530> is<00:04:44.650> a

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
first doesn't matter here do is a

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.560 
first doesn't matter here do is a
lot<00:04:45.250> of<00:04:45.370> pressure<00:04:45.640> you<00:04:45.970> have<00:04:46.000> a<00:04:46.300> lot<00:04:46.540> of

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
lot of pressure you have a lot of

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.440 
lot of pressure you have a lot of
drapeau<00:04:47.110> in<00:04:47.230> the<00:04:47.350> stack<00:04:47.590> so<00:04:48.370> if<00:04:49.000> you<00:04:49.120> get<00:04:49.270> the

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
drapeau in the stack so if you get the

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.500 
drapeau in the stack so if you get the
end<00:04:49.600> if<00:04:50.290> you<00:04:50.470> get<00:04:50.770> it<00:04:50.920> first<00:04:51.100> down<00:04:51.460> list<00:04:51.790> you

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
end if you get it first down list you

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.640 
end if you get it first down list you
prefer<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:52.960> write<00:04:53.080> down<00:04:53.260> force<00:04:53.470> of<00:04:53.560> a

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
prefer to write down force of a

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.320 
prefer to write down force of a
dauntless<00:04:53.980> that's<00:04:54.370> why<00:04:54.550> I<00:04:54.580> play<00:04:54.910> a<00:04:54.940> lot<00:04:55.210> of

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
dauntless that's why I play a lot of

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.940 
dauntless that's why I play a lot of
dropper<00:04:55.690> once<00:04:55.900> so<00:04:56.080> that<00:04:56.110> I<00:04:56.260> can<00:04:56.380> get<00:04:56.650> into<00:04:56.920> the

dropper once so that I can get into the

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.830 
dropper once so that I can get into the
second<00:04:57.340> part<00:04:57.520> list<00:04:57.760> to<00:04:57.910> break<00:04:58.120> my<00:04:58.300> counters<00:04:58.690> /

with<00:05:20.650> the<00:05:21.010> end<00:05:21.310> instead<00:05:21.880> of<00:05:22.180> using<00:05:22.300> dollars<00:05:22.720> is

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
with the end instead of using dollars is

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.630 
with the end instead of using dollars is
very<00:05:23.050> quite<00:05:23.230> skill<00:05:23.530> you<00:05:23.650> tend<00:05:23.860> to<00:05:23.980> use<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.490> end

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
very quite skill you tend to use the end

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.659 
very quite skill you tend to use the end
skill<00:05:25.000> yes<00:05:25.420> because<00:05:26.050> dauntless<00:05:26.830> is<00:05:27.190> pretty

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
skill yes because dauntless is pretty

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.850 
skill yes because dauntless is pretty
much<00:05:27.790> minus<00:05:28.450> and<00:05:28.690> everybody<00:05:29.140> knows<00:05:29.350> that<00:05:29.380> the

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
much minus and everybody knows that the

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.480 
much minus and everybody knows that the
second<00:05:30.430> attack<00:05:30.669> of<00:05:31.320> countless<00:05:32.370> dn20<00:05:33.370> and

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
second attack of countless dn20 and

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.180 
second attack of countless dn20 and
swinging<00:05:33.970> he<00:05:34.510> doesn't<00:05:34.870> go<00:05:34.990> true<00:05:35.500> because<00:05:36.010> the

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
swinging he doesn't go true because the

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.890 
swinging he doesn't go true because the
point<00:05:36.370> is<00:05:36.490> keeping<00:05:36.850> the<00:05:37.000> perfect<00:05:37.419> shield<00:05:37.750> for

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
point is keeping the perfect shield for

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.470 
point is keeping the perfect shield for
the<00:05:37.960> second<00:05:38.350> attack<00:05:38.590> so<00:05:39.370> when<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.270> first

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
the second attack so when the first

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.320 
the second attack so when the first
attacks<00:05:40.780> hits<00:05:41.050> I<00:05:41.230> use<00:05:41.650> immediately<00:05:42.400> and<00:05:42.970> skill

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
attacks hits I use immediately and skill

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.960 
attacks hits I use immediately and skill
so<00:05:43.660> I<00:05:43.690> just<00:05:44.080> do<00:05:44.260> discard<00:05:45.130> one<00:05:45.310> card<00:05:45.340> and<00:05:45.730> I<00:05:45.820> got

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
so I just do discard one card and I got

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.400 
so I just do discard one card and I got
a<00:05:46.000> twin<00:05:46.270> drive<00:05:46.480> so<00:05:46.690> I<00:05:46.720> make<00:05:46.960> plus<00:05:47.169> one

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
a twin drive so I make plus one

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.800 
a twin drive so I make plus one
basically<00:05:47.919> so<00:05:48.220> that<00:05:48.669> turn<00:05:48.880> I<00:05:49.060> got<00:05:49.240> three<00:05:49.390> cards

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
basically so that turn I got three cards

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.659 
basically so that turn I got three cards
and<00:05:49.990> if<00:05:50.260> I<00:05:50.380> would<00:05:50.530> use<00:05:50.800> doubtless<00:05:51.250> skill<00:05:51.490> I

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
and if I would use doubtless skill I

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.640 
and if I would use doubtless skill I
would<00:05:52.120> get<00:05:52.300> lost<00:05:52.480> two<00:05:52.720> cards<00:05:53.080> and<00:05:53.140> only<00:05:53.500> got

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
would get lost two cards and only got

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.850 
would get lost two cards and only got
one<00:05:53.919> card<00:05:54.220> plus<00:05:54.910> in<00:05:55.150> distr<00:05:55.570> so<00:05:55.930> that's<00:05:56.680> why

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
one card plus in distr so that's why

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.990 
one card plus in distr so that's why
first<00:05:57.730> using<00:05:58.060> ATMs<00:05:58.570> I'm<00:05:59.040> not<00:06:00.040> using<00:06:00.340> it<00:06:00.580> the

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
first using ATMs I'm not using it the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.780 
first using ATMs I'm not using it the
second<00:06:01.390> attack<00:06:01.690> because<00:06:01.990> the<00:06:02.080> second<00:06:02.350> attack

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
second attack because the second attack

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.690 
second attack because the second attack
