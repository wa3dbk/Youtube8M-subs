00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.660
 some Emperor biscuits flavored with cream 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.090
 nut that brings the promotion of the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.000
 kids jumpers here we see the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.280
 image of the child that I love is what 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.509
 more I liked the promotional 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.000
 of the kids 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.400
 this child figure a dress a 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.560
 guard this and by manu let's see here 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.199
 as we have seen in other videos by 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.539
 one side comes the mention of the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.080
 jumpers there are what are we 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.430
 they come out here in these cookies the table and 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.290
 on the other side he tells us that he can 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.170
 leave a coupon redeemable for any of 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.989
 these keychains that come here the coupon 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.660
 plus 13 pesos is how you can have one of 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.600
 these keychains and well let's go to 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.149
 open these cookies 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.800
 I hope that now we have luck and we 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.079
 get a coupon redeemable so that 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.239
 you know him 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.289
 and if not then at least it is a jumper 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.289
 that is not repeated 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.690
 fortunately in this promotion of the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.600
 children's table we have not had the 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:10.090
 problem that comes out of the cookies or 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:13.860
 the chips without stamps or without jumpers 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.840
 then that is a positive point and here 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.119
 I 've seen around here jumper that I 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.740
 Give a master only bring one if 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.479

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.159

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.509
 and this is a million with a guitar and 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.210
 on the other side 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.330

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.560
 very father of this mini a dress of 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.289
 dracula I liked it pretty much until now 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.509
 I liked the designs of the children 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.850
 they are very much carried by people who do not 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.289
 they end up convincing as opposed to 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.240
 the strokes that is so true 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.759

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.660
