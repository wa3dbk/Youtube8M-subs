00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.710
 oven 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.120
 you asked me if there were any that 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.820
 existed without an oven because there are people who 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.679
 does not have and if you have a yearning from 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.300
 many years ago and has taken advantage of 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.679
 to make video recipe of it 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.349
 to prepare a cheesecake 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:27.539
 We need the following ingredients 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.759
 25 breakfast type cookies 100 grams of 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.189

 grams of strawberry jam or 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.600
 raspberry 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.750
 It's super simple cookie layer 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.010
 crushed 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.770
 I in this case I will add some 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.040
 few nuts a hazelnut for 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.550
 give that different dot to the cookie 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.870
 cream cheese we have whipped the cream 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.760
 we have the cream cheese here and you 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.090
 let's give a little bit of gelatin to 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.490
 that the refrigerator stays perfect and for 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.990
 finish a raspberry jam that 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.990
 we will also meet with a little bit of 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.499
 gelatin to make it perfect and that 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.829
 is for us to expand but not 

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:23.810
 let us go in the afternoon first thing the 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.270
 cookies for inside let's make a 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.950
 thick just base but each one new 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.259
 I do at home as I want 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.689
 we take advantage to hydrate the gelatin 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:37.119
 in water previously that we have heated 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.119
 in the micro we eat well 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.900
 we gave him the whole cookie here 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.680
 we have melted butter in the micro 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.710
 to make it easy after you stay 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.840
 this all the hard part with the hands 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.570
 that we have washed the ones that do not see everything 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.790
 to gather the cookie the dried fruit with 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.980
 the butter with the help of fingers 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.410
 we are pressing to cover all the 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.020
 surface of the pie and this is going to go to 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.390
 the minimum minimum refrigerator half an hour 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.750
 we already have a refrigerator cooling what 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.640
 is the base of the cookie we are going to add 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.020
 the cream of cheese 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.020
 and we beat with the gelatin 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:30.420
 is well beaten and now finally the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.940
 cream and we put all the cream together very well 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.150
 well, a half hour has passed 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.390
 already what is the perfect base you see that 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.760
 nothing is moving here and we add what 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.770
 is the cream on top of the base of the 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.380
 diet and now have to go again to the 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.230
 fridge but in this case minimum minimum 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.840
 minimum three hours so within three 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.970
 hours we continue with this cake the raisin 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.459
 flying that you're in a plis-plas and 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.060
 we already have the perfect cake 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.550
 You see, it's super curdled and we added 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.000
 our favorite raspberry jam 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.100
 a little hot water with more 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.370
 gelatin with two leaves is going to 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.549
 pour over and that's going to give you the 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.720
 contrast a bit acid with the sweet of the 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.560
 cheese just enough to be above 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.170
 we do not want to spend either 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.720
 and again to the fridge but on average 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.300
 an hour would already be there and we have the 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.680
 Classic cheese cake is not so easy 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.140
 like the other day but it's pretty 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.690
 simple you can make it from kiwi to son 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.819
 of even with applesauce the one 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.800
 fruit that you like well then 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.380
 This is one of the tarts that I like the most 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.410
 in the blog, encourage you with her I assure you 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.230
 that is yummy and see you the 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:51.060
 next week with another candy store or 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.540
 something salty this for inside 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.750
 one 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.750
 Well, I'm still here 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.439
 two
