00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:07.430
 is it possible to keep youth if yes then 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.650
 how best to do this we turned to 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.440
 Alexander Nazarov wrote 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.240
 book on how to slow down aging 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.650
 hello good afternoon good afternoon 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.600
 alexander alekseevich 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.020
 do you really know how it can be 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.830
 make it seems to me know for this 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.980
 it is necessary from childhood to drink 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.420
 correct water 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.270
 perhaps confirmation of this will be 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.370
 serve what in europe in schools 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.539
 interrupt classes for children 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.690
 under the supervision of a teacher drank water 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:44.120
 what does it mean on time it means for 15-20 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.109
 minutes to eat drink mineral water 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.960
 drinking 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:52.300
 half an hour before and after a half two hours 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.469
 after eating what means to the right 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.690
 mineral water must contain 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.589
 scarce vital macro and 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.809
 trace elements 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.319
 they speed up the digestion process 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.820
 into energy billions of times and allow out 

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:07.640
 the same amount of food 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.490
 get more energy thanks to this 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.220
 energy we live and A. 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.010
 why water why not oxygen 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.500
 or for example and yes well for consumption 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.950
 oxygen we can not affect it or 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.950
 eat or not without food we can live 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.880
 up to 40 days and only 57 children without water 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.240
 two or three days water is more important than food 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.850
 without water and neither tudes nor syudy nor tudes and 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.370
 neither syudy deficit of 2-3 percent 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.170
 leads our brain to worse 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.240
 eight percent start hallucinations 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.330
 10 percent coma 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.270
 just over 12 percent and comes 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.230
 fatal 12 percent deficit 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.640
 water up 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:55.340
 how to explain blood thickens it badly 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.450
 flows through the capillaries to our cell 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.610
 cell don't get nutrients 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.240
 the extracellular space is acidified we 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:09.259
 start getting sick and in israel 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.979
 for example the first question at the doctor 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.260
 and how much water is in 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.760
 you drink by what parameters you need 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.810
 choose water to 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.549
 activate 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.010
 digestion is what I owe 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:23.159
 be kept must follow that 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.860
 so that in this water was as little as possible 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:28.920
 sodium chlorine here sodium chlorine is salt 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.920
 only with the food we daily 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.930
 we get 3 4 daily norms of salt 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.450
 it is necessary that in this mineral water 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.480
 were scarce vital 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.269
 macro and microelements 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.110
 here you have on the table mineral 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:49.109
 water is sulin to which is 10 of 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.000
 10 chemical elements for beauty and 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.180
 longevity so in this water so and 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.340
 call water beauty and longevity if 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.500
 start to drink that kind of water then they 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.440
 skin will split and fall out 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.290
 will be supple and velvety yet it is water 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.750
 contains magnesium which will allow us to 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.329
 Generally not gain fat keep slim 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.910
 mineral water holds this figure 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.079
 the digestive process of the intestine and a half 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.139
 two hours and 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.840
 up to 25 percent of the food passes by and 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:21.060
 digested even this water contains 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.010
 a large amount of bicarbonate hcl 3 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.340
 intestinal bicarbonate significantly 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.940
 increases the amount of hormones one of 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.790
 theories of aging says that with 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.940
 hormone deficiency we start to hurt and 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.349
 grow old still contains a lot of water 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.319
 amount of silicon 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.989
 it is called the element of youth and 13 of 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.630
 15 vital macro and micro 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.599
 elements so that water from Lenca will help 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.790
 we keep our youth a little 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.590
 Arsenovich and what water is better to drink 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.629
 after eating why actually 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.790
 it is necessary to do this in one and a half two 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.200
 an hour after eating drink a glass of drinking 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.989
 water our cage 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.669
 during this time has developed a large 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.819
 amount of energy and found out 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:08.579
 and brought into the extracellular space 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:12.389
 harmful substances from there they can 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:14.609
 bring out only water to penetrate 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:17.729
 intercellular space can only 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:20.700
 active energy saturated water here 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:23.800
 such as it is represented in our water 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.409
 light activated fullerene she 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.479
 entering the blood activates the processes 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:32.259
 occurring in our body and 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:34.150
 since close to our to our water 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:37.150
 the body quickly enters 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.060
 extracellular space removes 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.030
 harmful substances 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.110
 improves the ecology of our body 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.319
 allows the cell to produce more 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.080
 energy and that allows us in general 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:51.789
 stay healthy that is it turns out 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.250
 in order to keep youth 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.620
 need to drink water and thereby 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:01.530
 create good working conditions 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:04.150
 of our cells yes and there was such a scientist 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.360
 Nobel Prize winner Alexei 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.270
 rather, who claimed that the cell 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.969
 can live forever the process of degeneration 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.060
 exposed only liquid which they 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:17.530
 swim that is in our case 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.530
 interstitial fluid today already 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.469
 found and cells whose age is 3 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:27.909
 million years in experiments with 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:29.979
 animals using water and olive 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:33.270
 oil activating or rename succeeded 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:37.330
 extend their life more than twice 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.279
 while they lived for a long time without aging 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.250
 after they stopped giving 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:45.639
 fullerene their aging was very 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.610
 slow and if we consider our water 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:53.250
 light activated fullerene me to 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.969
 in experiments showed that activity 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.490
 our body 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:00.449
 already 2 minutes after drinking a glass 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.789
 this water increases by 20 percent 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.340
 fits entropy that is chaotic 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:09.190
 the work of our body in this way 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.400
 it may happen that the water is light 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:15.909
 help us get more energy and 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.430
 it is possible to extend our life in any 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:20.949
 the case of the animals can be turned 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.090
 should try thank you so much 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:25.870
 alexander alekseevich 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:28.139
 thank you all time a woman was 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.180
 tend to hide your age 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:33.100
 today it is possible to preserve youth 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.710
 plastic surgery assistance 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.290
 anti-aging creams and various 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:41.020
 cosmetology procedures but one 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.800
 the recipe remains the same smile 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:47.140
 healthy eating and active lifestyle 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.360
 With you there was a program doctor and see 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.870
 us on weekdays on that center's channel not 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.870
 be ill
