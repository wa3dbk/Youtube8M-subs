00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
so quite self-explanatory but this part

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.890 
so quite self-explanatory but this part
is<00:02:41.220> kind<00:02:41.520> of<00:02:41.700> like<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.270> smart<00:02:42.570> moving<00:02:42.750> mod

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
is kind of like the smart moving mod

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.660 
is kind of like the smart moving mod
allows<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.530> climb<00:02:43.800> walls<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.340> basically

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
allows you to climb walls so basically

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.760 
allows you to climb walls so basically
what<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:44.940> do<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.180> once<00:02:45.930> again<00:02:46.050> poke<00:02:46.590> your

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
what you do is once again poke your

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.200 
what you do is once again poke your
pee-pee<00:02:47.700> against<00:02:49.160> against<00:02:50.160> either<00:02:50.430> iron<00:02:50.790> bars

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
pee-pee against against either iron bars

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.510 
pee-pee against against either iron bars
or<00:02:51.450> fences<00:02:51.990> and<00:02:52.230> press<00:02:52.470> C<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:52.950> you'll<00:02:53.070> be<00:02:53.280> able

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
or fences and press C and you'll be able

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.270 
or fences and press C and you'll be able
to<00:02:53.730> climb<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.600> now<00:02:54.750> this<00:02:54.960> is<00:02:55.140> really<00:02:55.350> just<00:02:55.860> sort

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
to climb it now this is really just sort

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.300 
to climb it now this is really just sort
of<00:02:56.370> based<00:02:56.580> off<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.940> smart<00:02:57.390> moving<00:02:57.690> idea

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
of based off the smart moving idea

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.310 
of based off the smart moving idea
easier<00:02:59.310> stuff<00:03:00.060> except<00:03:00.450> it's<00:03:00.630> ninja<00:03:00.930> themed

night vision here is that we can
actually<00:03:52.310> go<00:03:53.310> into<00:03:53.550> slow<00:03:54.300> motion<00:03:54.330> mode<00:03:55.110> and

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
actually go into slow motion mode and

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.740 
actually go into slow motion mode and
basically<00:03:55.710> just<00:03:56.370> hold<00:03:56.670> caps<00:03:57.090> down<00:03:57.390> as<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.660> can

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
basically just hold caps down as you can

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
see i'm falling bubbles really slow now

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.330 
see i'm falling bubbles really slow now
i'm<00:04:00.060> moving<00:04:00.480> really<00:04:00.630> slow<00:04:01.020> now<00:04:01.290> however<00:04:01.980> i<00:04:02.190> can

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
i'm moving really slow now however i can

i'm moving really slow now however i can
swing<00:04:02.580> my<00:04:02.610> cursor<00:04:03.060> at<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.180> spain<00:04:03.480> same<00:04:03.900> speed

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
swing my cursor at the spain same speed

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.080 
swing my cursor at the spain same speed
and<00:04:04.500> this<00:04:04.860> is<00:04:04.950> actually<00:04:05.100> one<00:04:05.490> fourth<00:04:05.850> of<00:04:06.030> the

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
and this is actually one fourth of the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.390 
and this is actually one fourth of the
original<00:04:06.720> speed<00:04:07.020> so<00:04:07.260> if<00:04:07.350> i<00:04:07.440> go<00:04:07.470> with<00:04:07.710> and<00:04:07.860> hit

original speed so if i go with and hit
this<00:04:08.550> creeper<00:04:09.000> here<00:04:09.360> look<00:04:09.720> at<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:10.110> look<00:04:10.320> at

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
this creeper here look at that look at

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.220 
this creeper here look at that look at
that<00:04:10.680> look<00:04:10.710> at<00:04:11.580> how<00:04:11.730> slow<00:04:12.090> we<00:04:12.120> all<00:04:12.480> are<00:04:12.780> we<00:04:13.020> are

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
that look at how slow we all are we are

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.640 
that look at how slow we all are we are
we<00:04:13.590> are<00:04:14.130> all<00:04:14.310> slow<00:04:15.270> so<00:04:15.810> as<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:16.260> can<00:04:16.320> see<00:04:16.500> I've

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
we are all slow so as you can see I've

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.130 
we are all slow so as you can see I've
just<00:04:16.830> slayed<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.130> creeper<00:04:17.870> still<00:04:18.870> quite

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
just slayed that creeper still quite

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.130 
just slayed that creeper still quite
slow<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.680> basically<00:04:19.950> this<00:04:20.250> doesn't<00:04:21.140> this

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
slow and basically this doesn't this

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.110 
slow and basically this doesn't this
kind<00:04:22.650> is<00:04:22.770> your<00:04:22.980> movement<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.610> however<00:04:24.030> it

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
kind is your movement to however it

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.050 
kind is your movement to however it
doesn't

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
doesn't

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.540 
doesn't
wherever<00:04:25.540> you<00:04:25.690> look<00:04:25.960> at<00:04:26.200> so<00:04:26.380> you<00:04:26.440> you<00:04:27.040> do<00:04:27.310> move

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
wherever you look at so you you do move

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.510 
wherever you look at so you you do move
at<00:04:27.790> a<00:04:27.820> slower<00:04:28.120> pace<00:04:28.389> as<00:04:28.900> well<00:04:29.380> but<00:04:30.040> the

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
at a slower pace as well but the

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.550 
at a slower pace as well but the
advantage<00:04:30.970> we<00:04:31.270> have<00:04:31.450> here<00:04:31.900> is<00:04:32.050> that<00:04:32.200> we<00:04:32.380> can

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
advantage we have here is that we can

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.830 
advantage we have here is that we can
swing<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.070> cursor<00:04:33.400> really<00:04:33.610> fast<00:04:33.880> so<00:04:34.180> if<00:04:34.660> I<00:04:34.810> go

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
swing the cursor really fast so if I go

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.370 
swing the cursor really fast so if I go
and<00:04:35.260> do<00:04:35.470> that<00:04:35.500> again<00:04:36.450> slow<00:04:37.450> motion<00:04:37.780> we<00:04:38.200> can

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
and do that again slow motion we can

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.250 
and do that again slow motion we can
actually<00:04:38.530> do<00:04:38.800> that<00:04:38.950> wall<00:04:39.700> climbing<00:04:40.000> move<00:04:40.450> jump

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
actually do that wall climbing move jump

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.430 
actually do that wall climbing move jump
up<00:04:41.500> look<00:04:41.950> the<00:04:42.160> other<00:04:42.190> way<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:42.930> hop<00:04:43.930> on<00:04:44.169> so

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
up look the other way and hop on so

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.860 
up look the other way and hop on so
that's<00:04:44.620> really<00:04:45.130> really<00:04:45.430> cool<00:04:45.490> we<00:04:46.480> can<00:04:46.600> do<00:04:46.720> all

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
that's really really cool we can do all

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.890 
that's really really cool we can do all
sorts<00:04:46.900> of<00:04:47.260> parkour<00:04:47.800> stuff<00:04:48.190> with<00:04:48.400> this<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:48.970> so

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
sorts of parkour stuff with this and so

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.980 
sorts of parkour stuff with this and so
