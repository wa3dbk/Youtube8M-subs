00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.260 
to as by its correct name because there
haven't<00:01:37.979> thought<00:01:38.280> up<00:01:38.430> some<00:01:38.640> stupid<00:01:38.970> name<00:01:39.090> for

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
haven't thought up some stupid name for

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.120 
haven't thought up some stupid name for
it<00:01:39.360> yet<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:40.079> captive<00:01:40.439> bead<00:01:40.590> ring<00:01:40.799> there<00:01:40.950> also

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
it yet so captive bead ring there also

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.639 
it yet so captive bead ring there also
segment<00:01:41.880> rings<00:01:42.180> which<00:01:42.990> are<00:01:43.200> pretty<00:01:43.470> much<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
segment rings which are pretty much the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.230 
segment rings which are pretty much the
same<00:01:43.770> principle<00:01:44.340> as<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> captive<00:01:44.850> bead<00:01:45.030> ring

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
same principle as a captive bead ring

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.639 
same principle as a captive bead ring
but<00:01:45.420> instead<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> bead<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.200> an<00:01:46.409> actual

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
but instead of a bead is an actual

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.990 
but instead of a bead is an actual
segment<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.310> ring<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.700> looks<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:47.909> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
segment of the ring so it looks like a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.350 
segment of the ring so it looks like a
continuous<00:01:48.270> loop<00:01:49.170> without<00:01:49.680> any<00:01:50.360> interference

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
continuous loop without any interference

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.870 
continuous loop without any interference
