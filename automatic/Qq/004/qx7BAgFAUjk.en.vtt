00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
that and then on another thing is when

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.530 
that and then on another thing is when
you<00:01:36.360> feed<00:01:36.630> them<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.460> have<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.670> use<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
you feed them you have to use the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.649 
you feed them you have to use the
special<00:01:40.259> kind<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.590> powder<00:01:41.180> well<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.479> can

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
special kind of powder well you can

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.219 
special kind of powder well you can
really<00:01:42.960> use<00:01:43.200> any<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.979> calcium<00:01:44.909> powder<00:01:45.229> but
