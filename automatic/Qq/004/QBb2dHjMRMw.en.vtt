diesel switch rod balanced out fit it it
was<00:00:43.120> an<00:00:43.239> awesome<00:00:43.420> experience<00:00:43.690> to<00:00:44.019> be<00:00:44.170> able<00:00:44.260> to

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
was an awesome experience to be able to

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:50.600 
was an awesome experience to be able to
design<00:00:45.129> the<00:00:45.309> one<00:00:45.699> rod<00:00:45.940> that<00:00:46.239> does<00:00:46.420> it<00:00:46.540> all

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.860 

the<00:00:51.610> red<00:00:51.760> truck<00:00:51.940> diesel<00:00:52.270> switch<00:00:52.480> rod<00:00:52.690> is<00:00:52.840> a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
the red truck diesel switch rod is a

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.770 
the red truck diesel switch rod is a
seven<00:00:53.410> weight<00:00:53.590> 11<00:00:53.950> foot<00:00:54.190> rod<00:00:54.400> we<00:00:55.330> chose<00:00:55.600> this

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
seven weight 11 foot rod we chose this

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.000 
seven weight 11 foot rod we chose this
length<00:00:56.050> and<00:00:56.200> weight<00:00:56.320> because<00:00:56.620> it's<00:00:56.770> the<00:00:56.890> best

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
length and weight because it's the best

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.950 
length and weight because it's the best
to<00:00:57.190> do<00:00:57.310> all<00:00:57.520> the<00:00:57.640> different<00:00:57.760> techniques<00:00:58.300> to

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
to do all the different techniques to

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.510 
to do all the different techniques to
catch<00:00:59.110> steel<00:00:59.410> it<00:00:59.560> you<00:01:00.040> know<00:01:00.130> I<00:01:00.190> think<00:01:00.250> there's

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
catch steel it you know I think there's

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.590 
catch steel it you know I think there's
some<00:01:00.640> confusion<00:01:00.820> out<00:01:01.180> there<00:01:01.330> on<00:01:01.420> what<00:01:01.570> a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
some confusion out there on what a

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.310 
some confusion out there on what a
switch<00:01:01.870> rod<00:01:02.080> is<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:03.190> I<00:01:03.610> think<00:01:04.210> it's<00:01:04.570> best<00:01:04.960> used

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
switch rod is and I think it's best used

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.620 
switch rod is and I think it's best used
as<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.530> compact<00:01:06.010> spirit<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:07.120> shorter<00:01:07.450> length

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
as a compact spirit the shorter length

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.080 
as a compact spirit the shorter length
allows<00:01:07.990> you<00:01:08.170> to<00:01:08.290> land<00:01:08.920> a<00:01:09.040> fish<00:01:09.220> much<00:01:09.430> easier<00:01:09.820> so

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
allows you to land a fish much easier so

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.969 
allows you to land a fish much easier so
with<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:10.420> spay<00:01:10.780> rod<00:01:11.020> and<00:01:11.470> a<00:01:11.530> lot<00:01:11.710> of<00:01:11.740> times<00:01:11.890> I

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
with a spay rod and a lot of times I

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.650 
with a spay rod and a lot of times I
have<00:01:12.100> to<00:01:12.160> have<00:01:12.250> my<00:01:12.400> brother<00:01:12.940> my<00:01:13.150> buddy<00:01:13.360> helped

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
have to have my brother my buddy helped

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.300 
have to have my brother my buddy helped
me<00:01:13.750> land<00:01:14.050> it<00:01:14.229> or<00:01:14.380> Beach<00:01:14.650> it<00:01:14.890> or<00:01:15.010> something<00:01:15.280> like

that<00:01:15.460> with<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:16.060> switch<00:01:16.479> rod<00:01:16.690> I<00:01:16.930> can<00:01:17.110> land<00:01:17.229> it

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
that with a switch rod I can land it

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.080 
that with a switch rod I can land it
just<00:01:17.410> like<00:01:17.770> you<00:01:18.190> know<00:01:18.280> a<00:01:18.310> single<00:01:18.640> hand<00:01:18.790> rod<00:01:18.940> you

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
just like you know a single hand rod you

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.120 
just like you know a single hand rod you
know<00:01:19.120> tip<00:01:19.479> way<00:01:19.690> up<00:01:19.900> bring<00:01:20.200> it<00:01:20.290> back<00:01:20.500> land<00:01:20.979> my

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
know tip way up bring it back land my

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.180 
know tip way up bring it back land my
fish<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.500> there's<00:01:23.680> there's<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:23.979> lot<00:01:24.009> of

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
fish so there's there's a lot of

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.440 
fish so there's there's a lot of
different<00:01:24.430> things<00:01:24.490> I<00:01:24.640> like<00:01:24.820> about<00:01:24.850> this<00:01:25.210> rod

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
different things I like about this rod

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.480 
different things I like about this rod
the<00:01:25.810> rods<00:01:26.020> are<00:01:26.110> incredibly<00:01:26.560> durable<00:01:26.860> with<00:01:27.310> the

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
the rods are incredibly durable with the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.150 
the rods are incredibly durable with the
the<00:01:27.700> snake<00:01:27.940> belly<00:01:28.180> finish<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:29.470> quality<00:01:30.040> of

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
the snake belly finish the quality of

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.770 
the snake belly finish the quality of
everything<00:01:30.670> is<00:01:30.790> great<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.210> cork<00:01:31.540> the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
everything is great the cork the

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.530 
everything is great the cork the
components<00:01:32.410> that's<00:01:32.770> all<00:01:32.950> awesome<00:01:33.400> but<00:01:33.970> what

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
components that's all awesome but what

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.300 
components that's all awesome but what
really<00:01:34.720> comes<00:01:35.080> to<00:01:35.440> play<00:01:35.590> for<00:01:35.800> me<00:01:35.890> here<00:01:36.100> is<00:01:36.280> the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
really comes to play for me here is the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.340 
really comes to play for me here is the
little<00:01:36.670> things<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.390> ferals<00:01:37.750> for<00:01:37.930> example

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
little things the ferals for example

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.440 
little things the ferals for example
they're<00:01:38.740> not<00:01:38.890> painted<00:01:39.369> they're<00:01:39.790> sanded<00:01:40.270> so

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
they're not painted they're sanded so

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.600 
they're not painted they're sanded so
there's<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.690> lot<00:01:40.869> more<00:01:41.020> friction<00:01:41.350> most<00:01:42.190> common

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
there's a lot more friction most common

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.760 
there's a lot more friction most common
brake<00:01:42.790> and<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.030> spay<00:01:43.270> rod<00:01:43.479> is<00:01:43.690> is<00:01:44.020> these<00:01:44.470> ferals

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
brake and a spay rod is is these ferals

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.900 
brake and a spay rod is is these ferals
start<00:01:44.979> to<00:01:45.070> wiggle<00:01:45.220> loose<00:01:45.430> from<00:01:45.640> all<00:01:45.759> that

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
start to wiggle loose from all that

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.930 
start to wiggle loose from all that
different<00:01:46.360> you<00:01:46.720> know<00:01:47.100> rotational<00:01:48.100> torsion

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
different you know rotational torsion

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.130 
different you know rotational torsion
and<00:01:49.119> all<00:01:49.210> this<00:01:49.360> stuff<00:01:49.479> though<00:01:49.750> they'll<00:01:49.960> work

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
and all this stuff though they'll work

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.050 
and all this stuff though they'll work
their<00:01:50.170> way<00:01:50.410> loose<00:01:50.619> and<00:01:50.860> then<00:01:51.130> they'll<00:01:51.880> break

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
their way loose and then they'll break

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.450 
their way loose and then they'll break
and<00:01:52.360> so<00:01:52.780> we<00:01:53.680> said<00:01:53.830> well<00:01:53.860> what<00:01:54.040> if<00:01:54.159> we<00:01:54.250> didn't

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
and so we said well what if we didn't

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.980 
and so we said well what if we didn't
what<00:01:54.580> if<00:01:54.670> we<00:01:54.760> didn't<00:01:54.970> paint<00:01:55.150> them<00:01:55.299> and<00:01:55.510> and<00:01:55.659> we

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
what if we didn't paint them and and we

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.990 
what if we didn't paint them and and we
did<00:01:56.170> that<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.560> our<00:01:57.220> Farrell's<00:01:57.580> never<00:01:57.760> came

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
did that and our Farrell's never came

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.120 
did that and our Farrell's never came
loose<00:01:58.150> so<00:01:58.810> that's<00:01:59.200> it's<00:01:59.440> one<00:01:59.680> really<00:02:00.010> nice

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130
