00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.809
 in the netherlands there were around seven and a half million cars around 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.939
 for the most part, the dodo steer as the movie come 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.729
 But something special is going on with some 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:20.349
 a car means freedom to go where you want and when you want 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:21.699
 that does not apply to everyone 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.039
 Some people have a disability and can only go with a modified car 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.829
 stay nice and mobile 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.269
 slowness of a lot further 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.380
 I can independently overpriced dinner 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.540
 I live independently 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.960
 but the pastor I like a lot 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.059
 a car from a Christian so adjusted 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.059
 that he can take a seat with a wheelchair and already behind the wheel 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.420
 after the seat snaps on from intergas and braking 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.490
 with his hand 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.110
 the switch to this system from the very simple that was actually 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.930
 learned so 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.440
 that claim to be 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.880
 but we have grown up 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.940
 i'm mostly on her editors 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.940
 the statement that citizens respond themselves 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.990
 Fortunately, this group of people is over the attention of a much more difficult one 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.290
 example has been taken 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.250
 they have a special Adam Pearson program 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.610
 It is very much taken into account for the development of new models 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.640
 with 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.090
 all possible wishes of the customer 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.240
 and drink and make of an engine happened interior space of the cars 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.680
 You see vandalism throughout the range of models and are also destroyed 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.020
 there in the ranks to the model all available with an automatic 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.360
 gear box 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.440
 so from support initiatives a sprinter adjustment comes from further work 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.440
 to find a mobility solution for his client 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.189
 in the along with the Dutch adaptation process became beer man 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.040
 a customer can go after every no dealer to two possible options 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.400
 view and make wishes known 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.990
 possibly here beerman who is the only hesitant in europe on this 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.469
 area 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.469
 where the specific possibilities and adjustments are looked at 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.790
 there is a solution for almost everything 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.790
 of a rotating chair that facilitates getting in and out 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.700
 dott trunk lifts that can lift up to 180 pounds 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.319
 but you can also think of a wheelchair is it for this nothing to 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.430
 the suitcase of the car in which you are traveling with the wheelchair and all 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:28.559
 the adjustments sometimes go very far as with this brand new van alcan 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:33.259
 how far one serves with a full factory school this beer man does it 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:37.339
 convert it into a wheelchair over for this their developed depending on the 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:38.799
 size of which is a wheelchair 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.390
 then you can come in total with four or five people to the kids' conversion 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.350
 The Dutch company is so special also finds one itself 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.350
 through this can promise almost the whole world can be delivered 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.769
 with adjustments we can go very far very far that is possible with the 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:02.809
 to send your feet 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:06.549
 to trade with but as we reasonably write about him or a 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.729
 sjors the control is possible but unfortunately walk or I recognized 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:14.759
 recognized costs so it is not for everyone one 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:18.769
 the old job but almost everything is already possible if necessary 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.569
 People like that and therefore themselves with an adapted everywhere 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.409
 other points 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.539
 And then it is nice that you can be completely independent 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.539
 without being dependent 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:42.279
 This can no longer be over but yes if you are not sharp the other 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:44.669
 yes i am not going to get you going anywhere 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.599
 the latter you have to take a taxi 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.159
 he valuation he may be his own I have my father 40 percent 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.569
 in three years 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.019
 and I am another fannie mae 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.379
 it's been a while and after 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.409
 but yes don't go to work 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:03.879
 it was a great promotion 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.419
 with existing subsidy schemes to make the adjusted about more accessible 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:09.650
 but the subsidies vary per municipality 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.509
 and that makes everything messy and sometimes unfair 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:13.939
 here would the government 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:15.269
 have a good look at it 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.410
 Some people are born disabled while others are drake during their 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.340
 life handicapped 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.919
 fortunately we can ensure that with all modern technology and commitment 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.039
 those people can stand where they want
