compost is an odd material it's dark you
can't<00:00:08.370> see<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.240> very<00:00:09.719> essence<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.410> compost

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
can't see the very essence of compost

can't see the very essence of compost
that's<00:00:11.070> most<00:00:11.340> important<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.179> the

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
microbes and I think for most people it

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.859 
microbes and I think for most people it
seems<00:00:15.690> like<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.929> lifeless<00:00:16.560> black<00:00:17.420> maybe<00:00:18.420> smelly

composting<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> beautiful<00:00:28.019> thing<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.439> takes

composting is a beautiful thing it takes

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.470 
composting is a beautiful thing it takes
those<00:00:29.160> materials<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.820> normally<00:00:30.090> would<00:00:30.449> be

those materials that normally would be

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.749 
those materials that normally would be
wasted<00:00:31.019> or<00:00:31.170> normally<00:00:31.949> could<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.399> pathogenic

wasted or normally could be pathogenic

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.799 
wasted or normally could be pathogenic
and<00:00:33.390> turns<00:00:34.170> them<00:00:34.440> into<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.890> clean<00:00:35.809> highly

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
and turns them into a clean highly

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.590 
and turns them into a clean highly
valuable<00:00:37.260> resource<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.280> farmers<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.000> for

valuable resource for farmers and for
improving<00:00:39.960> our<00:00:40.170> food<00:00:40.440> quality<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.309> the

improving our food quality so the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.950 
improving our food quality so the
question<00:00:41.790> always<00:00:41.879> becomes<00:00:42.149> how<00:00:42.690> did<00:00:42.840> that

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960
