 one 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.260
 none 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:11.689
 villanueva 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:15.659
 forty days and with purpose 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.960
 a stop in the day to consider that God's plan for your life 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.119
 meditate together or for a bit 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.589
 let's stop to continue with more force 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.399
 God wants to reorient our lives, let's pay attention 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.110
 day 11 let's make good friends 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.640
 Tissera would come Romans 5 10 because if when we were enemies of God we went 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.090
 reconciled with him through the death of his son 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.610
 how much more reason 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.110
 we will be saved from God's punishment for his 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.830
 God wants to be your best friend 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.770
 our relationship with god 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.000
 has different aspects god is the creator and the steel 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.870
 the lord and the teacher 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.590
 redeemer father 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.130
 Savior and much more 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.130
 but the most shocking truth is that the almighty god 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.330
 longs to do our 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.850
 in the garden of Eden we see God's ideal relationship with us 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.810
 Adam and Eve 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.810
 they enjoyed an intimate friendship with him 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.220
 there were no rituals or ceremonies my religion 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.830
 simply a simple and loving relationship 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.979
 'between god 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.220
 and the people who had created 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.410
 if it hinders us and the fear was the fear 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.630
 Adam and Eve were engaged in God 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.620
 and he n 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.360
 God created us to live continuously in his presence but after the 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.730
 fall that ideal relationship broke down 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.200
 only a few people in the old testament had the privilege of 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.590
 inem lists 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.290
 I love and I know if there will be more 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.229
 They were called friends of God 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:15.169
 of life we ​​are told that for God he was a man according to his heart 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.699
 son in the west 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:21.669
 they had an intimate friendship with God 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:26.849
 but in the old testament the fear of god predominates more than a friendship 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:30.889
 Jesus changed that situation 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:35.569
 by paying our sins on the cross the veil of the temple that symbolized our 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.939
 separation from god 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.469
 it cracked up and down 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:42.239
 as a sign that the direct access to God 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.909
 they were open again 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.119
 unlike the priests who had to prepare for hours 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:51.219
 before meeting him 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:54.360
 we can now approach God 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.679
 anytime 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:58.249
 the Bible says 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:02.920
 that now we have the wonderful joy of the Lord in our lives 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.759
 thanks to Christ 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:08.069
 died for our sins and it was not done 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.749
 his friends 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:11.119
 Friendship with God 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.549
 it is only possible by his grace and the sacrifice of Jesus 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.729
 He reconciled us through Christ transformed us from enemies into friends 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:24.519
 an old hymn says 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.589
 hook that friend we have in Christ 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:29.049
 but actually 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.039
 God 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:34.279
 invites us to enjoy their friendship and communion with the three people of the 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:36.089
 trinity our father 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:37.010
 The son 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.879
 and the holy spirit 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.359
 jesus said 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.149
 I no longer call you servants 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:45.449
 because the servant is not aware of what his master does 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:50.209
 I have called them friends because everything that my father heard him say 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.879
 I have made it known to you 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.080
 the word friend 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.589
 in this verse 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:04:00.629
 does not refer to a well-known naval casino but a close and 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.129
 trust 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.019
 the same term 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.639
 it is used to refer to the groom's godfather at the wedding 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:13.079
 and the circle of closest friends and trusted people of the king 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:15.979
 in the royal courts 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:20.059
 the deer must keep a certain prudent distance from the king 

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:21.859
 but his close friends 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.400
 they enjoy a close contact 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.379
 as well as direct access to the king and confidential information 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.889
 it's hard to understand why God wants to be my close friend but the 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.570
 bible declares that god 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.150
 he is passionate 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.259
 with regard 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:40.999
 to your relationship with us 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:44.989
 God has the intense desire that we know him intimately 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:46.900
 indeed 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.259
 planned the universe and structured the story 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.219
 including the details of our life 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.199
 so that we could be his friends 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.590
 the writing affirms a single man 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.550
 and they are all nations 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.360
 so that they will inhabit the whole earth 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.669
 and determined the periods of its history 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.979
 and the borders of their territories 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.400
 God did it so that all do not look for 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.740
 and even if they are clients 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.339
 find him 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:21.270
 know and love God 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.539
 It is our great privilege 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:26.979
 be known and loved by which is your greatest pleasure 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:29.029
 he says 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.220
 that if someone 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.389
 a of hydrochloride c that boast of knowing me 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.389
 and to understand that I am the Lord 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.559
 is what I like 

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:43.119
 It is difficult to imagine how an intimate friendship between a day is possible 

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:44.409
 perfect 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:47.009
 invisible and omnipotent 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.009
 and the finite human being and sin 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:54.299
 It would be easier to understand a relationship between love and heaven 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:57.099
 or between the creator and the created 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:59.960
 even between father and son 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.960
 but that means that God wants to be my friend 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.169
 if we consider the lives of the friends of God in the bible 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:11.740
 we can learn six secrets of friendship with God 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.129
 let's see two secrets 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:16.629
 on this day 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:19.629
 and the remaining four 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.449
 how to become God's best friend 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:28.229
 Through constant conversation it will not be possible to develop a relationship 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.159
 close with god 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:33.169
 if we only attend church once a week 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.210
 nor if we only have a little time alone with God 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.150
 Friendship with God 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.360
 it is grown when we share all 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.059
 our experiences with him 

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:50.659
 Of course it is important to establish the habit of devotion to 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:52.719
 diary with god 

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:53.970
 but he wants 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.129
 be more than a date in our agenda 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:00.469
 wants to be included in each activity in each conversation 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.400
 in each problem and even in each of our thoughts 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.110
 it is possible to have a continuous conversation with him 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.549
 and waiting for your answer throughout the day 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:18.199
 commenting on what we are doing open sando at that moment 

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:23.449
 pray without ceasing implies conversing with God 

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:25.860
 while doing some shopping 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.449
 when we drive the car 

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:29.619
 we work 

00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:31.280
 or develop moss any 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.289
 another daily task 

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:37.780
 There is the misconception that spending time with God 

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:41.699
 means being alone with him of course 

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:44.009
 according to the model of Jesus 

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:47.379
 We need to spend time alone with God 

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:48.499
 but that 

00:07:48.499 --> 00:07:52.319
 represents just a fraction of the time we are awake 

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:55.289
 everything we do 

00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:58.169
 It can be the time we spend with God 

00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:00.440
 if we invite you to join us 

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.159
 and we are aware of his presence
