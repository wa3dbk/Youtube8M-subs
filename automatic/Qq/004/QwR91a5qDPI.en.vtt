but first of all what is your task

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.739 
but first of all what is your task
manager<00:00:26.399> and<00:00:26.429> why<00:00:26.789> would<00:00:26.999> you<00:00:27.029> want<00:00:27.329> to<00:00:27.390> open

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:27.749 
manager and why would you want to open

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.469 
manager and why would you want to open
it<00:00:27.839> well<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:29.009> your<00:00:29.159> computer<00:00:29.729> there<00:00:30.119> are<00:00:30.149> lots

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:30.479 
it well on your computer there are lots

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:32.269 
it well on your computer there are lots
of<00:00:30.659> processes<00:00:31.289> running<00:00:31.619> all<00:00:31.769> at<00:00:31.829> the<00:00:32.070> same

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
of processes running all at the same

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.520 
of processes running all at the same
time<00:00:32.550> some<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.329> them<00:00:33.420> might<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:33.690> obvious<00:00:33.930> like

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
time some of them might be obvious like

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.310 
time some of them might be obvious like
your<00:00:34.859> word<00:00:35.160> processor<00:00:35.940> or<00:00:36.120> your<00:00:36.359> email<00:00:36.989> client

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
your word processor or your email client

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.319 
your word processor or your email client
but<00:00:37.829> other<00:00:37.949> ones<00:00:38.070> might<00:00:38.429> be<00:00:38.609> less<00:00:38.910> obvious

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
but other ones might be less obvious

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.310 
but other ones might be less obvious
because<00:00:39.510> they're<00:00:39.809> running<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
because they're running in the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.229 
because they're running in the
background<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:41.399> might<00:00:41.609> be<00:00:41.730> something<00:00:42.210> like

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
background this might be something like

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.919 
background this might be something like
your<00:00:42.809> instant<00:00:43.320> messaging<00:00:43.920> clients<00:00:44.519> or<00:00:44.929> maybe

00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:45.929 
your instant messaging clients or maybe

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.250 
your instant messaging clients or maybe
your<00:00:46.140> printer<00:00:46.589> driver<00:00:46.859> now<00:00:47.809> sometimes<00:00:48.809> your

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
your printer driver now sometimes your

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.819 
your printer driver now sometimes your
computer<00:00:49.679> can<00:00:49.949> start<00:00:50.370> around<00:00:50.730> quite<00:00:51.149> slowly

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
computer can start around quite slowly

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.319 
computer can start around quite slowly
and<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.010> also<00:00:53.160> might<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:53.519> that<00:00:53.820> an<00:00:53.879> application

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
and it also might be that an application

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.840 
and it also might be that an application
has<00:00:54.839> crashed<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.530> becomes<00:00:55.890> unresponsive<00:00:56.339> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
has crashed and becomes unresponsive and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.029 
has crashed and becomes unresponsive and
you<00:00:56.910> need<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.179> close<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.719> down<00:00:57.899> what<00:00:58.679> task

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
you need to close it down what task

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.099 
you need to close it down what task
manager<00:00:59.519> lets<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.969> do<00:01:00.179> is<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.839> look<00:01:00.989> at

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
manager lets you do is have a look at

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.750 
manager lets you do is have a look at
all<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.469> processes<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.280> are<00:01:02.339> running<00:01:02.519> on

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
all of the processes that are running on

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.640 
all of the processes that are running on
your<00:01:02.879> computer<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.929> can<00:01:04.170> see<00:01:04.380> how<00:01:04.590> many

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
your computer so you can see how many

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.060 
your computer so you can see how many
resources<00:01:05.520> like<00:01:05.850> memory<00:01:06.480> and<00:01:06.890> processor<00:01:07.890> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
resources like memory and processor and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.000 
resources like memory and processor and
even<00:01:08.250> network<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.270> they<00:01:09.390> may<00:01:09.660> be<00:01:09.720> using<00:01:10.200> and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
even network that they may be using and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.680 
even network that they may be using and
that<00:01:11.160> gives<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> opportunity<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:12.270> close

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
that gives you the opportunity to close

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.520 
that gives you the opportunity to close
any<00:01:13.080> one<00:01:13.410> of<00:01:13.530> those<00:01:13.710> processes<00:01:14.040> down<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.750> let's

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
any one of those processes down so let's

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.200 
any one of those processes down so let's
have<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.740> look<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:16.920> how<00:01:16.980> to<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.370> we're<00:01:18.090> on

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
have a look at how to do it we're on

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.330 
have a look at how to do it we're on
Windows<00:01:18.570> Vista<00:01:18.600> here<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.740> what<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.010> can<00:01:20.040> do

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
Windows Vista here and what you can do

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.240 
Windows Vista here and what you can do
is<00:01:20.550> right<00:01:21.210> click<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.990> menu<00:01:22.350> bar<00:01:22.710> taskbar

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
is right click on the menu bar taskbar

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.790 
is right click on the menu bar taskbar
at<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.580> bottom<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:24.840> click<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.350> task<00:01:26.040> manager

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
at the bottom and click on task manager

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.500 
at the bottom and click on task manager
now<00:01:28.800> this<00:01:28.980> is<00:01:29.100> almost<00:01:29.280> identical<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:30.210> Windows

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
now this is almost identical in Windows

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.370 
now this is almost identical in Windows
XP<00:01:31.230> and<00:01:31.440> also<00:01:31.830> in<00:01:32.100> Windows<00:01:32.370> 7<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.170> see

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
XP and also in Windows 7 so you can see

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.680 
XP and also in Windows 7 so you can see
here<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.220> processes<00:01:35.910> tab<00:01:36.090> with<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> whole

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
here in the processes tab with a whole

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.380 
here in the processes tab with a whole
list<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.350> different<00:01:37.770> processes<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:39.120> are<00:01:39.270> all

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
list of different processes that are all

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.390 
list of different processes that are all
running<00:01:39.660> in<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> background<00:01:40.470> some<00:01:41.190> of<00:01:41.220> them

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
running in the background some of them

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.790 
running in the background some of them
may<00:01:42.180> be<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.420> recognize<00:01:42.930> some<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.500> them<00:01:43.680> you

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
may be you recognize some of them you

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.740 
may be you recognize some of them you
probably<00:01:44.010> don't<00:01:44.580> you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.360> also<00:01:45.480> look<00:01:45.660> at

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
probably don't you can also look at

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.170 
probably don't you can also look at
applications<00:01:46.620> and<00:01:46.830> here<00:01:47.430> for<00:01:47.610> example<00:01:47.700> we<00:01:48.150> see

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
applications and here for example we see

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.300 
applications and here for example we see
that<00:01:48.420> we've<00:01:48.540> got<00:01:48.660> Google<00:01:48.930> running<00:01:49.410> Google

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
that we've got Google running Google

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.270 
that we've got Google running Google
running<00:01:50.580> in<00:01:50.670> Internet<00:01:51.000> Explorer<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:53.130> we

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
running in Internet Explorer so if we

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.340 
running in Internet Explorer so if we
wanted<00:01:53.580> to<00:01:53.700> close<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.270> application<00:01:54.900> what<00:01:55.260> we

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
wanted to close that application what we

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.670 
wanted to close that application what we
could<00:01:55.560> do<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:56.130> click<00:01:56.400> on<00:01:56.520> end<00:01:56.880> tasks<00:01:57.680> other

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
could do is click on end tasks other

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.430 
could do is click on end tasks other
things<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.100> we<00:01:59.190> can<00:01:59.370> see<00:01:59.550> is<00:01:59.760> how<00:02:00.150> your<00:02:00.480> CPU

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
things that we can see is how your CPU

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.500 
things that we can see is how your CPU
utilization<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.460> looking<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.000> also<00:02:03.090> how<00:02:03.330> much

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
utilization is looking and also how much

that<00:02:17.340> well<00:02:17.520> this<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.849> all<00:02:17.970> very<00:02:18.150> interesting

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
that well this is all very interesting

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.900 
that well this is all very interesting
to<00:02:19.020> look<00:02:19.170> at<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.800> can<00:02:19.830> close<00:02:20.310> down<00:02:20.580> some

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
to look at and you can close down some

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.699 
to look at and you can close down some
processes<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:21.989> might<00:02:22.230> not<00:02:22.470> want

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
processes that you might not want

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.589 
processes that you might not want
running<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.580> can<00:02:23.849> also<00:02:24.030> be<00:02:24.300> very<00:02:24.330> dangerous

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
running it can also be very dangerous

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.170 
running it can also be very dangerous
and<00:02:25.349> in<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.680> worst<00:02:25.920> case<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.790> could<00:02:26.970> mean<00:02:27.090> that

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
and in a worst case it could mean that

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.089 
and in a worst case it could mean that
you<00:02:27.269> need<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.510> reboot<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.019> computer<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.980> get

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
you need to reboot the computer to get

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.000 
you need to reboot the computer to get
it<00:02:29.190> working<00:02:29.340> again<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:30.780> that's<00:02:30.959> how<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.230> open<00:02:31.739> a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
it working again so that's how to open a

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.610 
it working again so that's how to open a
task<00:02:32.220> manager
