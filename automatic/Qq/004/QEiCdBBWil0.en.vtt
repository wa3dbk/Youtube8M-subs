style see I have a very normal

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.149 
style see I have a very normal
commandery<00:01:37.110> style<00:01:37.470> when<00:01:37.710> I'm<00:01:37.829> doing<00:01:38.040> my

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
commandery style when I'm doing my

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.249 
commandery style when I'm doing my
sunderland<00:01:38.790> manager<00:01:38.880> mode<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.720> kind<00:01:40.170> of

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
feel that the commentary style for this

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.569 
feel that the commentary style for this
series<00:01:42.600> comic<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.259> can't<00:01:43.500> be<00:01:43.619> exactly<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.399> it

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
series comic it can't be exactly as it

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.069 
series comic it can't be exactly as it

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
know I was kind of thinking about a

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.410

thinking whether i should include humor
trying<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.369> make<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.549> serious<00:02:00.030> humorous<00:02:00.509> or

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
used to be quite strong I do remember

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.940 
used to be quite strong I do remember
when<00:04:26.610> they<00:04:26.729> are

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
when they are

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.440 
when they are
the<00:04:27.010> Premier<00:04:27.400> League<00:04:27.430> it<00:04:28.000> feels<00:04:28.270> like<00:04:28.330> a

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
the Premier League it feels like a

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.360 
the Premier League it feels like a
really<00:04:28.720> long<00:04:28.960> time<00:04:28.990> ago<00:04:29.530> actually<00:04:29.710> are<00:04:30.070> the

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
really long time ago actually are the

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.950 
really long time ago actually are the
only<00:04:30.490> thing<00:04:30.670> I<00:04:30.760> can<00:04:30.820> really<00:04:31.120> remember<00:04:31.450> from

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
only thing I can really remember from

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.230 
only thing I can really remember from
them<00:04:32.140> is<00:04:32.260> Arsenal<00:04:32.650> thrashing<00:04:33.100> them<00:04:33.130> like<00:04:33.400> 70

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
them is Arsenal thrashing them like 70

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.270 
them is Arsenal thrashing them like 70

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.730

this<00:04:44.560> match<00:04:44.740> was<00:04:45.040> really<00:04:45.460> slow<00:04:45.760> pace<00:04:46.180> they<00:04:46.390> had

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
this match was really slow pace they had

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.600 
this match was really slow pace they had
a<00:04:46.540> really<00:04:46.810> good<00:04:47.050> opportunity<00:04:47.290> there<00:04:47.830> just<00:04:48.490> hit

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.830 
could have easily gone on the inside and
in<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.280> back<00:04:54.760> of<00:04:54.910> the<00:04:55.030> net<00:04:55.180> but<00:04:55.300> in<00:04:55.420> terms<00:04:55.660> of

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
in the end nothing really troubling and

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.130 
in the end nothing really troubling and

a corner nothing came of it I had a
pretty<00:05:07.060> good<00:05:07.270> shot<00:05:07.480> there<00:05:07.660> maybe<00:05:07.930> should<00:05:08.230> have

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
pretty good shot there maybe should have

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.920 
pretty good shot there maybe should have
scored<00:05:08.710> it<00:05:08.920> but<00:05:09.130> a<00:05:09.370> half<00:05:09.730> time<00:05:09.970> it<00:05:10.090> was<00:05:10.240> no<00:05:10.720> no

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
hard as much I hardly had any chance I

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.500 
hard as much I hardly had any chance I
mean<00:05:30.010> I<00:05:30.100> had<00:05:30.250> a<00:05:30.280> lot<00:05:30.460> in<00:05:30.640> that<00:05:30.670> in<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.060> first

unfortunate<00:06:38.080> really<00:06:38.740> i<00:06:38.770> was<00:06:38.890> hoping<00:06:39.190> to

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
unfortunate really i was hoping to

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.770 
unfortunate really i was hoping to
progress<00:06:40.060> through<00:06:40.120> that<00:06:40.510> and

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
progress through that and

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.360 
progress through that and
perhaps<00:06:40.930> attract<00:06:41.290> some<00:06:41.440> attention<00:06:41.500> but<00:06:42.280> in

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
perhaps attract some attention but in

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.860 
perhaps attract some attention but in
the<00:06:42.460> championship<00:06:43.000> today<00:06:43.090> we<00:06:43.300> are<00:06:43.389> in<00:06:43.510> seventh
