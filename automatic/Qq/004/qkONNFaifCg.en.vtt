00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.610 
all right so we've gotten all the leaves
trimmed<00:01:43.180> we're<00:01:43.750> gonna<00:01:43.840> go<00:01:44.020> ahead<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.170> spread

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
trimmed we're gonna go ahead and spread

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.380 
trimmed we're gonna go ahead and spread
these<00:01:44.890> leaves<00:01:45.340> just<00:01:45.670> a<00:01:45.760> little<00:01:46.000> bit<00:01:46.120> the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
these leaves just a little bit the

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.940 
these leaves just a little bit the
fresher<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:46.900> artichoke<00:01:47.320> it's<00:01:47.560> gonna<00:01:47.740> be<00:01:47.920> a

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
fresher the artichoke it's gonna be a

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.320 
fresher the artichoke it's gonna be a
little<00:01:48.190> bit<00:01:48.430> tougher<00:01:48.700> to<00:01:48.820> spread<00:01:49.060> so<00:01:49.300> you

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
little bit tougher to spread so you

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.700 
little bit tougher to spread so you
don't<00:01:49.540> want<00:01:49.720> to<00:01:49.810> force<00:01:50.050> it<00:01:50.229> too<00:01:50.410> much<00:01:50.530> because

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
don't want to force it too much because

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.260 
don't want to force it too much because
then<00:01:50.890> you're<00:01:50.979> gonna<00:01:51.070> snap<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.670> leaves<00:01:51.880> so

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
then you're gonna snap the leaves so

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.570 
then you're gonna snap the leaves so
open<00:01:52.690> them<00:01:52.840> as<00:01:52.960> much<00:01:53.229> as<00:01:53.470> they'll<00:01:53.650> go<00:01:53.680> because

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
open them as much as they'll go because

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.400 
open them as much as they'll go because

in the little aluminum foil pocket and

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.070 
in the little aluminum foil pocket and
now<00:02:51.760> we're<00:02:51.940> gonna<00:02:52.060> do<00:02:52.299> is<00:02:52.390> we're<00:02:52.540> gonna<00:02:52.600> double

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
now we're gonna do is we're gonna double

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.740 
now we're gonna do is we're gonna double
coat<00:02:53.560> with<00:02:54.100> aluminum<00:02:54.610> foil<00:02:54.820> so<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:55.150> all<00:02:55.480> the

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
coat with aluminum foil so that all the

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.070 
coat with aluminum foil so that all the
juices<00:02:56.140> stay<00:02:56.350> inside<00:02:56.799> there's<00:02:57.459> one<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.780> then

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
juices stay inside there's one and then

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.430 
juices stay inside there's one and then
two<00:03:00.239> so<00:03:01.239> we've<00:03:01.360> got<00:03:01.510> our<00:03:01.600> oven<00:03:01.900> preheated<00:03:01.930> to

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
two so we've got our oven preheated to

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.410 
two so we've got our oven preheated to
425<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.430> we're<00:03:03.580> gonna<00:03:03.700> roast<00:03:03.970> these<00:03:04.180> for

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
425 and we're gonna roast these for

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.670 
425 and we're gonna roast these for
about<00:03:04.660> 60<00:03:05.170> minutes

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
about 60 minutes

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.560 
about 60 minutes
these<00:03:06.040> are<00:03:06.190> along<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.670> medium<00:03:07.060> side<00:03:07.269> so<00:03:07.480> you

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
these are along the medium side so you

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.030 
these are along the medium side so you
want<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.840> keep<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.140> at<00:03:08.230> about<00:03:08.410> an<00:03:08.530> hour<00:03:08.680> if

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
want to keep it at about an hour if
