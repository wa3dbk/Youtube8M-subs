00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
alright so the way that I get the the

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.870 
alright so the way that I get the the
wheel<00:00:05.370> bolts<00:00:05.609> off<00:00:05.940> use<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.810> breaker<00:00:07.109> bar<00:00:07.639> and<00:00:08.639> I

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
wheel bolts off use a breaker bar and I

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.190 
wheel bolts off use a breaker bar and I
also<00:00:09.179> use<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.420> deep<00:00:09.719> socket<00:00:10.019> 17<00:00:11.010> millimeter<00:00:12.200> so

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
also use a deep socket 17 millimeter so

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.829 
also use a deep socket 17 millimeter so
the<00:00:13.320> 17<00:00:13.769> mil<00:00:13.980> obviously<00:00:14.880> did<00:00:15.059> socket<00:00:15.570> only

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
the 17 mil obviously did socket only

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.960 
the 17 mil obviously did socket only
because<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.440> want<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.400> be<00:00:17.460> able<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.640> reach<00:00:17.789> and

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
because I want to be able to reach and

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.950 
because I want to be able to reach and
get<00:00:18.119> myself<00:00:18.390> plenty<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.750> room<00:00:18.840> without

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
get myself plenty of room without

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.810 
get myself plenty of room without
rubbing<00:00:19.350> on<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.500> wheel<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.430> then<00:00:20.550> once<00:00:20.730> I

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
rubbing on the wheel and then once I

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.849 
rubbing on the wheel and then once I
loosen<00:00:21.150> up<00:00:21.240> with<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.390> breaker<00:00:21.600> bar<00:00:21.869> I'll<00:00:22.350> just

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
loosen up with a breaker bar I'll just

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.910 
loosen up with a breaker bar I'll just
go<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.220> 18<00:00:23.580> volt<00:00:24.260> you<00:00:25.260> know<00:00:25.320> with<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.500> 17

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
go with the 18 volt you know with a 17

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.310 
go with the 18 volt you know with a 17
mm<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.340> laid<00:00:27.300> down<00:00:27.330> some<00:00:27.480> one<00:00:27.810> on<00:00:27.900> top<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.230> my

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
mm I laid down some one on top of my

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.890 
mm I laid down some one on top of my
floor<00:00:28.619> jack<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.220> that's<00:00:29.970> just<00:00:30.150> basically<00:00:30.269> a

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
floor jack and that's just basically a

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.470 
floor jack and that's just basically a
little<00:00:31.800> bit<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.980> buffer<00:00:32.160> between<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.910> top<00:00:33.450> of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
little bit of buffer between the top of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.780 
little bit of buffer between the top of
the<00:00:33.630> jack<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.680> actual<00:00:35.010> jack<00:00:35.340> stand<00:00:35.640> I

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the jack and the actual jack stand I

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.459 
the jack and the actual jack stand I
just<00:00:35.969> don't<00:00:36.149> want<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.480> put<00:00:36.660> enough<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.140> too<00:00:37.350> much

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
just don't want to put enough a too much

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.080 
just don't want to put enough a too much
pressure<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.980> sword<00:00:38.219> disperses<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> little

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
pressure the sword disperses a little

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.549 
pressure the sword disperses a little
bit<00:00:41.809> there's<00:00:42.809> me<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> little<00:00:43.200> bit<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> slow

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
bit there's me a little bit of a slow

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.900 
bit there's me a little bit of a slow
process<00:00:43.590> at<00:00:44.129> first<00:00:44.370> cuz<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.640> don't<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:44.850> that

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
process at first cuz I don't have that

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.510 
process at first cuz I don't have that
much<00:00:45.059> room<00:00:45.590> with<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.680> jack<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> car<00:00:47.430> will

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
much room with the jack but the car will

00:00:47.520 --> 00:01:02.439 
much room with the jack but the car will
start<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.850> lift<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.469> high<00:01:01.649> enough

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
start to lift so you just high enough

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.090 
start to lift so you just high enough
for<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.510> poor<00:01:03.840> jack<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.619> jacks<00:01:04.890> in

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
for the poor jack for the jacks in

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.399 
for the poor jack for the jacks in
rather<00:01:05.510> all<00:01:06.510> right<00:01:06.630> that's<00:01:06.780> perfect<00:01:07.350> right

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
rather all right that's perfect right

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.820 
rather all right that's perfect right
there

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.250 

and<00:01:10.830> that's<00:01:10.979> perfect<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.549> well<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:13.110> I'm<00:01:13.170> gonna

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
and that's perfect as well so I'm gonna

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.630 
and that's perfect as well so I'm gonna
slowly<00:01:13.470> lower<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> car<00:01:13.979> down<00:01:14.010> over<00:01:14.520> these

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
slowly lower the car down over these

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.410 
slowly lower the car down over these
jack<00:01:14.939> stands<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:16.850> should<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:17.939> able<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.270> take

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
jack stands and should be able to take

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:33.260 
jack stands and should be able to take
the<00:01:18.540> wheels<00:01:18.720> off<00:01:18.900> from<00:01:19.110> there<00:01:31.759> as<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.119> see

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
the wheels off from there as you can see

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.880 
the wheels off from there as you can see
obviously<00:01:33.450> they<00:01:33.810> come<00:01:33.930> out<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> lot<00:01:34.259> easier<00:01:34.320> if

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
obviously they come out a lot easier if

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.200 
obviously they come out a lot easier if
you<00:01:35.100> give<00:01:35.250> yourself<00:01:35.579> an<00:01:35.670> 18<00:01:35.939> volt<00:01:37.820> so<00:01:38.820> go<00:01:39.000> buy<00:01:39.180> a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
you give yourself an 18 volt so go buy a

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.930 
you give yourself an 18 volt so go buy a
lot<00:01:39.479> easier

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.960 

but<00:01:48.830> this<00:01:49.830> is<00:01:49.920> what<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.130> rear<00:01:50.310> end<00:01:50.460> pretty

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
but this is what the rear end pretty

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.370 
but this is what the rear end pretty
much<00:01:51.150> looks<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> e39<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:55.200> what<00:01:55.350> I

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
much looks like on the e39 and what I

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.740 
much looks like on the e39 and what I
have<00:01:55.620> right<00:01:55.860> here<00:01:55.920> I'm<00:01:56.790> replacing<00:01:57.120> this<00:01:57.510> arm

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
have right here I'm replacing this arm

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.680 
have right here I'm replacing this arm
first<00:01:58.550> this<00:01:59.550> is<00:01:59.610> an<00:01:59.850> original<00:02:00.210> part<00:02:00.479> with<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
first this is an original part with the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:08.120 
first this is an original part with the
car<00:02:02.570> basically<00:02:03.570> bolt<00:02:03.990> back<00:02:04.229> up<00:02:04.410> in<00:02:04.530> here<00:02:07.130> and

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
car basically bolt back up in here and

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.080 
car basically bolt back up in here and
it<00:02:08.250> attaches<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.940> here<00:02:10.610> so<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.910> kind

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
it attaches in here so this is the kind

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.260 
it attaches in here so this is the kind
of<00:02:12.120> space<00:02:12.330> I'm<00:02:12.540> working<00:02:12.810> with<00:02:13.580> air<00:02:14.580> tools<00:02:15.000> and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
of space I'm working with air tools and

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:26.559 
of space I'm working with air tools and
expertise

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:38.479 

daddy<00:02:27.739> all<00:02:28.739> right<00:02:28.980> back<00:02:29.190> off<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:38.040> we're<00:02:38.190> doing

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
daddy all right back off and we're doing

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:54.819 
daddy all right back off and we're doing
this<00:02:38.549> because<00:02:38.730> otherwise<00:02:39.209> I'll<00:02:39.540> spin<00:02:39.900> inside

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:09.619 

still<00:02:55.829> spinning<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> little<00:02:56.400> bit<00:02:56.549> so<00:03:08.510> there<00:03:09.510> we

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
still spinning a little bit so there we

00:03:09.629 --> 00:04:28.030 
still spinning a little bit so there we
go<00:03:09.950> nice<00:03:12.680> any<00:03:13.680> bank<00:03:13.920> yeah<00:03:14.609> come<00:03:21.829> loose

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:37.700 

should<00:04:29.040> come<00:04:29.670> right<00:04:29.850> up<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:34.580> changed<00:04:35.580> my<00:04:36.710> hand
