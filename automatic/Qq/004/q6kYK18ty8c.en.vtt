criss-cross<00:00:00.630> is<00:00:00.900> about<00:00:01.199> midpoint<00:00:01.770> through

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
criss-cross is about midpoint through

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.649 
criss-cross is about midpoint through
your<00:00:02.159> head<00:00:02.370> both<00:00:02.639> of<00:00:02.850> them<00:00:02.939> criss<00:00:03.210> cross<00:00:03.419> and

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
your head both of them criss cross and

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.650 
your head both of them criss cross and
they<00:00:03.750> share<00:00:04.049> fiber<00:00:04.410> one<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.190> next<00:00:05.400> and

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:05.660 
they share fiber one to the next and

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.780 
they share fiber one to the next and
then<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:07.319> nerve<00:00:07.500> fibers<00:00:07.950> go<00:00:08.130> back<00:00:08.370> along<00:00:08.760> the

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
then the nerve fibers go back along the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.330 
then the nerve fibers go back along the
sides<00:00:09.210> where<00:00:09.480> your<00:00:09.599> temple<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.440> then<00:00:10.950> your

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
sides where your temple is and then your

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.190 
sides where your temple is and then your
site<00:00:11.550> centers<00:00:11.940> are<00:00:12.090> actually<00:00:12.509> back<00:00:12.719> here<00:00:13.019> this

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
site centers are actually back here this

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.600 
site centers are actually back here this
part<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.620> your<00:00:13.710> brain<00:00:13.920> back<00:00:14.160> here<00:00:14.400> where<00:00:14.519> the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
part of your brain back here where the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.700 
part of your brain back here where the
bump<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.000> on<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.269> back<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.480> your<00:00:15.750> head<00:00:15.960> from

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
bump is on the back of your head from

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.560 
bump is on the back of your head from
that<00:00:16.859> point<00:00:17.160> up<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.580> about<00:00:17.760> mid<00:00:18.000> point<00:00:18.300> there

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
that point up to about mid point there

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.660 
that point up to about mid point there
that's<00:00:19.260> where<00:00:19.560> your<00:00:19.680> site<00:00:19.920> centers<00:00:20.340> are<00:00:20.550> on

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
that's where your site centers are on

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.160 
that's where your site centers are on
either<00:00:20.820> side<00:00:21.210> that's<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.689> part<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.080> your

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
either side that's the part of your

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.960 
either side that's the part of your
brain<00:00:22.230> called<00:00:22.800> your<00:00:23.010> occipital<00:00:23.340> lobes<00:00:23.730> where

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
brain called your occipital lobes where

brain called your occipital lobes where
you<00:00:24.090> see<00:00:24.539> that's<00:00:25.470> where<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.800> interpret

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
you see that's where you interpret

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.759 
you see that's where you interpret
what's<00:00:27.330> coming<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.840> from<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.140> light<00:00:28.349> impulse

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
what's coming in from a light impulse

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.859 
what's coming in from a light impulse
out<00:00:29.010> here<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.490> that's<00:00:30.060> how<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.300> interpret

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
out here and that's how you interpret

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.160 
out here and that's how you interpret
whoops<00:00:31.130> okay<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:33.000> purpose<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.480> an<00:00:33.600> eyeball<00:00:33.989> is

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
whoops okay the purpose of an eyeball is

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.229 
whoops okay the purpose of an eyeball is
to<00:00:34.320> take<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.710> light<00:00:34.890> coming<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.520> flex<00:00:37.340> 75%<00:00:38.340> 25%

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
to take the light coming in flex 75% 25%

but most of us don't have that situation
most<00:01:32.659> of<00:01:32.840> us<00:01:32.929> have<00:01:32.990> a<00:01:33.320> 9<00:01:33.500> is<00:01:33.710> too<00:01:33.979> long<00:01:34.219> or<00:01:34.490> too

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
most of us have a 9 is too long or too

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.300 
most of us have a 9 is too long or too
squatty<00:01:35.030> short<00:01:35.479> and<00:01:36.289> it's<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.860> front<00:01:37.070> doesn't

squatty short and it's the front doesn't

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.730 
squatty short and it's the front doesn't
is<00:01:37.579> it<00:01:37.729> round<00:01:38.030> it's<00:01:38.750> got<00:01:39.079> looks<00:01:39.560> like<00:01:39.710> a

if you're far-sighted you're the people

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.639 
if you're far-sighted you're the people
that<00:02:02.090> can<00:02:02.209> see<00:02:02.239> forever<00:02:02.689> when<00:02:03.170> you're<00:02:03.319> a<00:02:03.349> kid

sighted people what happens about the

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.080 
sighted people what happens about the
tiny<00:02:19.549> in<00:02:19.790> puberty<00:02:20.950> when<00:02:21.950> we<00:02:22.099> get<00:02:22.250> jockey<00:02:22.549> gets

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
tiny in puberty when we get jockey gets

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.809 
tiny in puberty when we get jockey gets
its<00:02:23.890> everything<00:02:24.890> else<00:02:25.040> goes<00:02:25.280> wrong<00:02:25.430> your

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
its everything else goes wrong your

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.670 
its everything else goes wrong your
eyeballs<00:02:26.120> can<00:02:26.420> no<00:02:26.629> longer<00:02:26.930> than<00:02:27.230> normal<00:02:27.379> and

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
eyeballs can no longer than normal and

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.250 
eyeballs can no longer than normal and
you<00:02:27.829> go<00:02:28.010> black<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.569> basically<00:02:29.569> can't<00:02:29.959> see

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
you go black you basically can't see

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.530 
you go black you basically can't see
anymore<00:02:30.590> without<00:02:31.400> moving<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.090> all<00:02:32.329> the<00:02:32.510> time

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
anymore without moving this all the time

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.190 
anymore without moving this all the time
which<00:02:32.870> makes<00:02:33.049> it<00:02:33.230> even<00:02:33.350> worse<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:35.810> doesn't

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
which makes it even worse and it doesn't

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.990 
which makes it even worse and it doesn't
take<00:02:36.230> much<00:02:36.530> elongation<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.370> those<00:02:37.549> eyeballs

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
take much elongation of those eyeballs

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.830 
take much elongation of those eyeballs
can<00:02:38.359> make<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:38.720> very<00:02:39.139> very<00:02:39.319> nearsighted<00:02:40.840> just

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
can make you very very nearsighted just

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.360 
can make you very very nearsighted just
as<00:02:42.019> much<00:02:42.170> as<00:02:42.380> a<00:02:42.410> quarter<00:02:42.709> of<00:02:42.889> an<00:02:43.069> inch<00:02:43.130> will

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
as much as a quarter of an inch will

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.949 
as much as a quarter of an inch will
make<00:02:43.519> you<00:02:43.639> so<00:02:43.819> nearsighted<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:44.450> can't<00:02:44.750> tell

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
make you so nearsighted you can't tell

make you so nearsighted you can't tell
the<00:02:45.139> munition<00:02:45.590> maybe<00:02:45.859> is<00:02:46.010> the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
the munition maybe is the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.020 
the munition maybe is the
from<00:02:47.570> this<00:02:47.750> distance<00:02:48.370> that's<00:02:49.370> how<00:02:49.550> near<00:02:49.760> said
