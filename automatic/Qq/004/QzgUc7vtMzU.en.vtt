 liabilities that now indicate the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.180
 speed of movement bonus on lebron 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.430
 beef but which roughly speaking does not 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.660
 do not change then so what does not 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.860

 first target that reduces the damage 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.470
 on the second target which increases the 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.239

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.559
 day as you will see the cost in 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.270
 mana to decrease the time to 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.829
 recovery that decreases a lot which 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.570
 so starts at 7 seconds and the cost in 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.789
 mana rising to 43 for the first 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.240
 for the evidence the first for the 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.610
 first level 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.179

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:21.820
 full holder in your stale the 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.780
 damage of a passive menus change they 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.039

 the duration of hemorrhage decreased to 2 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.369
 seconds and attac speeds change 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.860
 decrease the mana cost decreases 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.630
 also his commitment a change 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.090
 on ball rain the delay of 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.220
 recovery decreases from caen 7 and 15 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.670
 fixed now it's going from 14 have the 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.009
 level 1 to 10 for level 5 of the 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.149

 the slowdown percentage 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.700
 increases from 20 to 25% for the first 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.009
 level and vision is better suited to 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.219
 the area of effect and finally on the dam 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:01.479
 lead on the ultimate damage down 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:03.130
 from 65 for level 1 to 50 and we 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.460
 now applies the effects 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.780
 passive stale shot and its applies a 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.160
 new passive effect that increases the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.170
 number of effects maximum two thirds stale 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.120
 at 6-7 and 8 May the ratio is lost to 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.570
 on the ultimate we have more than a ratio ap 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.190
