rods yeah this is a new Intex they are a
casting<00:00:25.260> rod<00:00:25.289> yeah<00:00:25.800> still<00:00:26.160> nice<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.460> play<00:00:26.550> fish

casting rod yeah still nice to play fish
on<00:00:27.000> obviously<00:00:27.720> but<00:00:28.619> they<00:00:28.710> cast<00:00:28.950> really<00:00:29.220> well<00:00:29.490> I

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
on obviously but they cast really well I

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.869 
on obviously but they cast really well I
had<00:00:29.940> a<00:00:29.970> lot<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.240> power<00:00:30.590> they've<00:00:31.590> got<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.879> very

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
had a lot of power they've got a very

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.300 
had a lot of power they've got a very
fast<00:00:33.300> tip<00:00:33.660> fast<00:00:33.960> recovery<00:00:34.260> tip<00:00:34.680> which<00:00:35.190> is

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310 
fast tip fast recovery tip which is

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.530 
fast tip fast recovery tip which is
really<00:00:35.610> important<00:00:36.000> if<00:00:36.120> your<00:00:36.210> distance

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
really important if your distance

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.750 
really important if your distance
fishing<00:00:36.920> you<00:00:37.920> know<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.040> think<00:00:38.190> that's<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.489> what

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
fishing you know I think that's it what

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.490 
fishing you know I think that's it what
was<00:00:38.910> about<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.420> lose<00:00:39.630> accuracy<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.440> you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
was about you lose accuracy and you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.680 
was about you lose accuracy and you
don't<00:00:40.890> get<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.730> fine<00:00:41.970> will<00:00:42.180> build<00:00:42.390> up<00:00:42.570> a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
don't get that that fine will build up a

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.030 
don't get that that fine will build up a
parallel<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.260> will<00:00:43.350> sort<00:00:43.470> of<00:00:43.530> flick<00:00:43.770> at<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
parallel it will sort of flick at the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.190 
parallel it will sort of flick at the
end<00:00:44.220> which<00:00:44.460> these<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.790> got<00:00:45.050> they've<00:00:46.050> got<00:00:46.079> a

yes<00:01:02.610> it's<00:01:02.940> flared<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.570> you've<00:01:03.690> got

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
yes it's flared it so you've got

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.179 
yes it's flared it so you've got
actually<00:01:04.049> something<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.559> grip<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.920> know<00:01:04.949> some

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
of them are so thin they're quite hard

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.929 
of them are so thin they're quite hard
hard<00:01:07.289> to<00:01:07.439> grip<00:01:07.590> onto<00:01:07.829> but<00:01:08.219> yeah<00:01:08.759> if<00:01:08.819> you're

K<00:01:19.529> style<00:01:19.859> guides<00:01:20.929> Fuji<00:01:21.929> k<00:01:22.109> guides<00:01:22.439> they<00:01:23.069> are

00:01:23.269 --> 00:01:23.279 
K style guides Fuji k guides they are

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:25.849 
K style guides Fuji k guides they are
very<00:01:23.700> different<00:01:23.969> and<00:01:24.359> I<00:01:24.719> said<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.319> Fuji<00:01:25.649> guides

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
very different and I said a Fuji guides

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:27.559 
very different and I said a Fuji guides
and<00:01:26.159> foods<00:01:26.399> you<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.579> developed<00:01:26.819> them<00:01:27.209> as

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:27.569 
and foods you have developed them as

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:29.359 
and foods you have developed them as
anti<00:01:27.990> frappe<00:01:28.229> guides<00:01:28.529> for<00:01:28.859> long<00:01:28.979> distance

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
anti frappe guides for long distance

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.080 
anti frappe guides for long distance
casting<00:01:29.609> and<00:01:30.389> because<00:01:30.779> of<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.020> shape<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
casting and because of the shape and the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.239 
casting and because of the shape and the
forward-leaning<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.289> arms<00:01:34.590> there<00:01:34.770> you

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249 
forward-leaning on the arms there you

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:37.870 
forward-leaning on the arms there you
don't<00:01:35.459> get<00:01:35.609> coils<00:01:36.029> you<00:01:36.810> can't<00:01:37.049> get<00:01:37.289> a<00:01:37.319> coil

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
don't get coils you can't get a coil

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.190 
don't get coils you can't get a coil
catching<00:01:38.880> around<00:01:38.969> it<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.359> a<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
catching around it like a can with a

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.039 
catching around it like a can with a
more<00:01:40.880> standard<00:01:41.880> guide<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.749> you<00:01:42.810> know<00:01:42.929> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
more standard guide so you know the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.109 
more standard guide so you know the
cause<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.499> what<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:43.979> does<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.279> it<00:01:44.399> reduces<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
cause and what it does is it reduces the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.109 
cause and what it does is it reduces the
coils<00:01:45.539> here<00:01:46.469> which<00:01:46.709> obviously<00:01:46.859> aids<00:01:47.219> longer

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
coils here which obviously aids longer

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.300 
coils here which obviously aids longer
casting<00:01:48.630> that's<00:01:49.619> freaky

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
casting that's freaky

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.099 
casting that's freaky
yeah<00:01:50.609> yeah<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.090> brings<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.599> straight<00:01:51.869> down

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
yeah yeah it brings it straight down

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.199 
yeah yeah it brings it straight down
without<00:01:52.649> without<00:01:53.219> the<00:01:53.310> chance<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.849> actually

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
without without the chance of actually

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:57.230 
without without the chance of actually
going<00:01:54.509> around<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.929> guide<00:01:56.060> it's<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.119> one

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
going around the guide it's the one

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.940 
going around the guide it's the one
you've<00:01:57.389> actually<00:01:57.630> developed<00:01:57.990> ease<00:01:58.259> yeah<00:01:58.739> yeah

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
you've actually developed ease yeah yeah

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.859 
you've actually developed ease yeah yeah
I've<00:01:59.069> been<00:01:59.219> working<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.669> this<00:01:59.789> I've<00:02:00.209> quite<00:02:00.810> a

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
I've been working on this I've quite a

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.599 
I've been working on this I've quite a
while<00:02:01.049> now<00:02:01.200> really<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.889> know<00:02:02.009> started<00:02:02.459> by

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
while now really you know started by

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:05.539 
while now really you know started by
getting<00:02:03.179> the<00:02:03.239> blank<00:02:03.479> right<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.799> then<00:02:05.279> getting

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
getting the blank right and then getting

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.399 
getting the blank right and then getting
the<00:02:05.609> guides<00:02:05.819> right<00:02:06.179> and<00:02:06.419> then<00:02:06.959> obviously<00:02:07.139> the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
the guides right and then obviously the
