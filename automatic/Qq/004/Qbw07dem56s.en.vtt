00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.730
 the production of sheep for 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.380
 market their meat grows every day in 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.320
 our country and the number of people 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.509
 that consume it also increases that by 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.030
 be a softer white flesh and have 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.830
 a different flavor is for this reason that 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.019
 entrepreneurs and ranchers increase 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.210
 data for example this is a 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.910
 stable but space for the sheep 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.920
 and the goats gain more and more space 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.140
 in the case of female sheep when 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.509
 are for young are pregnant the year of 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.279
 age and those that are for meat to 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.080
 five months and with an average weight of 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.969
 the 40 kilos can already be 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.899
 marketed at an average price of 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.300
 6 thousand 500 colones per kilo or about 260 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.829
 thousand colones by order most of the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.379
 some producers sell 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.620
 directly in restaurants and others 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.629
 We sell the channels to the automercado or 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.780
 more for less' or to other companies that 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.809
 they pack lamb meat for consumption 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.809
 national 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.050
 we produce our own 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.900
 our own meat on the farms 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.770
 Over the 5 or 6 months maximum 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.240
 the animal reaches to reach 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:14.330
 approximately 45 kilos between 40 and 50 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.180
 kilos an average 45 is that the animal is going 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.670
 for the destace the country there is an act 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.170
 Approximately 11,900 animals according to 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.869
 the world health organization 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.840
 animal in the year 2012 the province of 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.700
 alajuela had about 3000 animals the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.340
 Procreation of cattle is 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.830
 relatively simple since a single 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.600
 Male can vary up to 50 females 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:41.869
 we have groups of 15 mother sheep up 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.140
 30 mothers workers and let go of the padrote 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:50.730
 that we think is convenient at that moment 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:54.370
 can actually be a pimp for 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.930
 50/50 in the country there are already several races 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.180
 specialized for the production of 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.100
 meat and adapt to any climate 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.590
 but the national production does not reach 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.450
 to supply the domestic market so 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.450
 that every six months matter to our 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.100
 country little more than twelve thousand kilos of meat 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.350
 in quantity that they hope to cover 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.480
 domestic producers to then be able to 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.030
 export costa rica imports meat 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.459
 which means that there is a deficit that 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.610
 is not being taken care of then the idea 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.129
 in principle it is possible to replace these 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.010
 imports and according to the largest sector 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.599
 it matures and grows is that 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.599
 production may even 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:39.120
 exportable levels 8 years ago in the coast 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:43.610
 rich was produced forgiveness were imported 88 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.280
 tons of lamb meat 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:50.030
 to satisfy the entire market in a 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.670
 year are currently being imported 2 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.640
 tons approximately between kim 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.130
 between 1.5 and 2 tons of meat 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.410
 monthly the southern goats 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.690
 because it takes strength in the country there is a 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.700
 average of 7 thousand heads destined to 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.610
 the production of milk and cheese according to 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.860
 hey the goats give milk practically 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.050
 all year since after his first 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.510
 childbirth are milked until they return to 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.820
 have breeding this is by an average of 8 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.650
 years that is the lifespan this has 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.080
 generated that entrepreneurs see the idea of 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.840
 create milk powder and say you're 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.680
 in the northern zone after this day of the 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.600
 party can already be 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.810
 put to milking 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.599
 up to 79 months 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.300
 you are charged, the 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:40.440
 cabro 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.960
 and he is given two or three more months of 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.020
 milking that are already drying so 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.760
 dan rests two or three months and another 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.970
 once after couples with the same 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.920
 sequence the sheep and goats are in and 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.110
 is bull fairies or in small 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.880
 enclosures to prevent them from acquiring 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.350
 parasites or any type of disease 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.230
 so the fields are 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.330
 practically without animals 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.129
 meadows how are you from where the 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.720
 feeding both for the goats as 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.400
 also the sheep which 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.530
 they find it under cover first by 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.330
 security issues and second for 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.340
 improve the quality of meat in the 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.829
 sheep and also increase production 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.750
 of milk in the case of goats 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.699
 goat milk producers ensure 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.130
 that it is digested in only 20 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.740
 minutes and they contain much less lactose 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.840
 in the case of the sheep their meat have 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.699
 less fat which increases the number of 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.860
 consumers before that the institute 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.229
 national learning and senasa 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.080
 they made an agreement to support the 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:39.900
 producers and thus increase production 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.300
 in terms of the sanitary what is done 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.370
 is to design health programs for 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.310
 than to control the diseases that 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.680
 may be present in the country and 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.770
 designing research studies 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.350
 national level 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.270
 establish sanitary barriers in the 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.360
 sense that if you were going to import 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.130
 animals or genetic material so that 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.490
 comply with the standards set forth in 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.170
 international level true and also 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.850
 prevent the entry of diseases that 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.070
 can come to harm the health of the 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.840
 national story the activity or my 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.720
 goat is magnified to such a degree that 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.510
 this 2013 they will realize the first expo 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.800
 Goat and Costa Rica from 7 to 8 of 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.500
 December the technical university 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.660
 national in Athens where producers of 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.760
 other countries will show their animals and 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.830
 also prepare dishes so 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.830
 stimulate consumption in costa rica
