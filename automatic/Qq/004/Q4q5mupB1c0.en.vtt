I am so we're going to talk about

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.490 
I am so we're going to talk about
getting<00:00:37.220> antler<00:00:37.850> set<00:00:38.449> up<00:00:38.600> here<00:00:39.050> on<00:00:39.199> the<00:00:39.320> lathe

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
getting antler set up here on the lathe

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.410 
getting antler set up here on the lathe
so<00:00:39.769> one<00:00:40.309> of<00:00:40.339> the<00:00:40.489> things<00:00:40.730> I've<00:00:40.910> done<00:00:41.120> with<00:00:41.180> the

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
so one of the things I've done with the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.619 
so one of the things I've done with the
antler<00:00:41.719> so<00:00:41.960> far<00:00:42.320> is<00:00:42.680> I<00:00:43.250> cut<00:00:43.520> a<00:00:43.550> chunk<00:00:43.969> off<00:00:44.239> the

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
antler so far is I cut a chunk off the

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.630 
antler so far is I cut a chunk off the
end<00:00:44.780> of<00:00:45.020> a<00:00:45.110> piece<00:00:45.469> of<00:00:45.649> antler<00:00:45.950> then<00:00:46.430> you'll

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
end of a piece of antler then you'll

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.670 
end of a piece of antler then you'll
find<00:00:46.940> you<00:00:47.090> can<00:00:47.239> cut<00:00:47.570> antler<00:00:47.899> on<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.170> bandsaw

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
find you can cut antler on the bandsaw

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.430 
find you can cut antler on the bandsaw
so<00:00:49.340> I<00:00:49.399> clip<00:00:49.969> this<00:00:50.149> off<00:00:50.420> to<00:00:50.660> length<00:00:50.930> and<00:00:51.140> because

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
so I clip this off to length and because

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.830 
so I clip this off to length and because
I<00:00:51.469> was<00:00:51.739> going<00:00:51.860> to<00:00:51.949> turn<00:00:52.250> it<00:00:52.489> I<00:00:52.699> was<00:00:53.180> looking<00:00:53.600> for

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
I was going to turn it I was looking for

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.830 
I was going to turn it I was looking for
a<00:00:53.870> piece<00:00:54.199> that<00:00:54.260> was<00:00:55.070> fairly<00:00:55.609> straight<00:00:55.969> so<00:00:56.300> this

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
a piece that was fairly straight so this

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.020 
a piece that was fairly straight so this
is<00:00:56.989> a<00:00:57.020> piece<00:00:57.260> of<00:00:57.440> antler<00:00:57.770> that's<00:00:58.129> got<00:00:58.309> a<00:00:58.340> pretty

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
is a piece of antler that's got a pretty

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.540 
is a piece of antler that's got a pretty
good<00:00:59.210> straight<00:00:59.750> access<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.500> it<00:01:00.649> now<00:01:01.280> if<00:01:01.430> we

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
good straight access to it now if we

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.639 
good straight access to it now if we
look<00:01:01.670> at<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:01.940> inside<00:01:02.390> of<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.629> antler<00:01:03.019> you<00:01:03.469> can

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
look at the inside of the antler you can

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.100 
look at the inside of the antler you can
see<00:01:03.920> that<00:01:04.129> it's<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.820> little<00:01:05.180> bit<00:01:05.300> soft<00:01:05.600> inside

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
see that it's a little bit soft inside

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.380 
see that it's a little bit soft inside
there<00:01:06.470> so<00:01:07.039> what<00:01:07.250> we'll<00:01:07.399> do<00:01:07.550> is<00:01:07.729> kind<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.210> stay

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
there so what we'll do is kind of stay

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.790 
there so what we'll do is kind of stay
away<00:01:08.420> from<00:01:08.660> that<00:01:08.960> we're<00:01:09.080> primarily<00:01:09.320> going<00:01:09.740> to

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
away from that we're primarily going to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.190 
away from that we're primarily going to
work<00:01:09.979> on<00:01:10.190> turn<00:01:10.429> on<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.670> outside<00:01:11.179> stay<00:01:11.960> away

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
work on turn on the outside stay away

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.520 
work on turn on the outside stay away
from<00:01:12.259> the<00:01:12.560> spongy<00:01:12.979> antler<00:01:13.430> inside<00:01:14.270> as<00:01:15.170> it<00:01:15.380> goes

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
from the spongy antler inside as it goes

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.990 
from the spongy antler inside as it goes
on<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.770> lathe<00:01:15.979> what<00:01:16.250> I'll<00:01:16.340> do<00:01:16.549> is<00:01:16.700> get<00:01:16.850> the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
on the lathe what I'll do is get the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.590 
on the lathe what I'll do is get the
antler<00:01:17.330> inside<00:01:17.810> this<00:01:18.080> four<00:01:18.380> jaw<00:01:18.650> Chuck<00:01:18.680> and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
antler inside this four jaw Chuck and

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.270 
antler inside this four jaw Chuck and
what<00:01:20.600> we<00:01:20.720> need<00:01:20.900> to<00:01:20.930> do<00:01:21.140> is<00:01:21.290> mess<00:01:21.650> with<00:01:21.890> it<00:01:22.040> just

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
what we need to do is mess with it just

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.999 
what we need to do is mess with it just
a<00:01:22.490> little<00:01:22.820> bit<00:01:23.000> to<00:01:23.689> try<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:23.900> get<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.259> antler<00:01:24.770> as

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
a little bit to try to get the antler as

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.490 
a little bit to try to get the antler as
centered<00:01:25.850> as<00:01:26.000> possible<00:01:26.090> here<00:01:26.990> on<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.290> lathe

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
centered as possible here on the lathe

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.260 
centered as possible here on the lathe
so<00:01:27.829> I'm<00:01:28.430> going<00:01:28.610> to<00:01:28.640> tighten<00:01:29.060> her<00:01:29.150> down<00:01:31.270> and

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
so I'm going to tighten her down and

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.910 
so I'm going to tighten her down and
then<00:01:32.479> just<00:01:32.509> kind<00:01:32.930> of<00:01:33.020> spin<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.470> antler<00:01:33.770> by

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
then just kind of spin the antler by

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.130 
then just kind of spin the antler by
hand<00:01:34.159> so<00:01:34.340> what<00:01:34.460> I'm<00:01:34.579> doing<00:01:34.909> is<00:01:35.060> as<00:01:35.240> I<00:01:35.720> turn<00:01:35.960> this

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
hand so what I'm doing is as I turn this

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.200 
hand so what I'm doing is as I turn this
by<00:01:36.350> hand<00:01:36.590> I'm<00:01:36.860> looking<00:01:37.250> through<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.549> at<00:01:37.909> the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
by hand I'm looking through it at the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.770 
by hand I'm looking through it at the
floor<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:39.229> see<00:01:39.680> if<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.640> antler<00:01:41.149> is<00:01:41.180> little

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
floor to see if the antler is little

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.539 
floor to see if the antler is little
rule<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:42.290> know<00:01:42.409> if<00:01:42.530> it's<00:01:42.649> bouncing<00:01:43.070> around

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
rule you know if it's bouncing around

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.069 
rule you know if it's bouncing around
if<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:44.090> antler<00:01:44.390> looks<00:01:44.630> like<00:01:44.750> it's<00:01:44.899> running

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
if the antler looks like it's running

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.710 
if the antler looks like it's running
pretty<00:01:45.350> straight<00:01:45.880> then<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:47.060> think<00:01:47.270> I'm<00:01:47.479> pretty

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
pretty straight then I think I'm pretty

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.359 
pretty straight then I think I'm pretty
straight<00:01:48.049> on<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.320> lathe<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:48.770> let's<00:01:48.950> go<00:01:49.100> ahead

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
straight on the lathe so let's go ahead

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.200 
straight on the lathe so let's go ahead
and<00:01:49.549> snug<00:01:50.390> down<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:50.990> four<00:01:51.290> jaw<00:01:51.590> Chuck<00:01:52.210> now

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
and snug down that four jaw Chuck now

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.039 
and snug down that four jaw Chuck now
antler<00:01:53.719> is<00:01:53.750> pretty<00:01:54.140> hard<00:01:54.380> stuff<00:01:55.719> so<00:01:56.719> if<00:01:56.899> you're

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
antler is pretty hard stuff so if you're

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.929 
antler is pretty hard stuff so if you're
going<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.350> turn<00:01:57.500> this<00:01:57.799> you<00:01:58.310> want<00:01:58.490> to<00:01:58.549> use<00:01:58.610> high

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
going to turn this you want to use high

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.539 
going to turn this you want to use high
speed<00:01:58.969> steel<00:01:59.630> chisels<00:02:00.079> not<00:02:00.590> tool<00:02:00.890> steel<00:02:01.280> and

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
speed steel chisels not tool steel and

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.340 
speed steel chisels not tool steel and
they're<00:02:02.270> going<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.479> hold<00:02:02.659> their<00:02:02.869> edge<00:02:03.020> against

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
they're going to hold their edge against

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.980 
they're going to hold their edge against
that<00:02:03.560> antler<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:03.950> whole<00:02:04.280> lot<00:02:04.520> longer<00:02:04.759> than<00:02:05.119> tool

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
that antler a whole lot longer than tool

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.380 
that antler a whole lot longer than tool
steel<00:02:06.350> would<00:02:06.680> now<00:02:07.340> as<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.610> position<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:08.179> tool

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
steel would now as you position the tool

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.630 
steel would now as you position the tool
rest<00:02:08.810> you<00:02:09.649> want<00:02:09.769> to<00:02:09.920> be<00:02:10.009> careful<00:02:10.429> because<00:02:10.549> of

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
rest you want to be careful because of

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.850 
rest you want to be careful because of
course<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.090> antler<00:02:11.450> is<00:02:11.630> just<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.350> little<00:02:12.709> bit

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
course the antler is just a little bit

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.729 
course the antler is just a little bit
funky<00:02:13.340> shaped<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.510> being<00:02:14.780> clear<00:02:15.110> on<00:02:15.140> one<00:02:15.500> side

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
funky shaped so being clear on one side

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.140 
funky shaped so being clear on one side
doesn't<00:02:16.040> mean<00:02:16.250> you're<00:02:16.400> going<00:02:16.489> to<00:02:16.549> be<00:02:16.639> clear<00:02:17.030> of

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
doesn't mean you're going to be clear of

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.590 
doesn't mean you're going to be clear of
the<00:02:17.209> work<00:02:17.389> on<00:02:17.660> all<00:02:18.440> sides<00:02:18.850> so<00:02:19.850> be<00:02:20.030> real<00:02:20.269> careful

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
the work on all sides so be real careful

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.190 
the work on all sides so be real careful
about<00:02:21.019> that

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
about that

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.900 
about that
now<00:02:24.200> we<00:02:24.260> got<00:02:24.440> kind<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:24.770> a<00:02:24.860> tenuous<00:02:25.220> hold<00:02:25.640> here

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
now we got kind of a tenuous hold here

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.850 
now we got kind of a tenuous hold here
with<00:02:26.060> our<00:02:26.210> four<00:02:26.450> jaw<00:02:26.690> Chuck<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.560> want<00:02:27.770> to

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
with our four jaw Chuck so you want to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.250 
with our four jaw Chuck so you want to
take<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.190> nice<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:28.550> easy<00:02:28.940> on<00:02:29.240> your<00:02:29.630> passes<00:02:30.110> on

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260

the<00:02:30.380> antler<00:02:30.770> just<00:02:31.370> real<00:02:31.760> light<00:02:32.120> cuts<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.750> little

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
the antler just real light cuts a little

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.080 
the antler just real light cuts a little
bit<00:02:33.560> at<00:02:33.710> a<00:02:33.800> time<00:02:33.830> as<00:02:34.310> we<00:02:34.490> work<00:02:34.700> our<00:02:34.910> way<00:02:34.940> down

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
bit at a time as we work our way down

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.180 
bit at a time as we work our way down
I'm<00:02:35.900> going<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.170> start<00:02:36.410> on<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.680> antler<00:02:37.010> with

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
I'm going to start on the antler with

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.220 
I'm going to start on the antler with
just<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.520> half-inch<00:02:37.970> bowl<00:02:38.240> gouge<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.810> we'll

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
just a half-inch bowl gouge and we'll

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:59.230 
just a half-inch bowl gouge and we'll
get<00:02:39.380> that<00:02:39.560> cleaned<00:02:40.070> up<00:02:40.220> just<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.490> little<00:02:40.520> bit<00:02:58.240> my

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
get that cleaned up just a little bit my

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.080 
get that cleaned up just a little bit my
least<00:02:59.480> favorite<00:02:59.870> part<00:03:00.020> of<00:03:00.200> antler<00:03:00.530> is<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.970> it

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
least favorite part of antler is that it

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.850 
least favorite part of antler is that it
smells<00:03:02.420> like<00:03:02.540> your<00:03:02.780> worst<00:03:02.960> trip<00:03:03.290> ever<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.770> the

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
smells like your worst trip ever to the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:13.750 
smells like your worst trip ever to the
dentist<00:03:11.800> all<00:03:12.800> right<00:03:12.980> let's<00:03:13.190> stop<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.550> have<00:03:13.700> a

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
dentist all right let's stop and have a

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.430 
dentist all right let's stop and have a
look<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.030> see<00:03:14.210> what<00:03:14.360> our<00:03:14.390> antler<00:03:14.900> looks<00:03:15.170> like

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
look and see what our antler looks like

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.770 
look and see what our antler looks like
and<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.280> think<00:03:16.490> we<00:03:16.580> can<00:03:16.730> do<00:03:16.820> a<00:03:16.850> good<00:03:17.120> reposition

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
and I think we can do a good reposition

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.420 
and I think we can do a good reposition
on<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.020> tool<00:03:18.200> rest<00:03:18.500> here<00:03:19.810> in<00:03:20.860> that<00:03:21.860> cool<00:03:22.130> the

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
on the tool rest here in that cool the

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.970 
on the tool rest here in that cool the
antler<00:03:23.300> is<00:03:23.330> starting<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.750> get<00:03:23.840> exposed<00:03:24.320> inside

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
antler is starting to get exposed inside

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.640 
antler is starting to get exposed inside
there<00:03:25.460> so<00:03:25.940> what's<00:03:26.210> neat<00:03:26.540> is<00:03:26.810> we<00:03:27.020> can<00:03:27.410> leave<00:03:27.620> a

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
there so what's neat is we can leave a

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.740 
there so what's neat is we can leave a
little<00:03:28.010> bit<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.520> antler<00:03:28.850> exterior<00:03:29.540> where

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
little bit of the antler exterior where

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.560 
little bit of the antler exterior where
it's<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:30.080> knobby<00:03:30.410> but<00:03:31.190> then<00:03:31.340> also<00:03:31.550> expose<00:03:32.210> some

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
it's so knobby but then also expose some

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.380 
it's so knobby but then also expose some
of<00:03:32.600> that<00:03:32.780> nice<00:03:33.050> hard<00:03:33.950> work<00:03:34.220> inside<00:03:34.700> there<00:03:35.000> I'll

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
of that nice hard work inside there I'll

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.330 
of that nice hard work inside there I'll
do<00:03:35.480> a<00:03:35.540> little<00:03:35.750> bit<00:03:35.900> more<00:03:35.930> cutting<00:03:36.320> then<00:03:37.160> we'll

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
do a little bit more cutting then we'll

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.220 
do a little bit more cutting then we'll
have<00:03:37.520> a<00:03:37.550> look<00:03:38.030> at<00:03:38.240> what<00:03:38.420> it<00:03:38.540> takes<00:03:38.750> to<00:03:38.930> sand

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
have a look at what it takes to sand

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:49.440 
have a look at what it takes to sand
antler<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:39.800> get<00:03:39.920> it<00:03:40.010> real<00:03:40.220> pretty

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.670 

I'm<00:03:50.450> not<00:03:50.659> sure<00:03:50.870> yet<00:03:51.049> what<00:03:51.290> I'm<00:03:51.409> going<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.590> use

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
I'm not sure yet what I'm going to use

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.070 
I'm not sure yet what I'm going to use
this<00:03:52.010> particular<00:03:52.489> piece<00:03:52.700> of<00:03:52.730> antler<00:03:53.390> for<00:03:53.810> I

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
this particular piece of antler for I

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.690 
this particular piece of antler for I
just<00:03:54.349> want<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.680> use<00:03:54.799> it<00:03:54.950> as<00:03:55.040> an<00:03:55.190> example<00:03:55.310> to

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
just want to use it as an example to

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.100 
just want to use it as an example to
show<00:03:55.940> you<00:03:55.970> what<00:03:56.209> working<00:03:56.450> with<00:03:56.690> antler<00:03:57.080> is

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
show you what working with antler is

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.759 
show you what working with antler is
like<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:57.709> I'm<00:03:58.159> going<00:03:58.340> to<00:03:58.370> leave<00:03:58.580> it<00:03:58.730> like<00:03:59.209> that

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
like so I'm going to leave it like that

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.979 
like so I'm going to leave it like that
for<00:04:00.769> right<00:04:00.980> now<00:04:01.010> but<00:04:01.909> let's<00:04:02.120> talk<00:04:02.329> about<00:04:02.390> sand

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
for right now but let's talk about sand

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.509
