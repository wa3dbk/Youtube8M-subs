not final Windows Phone 7 hardware or
software<00:00:19.160> we're<00:00:20.160> just<00:00:20.340> showing<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.730> how<00:00:20.760> it

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
software we're just showing you how it

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.929 
software we're just showing you how it
is<00:00:21.420> now<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.350> let's<00:00:22.529> talk<00:00:22.680> about<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.070> Bing<00:00:23.279> Maps

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
is now so let's talk about the Bing Maps

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.490 
is now so let's talk about the Bing Maps
application<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.019> very<00:00:25.260> similar

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
application this is a very similar

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.259 
application this is a very similar
application<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.550> what<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.820> get<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.090> other

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
application to what you get on other

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.630 
application to what you get on other
platforms<00:00:27.599> from<00:00:28.080> Google<00:00:28.439> Maps<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.859> from<00:00:29.429> Bing

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
platforms from Google Maps and from Bing

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.460 
platforms from Google Maps and from Bing
so<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.300> allows<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.810> search<00:00:31.109> for<00:00:31.349> places

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
so it allows you to search for places

allows you to see traffic and all that

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.340 
allows you to see traffic and all that
sort<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.820> stuff<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.420> let's<00:00:36.630> talk<00:00:36.809> about<00:00:37.020> that

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
sort of stuff so let's talk about that

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.760 
sort of stuff so let's talk about that
now

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
now

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.740 
now
on<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.219> most<00:00:38.370> basic<00:00:38.460> level<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.360> Maps

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
on the most basic level it is a Maps

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.810 
on the most basic level it is a Maps
application<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.710> lets<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:40.950> see<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.700> know

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
and how to get to certain places we can

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.209 
and how to get to certain places we can
also<00:00:45.960> turn<00:00:46.379> on<00:00:46.680> an<00:00:46.950> aerial<00:00:47.579> view<00:00:49.100> just<00:00:50.100> like

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
also turn on an aerial view just like

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.819 
also turn on an aerial view just like
you<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.550> do<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.969> Google<00:00:51.120> Maps<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:52.260> Bing

you can do in Google Maps and in Bing
Maps<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.280> other<00:00:53.489> platforms<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.239> here's<00:00:54.449> an

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
Maps on other platforms so here's an

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.869 
Maps on other platforms so here's an
aerial<00:00:54.899> view<00:00:54.930> we'll<00:00:55.469> go<00:00:55.590> back<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.340> area<00:00:56.730> or

we'll go back to the maps view and turn

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.189 
we'll go back to the maps view and turn
on<00:00:59.460> traffic<00:01:00.030> although<00:01:00.510> traffic's<00:01:00.899> already

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
that there is no congestion and then you

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.929 
that there is no congestion and then you
get<00:01:10.860> red<00:01:11.159> which<00:01:11.369> means<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.790> there<00:01:11.909> is
