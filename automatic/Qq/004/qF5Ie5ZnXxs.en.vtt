00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.960
 good I'll explain how to clean 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.720
 your applications mobile 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.410
 unnecessary with a very useful application 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.889
 what's called system clean, we're going to 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.889
 run 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.710
 well and I have it executed so we 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.869
 let's go first to settings and we're going 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.910
 to remove this option that ultimately ends 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.800
 being heavy because it tones you in each 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.710
 installation that you do and does not work for 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.370
 nothing with which this we leave it such 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.280
 which and if you think it will mark you use a 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.940
 restart not fast remove it because 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.580
 It is also very uncomfortable and it does not work 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.479
 alright then here we have the 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:51.100
 applications and let's see what you see this 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:55.150
 car in lilac because that means that 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.519
 that car starts with what we are going to see 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.729
 for example in this we keep the finger 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.530
 pressed and we get a menu and I do not 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.740
 I want it to start every time 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.970
 ripped the pc there is the mobile sorry so 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.909
 what am I going to give to disable 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.190
 automatic execution I'm going to mark 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:16.250
 this and save 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.920
 theoretically now this program does not 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.710
 should start every time the 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.420
 Mobile is sometimes not enough and still 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.170
 pulling from the same but many others 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.540
 Sometimes it really shuts down afterwards 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.360
 example here when we see six stretches 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.900
 move simply means that it 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.210
 You can delete without affecting the system 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.460
 operating obviously drop because it's 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.650
 an application that has installed me or it 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.560
 installs everyone and obviously 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.130
 you can erase that we already know but 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.770
 there are system applications 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.920
 that for example we do not know it unless 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.399
 I put it here for example services 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:02.250
 in could also be done so let's go 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.250
 do let's freeze 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.540
 disabling the application is the same 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.310
 what's on the android jb and kitkat for 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:14.410
 disable the but we do it from 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.410
 here disable 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.880
 Well I just disabled services if 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.690
 I should go to the right menu 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.970
 frozen so we move here and all 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.730
 these are the ones that blocked and I for 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.909
 stop them starting 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.209
 to the photos in live wallpaper the mail 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:40.730
 because I use other wallpapers 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.280
 the launchers that come with a 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.080
 cyanogenmod not serve me 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.500
 browser as I already have another I've 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.590
 removed the original factory news 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.590
 of time I 've never used you picasa 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.360
 a blogger never climb the picasa 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.230
 eckstein service do not serve me because 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.530
 I have disabled is the mail by 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.890
 defect and the keyboard because it gives me also 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.060
 the removed because I have another keyboard with 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.110
 which here will come all the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.530
 frozen 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.290
 then it also allows you to make a 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.990
 backup good move them from replication the 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.600
 SD card 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:30.190
 or make a backup that is 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:34.180
 here full copy or copy only the 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.780
 data or copy them or remember this 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.940
 application 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.900
 so if you make a complete copy it 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.900
 I should make a backup 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.430
 After show application of such as 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.500
 go to the properties of the application 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.530
 here we have the options to force the 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.150
 attention uninstall enable 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:04:01.120
 privacy this is because it is a rom 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:04.510
 erase data erase cache and permissions 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.480
 after more has the option to 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.519
 to be able to move the application and make it 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.879
 if off system with this option 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.870
 here move the application to the system what 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.680
 what does he do 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.009
 turn it into an application of 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.729
 system and that in some applications you 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:24.000
 gives 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:27.090
 more power to do things within 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.310
 android if a system is comfortable and 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.729
 well basically these are the options 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.660
 most important and I hope that I have 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:38.720
 made clear 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.050
 then here sorry here has the clean up 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.130
 which is to clean the cache and the 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:49.640
 applications that we have deleted like this 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:52.010
 5 of the beat files not found because here 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.380
 they are applications that we have frozen today 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.930
 or we have deleted fabrics brand here as 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:01.010
 that serve us for nothing if we keep 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:04.750
 the push button we can clean the 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:07.300
 selected or clean all 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.480
 or ignore good simply and you do not see it 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.720
 pull back with which I hope that 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:17.650
 it has become clear to you that the good ones are 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.800
 the 6th oars and in others they explain to you that 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.800
 make 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.440
 Greetings until soon
