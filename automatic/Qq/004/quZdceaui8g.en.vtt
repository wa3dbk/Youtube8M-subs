00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
liberty of loosening up the cover and we

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:03.369 
liberty of loosening up the cover and we
try<00:01:00.739> to<00:01:00.800> place<00:01:01.070> things<00:01:01.309> in<00:01:01.550> a<00:01:02.170> spot<00:01:03.170> where

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
try to place things in a spot where

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.810 
try to place things in a spot where
you're<00:01:03.499> going<00:01:03.649> to<00:01:03.739> remember<00:01:04.010> what<00:01:06.159> you<00:01:07.159> did

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.440 

this<00:01:10.820> right<00:01:11.060> here<00:01:11.299> is<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:12.680> fastener<00:01:13.450> that

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
this right here is the fastener that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:22.620 
this right here is the fastener that
goes<00:01:14.689> on<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.229> I<00:01:15.770> guess<00:01:16.549> this<00:01:16.729> is<00:01:16.880> an<00:01:17.000> exhaust

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.499 

hose<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:23.990> want<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:24.850> separate<00:01:25.850> that<00:01:26.090> that<00:01:26.329> goes

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
hose you want to separate that that goes

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.560 
hose you want to separate that that goes
over<00:01:26.869> to<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.140> filter<00:01:28.299> so<00:01:29.299> it's<00:01:29.420> really

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
over to the filter so it's really

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.030 
over to the filter so it's really
nothing<00:01:29.750> really<00:01:30.020> electrical<00:01:30.590> attached<00:01:30.829> to

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
nothing really electrical attached to

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.709 
nothing really electrical attached to
that<00:01:31.219> except<00:01:31.460> for<00:01:31.490> that<00:01:31.670> sensor<00:01:32.060> that<00:01:32.420> I've

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
that except for that sensor that I've

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.560 
that except for that sensor that I've
disconnected<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:35.290> coal<00:01:36.290> packs<00:01:36.590> or

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
disconnected the coal packs or

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:46.029 
disconnected the coal packs or
equivalent<00:01:38.570> to<00:01:38.689> spark<00:01:39.079> plug<00:01:39.640> wires<00:01:45.039> our

housed<00:01:46.579> in<00:01:46.939> this<00:01:48.549> compartment<00:01:49.549> here<00:01:49.850> this<00:01:50.270> is

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
housed in this compartment here this is

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.440 
housed in this compartment here this is
Bank<00:01:50.750> number<00:01:50.990> one<00:01:51.380> that<00:01:51.619> I'm<00:01:51.710> working<00:01:51.950> on<00:01:52.450> in

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
Bank number one that I'm working on in

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.569 
Bank number one that I'm working on in
front<00:01:53.719> of<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.899> engine<00:01:54.049> one<00:01:54.860> two<00:01:55.159> three<00:01:55.460> and

front of the engine one two three and

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.730 
front of the engine one two three and
four<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:58.009> other<00:01:58.159> side<00:01:58.490> is<00:01:58.670> over<00:01:58.909> there

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
four and the other side is over there

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.620 
four and the other side is over there
I'll<00:02:01.220> show<00:02:01.400> you<00:02:01.460> that<00:02:01.640> in<00:02:01.700> a<00:02:01.790> second<00:02:04.630> I've

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
I'll show you that in a second I've

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.680 
I'll show you that in a second I've
disconnected<00:02:06.500> everything<00:02:06.860> because<00:02:07.610> I<00:02:08.240> just

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
disconnected everything because I just

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.560 
disconnected everything because I just
felt<00:02:08.810> like<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.080> was<00:02:09.200> safer<00:02:09.530> but<00:02:10.429> these<00:02:10.820> connect

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
felt like it was safer but these connect

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.480 
felt like it was safer but these connect
directly<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:14.740> spark<00:02:15.740> plugs<00:02:15.980> or<00:02:16.220> coil

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
directly to the spark plugs or coil

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:25.510 
directly to the spark plugs or coil
packs<00:02:21.190> they're<00:02:22.190> screwed<00:02:22.550> in<00:02:24.100> with<00:02:25.100> this<00:02:25.310> seven

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
packs they're screwed in with this seven

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.330 
packs they're screwed in with this seven
millimeter<00:02:26.180> bolt<00:02:27.520> right<00:02:28.520> here<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.980> you<00:02:31.040> just

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
millimeter bolt right here so you just

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
millimeter bolt right here so you just
take<00:02:31.550> those<00:02:31.760> out<00:02:33.130> wiggle<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:35.270> will

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
take those out wiggle it and it will

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.300 
take those out wiggle it and it will
come<00:02:35.540> out<00:02:36.520> so<00:02:37.520> if<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:37.790> look<00:02:37.940> at<00:02:38.060> this<00:02:38.239> part

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
come out so if you look at this part

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.160 
come out so if you look at this part
this<00:02:40.310> look<00:02:40.520> is<00:02:40.550> exactly<00:02:41.000> like<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.390> hose<00:02:41.600> that

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
this look is exactly like the hose that

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.570 
this look is exactly like the hose that
you<00:02:42.410> connect<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.720> spark<00:02:44.720> plug<00:02:44.780> which<00:02:45.200> is

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
you connect to the spark plug which is

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.800 
you connect to the spark plug which is
down<00:02:46.580> in<00:02:46.610> there<00:02:47.000> well<00:02:47.720> if<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.930> can<00:02:48.080> see<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.440> but

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
down in there well if you can see it but

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:59.140 
down in there well if you can see it but
it's<00:02:50.810> down<00:02:51.080> in<00:02:51.290> there<00:02:56.320> yeah<00:02:57.320> see<00:02:57.850> little<00:02:58.850> spark

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
it's down in there yeah see little spark

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.380 
it's down in there yeah see little spark
plug<00:02:59.390> down<00:02:59.720> in<00:02:59.900> there

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.819 

anyway<00:03:07.840> everybody<00:03:08.840> says<00:03:09.110> take<00:03:09.379> them<00:03:09.530> off<00:03:09.680> in

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
anyway everybody says take them off in

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.460 
anyway everybody says take them off in
order<00:03:10.159> but<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:11.110> couldn't<00:03:12.110> find<00:03:12.260> anything

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
order but I couldn't find anything

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.069 
order but I couldn't find anything
online<00:03:12.829> that<00:03:13.430> shows<00:03:14.120> me<00:03:14.329> the<00:03:14.480> order<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:14.930> them

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
online that shows me the order of them

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.149 
online that shows me the order of them
they<00:03:15.200> just<00:03:15.230> say<00:03:15.500> bank<00:03:15.739> to<00:03:15.980> bank<00:03:16.280> one<00:03:16.549> in<00:03:16.700> bank<00:03:16.909> -

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 
they just say bank to bank one in bank -

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.330 
they just say bank to bank one in bank -
I'm<00:03:19.159> pretty<00:03:19.370> sure<00:03:19.549> the<00:03:19.670> manual<00:03:20.060> has<00:03:20.299> it<00:03:20.540> in<00:03:21.340> in

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
I'm pretty sure the manual has it in in

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.149
