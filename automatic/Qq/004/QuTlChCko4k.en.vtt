00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
actually turning that screw inside you

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.770

might<00:01:29.740> can<00:01:29.920> see<00:01:30.130> that<00:01:30.340> turn<00:01:30.580> right<00:01:30.909> there<00:01:31.240> left

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
might can see that turn right there left

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.320 
might can see that turn right there left
or<00:01:32.500> right<00:01:32.560> now<00:01:33.430> I'm<00:01:33.490> not<00:01:33.670> sure<00:01:33.909> if<00:01:34.030> it's<00:01:34.180> going

to be left or right which makes your
picture<00:01:36.400> bigger<00:01:36.640> you<00:01:37.330> can<00:01:37.510> do<00:01:37.690> this<00:01:37.900> with<00:01:38.170> the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
picture bigger you can do this with the

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.859 
picture bigger you can do this with the
game<00:01:38.500> on<00:01:38.860> that's<00:01:39.580> why<00:01:39.820> we<00:01:40.030> use<00:01:40.270> this<00:01:40.510> plastic

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
game on that's why we use this plastic

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.760 
game on that's why we use this plastic
tool<00:01:41.409> in<00:01:41.770> order<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.909> do<00:01:43.090> that<00:01:43.299> with<00:01:43.650> so<00:01:44.650> you're

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
tool in order to do that with so you're

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.380 
tool in order to do that with so you're
going<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:44.950> turn<00:01:45.040> it<00:01:45.189> left<00:01:45.430> or<00:01:45.640> right<00:01:45.850> and<00:01:46.090> once

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
going to turn it left or right and once

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.469 
going to turn it left or right and once
your<00:01:46.600> screen<00:01:46.960> gets<00:01:47.290> smaller<00:01:47.680> or<00:01:48.040> bigger

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
your screen gets smaller or bigger

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.480 
your screen gets smaller or bigger
you'll<00:01:49.479> know<00:01:49.689> which<00:01:49.840> way<00:01:50.049> to<00:01:50.110> adjust<00:01:50.320> it<00:01:50.799> so

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
you'll know which way to adjust it so

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.789 
you'll know which way to adjust it so
you<00:01:51.580> use<00:01:51.760> it<00:01:51.790> like<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:52.330> now<00:01:52.990> let's<00:01:53.350> say<00:01:53.590> that

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
you use it like that now let's say that

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.850 
you use it like that now let's say that
you<00:01:53.979> don't<00:01:54.220> have<00:01:54.580> one<00:01:54.939> of<00:01:55.060> these<00:01:55.210> you<00:01:56.049> can<00:01:56.380> use

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
you don't have one of these you can use

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.899 
you don't have one of these you can use
an<00:01:57.100> Allen<00:01:57.580> wrench<00:01:57.610> and<00:01:58.619> or<00:01:59.619> something<00:02:00.580> like

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
an Allen wrench and or something like

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.359 
an Allen wrench and or something like
this<00:02:01.240> that<00:02:02.110> you<00:02:02.320> buy<00:02:02.500> at<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.770> local<00:02:02.799> hardware

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
this that you buy at the local hardware

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
store you can put that in there and turn

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.630
