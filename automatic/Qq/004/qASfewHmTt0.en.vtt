that's<00:04:52.410> when<00:04:52.620> Sinestro<00:04:53.040> remembered<00:04:53.460> the

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
that's when Sinestro remembered the

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.250 
that's when Sinestro remembered the
first<00:04:53.760> enemy<00:04:54.210> that<00:04:54.330> he<00:04:54.450> ever<00:04:54.630> met<00:04:54.900> as<00:04:55.020> a<00:04:55.080> Green

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
first enemy that he ever met as a Green

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.770 
first enemy that he ever met as a Green
Lantern<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:56.220> weaponers<00:04:56.640> of<00:04:56.820> cord<00:04:57.120> and<00:04:57.330> how

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
Lantern the weaponers of cord and how

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.290 
Lantern the weaponers of cord and how
they<00:04:57.930> lived<00:04:58.230> in<00:04:58.440> this<00:04:58.560> antimatter<00:04:59.010> universe

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
they lived in this antimatter universe

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.660 
they lived in this antimatter universe
so<00:05:00.300> he<00:05:00.450> sought<00:05:00.690> them<00:05:00.900> out<00:05:01.040> he<00:05:02.040> told<00:05:02.340> them<00:05:02.460> of<00:05:02.580> a

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
so he sought them out he told them of a

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.420 
so he sought them out he told them of a
great<00:05:02.970> power<00:05:03.270> of<00:05:03.570> fear<00:05:03.870> a<00:05:04.140> power<00:05:04.800> that<00:05:05.280> they

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
great power of fear a power that they

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.890 
great power of fear a power that they
could<00:05:05.580> use<00:05:05.700> against<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.300> Green<00:05:06.450> Lantern's

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
could use against the Green Lantern's

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.570 
could use against the Green Lantern's
because<00:05:07.170> it<00:05:07.290> was<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.590> one<00:05:07.800> weakness<00:05:08.250> of<00:05:08.430> the

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
because it was the one weakness of the

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.520 
because it was the one weakness of the
Green<00:05:08.760> Lantern<00:05:09.090> rings<00:05:09.410> using<00:05:10.410> their

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
Green Lantern rings using their

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.680 
Green Lantern rings using their
technology<00:05:10.860> they<00:05:11.490> were<00:05:11.610> able<00:05:11.850> to<00:05:12.000> forge<00:05:12.360> him<00:05:12.570> a

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
technology they were able to forge him a

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.870 
technology they were able to forge him a
yellow<00:05:13.020> power<00:05:13.290> battery<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:13.920> a<00:05:14.250> ring<00:05:14.490> that<00:05:14.760> was

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
yellow power battery and a ring that was

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.550 
yellow power battery and a ring that was
very<00:05:15.150> similar<00:05:15.510> to<00:05:15.690> the<00:05:15.810> Green<00:05:16.080> Lantern<00:05:16.380> ring

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
very similar to the Green Lantern ring

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.800 
very similar to the Green Lantern ring
but<00:05:17.280> one<00:05:17.580> that<00:05:17.700> would<00:05:17.820> be<00:05:17.880> filled<00:05:18.240> by<00:05:18.420> the<00:05:18.480> very

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
but one that would be filled by the very

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.690 
but one that would be filled by the very
thing<00:05:19.140> that<00:05:19.170> he<00:05:19.470> felt<00:05:19.770> could<00:05:19.950> bring<00:05:20.220> justice

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
thing that he felt could bring justice

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.210 
thing that he felt could bring justice
to<00:05:20.730> the<00:05:20.910> universe<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.990> yellow<00:05:22.230> light<00:05:22.500> of<00:05:22.680> fear

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
to the universe the yellow light of fear

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.550 
to the universe the yellow light of fear
from<00:05:24.030> there<00:05:24.240> Sinestro<00:05:24.840> built<00:05:25.050> up<00:05:25.200> his<00:05:25.290> core

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
from there Sinestro built up his core

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.380 
from there Sinestro built up his core
but<00:05:26.040> his<00:05:26.130> intentions<00:05:26.610> were<00:05:26.730> to<00:05:26.880> rule<00:05:27.150> with

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
but his intentions were to rule with

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.360 
but his intentions were to rule with
fear<00:05:27.630> and<00:05:27.780> a<00:05:27.870> militaristic<00:05:28.230> nature<00:05:28.830> not

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
fear and a militaristic nature not

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.640

actually<00:05:29.880> become<00:05:30.150> a<00:05:30.180> villain<00:05:30.480> due<00:05:31.200> to<00:05:31.320> this<00:05:31.440> he

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
actually become a villain due to this he

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.260 
actually become a villain due to this he
eventually<00:05:31.890> kills<00:05:32.340> off<00:05:32.520> his<00:05:32.730> own<00:05:32.940> entire

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
eventually kills off his own entire

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.880 
eventually kills off his own entire
Corps<00:05:33.690> when<00:05:34.200> they<00:05:34.290> turn<00:05:34.530> into<00:05:34.680> outright

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
Corps when they turn into outright

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.640 
Corps when they turn into outright
villains<00:05:35.520> in<00:05:35.610> his<00:05:35.730> absence<00:05:35.970> and<00:05:36.450> now<00:05:36.960> he<00:05:37.470> works

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
villains in his absence and now he works

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.070 
villains in his absence and now he works
as<00:05:37.890> more<00:05:38.100> of<00:05:38.160> an<00:05:38.250> antihero<00:05:38.790> than<00:05:39.030> anything<00:05:39.360> the

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
as more of an antihero than anything the

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.600 
as more of an antihero than anything the
powers<00:05:40.440> of<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:40.620> yellow<00:05:40.770> ring<00:05:41.010> are<00:05:41.130> basically

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
powers of the yellow ring are basically

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.490 
powers of the yellow ring are basically
the<00:05:41.790> same<00:05:41.820> thing<00:05:42.030> as<00:05:42.330> a<00:05:42.360> green<00:05:42.630> ring<00:05:42.900> but<00:05:43.380> it's

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
the same thing as a green ring but it's

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.170 
the same thing as a green ring but it's
more<00:05:43.680> based<00:05:43.890> on<00:05:44.160> fear<00:05:44.520> and<00:05:44.550> the<00:05:44.760> ability<00:05:45.150> to

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
more based on fear and the ability to

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.120 
more based on fear and the ability to
find<00:05:45.480> out<00:05:45.630> what<00:05:45.780> scares<00:05:46.080> a<00:05:46.140> person<00:05:46.560> and<00:05:46.680> use<00:05:47.010> it
