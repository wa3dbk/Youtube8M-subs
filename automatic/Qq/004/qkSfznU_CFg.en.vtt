hand<00:04:04.180> pick<00:04:04.599> any<00:04:04.780> note<00:04:05.049> from<00:04:05.260> C<00:04:05.560> D<00:04:05.859> or<00:04:05.890> E<00:04:11.430> what

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
hand pick any note from C D or E what

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.009 
hand pick any note from C D or E what
does<00:04:12.549> that<00:04:12.579> sound<00:04:12.879> like<00:04:13.030> boy<00:04:13.389> that<00:04:13.659> sounds

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
does that sound like boy that sounds

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.660 
does that sound like boy that sounds
kind<00:04:14.260> of<00:04:14.379> like<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.769> Space<00:04:15.069> Shuttle<00:04:15.099> they're

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
kind of like the Space Shuttle they're

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.140 
kind of like the Space Shuttle they're
talking<00:04:16.180> to<00:04:16.209> each<00:04:16.329> other<00:04:16.799> but<00:04:17.910> that's<00:04:18.910> a

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
talking to each other but that's a

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.699 
talking to each other but that's a
that's<00:04:19.389> a<00:04:19.539> theory<00:04:19.900> behind<00:04:20.079> this<00:04:20.410> kind<00:04:20.650> of

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
that's a theory behind this kind of

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.100 
that's a theory behind this kind of
exercise<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:22.090> notes<00:04:22.360> that<00:04:22.539> we<00:04:22.630> will<00:04:22.780> play

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
exercise the notes that we will play

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.580 
exercise the notes that we will play
they're<00:04:23.680> exactly<00:04:24.400> a<00:04:24.430> whole<00:04:24.910> notes<00:04:25.270> apart<00:04:25.780> from

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
they're exactly a whole notes apart from

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.460 
they're exactly a whole notes apart from
F<00:04:26.860> sharp<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.280> G<00:04:27.430> sharp<00:04:27.699> is<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.300> whole<00:04:28.780> notes<00:04:29.199> a

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
F sharp to G sharp is a whole notes a

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.750 
F sharp to G sharp is a whole notes a
whole<00:04:30.280> tone<00:04:30.900> so<00:04:31.900> they<00:04:32.139> are<00:04:32.340> whole<00:04:33.340> torn<00:04:33.639> apart

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
whole tone so they are whole torn apart

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.810 
whole tone so they are whole torn apart
from<00:04:34.210> here<00:04:34.510> to<00:04:34.720> here<00:04:35.050> mr.<00:04:35.410> Houghton<00:04:35.620> from<00:04:36.610> here

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
from here to here mr. Houghton from here

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.050 
from here to here mr. Houghton from here
to<00:04:37.030> here<00:04:37.330> is<00:04:37.479> also<00:04:37.780> a<00:04:37.810> hotel<00:04:38.380> so<00:04:39.130> that<00:04:39.370> is<00:04:39.580> a<00:04:39.880> the

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
to here is also a hotel so that is a the

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.390 
to here is also a hotel so that is a the
theory<00:04:40.419> behind<00:04:40.570> it<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.289> this<00:04:41.710> is<00:04:41.889> your<00:04:42.099> whole

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
theory behind it you this is your whole

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.189 
theory behind it you this is your whole
tone<00:04:42.789> skill<00:04:45.330> in<00:04:46.330> fact<00:04:46.630> you<00:04:46.690> can<00:04:46.870> start<00:04:47.110> with

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
tone skill in fact you can start with

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.290 
tone skill in fact you can start with
any<00:04:47.380> notes<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:48.099> pick<00:04:48.400> up<00:04:48.580> your<00:04:48.760> whole<00:04:49.000> tone

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
any notes and pick up your whole tone

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.969 
any notes and pick up your whole tone
let's<00:04:50.110> say<00:04:50.289> I<00:04:50.320> want<00:04:50.590> to<00:04:50.650> start<00:04:50.770> with<00:04:50.979> here

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
let's say I want to start with here

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.409 
let's say I want to start with here
there<00:04:53.979> will<00:04:54.099> be<00:04:54.130> a<00:04:54.250> whole<00:04:54.520> tone<00:04:54.789> from<00:04:55.030> D<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.270> E

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
there will be a whole tone from D to E

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.420 
there will be a whole tone from D to E
and<00:04:56.409> E<00:04:56.590> to<00:04:56.800> F<00:04:56.979> sharp<00:04:57.370> is<00:04:57.490> a<00:04:57.520> hotel

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
and E to F sharp is a hotel
