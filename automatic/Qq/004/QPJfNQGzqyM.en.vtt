00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.240
Hello, thanks for watching my channel!

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.900
There is one thing I envy Japanese people for

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.680
and that is their schools

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.280
They are so huge

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.180
Schools in Austria are really small

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.320
And in Japan all schools have a pool, baseball fields and stuff like that

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.400
I didn't have this in my school at all

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.780
Japanese school buildings are awesome

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.920
I envy the kids here

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.900
On the other hand, from what I heard about school here from friends...

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.540
...maybe Japanese kids would love our school system

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.800
A school day ends at 1 or 2 where I grew up

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.460
In high school too

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.300
In Japan there are "club activities" after school...

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.320
...but in Austria we go home after class at 1 or 2.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.660
And we don't have uniforms

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.980
I haven't seen a school uniform in Austria

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.840
Everyone wears what he likes

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.900
The next thing might be interesting for parents...

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.580
...school don't cost money

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.120
You need some money for the books and stuff

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.520
But no annual school fee

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.720
There was a fee in university...

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.280
but really cheap, like 300$ per semester.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.700
I think the clothing makes the biggest difference

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.740
In Japan, there are even rules about hairstyles or hair length

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.240
I heard that from friends

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.300
Also dying your hair is not allowed

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.960
In Austria you can do what you want

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.320
Also you can smoke when you're 16

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:25.020
So many students took smoking break together with the teachers

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.800
I do not smoke though

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.100
Many people wear their individual style in school

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.360
Like Lolita or Visual Kei in Japan

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.360
That is also ok in schools in Austria

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.600
I also had my very own style actually

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:58.180
This is a magazine my class made for graduation

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:05.280
The picture on the cover is from the year before graduation

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.820
High school is 4 years in Austria

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.020
Of course I am also on this picture

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.800
Can you see?

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.000
I am the guy dressed all in black in the center

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.620
With my cool necklace

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.700
And lots of accessories around my neck

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.340
All black, all serious

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.580
That was me!

00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:40.614
What do you think?

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.140
Going to school like this is OK in Austria

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.660
There's really a lot of freedom

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.960
First year in high school I didn't look like that yet

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.200
Can you find me?

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.780
I am the guy with the glasses and brown hair in the center

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.120
White shirt, green print

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.880
That's how I looked back then

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.800
Would you like to have your own clothes or school uniforms?

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:30.440
School uniforms are cute and many Japanese students also wear them on days without school

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.600
It's the same everyday but it looks neat

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.980
Many Japanese student like their uniforms a lot

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:49.800
Or would you like to chose what you wear?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.620
Both have pros and cons I guess

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.120
But I think there is too much freedom in Austrian schools

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.020
Japan might be strict and full of rules...

00:05:06.204 --> 00:05:09.424
...and a school day is long

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.400
Japanese student need to work really hard

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.760
But I think I would have liked being in a Japanese school

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:27.560
So that is it for today's video

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.900
Thanks for watching, stay tuned and have a nice day!
