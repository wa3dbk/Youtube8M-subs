skincare line that's organic and
all-natural<00:00:54.649> so<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.680> decide<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:55.980> want<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.309> try

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
all-natural so I decide I want to try

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.689 
all-natural so I decide I want to try
something<00:00:57.170> without<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.440> many<00:00:58.699> chemicals

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
something without as many chemicals

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.099 
something without as many chemicals
because<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.090> thought<00:01:00.390> maybe<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.719> would<00:01:00.960> be

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
because I thought maybe that would be

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.380 
because I thought maybe that would be
like<00:01:01.520> better<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.910> thought<00:01:03.059> maybe<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
like better I thought maybe the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.850 
like better I thought maybe the
chemicals<00:01:03.780> were<00:01:03.899> starting<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.409> take<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> toll

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
chemicals were starting to take a toll

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.130 
chemicals were starting to take a toll
on<00:01:04.920> my<00:01:05.129> skin<00:01:05.460> maybe<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.820> needed<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.240> stop<00:01:06.420> using

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
on my skin maybe I needed to stop using

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.750

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
produce on my face that sounded weird

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.140 
produce on my face that sounded weird
that<00:03:30.230> was<00:03:30.350> not

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
that was not

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.910 
that was not
the<00:03:31.480> best<00:03:31.659> way<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.840> put<00:03:32.049> it<00:03:32.110> but<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:32.620> can<00:03:32.769> make

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
the best way to put it but you can make

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.009 
the best way to put it but you can make
it<00:03:33.040> like<00:03:33.129> a<00:03:33.190> stick<00:03:33.610> as<00:03:33.730> you<00:03:33.849> want<00:03:34.060> or<00:03:34.360> as<00:03:34.390> creamy

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
it like a stick as you want or as creamy

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.430 
it like a stick as you want or as creamy
as<00:03:35.200> you<00:03:35.349> want<00:03:35.790> but<00:03:36.790> typically<00:03:37.299> just<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.110> equal

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
as you want but typically just the equal

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:49.850 
as you want but typically just the equal
portion<00:03:38.980> will<00:03:39.849> do<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.120> for<00:03:40.330> you

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.199 

and<00:03:50.860> now<00:03:51.010> I'm<00:03:51.340> going<00:03:51.489> to<00:03:51.550> leave<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:51.819> on<00:03:51.940> for

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
and now I'm going to leave it on for

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.089 
and now I'm going to leave it on for
probably<00:03:52.720> between<00:03:53.080> ten<00:03:53.290> and<00:03:53.319> fifteen<00:03:53.530> minutes

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
probably between ten and fifteen minutes

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.920 
probably between ten and fifteen minutes
if<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.849> are<00:03:54.940> someone<00:03:55.269> without<00:03:55.390> sensitive
