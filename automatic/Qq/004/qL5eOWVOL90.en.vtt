00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.280
 We are very satisfied with the game 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.920
 we really deserve it 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.000
 a good one with 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.240
 that was a very difficult game for 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.230
 us clear frankfurt its strong 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.539
 community and I think we are 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.270
 We are not completely satisfied today 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.250
 even more in it 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:29.939
 pity we had 2 yes but I think 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.199
 A draw is sufficient if served 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.399
 you look at it you are always 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.770
 still undefeated now in the second half 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.530
 It really shows that you are at the top 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.750
 I think so because of the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.090
 All injuries are injured 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.489
 we just mixed together and know 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.719
 we will do everything to order earlier 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.390
 and I think there is still 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.809
 hope, but we go by the game 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.949
 watch how it works 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.440
 I mean we always believed that 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.780
 we can do this together as well 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.199
 team and that has us closer 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.119
 brought and then we did and 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.520
 then never stopped 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.439
 we can be very satisfied with one 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.140
 taken away or left at home 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.970
 we finally had the last ones 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.590
 weeks no easy situation we 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.000
 many have injured now 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.960
 at the beginning also sara if one 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.580
 of course a shock too 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.070
 I think we will never be abandoned 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.409
 struggled to fall over and I think 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.119
 We are very happy with the point 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.890
 right after apple you were totally crazy 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.390
 broken the game went in the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.220
 final phase up and down again 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.360
 how fairest one to one who am 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.970
 maybe even more in the end 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.310
 been 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.200
 intense game yes we have, of course 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.860
 the latte still hit so it was 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.260
 chances 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.960
 that we win the game though 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.730
 Frankfurt partly had more of the 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.310
 So I think it's undecided 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.840
 meet was it for you as a team 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.490
 hard to find the rhythm again 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.190
 because now by the country break 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.500
 through the jordan journey for some, after all 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.030
 For a long time no game was clear 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.590
 it is always an interruption then 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.820
 get out of the rhythm a bit 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.730
 But that works in other teams 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.350
 even so you have to live with it and me 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.260
 think we have then quickly back in 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.150
 found and was no easy 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.640
 Opponents will ask today and I think 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.050
 so good on the general 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.010
 back round you are still looking 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.020
 undefeated 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.280
 What kind of feeling do you want 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.870
 the series would like to continue now 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.920
 is again up so at least on 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.080
 third place intervene 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.970
 yes we have a good series 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.640
 Of course we want to stay tuned 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.110
 want to win the next games 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.730
 Nevertheless, I still believe four 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.770
 points distance upwards so to 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.270
 next and yes we just want from 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.590
 play like a game just now 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.940
 also that we just try that 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.240
 win next game and then 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.410
 Let's see what comes out in the end 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.730
 when is the last time you have one? 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.150
 decisive goal shot 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.330
 I believe it last time in the 17th 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.010
 qualification to german 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.260
 championship then we are in the final 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.380
 but otherwise have a long time 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.550
 no longer very hectic very intense 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.120
 final phase how did you do that 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.950
 perceived 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.110
 I think I have not even given up 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.370
 We also continued to fight 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.890
 absolutely still at least in one point 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.640
 have and achieve the goal and 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.810
 Accordingly what I think deserves 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.420
 that we still made the goal 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.620
 You will first for the injury 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.209
 been changed 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.160
 how fast did you play then? 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.630
 believe after the goal then too was 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.239
 that actually so that bayern actually 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.340
 Almost the better team so on 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.019
 in the beginning what a shock still 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.019
 So also there when I yeah it 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.160
 Come in first shocked me 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.120
 but then quickly arrived and as soon as 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.280
 I was in the square then what 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.680
 actually forget everything and me then 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.970
 then concentrate on the game 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.230
 the clean sheet because we have again 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.019
 Absolutely wanted to put pressure 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.360
 at least point pick and have it 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.680
 then luckily managed here because 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.239
 so it will be in the square 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.370
 First of all many ball contacts was very 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.769
 present measures end the quasi 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.080
 the crucial goal is your role 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.200
 so yes I was definitely a lot of fun 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.280
 made playing positions like and one 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.720
 cool game when playing as a team 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.000
 just played great together and 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.860
 Everyone gave everything and thinks 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.570
 taken out today and so we do 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.590
 then still the gate straight in the 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.850
 back round you can see that yes you are 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.140
 still unbeaten you have in the 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.390
 principle had all the big opponents 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.460
 potsdam is still missing on the last day of play 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.040
 but how can you explain that one 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.330
 in the round, still against entangled 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.910
 a stupid game and now 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.920
 simply against all major bhf no point 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.660
 more ab gives yes, unfortunately we have there 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.820
 not really a solution would be 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.160
 ran 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.380
 but we do not know exactly how 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.760
 against the alleged weaker not 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.350
 so good services can call and 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.390
 against the big ones and somehow 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.280
 always exist and because we are good too 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.010
 deliver games and then win or 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.690
 uschi now makes almost the best out 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.460
 so i have many hurt but me 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.169
 faith as a team you still move much 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.300
 Tight together, you can get up there somewhere 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.669
 I pull that out, I believe that 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.500
 is really extreme and really 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.720
 unique what we team just 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.120
 we make a setback after the 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.770
 another always falls away and one 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.810
 We always really move as a team 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.350
 continue together and we are real 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.460
 great team and only time will work now 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.270
 I think you have it again today 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.560
 seen that a really good one 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.570
 Team is a very young one 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.790
 Team talented team with 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.419
 a very good coach i think so 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.650
 You can expose good good phone 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.060
 that you can also play in the front and 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.450
 I think that has the troupe on everyone 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.450
 fall for it
