00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.309
 gets my fitness 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.230
 we now carry my complete 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.570
 training plan starting with we start with 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.369
 monday breast how can it be otherwise 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.740
 his 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.650
 we make monday triceps easy 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.710
 because if the chest because 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.110
 we train the chest we train 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.370
 actually always the triceps with it 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.930
 because we train a lot 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.660
 any flying movements when 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.710
 Dessert of the biceps but 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.540
 basically all pressing movement 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.640
 actually always have the triceps with me 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:49.540
 doing so must be triceps and 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:55.190
 Of course, the first exercise is bench press 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:58.160
 which should be put the foresight 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.260
 we already that we with the eyes directly 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.189
 or stay with us later 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.860
 not to the friends stop 

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:10.580
 whoever has a neutral grip you can do 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.250
 often the centering of your grip 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.850
 see in the rules of the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:21.979
 rod engagement is relatively wide my 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:25.040
 arms are long and here it seems to me 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.659
 we have a solid relationship 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.510
 the shoulder up and to the back 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.050
 shows afterwards even more accurate and let 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.510
 the weight off slowly under the breast 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.690
 not on the breast 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.960
 under the breast and again exclusively after 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.960
 above 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:02:01.619
 which I quite often in the 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:02:04.369
 gym lake but it brings right 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.649
 little to shoulder again 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.380
 shoulders we should up 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.209
 pull and back so that we are quasi 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.890
 only with the trapezoid must and with the 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.930
 with the scapula on the mat 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:22.610
 should hang up here too easily now 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:26.250
 the press here in the hollow cross were 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.380
 So not with the po up but 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.330
 with the pro hang up with the 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.120
 put on one shoulder and then 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.010
 can be pressed by 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.640
 the next exercise is constantly increasing 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.459
 you press 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.269
 We'll see you subscribe right here 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.540
 above so he does not miss that and that 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.540
 equal
