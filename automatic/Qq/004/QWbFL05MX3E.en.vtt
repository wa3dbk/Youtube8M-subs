00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.869
Hello! Everyone I'm Won Sang Kim.

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.779
This time it will have an explanation for each separation.

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.800
Many people see a lot of textbooks.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.039
The textbook

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.279
Each of the separate and Object-Ball Cue-Ball is described.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.239
Any books

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.580
Of Cue-Ball, depending on the thickness and Object-Ball

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.640
Separate angles are described.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.220
This time,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:53.540
Except due to the authors described a very important

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.080
Readers are confused about the separation of each

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.160
I wanted to explain in detail the parts.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.790
First demonstration show

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.450
In fact, when an Object-Ball match with closed

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.890
Object-Ball and Cue-Ball look that will show the separation.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.270
Get it right by one-half the thickness in the textbook

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.390
Based on the direction of Cue-Ball

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.380
Object-Ball is going on 30,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.680
Cue-Ball says it happened even 60.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.100
But actually speaking haebomyeon

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.820
Cue-Ball is

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.760
60, not taking place at a much smaller angle than that

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.420
The progression.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.040
I'll show you a demonstration.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.540
The textbook

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.840
60 degrees, 30 degrees, that took place

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.549
Although this statement is

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.609
In fact, you can not see the phenomenon.

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.049
Because missing an important prerequisite.

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.729
Cue-Ball moments for this Object-Ball

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:42.569
The rotational force of the Cue-Ball is to be "0". Because the prerequisite is missing

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.289
Dokjayi confused a lot.

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:48.949
In fact, before the Object-Ball

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:51.400
It is stopped

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.359
Image-Ball a place

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.580
The demonstration will show again.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.159
Image-Ball is placed in front of Object-Ball

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.759
At the moment, because the rotational force is stopped without crashing

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.080
Forward to turning force, or

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.050
The rotational force is not at all attracted to the state.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.299
No rotational force to the role Cue-Ball

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.759
Haebomyeon observe Image-Ball

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.600
Like the theory 30, 60 are also separated.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.360
Now, as the

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.960
Actually

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.420
Cue-Ball has a rotational force that moves forward

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.380
Since arriving in Object-Ball

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.609
Saying in a book

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.829
30 degrees, 60 degrees separating the

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.449
It is difficult to observe visually.

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:59.939
So

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:04.279
Cue-Ball, you need to create a rotational force so that when arriving to the Object-Ball.

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:08.239
Depending on the speed while learning the Draw Shot in the last hour

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.979
Cue-Ball may stop, and they may be attracted

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:13.760
I've seen the look.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.460
Cue-Ball is meeting at the moment and Object-Ball

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.019
The rotational force of Cue-Ball, which can be '0'

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.519
Select the Hitting Point

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.140
Haebomyeon attempt

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.340
You can observe the progress, such as the theory of the book.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.160
Now, as the

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.429
And the theory of the book

00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:04.629
Group is equal to

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:09.160
You must suppress the rotational force to the advancement of Cue-Ball.

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:10.860
To do so,

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.140
A shock caused by a strong blow

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.499
It may be a separation angle,

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:20.120
The other gave way, as is seen now,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.640
Cue-Ball rotation of the moment for this Object-Ball

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.760
Creating a '0'

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:29.249
You can use the Hitting Point.

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:32.889
There are two ways to practice many both

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.789
I feel, should be able to speak.

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:39.240
Each separation.

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:41.909
The theory described in the book

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.300
But be different from the group,

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.260
The theory is not false.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.740
However, remember that a prerequisite is missing,

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.659
Separating each with a lot of practice

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.659
Please studies.

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:59.499
See you next time find.
