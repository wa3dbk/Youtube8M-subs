00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
after the game is started then probably

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.080 
after the game is started then probably
the<00:01:13.619> first<00:01:13.799> thing<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.100> should<00:01:14.130> do<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.729> go<00:01:15.030> to

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
the first thing you should do is go to

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:23.870 
the first thing you should do is go to
your<00:01:16.250> my<00:01:17.250> es<00:01:18.049> tab<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.740> click<00:01:23.040> start

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
your my es tab and you can click start

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.280 
your my es tab and you can click start
turn<00:01:25.640> we<00:01:26.640> can<00:01:26.759> start<00:01:27.030> turn<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:29.070> then<00:01:30.020> you<00:01:31.020> want

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
turn we can start turn and then you want

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.240 
turn we can start turn and then you want
to<00:01:32.900> first<00:01:33.900> Poly's<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.619> your<00:01:34.799> speed<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.189> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
to first Poly's that your speed so you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.399 
to first Poly's that your speed so you
click<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> speed<00:01:36.119> plot<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:37.259> will

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
click on the speed plot and this will

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.800 
click on the speed plot and this will
let<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:38.130> actually<00:01:38.369> set<00:01:39.000> what's<00:01:39.299> your

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
let you to actually set what's your

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.600 
let you to actually set what's your
speed<00:01:40.079> plot<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:42.079> do<00:01:43.079> victor<00:01:44.070> starting<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.490> be

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
speed plot is do victor starting to be

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.719 
speed plot is do victor starting to be
the<00:01:44.790> cake<00:01:45.030> start<00:01:45.840> with<00:01:45.990> impulse<00:01:46.619> 1<00:01:46.890> start<00:01:47.610> with

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
the cake start with impulse 1 start with

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.469 
the cake start with impulse 1 start with
speed<00:01:48.360> 15<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.200> then<00:01:50.100> I'm<00:01:50.579> gonna<00:01:50.790> do<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.299> I'm

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
speed 15 and then I'm gonna do is I'm

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.020 
speed 15 and then I'm gonna do is I'm
going<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.720> increase<00:01:52.290> my<00:01:52.380> speed<00:01:52.619> on<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.880> plus

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
going to increase my speed on the plus

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.370 
going to increase my speed on the plus
24<00:01:54.540> case<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.140> see<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:56.329> on<00:01:57.329> it's<00:01:58.229> going

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
24 case you can see that on it's going

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.590 
24 case you can see that on it's going
to<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.619> 32<00:01:58.860> impulse<00:01:59.430> 24<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.880> well<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.420> toy

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
to be 32 impulse 24 is well the toy

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.380 
to be 32 impulse 24 is well the toy
Fourth<00:02:00.899> Movement<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:02.329> so<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.570> will<00:02:03.840> then

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
Fourth Movement and so I will then

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.550 
Fourth Movement and so I will then
change<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:07.280> 21<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.610> click<00:02:08.789> oh<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.989> fell<00:02:10.200> also

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
change to 21 and click oh I fell also

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.150 
change to 21 and click oh I fell also
you<00:02:10.649> impulse<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.730> per<00:02:11.879> movement

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
you impulse the per movement

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.980 
you impulse the per movement
and<00:02:14.160> click<00:02:14.490> okay<00:02:15.090> now<00:02:16.460> obviously<00:02:17.460> when<00:02:18.330> doing

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
and click okay now obviously when doing

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.560 
and click okay now obviously when doing
the<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.110> cake<00:02:19.590> once<00:02:20.010> first<00:02:20.280> discharging<00:02:21.060> and

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
the a cake once first discharging and

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.940 
the a cake once first discharging and
then<00:02:21.990> next<00:02:22.260> thing<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.530> don't<00:02:22.710> want<00:02:22.920> to

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
then next thing you don't want to

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.600 
then next thing you don't want to
probably<00:02:23.460> do<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.940> then<00:02:24.270> recharge<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.610> that

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
probably do is then recharge it that

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.070 
probably do is then recharge it that
that's<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.360> way<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.540> do<00:02:28.910> reserve<00:02:29.910> power<00:02:30.360> in

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
that's the way you do reserve power in

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.930 
that's the way you do reserve power in
this<00:02:31.230> case<00:02:31.410> reserve<00:02:31.770> warp<00:02:32.070> power<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.610> have<00:02:32.760> to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
this case reserve warp power you have to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.690 
this case reserve warp power you have to
first<00:02:33.630> discharge<00:02:34.470> by<00:02:34.710> either<00:02:34.830> recharge<00:02:35.520> it

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
first discharge by either recharge it

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.720 
first discharge by either recharge it
and<00:02:36.320> then<00:02:37.320> let's<00:02:38.070> go<00:02:38.700> with<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:40.110> standard

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
and then let's go with the standard

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.850 
and then let's go with the standard
