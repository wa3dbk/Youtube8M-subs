00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 ah here is the clip is 3000 with the price 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.240
 but that's what they prove to me that 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.070
 both ways we do against side to 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.809
 jupp the SÃ¨te but she changed my life 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.679
 and for that I was already no more 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.680
 problem 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.970
 triple his 3000 order now 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.320
 oh no it is not a joke it 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.310
 really possible to counter a cons 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.990
 heart and that's what I'm going to you 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:29.740
 learn in this video while we 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:31.480
 be very clear this has absolutely nothing 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.280
 to do with countering at 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.989
 reluctantly it's just that the guy 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:47.379
 did not press the button wait for 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:49.750
 you counter however those is a 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.920
 then you have to know that it's a 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.300
 glyph very difficult to achieve 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.530
 do not expect to succeed him from 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.940
 first shot it took me a certain 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.989
 time to be able to master it at 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.090
 pretty much correctly 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.829
 so that's to put two shots of 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.390
 consecutive head at a certain frequency 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.470
 a full of bugger the animation of the 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:09.180
 reluctantly like this tak tak what 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.180
 will prevent your site from countering you 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.750
 so watch out I have very accurate tac tac 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.070
 it is precisely tac tac 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.420
 it's not tac tac tac tac tac it's 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.070
 precisely tac tac tac tac tac tac 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.390
 do not hesitate to go outside 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.450
 story of well you put the pace 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.229
 in the head then you have to know that 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.520
 I think it was 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.380
 impossible after a multitude of tests 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.090
 and one day a guy cost me face and 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.159
 I could not do anything this summer 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.610
 snapshot I did not even see my arm 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.990
 block his arm so his shot I'm 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.470
 am told but what is this 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.149
 whorehouse 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.399
 and then i arrive cfa exactly the same 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.140
 thing to another player so when the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.340
 pretty much binds the manipulation I redo 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.409
 do a second time a third 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.489
 time and then I tried to stay 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:15.660
 in one part so be careful 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.830
 tak tak so deep with the lake you 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.269
 put two blows is only one 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.220
 alone who accounted for what puts in 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.209
 failure your manipulation what is 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.209
 particularly troublesome 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.730
 attention toc toc here I hope that 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.650
 this video would have been helpful and 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.420
 do not hesitate to share it and 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.130
 subscribe to my channel apologize to beaune 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.130
 to China owes a lot of bananas
