to<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.119> sims<00:01:06.479> 4<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:07.380> has<00:01:07.590> caused<00:01:07.950> lad<00:01:08.310> ferred

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
to the sims 4 that has caused lad ferred

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.140 
to the sims 4 that has caused lad ferred
to<00:01:08.640> revert<00:01:09.240> back<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.659> his<00:01:09.990> human<00:01:10.229> form<00:01:10.790> this<00:01:11.790> is

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
to revert back to his human form this is

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.690 
to revert back to his human form this is
what<00:01:12.390> his<00:01:12.570> human<00:01:12.930> form<00:01:13.140> looks<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.040> that's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
what his human form looks like so that's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.550 
what his human form looks like so that's
when<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.030> based<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.540> sim<00:01:15.810> off<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.530> think

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
when I based the sim off of and I think

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.749 
when I based the sim off of and I think
I<00:01:16.920> actually<00:01:17.540> got<00:01:18.540> him<00:01:18.810> down<00:01:19.140> pretty<00:01:19.590> well<00:01:19.979> he

I actually got him down pretty well he

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.310 
I actually got him down pretty well he
can't<00:01:21.119> really<00:01:21.450> wear<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.780> same<00:01:22.020> clothing
