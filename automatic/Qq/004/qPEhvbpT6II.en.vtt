circle<00:02:33.480> ones<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:34.590> circle<00:02:35.069> right<00:02:35.160> here<00:02:35.220> and

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
circle ones this circle right here and

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.490 
circle ones this circle right here and
the<00:02:35.910> background<00:02:36.360> shows<00:02:36.569> ashworth<00:02:37.049> one<00:02:37.260> and

only<00:02:38.099> save<00:02:38.640> what<00:02:39.629> you<00:02:39.660> added<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.319> which<00:02:40.500> would

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
only save what you added on which would

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.220 
only save what you added on which would
look<00:02:40.799> like<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.129> because<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:42.180> circle<00:02:42.629> just

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
look like this because the circle just

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.160 
look like this because the circle just
to<00:02:43.319> fit<00:02:43.500> like<00:02:43.709> just<00:02:44.040> around<00:02:44.310> here<00:02:44.519> for<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.790> tag

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
to fit like just around here for the tag

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.380 
to fit like just around here for the tag
but<00:02:46.170> anyways<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:46.769> mine<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:50.209> remove<00:02:51.209> it

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
but anyways this is mine and remove it

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.520 
but anyways this is mine and remove it
and<00:02:51.829> once<00:02:52.829> you<00:02:53.040> make<00:02:53.250> your<00:02:53.280> speaker<00:02:53.760> tag<00:02:54.530> make

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
and once you make your speaker tag make

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.460 
and once you make your speaker tag make

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
sure you save it as a JPEG so the file

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.979 
sure you save it as a JPEG so the file
extension<00:02:58.739> would<00:02:59.250> be<00:02:59.489> dot<00:03:00.000> jpg<00:03:00.480> instead<00:03:00.840> of
