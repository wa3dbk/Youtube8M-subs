he was like warburg nods because he

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.609 
he was like warburg nods because he

anything<00:02:12.739> in<00:02:12.980> life<00:02:13.239> and<00:02:14.470> instead<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.530> just

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
anything in life and instead I just

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.880 
anything in life and instead I just

to my Gliscor and you know I this is

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.170 
to my Gliscor and you know I this is
probably<00:02:22.099> not<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.310> best<00:02:22.340> play<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:22.760> prize

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
probably not the best play I prize

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.089 
probably not the best play I prize
should<00:02:23.330> have<00:02:23.480> went<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:24.110> heat<00:02:24.349> ran<00:02:24.620> instead

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
should have went to heat ran instead

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.309 
should have went to heat ran instead
here<00:02:25.400> because<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:26.480> want<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.720> get<00:02:26.840> rocks<00:02:27.110> up

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
here because I want to get rocks up

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.199 
here because I want to get rocks up
really<00:02:27.620> bad<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:28.010> this<00:02:28.160> in<00:02:28.340> itself<00:02:28.700> was<00:02:28.880> kind<00:02:29.120> of

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
really bad so this in itself was kind of

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.089 
really bad so this in itself was kind of
miss<00:02:29.390> play<00:02:29.630> but<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:29.840> was<00:02:30.050> relatively<00:02:30.470> confident

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
miss play but I was relatively confident

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.180 
miss play but I was relatively confident
that<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.280> could<00:02:31.370> meet<00:02:31.819> oh<00:02:32.000> yeah<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.950> scissor

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
that I could meet oh yeah the scissor

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.040 
that I could meet oh yeah the scissor
would<00:02:34.459> gliscor<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.150> taunted<00:02:35.599> and<00:02:35.630> get<00:02:35.810> rocks

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
would gliscor and taunted and get rocks

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.990 
would gliscor and taunted and get rocks
up<00:02:36.319> but<00:02:36.530> as<00:02:36.739> you<00:02:36.980> can<00:02:37.130> tell<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:37.580> was<00:02:37.760> but

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
up but as you can tell this was but

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.090 
up but as you can tell this was but
probably<00:02:38.330> a<00:02:38.390> miss<00:02:38.660> play<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.019> my<00:02:39.200> part<00:02:39.530> the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
probably a miss play on my part the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.229 
probably a miss play on my part the
reason<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.459> went<00:02:40.580> glad<00:02:40.730> school<00:02:40.940> was<00:02:41.030> like<00:02:41.120> it

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
reason I went glad school was like it

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.360 
reason I went glad school was like it
was<00:02:41.360> because<00:02:41.510> I<00:02:41.690> wanted<00:02:41.900> rocks<00:02:42.350> but<00:02:42.739> it<00:02:42.950> really

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
was because I wanted rocks but it really

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.860 
was because I wanted rocks but it really
didn't<00:02:43.640> play<00:02:43.850> out<00:02:44.030> that<00:02:44.239> well<00:02:44.420> because<00:02:44.720> what

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
didn't play out that well because what

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.080 
didn't play out that well because what
this<00:02:45.019> does<00:02:45.260> is<00:02:45.560> just<00:02:45.590> gives<00:02:45.860> him<00:02:46.220> an<00:02:46.370> easy<00:02:46.670> roof

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
this does is just gives him an easy roof

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.479 
this does is just gives him an easy roof

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
was powered on gone I would have been

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.240 
was powered on gone I would have been
nope<00:03:14.420> rocks<00:03:14.870> on<00:03:15.170> my<00:03:15.320> side<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:15.890> I<00:03:15.980> would<00:03:16.040> have

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
nope rocks on my side and I would have

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.039

kept<00:03:16.489> insane<00:03:16.940> early<00:03:17.239> game<00:03:17.359> in<00:03:17.480> men<00:03:17.600> so<00:03:17.750> I<00:03:17.870> could

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
kept insane early game in men so I could

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.240 
kept insane early game in men so I could
have<00:03:18.140> saved<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.470> power<00:03:18.650> if<00:03:18.859> he<00:03:18.890> wanted<00:03:19.190> to

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
have saved the power if he wanted to

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.580

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
way of beating it so that's pretty much

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.120 
way of beating it so that's pretty much
it<00:03:49.940> that<00:03:50.209> really<00:03:50.569> is<00:03:50.690> pretty<00:03:50.900> much<00:03:51.109> it<00:03:51.380> I<00:03:51.590> go<00:03:52.069> to
