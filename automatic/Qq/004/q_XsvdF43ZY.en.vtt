market in Australia back so you're
letting<00:02:36.870> me<00:02:37.080> take<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.349> Triple<00:02:37.890> S<00:02:38.040> out<00:02:38.190> today

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
letting me take the Triple S out today

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.670 
letting me take the Triple S out today
what<00:02:38.849> makes<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.209> one<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.840> top<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.349> the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
what makes this one the top of the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.910 
what makes this one the top of the
Pulsar<00:02:41.280> range<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.940> Triple<00:02:42.330> S<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.920> model

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
Pulsar range the Triple S is the model

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.559 
Pulsar range the Triple S is the model
in<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.160> range<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.760> has<00:02:44.970> what<00:02:45.209> we<00:02:45.300> call<00:02:45.450> the

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
in the range that has what we call the

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.110 
in the range that has what we call the
di<00:02:45.780> G<00:02:46.110> or<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.349> turbocharged<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.220> engine<00:02:47.580> so

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
di G or the turbocharged the engine so

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.360 
di G or the turbocharged the engine so
it's<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:49.170> ultimate<00:02:49.590> for<00:02:49.769> performance<00:02:50.280> and

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
it's the ultimate for performance and

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.360 
it's the ultimate for performance and
safety<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.480> Triple<00:02:52.319> S<00:02:52.440> stands<00:02:52.709> for<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:53.129> and

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
safety so Triple S stands for that and

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.670 
safety so Triple S stands for that and
and<00:02:53.849> value<00:02:54.180> for<00:02:54.360> money<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:54.780> terms<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:55.349> what<00:02:55.590> you

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
and value for money in terms of what you

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.009 
and value for money in terms of what you
get<00:02:55.860> out<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.220> car<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.790> adage<00:02:57.180> for<00:02:57.450> pulsar

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
get out of this car the adage for pulsar

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.770 
get out of this car the adage for pulsar
M<00:02:58.230> for<00:02:58.440> Triple<00:02:58.739> S<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.099> more<00:02:59.670> in<00:02:59.849> the<00:03:00.000> car<00:03:00.209> for

M for Triple S is more in the car for

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.229 
M for Triple S is more in the car for
