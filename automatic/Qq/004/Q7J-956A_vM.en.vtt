00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.219 
compared to what I thought it would be
like<00:05:49.039> it's<00:05:49.400> really<00:05:50.030> big<00:05:50.450> like<00:05:50.750> when<00:05:51.080> you

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
like it's really big like when you

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.029 
like it's really big like when you
really<00:05:51.620> hold<00:05:51.860> it<00:05:52.099> like<00:05:52.840> sides<00:05:53.840> of<00:05:54.289> your<00:05:54.500> hand<00:05:54.800> I

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
really hold it like sides of your hand I

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:56.620 
really hold it like sides of your hand I
thought<00:05:55.669> it<00:05:55.789> would<00:05:55.849> be<00:05:56.000> the<00:05:56.150> size<00:05:56.390> of<00:05:56.539> the

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
thought it would be the size of the

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.709 
thought it would be the size of the
promotional<00:05:57.140> boxes<00:05:57.620> but<00:05:58.010> it's<00:05:58.219> way<00:05:58.460> bigger<00:05:58.719> it

00:05:59.709 --> 00:05:59.719 
promotional boxes but it's way bigger it

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:01.390 
promotional boxes but it's way bigger it
doesn't<00:06:00.050> look<00:06:00.110> too<00:06:00.349> big<00:06:00.530> but<00:06:00.770> it's<00:06:00.950> pretty<00:06:01.159> big

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
doesn't look too big but it's pretty big
