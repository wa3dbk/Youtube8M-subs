00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.730
 we are here for another video of him ktv 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.370
 in which today we pretend to show you 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.619
 something more about the distribution how 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.590
 is changing an engine with an excessive 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.690
 crossing or with a moderate crossing some 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.390
 things we need to show is for 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.510
 example how this engine has a 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.340
 corrector cam this concealer yes 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.200
 is important in the cars of 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.540
 competition or in the camshafts 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.420
 that were prepared to look for the 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.870
 exact point for the engine to work 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.630
 correctly we are talking about a 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.270
 camshaft that has all the cams 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.670
 of intake and exhaust which there is no 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.590
 great improvement because because if this 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.399
 I run to the side what I'm going to get 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.040
 is that the diagram of the distribution the 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.020
 which we have here, run slightly to 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.259
 one side or run slightly for the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.700
 another then what we gain on the one hand 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.330
 we are losing it for the other 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.729
 then there is no great advantage that in this 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.550
 camshaft turn to one side for the 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.220
 another the only advantage is to find the 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.320
 exact point 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.770
 but if instead of having a single tree of 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.200
 cams 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.200
 I have double overhead cams 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.030
 example how in that engine we can do 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.619
 that can change the relative position 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.259
 of escape or admission and so on 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.860
 get more crossing or less crossing 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:49.049
 we have to clarify that the crossing has 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.060
 importance in what time it is going to 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.640
 perform that engine better for example 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.069
 an engine that has an exaggerated crossing 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.250
 let's get the performance to be 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:03.429
 very good at high revs while 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.280
 a moderate or low crossing that that 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:09.280
 engine work perfectly well in 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.810
 low turns that's what the 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.750
 variable distributions of betty mind 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.910
 for example we have in those 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.630
 distributions 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.650
 a camshaft gear and for 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:30.310
 half of a computer we get that 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.310
 with this phase corrector change the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.070
 relative position of the camshaft in 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.880
 a certain moment that is going to be the 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.920
 computer sends the signal to a valve 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.530
 lets go of oil pressure here and 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.440
 right for this side or does it happen 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.750
 oil pressure here and run the 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.630
 gear for the other side in this case 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.600
 it's all or nothing but you can in a 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:59.110
 certain moment usually about 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.240
 admission put to the side or to the 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.000
 another advance the admission or delay the 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.700
 admission on some cars a little more 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.760
 processed can be done on admission 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.000
 and about escape what we try to show 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.260
 in this video is how a 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.690
 motor with an exaggerated crossing and how it 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:25.150
 it includes an engine with a moderate crossing 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:28.239
 the idea is in this 125 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.629
 how to put it with a super cross 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.959
 exaggerated and then we are going to vary 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:38.049
 the crossing to the normal position or even 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:41.980
 removing completely the crossing that is 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:44.129
 completely the intake and exhaust valves 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.859
 escape opening in dead spots 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:50.500
 higher the camshaft of the 125 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:54.590
 has two in which we can see the 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:58.020
 admission and with 20 degrees of progress 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.900
 55 of delay at the close of the admission and 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.570
 the escape something very similar but in 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.560
 opposite direction 20 degrees delay 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.630
 at the close of the escape and 55 advance to the 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.930
 escape opening 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.350
 this in a single diagram would be here 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:20.040
 this would be the camshaft diagram 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.900
 of 125 in relation to standard yes and 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.900
 now let's start up and let's 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.700
 see how the 125 works with a setting 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.700
 normal distribution 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.850
 we have seen the 125 how it works and how 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.160
 regulates with a distribution diagram 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.290
 normal the one that comes from the factory and now 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.800
 what we are going to do is cross the tree 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:06.080
 of cams give more advance to the 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.200
 opening of admission and more delay 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.840
 closure of the escape which we will see that 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.210
 we will run two teeth one for each 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.570
 side and we'll get a super cross 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.250
 exaggerated if this crossing more or less is 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.800
 compatible with cars that walk 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.950
 chopped logical the chopped car 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.870
 it also has a little more exaggerated the 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.270
 angles down here like it's a cam already 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.520
 formed we can not work on that 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:35.060
 so the only thing that we went was 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.070
 exaggerate in two teeth to the side and 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.200
 towards the other the diagram 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.390
 distribution of the intake and exhaust 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.060
 what we get is a super cross 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.430
 exaggerated this is going to benefit that the 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.150
 car will work much better in 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.070
 high turns answering quite 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.430
 better in high turns what in 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.100
 low turns will want to not regulate and 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.990
 let's make sure 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.260
 will be close to 2 thousand 500 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.800
 turns impossible to keep there if not 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.800
 it would stop 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.620
 we could see how the engine reacted 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.960
 very well in high turns and that when 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.360
 they fell low turns practically not 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.460
 he argued this is what they do 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.669
 normally the distributions 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:08.970
 variables if varying that position 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:11.220
 relative of the camshaft with those 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.830
 Progress correctors they have in each 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:17.099
 one of the admission and camshafts 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:20.490
 escape this was another video more of ek tv 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:23.400
 see you in the next and that for a 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:27.800
 command of future triple doubles point 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.800
 physical together with dot years
