find up a little bits that I know it
they're<00:00:23.490> here<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.419> just<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.749> get<00:00:24.929> them<00:00:25.079> here

yeah I've come up with ridiculously

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.929 
yeah I've come up with ridiculously
complex<00:00:28.169> kind<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.740> ambitious<00:00:29.310> stupid<00:00:29.730> things

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
complex kind of ambitious stupid things

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.010 
complex kind of ambitious stupid things
and<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.779> way<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.019> see<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.949> kind<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:33.020> walk

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
and the way you see it you kind of walk

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.290 
and the way you see it you kind of walk
this<00:00:34.200> kind<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.500> simplicity<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.670> my<00:00:35.820> work<00:00:36.060> and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
this kind of simplicity to my work and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.930 
this kind of simplicity to my work and
sort<00:00:36.810> of<00:00:36.930> strict<00:00:37.289> it<00:00:37.440> down<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.789> a<00:00:38.820> certain

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
sort of strict it down and to a certain

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.080 
sort of strict it down and to a certain
extent<00:00:39.719> kind<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.140> edited<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.649> perspex<00:00:41.160> has<00:00:41.730> got

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
extent kind of edited it perspex has got

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.939 
extent kind of edited it perspex has got
limitations<00:00:42.780> there<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.800> also

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
limitations there and it's also

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.130 
limitations there and it's also
different<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.850> terms<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.629> brittle<00:00:45.989> which

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
different in terms of it's brittle which

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.420 
different in terms of it's brittle which
doesn't<00:00:46.530> necessarily<00:00:46.590> apply<00:00:46.949> it<00:00:47.160> to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
doesn't necessarily apply it to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.610 
doesn't necessarily apply it to
something<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.359> technically<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.230> fragile

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
something that is technically so fragile

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.889 
something that is technically so fragile
as<00:00:50.039> paper<00:00:50.429> it's<00:00:50.699> a<00:00:50.820> lot<00:00:50.969> truer<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.600> paper

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
as paper it's a lot truer to the paper

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.610 
as paper it's a lot truer to the paper
cuts<00:00:52.199> it's<00:00:52.559> it's<00:00:53.340> much<00:00:53.730> more<00:00:54.000> about<00:00:54.620> single

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
cuts it's it's much more about single

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.610 
cuts it's it's much more about single
silhouette<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.670> very<00:00:56.879> monotone<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:58.350> it's

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
silhouette it's very monotone and it's

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.450 
silhouette it's very monotone and it's
all<00:00:58.859> about<00:00:59.190> trying<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.710> say<00:01:01.710> something<00:01:01.769> very

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
all about trying to say something very

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.189 
all about trying to say something very
simply<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.910> know<00:01:03.089> we<00:01:03.539> SAT<00:01:03.839> here<00:01:04.050> and

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
simply you know we SAT here and

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.840 
simply you know we SAT here and
scribbled<00:01:04.650> down<00:01:04.680> some<00:01:05.040> stuff<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.489> pulled<00:01:05.730> out

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
scribbled down some stuff and pulled out

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.370 
scribbled down some stuff and pulled out
the<00:01:06.000> bits<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.390> bobs<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.840> then<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.050> went<00:01:07.230> away

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the bits and bobs and then I went away

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.950 
the bits and bobs and then I went away
and<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.890> produced<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.490> all<00:01:08.610> out<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.630> SAT

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
and I produced it all out and I just SAT

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.179 
and I produced it all out and I just SAT
there<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.200> some<00:01:10.409> scissors<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.009> whole<00:01:11.159> day

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
there with some scissors for a whole day

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.609 
there with some scissors for a whole day
just<00:01:11.369> slip<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.180> tiny<00:01:12.570> little<00:01:12.750> bits<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.350> work

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
just slip in tiny little bits of work

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.710 
just slip in tiny little bits of work
out<00:01:13.829> I<00:01:13.860> literally<00:01:14.250> made<00:01:14.520> paper<00:01:14.820> versions<00:01:15.540> of

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
out I literally made paper versions of

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.899 
out I literally made paper versions of
the<00:01:15.869> jewelry<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:17.250> drawing<00:01:17.610> them<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
the jewelry so it's drawing them and

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.730 
the jewelry so it's drawing them and
just<00:01:18.060> cut<00:01:18.299> out<00:01:18.420> little<00:01:18.570> bits<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.200> stuff<00:01:19.500> and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
just cut out little bits of stuff and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.550 
just cut out little bits of stuff and
made<00:01:20.340> paper<00:01:20.670> versions<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.780> try<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.140> see<00:01:22.380> what

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
made paper versions to try and see what

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.960 
made paper versions to try and see what
whether<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.920> worked<00:01:23.100> or<00:01:23.189> not<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.520> think<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
whether it worked or not I think the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.060 
whether it worked or not I think the
thing<00:01:24.000> about<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.630> scale<00:01:25.170> obviously<00:01:25.920> we

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
thing about it is scale obviously we

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.090 
thing about it is scale obviously we
never<00:01:26.310> work<00:01:26.579> this<00:01:27.270> small<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:28.100> individual

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
never work this small on individual

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.130 
never work this small on individual
pieces<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:30.030> know<00:01:30.149> if<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.420> was<00:01:30.570> me<00:01:30.780> doing<00:01:30.930> our

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
pieces you know if it was me doing our

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.219 
pieces you know if it was me doing our
lives<00:01:31.439> or<00:01:31.670> hearing<00:01:32.670> about<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.030> baby<00:01:33.450> takes

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
lives or hearing about this baby takes

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.319 
lives or hearing about this baby takes
bottles<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.399> then<00:01:35.579> looks<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.030> that

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
bottles of it and then looks of it that

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.120 
bottles of it and then looks of it that
you<00:01:36.360> wrote<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.810> text<00:01:37.320> around<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.649> bracelet

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
you wrote the text around the bracelet

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.060 
you wrote the text around the bracelet
especially<00:01:38.630> for<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.810> exact<00:01:40.200> shape<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.950> the
