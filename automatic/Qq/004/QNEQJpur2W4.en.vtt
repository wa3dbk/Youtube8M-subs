00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
okay so today we making our first Java

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.909 
okay so today we making our first Java
tutorial<00:00:06.140> the<00:00:07.140> first<00:00:07.440> thing<00:00:07.620> we're<00:00:07.770> going<00:00:07.859> to

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
tutorial the first thing we're going to

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.370 
tutorial the first thing we're going to
do<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.250> it's<00:00:08.400> basically<00:00:09.019> download<00:00:10.019> something

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
do is it's basically download something

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.829 
do is it's basically download something
called<00:00:10.740> SDK<00:00:12.679> SDK<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.920> basically<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.839> software

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
called SDK SDK is basically a software

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.349 
called SDK SDK is basically a software
development<00:00:16.320> kit<00:00:17.090> basically<00:00:18.090> what<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.270> does

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
development kit basically what it does

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.500 
development kit basically what it does
is<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:19.520> basically<00:00:20.520> allows<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.240> actually

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
is it basically allows you to actually

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.529 
is it basically allows you to actually
program<00:00:22.080> or<00:00:22.260> write<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.650> code<00:00:23.070> for<00:00:23.880> java<00:00:24.180> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
program or write the code for java and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.720 
program or write the code for java and
actually<00:00:24.960> allows<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.410> run<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.550> um<00:00:27.650> is

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
actually allows you to run it so um is

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.980 
actually allows you to run it so um is
actually<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:29.880> more<00:00:30.060> advanced<00:00:30.390> version<00:00:30.810> of

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
actually have more advanced version of

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.860 
actually have more advanced version of
just<00:00:31.380> basically<00:00:31.740> he's<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.099> dulles<00:00:32.719> docks<00:00:33.719> is

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
just basically he's in dulles docks is

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.270 
just basically he's in dulles docks is
kind<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.110> boring<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:34.829> like<00:00:35.010> black

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
kind of boring and just like black

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.520 
kind of boring and just like black
screen<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.969> all<00:00:36.210> these<00:00:36.329> lines<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.690> code<00:00:36.870> looks

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
screen and all these lines of code looks

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.799 
screen and all these lines of code looks
almost<00:00:37.680> like<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.980> matrix<00:00:38.160> something<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.480> on

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
almost like the matrix something so on

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.450 
almost like the matrix something so on
the<00:00:40.200> Eclipse<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.590> actually<00:00:40.920> more<00:00:41.010> fun<00:00:41.280> and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the Eclipse is actually more fun and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
the Eclipse is actually more fun and
more<00:00:41.489> interactive<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.780> first<00:00:42.989> one<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.170> do

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
more interactive so the first one to do

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.350 
more interactive so the first one to do
is<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.500> want<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.739> download<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.579> SDK<00:00:45.149> call

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
is we want to download a SDK call

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.959 
is we want to download a SDK call
eclipse<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.050> very<00:00:46.260> well-known<00:00:46.530> one<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
eclipse is a very well-known one so the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.090 
eclipse is a very well-known one so the
first<00:00:48.090> one<00:00:48.300> was<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.980> google<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:51.949> type<00:00:52.949> in

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
first one was on google and type in

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.160 
first one was on google and type in
eclipse<00:00:54.289> and<00:00:55.340> it<00:00:56.340> should<00:00:56.520> be<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> first<00:00:57.120> um<00:00:57.449> your

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
eclipse and it should be a first um your

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.189 
eclipse and it should be a first um your
first<00:00:58.410> link<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.129> click<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.140> go<00:01:01.140> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
first link so click on that and go to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.130 
first link so click on that and go to
downloads<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:03.589> arm<00:01:05.600> so<00:01:06.600> we<00:01:06.720> want<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.990> download

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
downloads and arm so we want to download

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.469 
downloads and arm so we want to download
the<00:01:07.320> Eclipse<00:01:07.740> classic<00:01:08.250> route<00:01:08.580> point<00:01:08.820> six<00:01:09.390> one

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the Eclipse classic route point six one

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.990 
the Eclipse classic route point six one
and<00:01:09.960> apparently<00:01:10.770> have<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.189> 32-bit<00:01:11.760> or<00:01:11.790> 64-bit

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
and apparently have a 32-bit or 64-bit

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.719 
and apparently have a 32-bit or 64-bit
you<00:01:12.689> should<00:01:12.900> know<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.049> by<00:01:13.380> basically<00:01:14.189> your

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
you should know that by basically your

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.780 
you should know that by basically your
RAM<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.450> your<00:01:15.689> Rams<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:16.439> Gibbs<00:01:16.740> or<00:01:16.920> above<00:01:17.400> then

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
RAM if your Rams for Gibbs or above then

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.539 
RAM if your Rams for Gibbs or above then
you<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> 64-bit<00:01:18.420> computer<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.950> for

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
you have a 64-bit computer if it's for

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.270 
you have a 64-bit computer if it's for
gigs<00:01:20.759> or<00:01:20.909> less<00:01:21.090> then<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.479> gonna<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> 32-bit

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
gigs or less then it's gonna be a 32-bit

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.310 
gigs or less then it's gonna be a 32-bit
unfortunately<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.340> have<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.900> 32-bit<00:01:24.900> computer

go<00:02:25.370> ahead<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.519> go<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.819> desktop<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.900> now<00:02:27.140> we

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
go ahead and go to a desktop and now we

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.479 
go ahead and go to a desktop and now we
shall<00:02:27.500> have<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.680> folder<00:02:27.950> on<00:02:28.280> our<00:02:28.400> desktop

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
shall have a folder on our desktop

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.660 
shall have a folder on our desktop
called<00:02:29.150> Eclipse<00:02:29.830> square<00:02:30.830> including<00:02:31.250> Eclipse

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
called Eclipse square including Eclipse

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.190 
called Eclipse square including Eclipse
and<00:02:33.220> let's<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:35.090> now<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.239> should<00:02:35.510> see<00:02:35.540> like<00:02:36.170> a

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
and let's and now you should see like a

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.850 
and let's and now you should see like a
blue<00:02:37.010> or<00:02:37.579> purplish<00:02:38.209> looking<00:02:38.569> moon<00:02:38.810> with<00:02:39.349> some

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
blue or purplish looking moon with some

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.309 
blue or purplish looking moon with some
sparks<00:02:40.159> to<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.400> so<00:02:41.120> basically<00:02:41.420> I'm<00:02:41.720> just<00:02:41.750> click

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
sparks to it so basically I'm just click

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.229 
sparks to it so basically I'm just click
on<00:02:42.440> that<00:02:42.680> basically<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.910> there's<00:02:44.090> no

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
on that basically and there's no

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.819 
on that basically and there's no
installation<00:02:44.660> basically<00:02:45.290> we<00:02:45.379> extract<00:02:45.680> the

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
installation basically we extract the

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.770 
installation basically we extract the
files<00:02:46.099> it<00:02:46.370> basically<00:02:46.610> installs<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:47.629> you

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
files it basically installs and you

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.960 
files it basically installs and you
extract<00:02:48.049> them<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:49.129> in<00:02:49.280> basically<00:02:49.609> I'm<00:02:49.940> just

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
extract them so in basically I'm just

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.460 
extract them so in basically I'm just
click<00:02:50.329> on<00:02:50.359> the<00:02:50.510> Eclipse<00:02:50.870> file<00:02:51.079> and<00:02:51.319> if<00:02:51.379> you

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
click on the Eclipse file and if you

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.630 
click on the Eclipse file and if you
want<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.739> actually<00:02:52.040> run<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.459> from<00:02:52.519> your

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
want to actually run it from your

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.000 
want to actually run it from your
desktop<00:02:52.910> you<00:02:53.629> pretty<00:02:53.810> much<00:02:53.900> need<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.349> make<00:02:54.680> cut

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
desktop you pretty much need to make cut

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.550 
desktop you pretty much need to make cut
right<00:02:55.190> click<00:02:55.489> and<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:56.780> need<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.959> make<00:02:57.079> a<00:02:57.290> copy

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
right click and you need to make a copy

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.400 
right click and you need to make a copy
of<00:02:57.950> this<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.579> the<00:02:58.910> Eclipse<00:02:59.299> file<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.780> then

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
of this of the Eclipse file and then

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.020 
of this of the Eclipse file and then
just<00:03:00.680> paste<00:03:00.859> it<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.129> your<00:03:01.160> desktop<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:01.790> then

just paste it to your desktop and then
you<00:03:02.239> can<00:03:02.420> actually<00:03:02.510> run<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:02.930> from<00:03:03.019> there<00:03:03.519> so<00:03:04.519> so

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
you can actually run it from there so so

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.960 
you can actually run it from there so so
you<00:03:05.030> can<00:03:05.150> eclipse<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.660> open<00:03:05.870> up<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:09.879> takes<00:03:10.879> a

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
you can eclipse to open up and takes a

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.309 
you can eclipse to open up and takes a
while<00:03:11.090> for<00:03:11.120> everything<00:03:11.569> to<00:03:11.660> load<00:03:11.840> up<00:03:12.019> in<00:03:12.170> there

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
while for everything to load up in there

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.050 
while for everything to load up in there
anything<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:14.739> workspace<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:16.459> your<00:03:16.639> workspace

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060

your work your workspace basically just

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.610 
your work your workspace basically just
um<00:03:28.340> in<00:03:28.639> Java<00:03:29.389> you<00:03:29.630> basically<00:03:29.959> just<00:03:30.290> make

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
um in Java you basically just make

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.559 
um in Java you basically just make
another<00:03:30.650> workspace<00:03:31.310> folder<00:03:31.549> and<00:03:31.849> then<00:03:31.910> you

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
another workspace folder and then you

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.509 
another workspace folder and then you
can<00:03:32.720> actually<00:03:32.840> configure<00:03:33.319> Java<00:03:33.919> to<00:03:34.130> save<00:03:34.340> your

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
can actually configure Java to save your

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.089 
can actually configure Java to save your
files<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.910> that<00:03:35.030> folder<00:03:35.239> so<00:03:35.690> yeah<00:03:36.590> pretty<00:03:36.889> cool

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
files to that folder so yeah pretty cool

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.970 
files to that folder so yeah pretty cool
a<00:03:37.370> lot<00:03:38.090> of<00:03:38.120> features<00:03:38.540> in<00:03:38.750> Eclipse<00:03:39.109> but<00:03:39.829> we're

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
a lot of features in Eclipse but we're

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.099 
a lot of features in Eclipse but we're
going<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.340> do<00:03:40.489> them<00:03:40.669> so<00:03:40.849> there<00:03:41.000> we<00:03:41.090> go<00:03:41.150> voila
