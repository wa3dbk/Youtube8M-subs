00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800
 today I can stop and listen more thing 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:14.280
 I used to not do it before. 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.560
 I only heard symptoms 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.520
 and not today 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.520
 I hear the story and it brings me. 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.829
 I am your line I am formed in 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:38.040
 specialized medicine in psychiatry there is 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.739
 35 years have always worked with the park 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.309
 clinical psychiatry and psychotherapy 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.950
 in the last ten years I have observed 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:50.820
 and diseases have increased in a 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:55.050
 the frightening and even the advancement of 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.440
 Technology psychopharmacology have 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.980
 given that we can help 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.479
 an adequate form in the treatments 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.420
 so I got to me that's up to one 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.990
 point that a few years ago of a friend 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.040
 the psychologist commented on the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.890
 coaching 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.869
 so I ended up knowing ibc is 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.090
 through the Internet 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:27.409
 I registered and enrolled and started 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.979
 with psc after my training as 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.159
 coaching 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.880
 I realized this in the first place 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:40.990
 changes in me 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:44.200
 It's because you go through a series of 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.600
 internal transformations coming out of the 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.600
 You do not love the same person. 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:54.880
 you change I had a case of a person 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.450
 who had been diabetic for over 20 years 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:03.069
 use of insulin and from the moment they 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:06.729
 she started doing health coaching 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:09.670
 so her life is transformed into the 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:14.260
 my day to day I apply a coach doing 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.080
 in series of changes and cleaning shakes the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.010
 ibc is a family and this has helped 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:24.160
 a lot because we do not fall asleep 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.840
 we're always being a style one 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:32.079
 flame that 's when we think it's going 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.700
 falls asleep nor those cold amounting 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.739
 your mother again 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.370
 with alcohol had recommended 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:43.209
 because it is an excellent tool for 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:48.340
 self-knowledge is a tool of 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:56.010
 growth that can help many 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:59.769
 people help both in the emotional aspect 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:05.280
 professional and spiritual 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.280
 so this is very enriching
