freaky a little bit

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.699 
freaky a little bit
at<00:02:30.329> the<00:02:30.450> top<00:02:30.689> it<00:02:30.870> was<00:02:30.930> just<00:02:31.139> about<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.439> stall<00:02:31.680> I

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
at the top it was just about to stall I

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.349 
at the top it was just about to stall I
think<00:02:32.010> BCE<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:32.670> don't

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
think BCE I don't

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:39.140 
think BCE I don't
I<00:02:33.959> thought<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:37.010> was<00:02:38.010> worried<00:02:38.370> because<00:02:38.519> you<00:02:38.909> are

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
I thought I was worried because you are

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.240 
I thought I was worried because you are
running<00:02:39.810> low<00:02:40.049> on<00:02:40.079> gas<00:02:40.349> I<00:02:40.650> was<00:02:40.799> worried<00:02:41.099> it<00:02:41.159> was

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
running low on gas I was worried it was

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.059 
running low on gas I was worried it was
gonna<00:02:41.430> die<00:02:45.560> forwards<00:02:46.560> because<00:02:46.620> I'm<00:02:46.829> like<00:02:46.920> I

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
gonna die forwards because I'm like I

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.289 
gonna die forwards because I'm like I
think<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.519> plow<00:02:47.700> would<00:02:47.760> stop<00:02:48.090> me<00:02:48.209> from

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
think the plow would stop me from

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.819 
think the plow would stop me from
flipping<00:02:48.569> but<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:48.870> don't<00:02:49.170> know<00:02:49.379> so<00:02:49.650> I'm<00:02:49.709> like

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
flipping but I don't know so I'm like

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:50.659 
flipping but I don't know so I'm like
