00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.480
 since 2006 the government will make a final decision on the 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.950
 exploitation of gold in the area of ​​the páramo de santurbán the ministry 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.800
 environment will decide after a public hearing whether or not to grant 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.730
 license to the mining company costs there will be heard the arguments in 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.720
 pro and against the project this is the last report of the series on the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.159
 páramo de santurbán 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.909
 For some experts in economic matters, the 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:25.710
 elections that the mining company talks about 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.250
 where he states that the value of accor register for will become a 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.550
 opportunity for the region because it would receive 15 million dollars at 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.170
 year 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.070
 those who disagree with exploitation in that territory claim 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.740
 that of executing this project the royalty income for the 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.180
 nation and the department would be very low compared to the profits already 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.420
 would have the greystar multinational for the exploitation of salt don amador los 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.630
 mills the most of indigenous Wayúu Pablo in 12% 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.700
 of royalties 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.289
 and for the exploitation of the gold that is going to have a profit without mentioning if 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.390
 Masses this company 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.800
 would pay the 3 with everything is decided without doubt more than by an income of 100 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.720
 dollars how much that could represent that would mean that for $ 100 per 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.470
 every 100 dollars of income 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.150
 to Colombia he was surrounded they would enter 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.050
 3 dollars with 20 cents 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.020
 it would be the departmental is not clear and prove so is acting in agreement 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.820
 with a mining 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.390
 in the wasteland of santurbán 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.030
 I have to analyze this of the situation 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.780
 listen to businessmen listen to environmentalists listen to the 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.550
 mayors hear the only communal action listen to the aqueduct is a 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.480
 opportune moment if this government wants presentation of the work very definition 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:42.960
 clear 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.350
 the greystar mining company ensures that in the design of this project there 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.900
 intention to recover all impacted areas and specify each area 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.020
 ecosystem as our commitment in the construction producer taxes 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.220
 as much less programmed 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.010
 I do not enter into that supposed expansion avda only by birth of the doctor 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.690
 feminine impacted by a new album 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.219
 ann us but 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:12.899
 never so quiet 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.760
 hong kong as much less one jobs 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.929
 with a simple reason each 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:22.259
 with a maturity of five years for another took public status per hour 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.169
 we are experimenting with 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:29.539
 a growth among other assets a solana position 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:31.029
 they are many days 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:35.239
 this environmental polemic versus economic development has been pronounced 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.050
 also the attorney general's office 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.680
 where he already requested the ministry of housing and development environment 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.710
 territorial study the possibility of not granting the environmental license to 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.690
 mining project of narrowness I am seeing the legal and technical reasons 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.499
 although it was obviously a signature would be a prestigious cousins 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:58.259
 the presence of the project in the paramo area makes it unfeasible project 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:03.059
 It is a very strong preliminary consideration the colophon of the act by oblivion 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:04.759
 enforce 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:08.800
 and if the assistance of compelling technical reasons 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.750
 among them one well known in the world the province the project as it is 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.450
 presented 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.890
 In those moments, the Ministry of Environment advances the study to 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.060
 determine the scope of the project 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.040
 if you choose not to have stopped 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.390
 under what conditions would be anticipated and above all what are the variables that 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.280
 must consider to approve today is to attend this type of projects that mimics 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.729
 his 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:35.039
 we are looking towards the middle of February 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:41.499
 advance is state last percent citizen participation scenarios 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.319
 I like in 2009 a couple of weeks later I'm failing that fit 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.890
 definitively we are evaluating the project with or without stop if it meets or not 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.959
 is in front of the rest of the variables that must be considered the one of the streams 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.510
 with their families for the territory the technical design the project 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.540
 of all the mitigation measures of all the compensation measures of 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.860
 all the criteria to develop a project without causing any kind of 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.839
 impact on the social in the environmental 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:11.909
 or in the economy 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.519
 while they spend in one or two more months as the government says it did at the time 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.699
 who estimates to make a final decision 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.389
 to grant support the environmental license to be the discussion is maintained 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.699
 open between environmental santandereanos the mining firm even 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.690
 fenalco santander will organize a great march in defense of the water of 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:36.270
 bucaramanga next February 25 from the wasteland of santurbán in 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.589
