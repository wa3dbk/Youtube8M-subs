 Hello everyone, I am Dan Dugan. 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.940
 I am happy to tell you about Dan Dugan Sound Design and Yamaha. 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.330
 Co-developed a new digital mixer: QL series 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.230
 The QL Series includes Dugan Automix components that are built into the mixer. 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.500
 I have been working in the automatic mixing component development industry for 40 years. 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.180
 I am proud to say that we have implemented a high quality Dan Dugan automatic mix in this product. 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.310
 The Dan Dugan Automix component has three advantages; 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.020
 First it reduces the studio background noise of the microphone. 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.090
 Second, it reduces the feedback from the microphone. 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.060
 You may have twenty microphones, but they sound like a microphone. 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.480
 Third, the comb filter dynamically reduces the volume of my voice into the adjacent microphone. 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.000
 All of these operations do not have any thresholds or compression. 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.700
 All effects fade in and out naturally. 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.340
 Dugan Automix is ​​useful whenever you use multiple microphones. 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.480
 For example, in a company event, you might be involved in a group discussion; 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.150
 There are a lot of news discussions and sports events on TV; 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.960
 You will use a lot of microphones in the church; 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.320
 In the theater you will use a lot of wireless microphones. 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.500
 In all of these scenarios, the Dugan Automixer automatically pushes the faders up and down as people speak. 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.200
 The tuner no longer has to be busy on the fader. 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.570
 You can become an artist with a little correction. 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.780
 My products are often used in voice usage environments such as corporate meetings. 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.800
 Yamaha has also conducted in-depth research and development of such voice applications. 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.390
 After they understood my progress, they thought that cooperation would be good for both parties. 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.430
 We have teamed up to develop a card that plugs into the Yamaha console. 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.000
 It turns out that the effect is good and the user likes it. 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.600
 Now we are ready to continue to cooperate in depth. 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.450
 The Dugan Automix component was built on the Yamaha tuning board. 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.450
 I work directly with a team of experienced engineers at Yamaha. 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.020
 Their whole body research carried out my algorithm and the work was not compromised. 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.250
 We study it carefully. 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.620
 I went to Japan, tested multiple versions, and made some suggestions. 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.390
 They also made suggestions. 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.450
 In the end, we are very satisfied with the results of the exchange. 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.300
 The real advantage of having the Dugan Automix component built into the mixer is that no equipment needs to be assembled. 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.870
 All devices are ready to connect to the device on the matching screen. 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.000
 All you need to do is put the Automix component into the channel you want to use. 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.390
 If you want to use multiple open microphones for live tuning, 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.700
 It is highly recommended that you try Dugan Automix; 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.480
 You will find your work easier. 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.190
 The effect obtained is more consistent, 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.830
 You and your audience will be happy.
