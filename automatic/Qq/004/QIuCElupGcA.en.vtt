00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
making a really actual valuable

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:10.060 
making a really actual valuable
expansion<00:01:02.300> and<00:01:07.570> this<00:01:08.570> mission<00:01:08.900> so<00:01:09.770> it's<00:01:09.920> all

expansion and this mission so it's all
tank<00:01:10.340> battles<00:01:10.759> I<00:01:11.509> could<00:01:12.049> cheat<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:12.619> use

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
tank battles I could cheat and use

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.340 
tank battles I could cheat and use
terror<00:01:13.189> drones<00:01:13.490> but<00:01:13.909> terror<00:01:14.869> drones<00:01:15.110> are<00:01:15.320> not

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
terror drones but terror drones are not

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.080 
terror drones but terror drones are not
available<00:01:15.860> at<00:01:16.159> this<00:01:16.310> point<00:01:16.520> in<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.640> game<00:01:16.760> so

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
available at this point in the game so

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.110 
available at this point in the game so
we<00:01:17.210> will<00:01:17.630> just<00:01:17.780> be<00:01:17.900> relying<00:01:18.170> on<00:01:18.350> tanks<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:19.370> at

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
we will just be relying on tanks and at

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.670 
we will just be relying on tanks and at
aerodrome<00:01:20.450> in<00:01:20.540> surprise<00:01:20.900> which<00:01:21.230> means<00:01:21.440> that<00:01:21.650> I

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
aerodrome in surprise which means that I

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.800 
aerodrome in surprise which means that I
will<00:01:21.920> be<00:01:22.040> getting<00:01:22.760> terror<00:01:23.180> drones<00:01:23.420> from<00:01:23.570> every

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
will be getting terror drones from every

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.790 
will be getting terror drones from every
single<00:01:23.930> tank<00:01:24.230> that<00:01:24.380> I<00:01:24.409> lose<00:01:25.030> now<00:01:26.030> initially<00:01:26.840> we

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
single tank that I lose now initially we

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.570 
single tank that I lose now initially we
want<00:01:28.070> Tex

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
want Tex

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.570 
want Tex
to<00:01:28.790> just<00:01:29.210> stay<00:01:29.360> close<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:29.870> the<00:01:30.050> home<00:01:30.430> that's<00:01:31.430> is

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
to just stay close to the home that's is

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.820 
to just stay close to the home that's is
what<00:01:31.700> we<00:01:31.880> want<00:01:32.260> so<00:01:33.260> we'll<00:01:33.380> be<00:01:33.470> given<00:01:33.710> that

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
what we want so we'll be given that

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.430 
what we want so we'll be given that
initially<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.580> just<00:01:35.120> lowly<00:01:35.600> cranking<00:01:36.320> out<00:01:36.350> of

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
initially and just lowly cranking out of

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.230 
initially and just lowly cranking out of
these<00:01:36.530> tanks<00:01:36.770> um<00:01:37.990> I<00:01:38.990> think<00:01:39.260> I'm<00:01:39.590> gonna<00:01:39.740> get<00:01:39.950> a

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
these tanks um I think I'm gonna get a

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.090 
these tanks um I think I'm gonna get a
second<00:01:41.240> order<00:01:41.479> finery<00:01:42.020> sooner<00:01:42.710> rather<00:01:42.890> than

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
second order finery sooner rather than

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.370 
second order finery sooner rather than
later<00:01:43.280> I<00:01:43.670> probably<00:01:44.570> should've<00:01:44.870> gone<00:01:44.930> already

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
later I probably should've gone already

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.620 
later I probably should've gone already
ha<00:01:45.710> ha<00:01:46.190> ha

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
ha ha ha

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.320 
ha ha ha
but<00:01:48.049> I<00:01:48.080> didn't<00:01:48.470> I'm<00:01:49.400> probably<00:01:49.610> losing<00:01:49.820> tons<00:01:50.180> of

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
but I didn't I'm probably losing tons of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.600 
but I didn't I'm probably losing tons of
money<00:01:50.450> actually<00:01:51.070> make<00:01:52.070> me<00:01:52.250> wonder<00:01:52.400> whether

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
money actually make me wonder whether

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.160 
money actually make me wonder whether
it'll<00:01:53.090> be<00:01:53.150> worth<00:01:53.330> it<00:01:53.510> or<00:01:53.659> not<00:01:54.700> so<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.840> Guardian

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
it'll be worth it or not so the Guardian

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.760 
it'll be worth it or not so the Guardian
tank<00:01:57.500> is<00:01:57.740> a<00:01:57.979> good<00:01:58.369> thing

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
tank is a good thing

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.179 
tank is a good thing
but<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:01.000> Guardian<00:02:01.420> tank<00:02:01.689> only<00:02:01.960> really<00:02:02.560> works

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
but the Guardian tank only really works

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.190 
but the Guardian tank only really works
in<00:02:03.520> ridiculous<00:02:04.210> numbers<00:02:04.509> oh<00:02:04.630> good<00:02:04.899> they<00:02:05.049> lock

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
in ridiculous numbers oh good they lock

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.130 
in ridiculous numbers oh good they lock
at<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:05.970> terrordome<00:02:06.970> that's<00:02:07.479> very<00:02:07.720> good

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
at the terrordome that's very good

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.169 
at the terrordome that's very good
it<00:02:08.770> only<00:02:08.920> worked<00:02:09.190> some<00:02:09.340> ridiculous<00:02:09.849> numbers

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
it only worked some ridiculous numbers

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.949 
it only worked some ridiculous numbers
because<00:02:10.599> you<00:02:11.230> need<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.620> get<00:02:12.450> one<00:02:13.450> with<00:02:13.840> the

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
because you need to get one with the

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.930 
because you need to get one with the
focusing<00:02:14.500> beam<00:02:14.709> for<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.190> extra<00:02:15.400> damage<00:02:15.580> and

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
focusing beam for the extra damage and

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.910 
focusing beam for the extra damage and
the<00:02:16.180> remainder<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.660> do<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.959> damage<00:02:17.140> if<00:02:17.530> you

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
the remainder to do the damage if you

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.979 
the remainder to do the damage if you
don't<00:02:18.099> have<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.849> doesn't<00:02:19.180> work<00:02:19.330> out<00:02:19.540> and

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
don't have that it doesn't work out and

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.890 
don't have that it doesn't work out and
the<00:02:20.380> more<00:02:20.560> Guardian<00:02:20.980> tanks<00:02:21.190> have<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.640> better

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
the more Guardian tanks have the better

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.809 
the more Guardian tanks have the better
whereas<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.110> hammer<00:02:23.319> tank<00:02:23.650> is<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:24.310> tank<00:02:24.370> that

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
whereas the hammer tank is a tank that

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.030 
whereas the hammer tank is a tank that
is<00:02:24.880> really<00:02:25.360> good<00:02:25.569> in<00:02:25.780> few<00:02:26.110> numbers<00:02:26.410> very<00:02:26.830> very

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
is really good in few numbers very very

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.059 
is really good in few numbers very very
good<00:02:27.220> in<00:02:27.310> few<00:02:27.519> numbers<00:02:27.790> actually<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:29.069> that's

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
good in few numbers actually and that's

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.949 
good in few numbers actually and that's
because<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.459> has<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.700> leech<00:02:30.849> beam<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.690> can<00:02:31.810> run

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
because it has the leech beam it can run

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.800 
because it has the leech beam it can run
over<00:02:32.080> infantry<00:02:33.030> Brian<00:02:34.030> err<00:02:34.150> treads<00:02:34.390> upgrades

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
over infantry Brian err treads upgrades

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.449 
over infantry Brian err treads upgrades
makes<00:02:35.080> that<00:02:35.260> highly<00:02:35.830> highly<00:02:36.040> highly

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
makes that highly highly highly

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.059 
makes that highly highly highly
successful<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.390> all<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.530> good<00:02:38.709> stuff

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
successful and all that good stuff

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.900 
successful and all that good stuff
so<00:02:39.489> I<00:02:40.000> mean<00:02:40.569> this<00:02:41.350> is<00:02:41.410> kind<00:02:41.769> of<00:02:41.799> a<00:02:41.890> no-brainer<00:02:42.100> I

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
so I mean this is kind of a no-brainer I

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.330 
so I mean this is kind of a no-brainer I
mean<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:44.170> hammer<00:02:44.410> tank<00:02:44.709> will<00:02:44.860> always<00:02:45.130> beat

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
mean the hammer tank will always beat

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.729 
mean the hammer tank will always beat
the<00:02:45.370> Guardian<00:02:45.910> thing<00:02:46.200> now<00:02:47.200> because<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.530> didn't

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
the Guardian thing now because I didn't

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.530 
the Guardian thing now because I didn't
build<00:02:47.890> that<00:02:47.950> refinery<00:02:48.489> a<00:02:48.850> little<00:02:49.180> bit<00:02:49.269> earlier

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
build that refinery a little bit earlier

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.850 
build that refinery a little bit earlier
I<00:02:49.600> might<00:02:49.810> have<00:02:49.900> screwed<00:02:50.049> myself<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.500> little<00:02:50.709> bit

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
I might have screwed myself a little bit

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.610 
I might have screwed myself a little bit
of<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:51.040> half<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.790> tank<00:02:51.970> or<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.269> I<00:02:52.540> got<00:02:53.080> four<00:02:53.350> tanks

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
of a half a tank or so I got four tanks

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.340 
of a half a tank or so I got four tanks

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
being the same it's really much because

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.349 
being the same it's really much because
that's<00:03:13.540> exactly<00:03:13.690> I'm<00:03:14.200> talking<00:03:14.620> about<00:03:18.359> all

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359

and we can even micro backwards because

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.479 
and we can even micro backwards because
of<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:37.060> ridiculous<00:03:37.780> range<00:03:38.019> they<00:03:38.200> have<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:39.100> oh

of the ridiculous range they have and oh
god<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.299> lost<00:03:40.569> point<00:03:40.870> that's<00:03:41.200> not<00:03:41.350> good<00:03:45.389> bring

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
god I lost point that's not good bring

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:47.879 
god I lost point that's not good bring
out<00:03:46.480> more<00:03:46.600> tanks<00:03:46.900> coming<00:03:47.109> and<00:03:47.410> I'm<00:03:47.470> still

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
out more tanks coming and I'm still

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.430 
out more tanks coming and I'm still
being<00:03:48.069> more<00:03:48.280> cost-effective<00:03:48.850> than<00:03:48.880> he<00:03:49.060> is

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
being more cost-effective than he is

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:58.910 
being more cost-effective than he is
good<00:03:51.840> it's<00:03:52.840> got<00:03:52.959> windows<00:03:53.170> tank<00:03:53.500> battles<00:03:53.829> boys

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.990 

there's<00:03:59.920> literally<00:04:00.310> nothing<00:04:00.519> you<00:04:00.700> can<00:04:00.880> do

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
there's literally nothing you can do

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.979 
there's literally nothing you can do
about<00:04:01.120> this<00:04:02.910> I'm<00:04:03.910> surprising<00:04:04.480> that<00:04:04.600> ago<00:04:04.810> I

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
about this I'm surprising that ago I

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.870 
about this I'm surprising that ago I
haven't<00:04:05.260> had<00:04:05.350> a<00:04:05.380> tear<00:04:05.620> John<00:04:05.829> man<00:04:08.880> and

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
haven't had a tear John man and

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.610 
haven't had a tear John man and
eventually<00:04:10.209> it<00:04:10.329> becomes<00:04:10.600> like<00:04:10.930> highly<00:04:11.410> highly

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
eventually it becomes like highly highly

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.210 
eventually it becomes like highly highly
highly<00:04:12.150> ineffective<00:04:13.150> friend<00:04:13.739> and<00:04:14.739> he's<00:04:15.010> going

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
highly ineffective friend and he's going

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.439 
highly ineffective friend and he's going
to<00:04:15.400> have<00:04:15.549> to<00:04:16.859> do<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:18.100> equivalent<00:04:18.310> of<00:04:18.880> tapping

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
to have to do the equivalent of tapping

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:25.290 
to have to do the equivalent of tapping
out<00:04:22.229> he's<00:04:23.229> got<00:04:23.410> two<00:04:24.010> centres<00:04:24.820> of<00:04:24.910> production

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
out he's got two centres of production

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.290 
out he's got two centres of production
right<00:04:25.449> now<00:04:26.460> normally<00:04:27.460> that'd<00:04:27.669> be<00:04:27.820> a<00:04:27.850> good<00:04:27.970> idea

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
right now normally that'd be a good idea

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.140 
right now normally that'd be a good idea
but<00:04:28.600> in<00:04:28.750> this<00:04:28.870> case<00:04:29.110> with<00:04:29.979> my<00:04:30.250> ridiculous<00:04:30.880> tank

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
but in this case with my ridiculous tank

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.120 
but in this case with my ridiculous tank
count<00:04:31.419> being<00:04:31.690> what<00:04:31.900> it<00:04:32.020> is<00:04:32.050> he<00:04:32.680> doesn't<00:04:32.919> have<00:04:33.070> a

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
count being what it is he doesn't have a

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.939 
count being what it is he doesn't have a
chance<00:04:33.310> not<00:04:33.820> a<00:04:34.030> bloody<00:04:34.419> chance<00:04:34.750> in<00:04:35.139> a<00:04:35.350> pile

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
chance not a bloody chance in a pile

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:40.409 
chance not a bloody chance in a pile
pile<00:04:38.430> is<00:04:39.430> a<00:04:39.490> claim<00:04:39.790> that<00:04:39.970> people<00:04:40.120> would<00:04:40.300> make

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
pile is a claim that people would make
