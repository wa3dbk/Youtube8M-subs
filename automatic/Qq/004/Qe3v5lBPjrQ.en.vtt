I'll<00:00:45.059> show<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.480> problem<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.960> ran<00:00:46.170> into<00:00:46.789> but

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
I'll show you a problem I ran into but

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:55.220 
I'll show you a problem I ran into but
first<00:00:49.280> was<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> problem<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:53.809> strip's<00:00:54.809> here

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
first was a problem of the strip's here

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.950 
first was a problem of the strip's here
in<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.620> mowing<00:00:55.949> deck<00:00:56.390> that's<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.840> you

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
in the mowing deck that's so that you

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.069 
in the mowing deck that's so that you
can<00:00:58.140> see<00:00:58.350> what<00:00:58.590> you're<00:00:59.120> cutting<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.300> that's<00:01:00.960> a

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
can see what you're cutting and that's a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.729 
can see what you're cutting and that's a
good<00:01:01.199> idea

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
good idea

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.179 
good idea
but<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.640> found<00:01:03.000> things<00:01:03.390> flying<00:01:03.949> through<00:01:04.949> those

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
but I found things flying through those

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.130 
but I found things flying through those
holes

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
holes

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.000 
holes
quite<00:01:07.140> often<00:01:07.640> Rock<00:01:08.640> sticks<00:01:09.180> whatever<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:10.080> so

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
quite often Rock sticks whatever and so

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.120 
quite often Rock sticks whatever and so
I<00:01:11.310> mounted<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.909> piece<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.360> lexan<00:01:12.869> over<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.100> I

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
I mounted a piece of lexan over it so I

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.830 
I mounted a piece of lexan over it so I
can<00:01:14.400> still<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.259> I<00:01:16.259> don't<00:01:16.470> get<00:01:16.619> those

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
can still see but I don't get those

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.080 
can still see but I don't get those
hurling<00:01:18.840> objects<00:01:20.720> hitting<00:01:21.720> me<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.850> bigger

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
hurling objects hitting me the bigger

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.170 
hurling objects hitting me the bigger
problem<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.200> ran<00:01:25.619> into<00:01:26.210> was<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.880> fact

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
problem that I ran into was the fact

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.010 
problem that I ran into was the fact
that<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.630> deck<00:01:30.869> even<00:01:31.470> with<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.040> big<00:01:33.020> glides

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
that the deck even with the big glides

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.960 
that the deck even with the big glides
that<00:01:34.439> are<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:35.390> as<00:01:36.890> I<00:01:37.890> would<00:01:37.950> mow<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.549> they

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that are on it as I would mow it they

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.740 
that are on it as I would mow it they
would<00:01:39.119> dig<00:01:39.360> into<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.840> ground<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:41.750> eventually

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
would dig into the ground and eventually

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.499 
would dig into the ground and eventually
cause<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.979> cause<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.149> machine<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:47.159> dig

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
cause it to cause the machine to to dig

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.569 
cause it to cause the machine to to dig
cut<00:01:48.509> too<00:01:48.689> close<00:01:48.720> into<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.350> ground<00:01:49.649> was<00:01:50.189> taking

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
cut too close into the ground was taking

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.539 
cut too close into the ground was taking
too<00:01:50.759> much<00:01:50.970> power<00:01:51.299> when<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.470> would<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.369> end

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
too much power when I would get the end

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.639 
too much power when I would get the end
of<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.759> row<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.000> try<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.420> turn<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:55.079> had<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.470> pick

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
of a row and try to turn I had to pick

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.420 
of a row and try to turn I had to pick
up<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.009> deck<00:01:56.219> before<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.450> could<00:01:57.630> turn<00:01:57.869> because

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
up the deck before I could turn because

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.940 
up the deck before I could turn because
the<00:01:59.430> runners<00:01:59.850> were<00:02:00.060> down<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.320> ground<00:02:01.649> too

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the runners were down in the ground too

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.200 
the runners were down in the ground too
far<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:03.500> tried<00:02:04.500> running<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.159> holding<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.000> deck

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
far I tried running it holding the deck

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.469 
far I tried running it holding the deck
off<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.689> ground<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.140> little<00:02:07.170> bit<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:08.479> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
off the ground a little bit and the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.930 
off the ground a little bit and the
extreme<00:02:10.430> weight<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.790> the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
extreme weight of the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.810 
extreme weight of the
Dec<00:02:13.150> was<00:02:13.990> very<00:02:14.290> hard<00:02:14.560> on<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.980> hydraulics<00:02:15.610> on

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
Dec was very hard on the hydraulics on

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.740 
Dec was very hard on the hydraulics on
my<00:02:16.060> machine

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
my machine

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
my machine
and<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:18.100> was<00:02:18.280> difficult<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:18.880> keep<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.770> slightly

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
and it was difficult to keep it slightly

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.510 
and it was difficult to keep it slightly
off<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.190> ground<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:23.040> very<00:02:24.040> hard<00:02:24.250> on<00:02:24.400> the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
off the ground and very hard on the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.700 
off the ground and very hard on the
hydraulics<00:02:25.150> again<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:25.840> this<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.380> what<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.590> came

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
hydraulics again so this is what I came

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.630 
hydraulics again so this is what I came
up<00:02:27.160> with

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
up with

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.060 
up with
I<00:02:28.890> bought<00:02:29.890> two<00:02:30.420> bush<00:02:31.420> hog<00:02:31.660> type<00:02:32.070> trailing

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
I bought two bush hog type trailing

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.390 
I bought two bush hog type trailing
wheels<00:02:33.250> I<00:02:33.780> found<00:02:34.780> these<00:02:34.990> on<00:02:35.590> line<00:02:35.890> brand-new

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
wheels I found these on line brand-new

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.630 
wheels I found these on line brand-new
for<00:02:36.670> 68<00:02:37.210> dollars<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.720> piece<00:02:38.050> I<00:02:40.560> did<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:42.430> little

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
for 68 dollars a piece I did a little

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.940 
for 68 dollars a piece I did a little
measuring<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.480> went<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:44.050> bought<00:02:44.500> some

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
measuring and I went and bought some

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.360 
measuring and I went and bought some
steel<00:02:45.870> I'll<00:02:46.870> try<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.200> give<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.590> close-up<00:02:47.920> of

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.780 
steel I'll try to give you a close-up of
what<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:48.700> did<00:02:48.850> here<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:52.230> for<00:02:53.230> about<00:02:53.470> 45<00:02:54.430> dollars

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
what I did here and for about 45 dollars

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.960 
what I did here and for about 45 dollars
where<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.120> steel<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:56.310> welded<00:02:57.310> these<00:02:57.460> up<00:02:57.700> that's

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
where the steel I welded these up that's

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.060 
where the steel I welded these up that's
half<00:02:58.210> inch<00:02:58.480> thick<00:02:58.810> steel<00:02:59.070> and<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:01.510> guess

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
half inch thick steel and I guess

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.500 
half inch thick steel and I guess
instead<00:03:03.070> of<00:03:03.190> welding<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:03.640> permanently<00:03:04.210> you

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
instead of welding and permanently you

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.260 
instead of welding and permanently you
could<00:03:04.690> put<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.900> plate<00:03:05.260> on<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.620> back<00:03:06.240> there<00:03:07.240> and

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
could put a plate on the back there and

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.200 
could put a plate on the back there and
then<00:03:07.990> you<00:03:08.140> could<00:03:08.290> fold<00:03:08.710> it<00:03:08.920> on<00:03:09.130> very<00:03:09.880> easily

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
then you could fold it on very easily

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.830 
then you could fold it on very easily
and<00:03:10.720> unbolt<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.320> I<00:03:11.910> can<00:03:12.910> still<00:03:13.150> just<00:03:13.360> drop<00:03:13.630> the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
and unbolt it I can still just drop the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.650 
and unbolt it I can still just drop the
wheels<00:03:14.670> if<00:03:15.670> I<00:03:15.880> don't<00:03:16.120> need<00:03:16.420> them<00:03:18.209> but<00:03:19.209> anyways

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
wheels if I don't need them but anyways

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.440

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
shipping on those wheels was about fifty

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.510 
shipping on those wheels was about fifty
dollars<00:03:30.400> for<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.730> two<00:03:30.880> wheels<00:03:31.530> they're<00:03:32.530> very

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
dollars for the two wheels they're very

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.270

if CID has some kind of attachment like
this<00:04:19.480> I<00:04:19.720> looked<00:04:20.260> online<00:04:20.530> didn't<00:04:21.250> see<00:04:21.400> anything

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
this I looked online didn't see anything

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.820 
this I looked online didn't see anything
but<00:04:23.460> this<00:04:24.460> took<00:04:24.729> me<00:04:24.880> about<00:04:25.060> three<00:04:25.450> hours<00:04:25.479> to

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
but this took me about three hours to

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.670 
but this took me about three hours to
to<00:04:27.830> assemble<00:04:28.210> and<00:04:29.210> which<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:30.169> didn't<00:04:30.409> think<00:04:30.500> was

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
to assemble and which I didn't think was

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.820 
to assemble and which I didn't think was
too<00:04:30.889> bad<00:04:31.099> I<00:04:32.409> think<00:04:33.409> it's<00:04:33.560> a<00:04:33.650> worthwhile

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
too bad I think it's a worthwhile

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.879 
too bad I think it's a worthwhile
investment<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:35.000> if<00:04:35.150> you<00:04:35.930> run<00:04:36.199> into<00:04:36.469> the<00:04:36.620> same

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
investment and if you run into the same

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.730 
investment and if you run into the same
problem<00:04:37.430> I<00:04:37.610> did<00:04:38.050> it's<00:04:39.050> something<00:04:39.199> you<00:04:39.590> might

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
problem I did it's something you might

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.680 
problem I did it's something you might
