00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.789

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:36.720

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:45.820

 moments of the tube have definitely 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.859
 had those those impasses and that 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.450

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.420

 baby like that he tried to fix as 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:13.050
 as long as you always do so 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.930
 it is difficult to qualify a new one when 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.650
 been in moments well in moments 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.989

 ricardo we hear you ojala diego towers 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.680
 I 'm not listening 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.630
 because the truth is today has been the 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.030
 memory day today has been the day of the 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.470
 memory I think this is going to change the 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.960
 next week you know from the 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.720
 next week the participants who 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.030
 remain in competition have chosen the 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.610
 songs that they are going to sing in their 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.380
 last five days of competition within 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.720
 of what they have sung in the season 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.880
 to impress with his repertoire and not 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.710
 are going to be subjected to these challenges so 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.150
 difficult to those promised in the 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.260
 last 10 or 12 days in which they have 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.080
 had to learn two or three songs 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.840
 daily sometimes but still we can not 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.120
 stop evaluating and as a jury it is 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.890
 difficult to evaluate when the singers 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.750
 they are insecure and they do not know the letter 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.920
 as it has happened today in several 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.090
 presentations then I'm not going to 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.639
 result in what we have said before 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.260
 there just so many actions of 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.770
 juries I ask you to please take 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.770
 seat
