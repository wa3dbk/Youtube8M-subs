original<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:49.020> i<00:00:49.289> don't<00:00:49.860> think<00:00:49.950> they<00:00:50.219> learned

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
original but i don't think they learned

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.510

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
forgettable with all the recolors why

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.850 
forgettable with all the recolors why
they<00:04:13.670> base<00:04:13.879> the<00:04:14.060> stage<00:04:14.329> off<00:04:14.599> that<00:04:14.870> instead<00:04:15.739> of

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
they base the stage off that instead of

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.740 
they base the stage off that instead of
maybe<00:04:16.039> like<00:04:16.370> a<00:04:16.609> stage<00:04:16.910> from<00:04:17.180> a<00:04:17.239> sonic<00:04:17.419> game
