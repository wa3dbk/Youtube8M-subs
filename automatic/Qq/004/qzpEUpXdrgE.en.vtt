00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.440
 talk guys back with one more 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.660
 tutorial here from galaxy note four already 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.340
 made some videos of some with the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.019
 Here custom channel 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.120
 some people have asked me to make a 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.130
 video teaching how it 's there then you 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.289
 need to get into the rich see here 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.740
 pressing the volume button up 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.380
 button to turn the home button on here 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.390
 You will enter a cwm if you still 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.279
 does not have a legacy teaching inscription 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.289
 how to do it rude and how to install this 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.689
 recovery in your 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.719
 the first thing you will do is 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.920
 make a backup of your current system 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.960
 then you can use the volume buttons 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.530
 to navigate or you can use the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.570
 there below the screen then the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.969
 steps are always the same no matter what 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.500
 that you went to install be a rom 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.820
 internal or whatever else you have 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.010
 to back up 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.739
 first because cause in case something 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.390
 It's wrong you can restore then 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.910
 you can save the backup in memory 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.800
 internal or micro sd card that I go 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.690
 do what I find most interesting 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.300
 because you erase the memory of your 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.220
 phone you do not lose your backup 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.979
 So you mark the beginning of the week and it 's 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.409
 if it will start as you are 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.320
 backing up to the micro sd card then 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.570
 the faster your card is 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.810
 This process is going to be fast and 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.060
 three to five minutes depending on the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.700
 still going to release his card and the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.200
 The more time consuming it is to generate the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.329
 md5 which is 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.000
 it will generate a file for when 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:33.450
 you're going to restore the system it's after 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.009
 it will check if the file is 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.289
 corrupted or not then it is very 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.979
 important this part there after you 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.299
 ends now you will do the cleaning 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.880
 so if you are going to install 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.939
 It's a new outfit is always important. 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.399
 you do the ipp date is factor 17 by 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.350
 who clears all the settings you 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.520
 is using on the street today to be able to 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.929
 install a new one 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.509
 if you install anything else 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:01.500
 You will not need to do this cleaning. 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.439
 are you making only haiti cash and should you 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.119
 cash at first you come here aip cash 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.539
 select s 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.370
 this process is very fast when 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.530
 I finished making the other then you 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.180
 here it comes advanced 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.510
 You will see here in Delphi that cash 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.629
 and then you will clean it is the virtual machine 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.739
 android you're going to get out is fine 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.049
 quick as well 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.540
 ready you did the cleaning now you go 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:31.120
 be there what you want can not be 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.799
 a rom a suit anything is always 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.930
 a zip file you downloaded 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.450
 you can put it in the internal memory or 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.129
 in the external memory then you go where 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.650
 You left the file in my case. 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.540
 in the internal memory in the download folder that 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.719
 I downloaded it directly on my cell phone 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.739
 so just navigate to the part of the world 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:48.669
 service in the file that I want to be 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.519
 want nyon 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:54.220
 I just came here and will install 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.930
 remembering that if it is an arrow it is delay 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.090
 more to install than they do not want or 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.410
 another file to finish 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.250
 It's just you come back 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:07.820
 the screen and there you will come reboots system 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.760
 barely there will start your smartphone and 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.280
 hence will load new rom you installed 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.320
 or if you say that in my case 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.980
 and it will recharge you, it was only that 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.140
 with a new tender process will take and 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.480

 here the cash aipim and delphi cash him 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.890
 will have to recover all 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.710
 applications that have installed on three 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.440
 process there takes a while is not who 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.500
 on this screen and then when I finish it 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.880
 will start is the system in case you 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.260
 will install from brown 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.020
 You'll have to set everything up. 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.360
 google account is the things that I 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.760
 I was going with new what was not 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.120
 if I did it here and if there was any 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.640
 wrong thing or if you want to go back 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.530
 previous car in case you have changed 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.010
 that you do restore a backup that 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.700
 You did then you turn your nos 4 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.990
 and then you will enter is back there in the 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.440
 vehicle then hold the volume knob 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.709
 up the power button and the home button 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.560
 until this samsung screen appears. 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.950
 and then you loose to enter the recovery 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.770
 then I will come here and backup 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.390
 restore and then you have two options you 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.660
 will restore the internal memory if you 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.550
 back up there you will restore the 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.190
 external memory if you have saved in the micro 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.410
 sd that was the option I did here 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.390
 then select that the external memory is 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.550
 then all my backups it gets 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.100
 organized from the oldest to a more 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.820
 recent attack was a recent only 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.440
 select is historical and it will come back 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.180

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.910
 after you finish you come back here 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.190
 screen you return here to the beginning and 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.070
 You start and then you will be with a 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.860
 system you were before when 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.070
 You backed up with you, you see, it's okay. 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.630
