00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:20.640

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.570

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.570

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.050

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.509

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.920

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.470

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.400

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:27.780

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.000

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.970
 thing 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.740

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.720

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.190

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.640

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.240
 It was better than my brake is better 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.530
 that the apex is different from the 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.530
 brake disc is a bit different 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.160

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:40.950

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.420
