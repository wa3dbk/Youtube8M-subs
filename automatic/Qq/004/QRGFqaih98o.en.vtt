 And minor codes and seventh codes 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:34.040

 But 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.050
 But to 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.640
 Something restlessly in recent jpop is a Toka Western 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.739
 That 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:51.629

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.130
 Rifflet 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.240
 The middle finger 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.309
 No 4 cases 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.200
 In the ring finger 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.659
 With 3 frets of 5 strings 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.909
 From the matter yeah 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.909
 I'm glad I just release the index finger 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.960
 It sounds a little softer 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.310
 me 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.509
 me 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.509
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:35.720
 Shall we go? 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:37.490
 Well then , hold down the c's and let's get rid of that index finger 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.470
 But was 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.550
 From Yama's first 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.710
 let's go 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:49.159
 It is a zodiac sign middle finger 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.159
 4 frets 2 frets counted from 4 people 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.550
 The ring finger to in 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.800
 It is only this 3 fret of 5 strings 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:06.430
 So from the highlands yes 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:12.690
 Or, if you want to use the stroke , hold down the 5th 3rd fret with your little finger 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.690
 Please bring a ring finger 3 frets of 6 strings like this 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.890
 But ok 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:24.270
 See you again in the major 7th 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.360
 Well that's the case with other codes, but even that c major 7 snow 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.930
 It's not right 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.170
 That's right, with your index finger 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.410
 Valley Code That's the Valley Code 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.480
 I think it's side by side, but 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.620
 It is 8 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.080
 We suppress all 3 frets with 3 fret index finger 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.300
 Yo and 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.950
 84 it in the middle finger is 3 reviews fret 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.490
 Ternary middle finger on 4th fret 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.230
 and again 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.620
 With the ring finger 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:02.620
 I 'm sorry to meet 5 frets 5 frets 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.620
 It is 4 of 5 frets, so with the pinky 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.820
 2 cases of 5 frets 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.430
 Would you say if 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.890
 3 frets with index finger 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.080
 All strings 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:21.140
 Three 4 frets with middle finger at 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.930
 5 frets of 4 strings with finger ring 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.920
 In such a day 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.920
 8 2 reviews 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.040
 From 5 I'm fret at the 5 that if you come with it 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.630
 Sounds a bit high 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.140
 Yes there is a difference here 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.250
 It is the same sound 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.250
 Ah ah ah 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:54.890
 First of all to both of these two I think I would like to use it often 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.590
 There are still other ways to press it, but when you use that jazz something more 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.660
 How to hold complicated 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.040
 There is also something I First of all, please try to remember the two 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.579
 conversation 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:10.829
 c It was about the late wife of the major seventh 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:13.430
 So in the end, remember the major seven numbers or something, and let's come to the beginning of the sound just before gay 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.430
 N 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:23.570
 As we are put to work making or phrase making that it is labor change, and we learn action 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.639
 Code change will just get better too 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:30.050
 It will get better with it and that riff 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:34.819
 To the song 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:38.479
 The riff-making composer tool that fishing port first impression characterize phrase Kedomo it says Li Futte 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:43.909
 I think Fu that kana not you come that helped even if many times on the right side 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:48.129
 So let's remember mountain-chan when there do not know the new behavior act in it 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:48.129
 Thank you again next time
