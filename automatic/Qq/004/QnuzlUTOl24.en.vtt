00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.460 
now this is one of them right here

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.730 
now this is one of them right here
smile<00:00:07.040> nice<00:00:08.090> oh<00:00:09.090> oh<00:00:09.210> oh<00:00:09.450> okay<00:00:10.260> I'm<00:00:10.380> waiting

smile nice oh oh oh okay I'm waiting
okay<00:00:11.250> if<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.300> thing<00:00:12.570> goes<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.110> side<00:00:13.549> it's

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
okay if this thing goes to the side it's

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.470 
okay if this thing goes to the side it's
the<00:00:14.759> middle<00:00:15.330> cerebral<00:00:16.760> if<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:18.000> goes<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.359> the

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
the middle cerebral if it goes to the

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.040 
the middle cerebral if it goes to the
front

it<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.070> anterior<00:00:21.060> cerebral<00:00:21.740> see<00:00:22.740> if<00:00:22.830> it's

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
it is the anterior cerebral see if it's

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.730 
it is the anterior cerebral see if it's
a<00:00:23.070> little<00:00:23.250> nub<00:00:23.580> here<00:00:24.260> that's<00:00:25.260> going<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.529> be<00:00:25.619> the

is<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> posterior<00:01:02.340> cerebral<00:01:04.880> now<00:01:06.200> this<00:01:07.200> comes

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
is the posterior cerebral now this comes

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.380 
is the posterior cerebral now this comes
into<00:01:07.650> play<00:01:07.770> there's<00:01:08.610> why<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.760> want<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.119> use<00:01:09.240> this

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
into play there's why I want to use this

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.510 
into play there's why I want to use this
one<00:01:09.600> because<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.990> shows<00:01:10.020> all<00:01:10.920> thing

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
one because it shows all thing

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.109 
one because it shows all thing
the<00:01:12.299> very<00:01:12.600> next<00:01:12.780> blood<00:01:13.110> vessel<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:14.119> inferior

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
the very next blood vessel just inferior

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.219 
the very next blood vessel just inferior
to<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> posterior<00:01:15.990> cerebral<00:01:16.670> will<00:01:18.229> posterior

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
to the posterior cerebral will posterior

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.820 
to the posterior cerebral will posterior
vote<00:01:19.409> will<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.950> anterior<00:01:20.820> superior

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
vote will be the anterior superior

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.679 
vote will be the anterior superior
cerebellar<00:01:22.830> now<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.850> book<00:01:24.090> they<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.509> say

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
cerebellar now the book they just say

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.810 
cerebellar now the book they just say
superior<00:01:25.350> cerebellar<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.130> really<00:01:26.490> prefer

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
superior cerebellar I really prefer

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.740 
superior cerebellar I really prefer
anterior<00:01:27.420> superior<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:28.110> say<00:01:28.259> superior<00:01:28.740> okay

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
anterior superior you say superior okay

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.249 
anterior superior you say superior okay
the<00:01:30.750> very<00:01:31.140> next<00:01:31.439> one<00:01:31.770> goes<00:01:32.310> into<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.789> internal

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
the very next one goes into the internal

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.620 
the very next one goes into the internal
auditory<00:01:34.259> meatus<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.880> time<00:01:36.149> is<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
auditory meatus so this time is the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.440 
auditory meatus so this time is the
labyrinth<00:01:37.289> iam<00:01:37.649> just<00:01:38.299> below<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
labyrinth iam just below the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.370 
labyrinth iam just below the
labyrinthian<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.799> anterior<00:01:41.580> inferior

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
labyrinthian is the anterior inferior

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.309 
labyrinthian is the anterior inferior
cerebellar<00:01:44.060> now<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.390> take<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.810> model<00:01:46.110> and

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
cerebellar now if I take this model and

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.039 
cerebellar now if I take this model and
plop<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.250> there

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
plop it in there

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:54.770 
plop it in there
this<00:01:49.049> guy<00:01:49.729> matches<00:01:50.729> up<00:01:50.909> here<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:54.119> here<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.509> have

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
this guy matches up here so here we have

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.880 
this guy matches up here so here we have
the<00:01:55.049> anterior<00:01:55.740> superior<00:01:56.240> cerebellar<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.890> look

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the anterior superior cerebellar a look

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.029 
the anterior superior cerebellar a look
underneath<00:01:59.220> it<00:01:59.580> below<00:02:00.090> inferior<00:02:01.080> to<00:02:01.289> it<00:02:01.440> there

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
underneath it below inferior to it there

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.419 
underneath it below inferior to it there
is<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.399> anterior<00:02:02.970> inferior<00:02:03.679> cerebellar<00:02:04.679> that

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
is the anterior inferior cerebellar that

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.650 
is the anterior inferior cerebellar that
matches<00:02:05.880> up<00:02:06.030> here<00:02:07.580> not<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.850> this<00:02:09.179> model

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
matches up here not on this model

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.339 
matches up here not on this model
directly<00:02:10.940> but<00:02:11.940> there<00:02:12.299> you<00:02:12.540> have<00:02:12.569> the

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
directly but there you have the

this<00:02:17.519> model<00:02:17.850> they<00:02:18.780> draw<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.350> in<00:02:19.500> here<00:02:19.980> but<00:02:20.519> they

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
this model they draw it in here but they

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.840 
this model they draw it in here but they
don't<00:02:20.820> have<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.209> coming<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.680> connects<00:02:23.220> yeah

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
don't have it coming so it connects yeah

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.960 
don't have it coming so it connects yeah
it<00:02:24.209> don't<00:02:24.329> connect<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:24.840> down<00:02:25.109> there<00:02:25.579> now<00:02:26.579> on

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
it don't connect this down there now on

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.560 
it don't connect this down there now on
this<00:02:27.660> model<00:02:27.930> look<00:02:28.650> at<00:02:28.799> this<00:02:28.950> guy<00:02:29.269> this<00:02:30.269> guy

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
this model look at this guy this guy

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.160 
this model look at this guy this guy
that's<00:02:31.260> down<00:02:31.650> below<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.250> posterior<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.959> is

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
that's down below and posterior that is

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.880 
that's down below and posterior that is
the<00:02:34.350> posterior<00:02:34.980> inferior<00:02:35.510> cerebellar<00:02:36.890> here

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
the posterior inferior cerebellar here

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.059 
the posterior inferior cerebellar here
is<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.220> posterior<00:02:38.760> inferior<00:02:39.120> ball<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:40.859> fed

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
is the posterior inferior ball and I fed

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.840 
is the posterior inferior ball and I fed
plop<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.519> in<00:02:41.670> they<00:02:42.420> match<00:02:42.630> up<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.730> here<00:02:44.730> you

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
plop it in they match up so here you

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.490 
plop it in they match up so here you
have<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.239> three<00:02:45.660> cerebellar<00:02:46.560> arteries<00:02:47.329> on

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
have the three cerebellar arteries on

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.530 
have the three cerebellar arteries on
here<00:02:49.500> matching<00:02:50.310> up<00:02:50.459> here<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.150> why<00:02:51.269> I<00:02:51.299> like

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
here matching up here this is why I like

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.569 
here matching up here this is why I like
to<00:02:51.660> use<00:02:51.780> this<00:02:52.019> particular<00:02:52.200> one<00:02:52.859> because<00:02:53.430> you

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
to use this particular one because you

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.950 
to use this particular one because you
can<00:02:53.609> see<00:02:54.060> on<00:02:54.299> this<00:02:54.690> exactly<00:02:55.410> where<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.799> goes
