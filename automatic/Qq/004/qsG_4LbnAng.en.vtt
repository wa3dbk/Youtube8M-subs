it's very quick and very simple to do
you<00:00:19.710> cut<00:00:19.920> your<00:00:20.039> strands<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.609> whatever<00:00:20.760> length

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
you cut your strands to whatever length

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.029 
you cut your strands to whatever length
you<00:00:21.150> want<00:00:21.420> but<00:00:21.810> keep<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.170> mind<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.800> will

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
you want but keep in mind that you will

you want but keep in mind that you will
be<00:00:23.189> folding<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.789> half

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
be folding it in half

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.500 
be folding it in half
and<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:26.099> number<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.430> strands<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.910> use<00:00:27.180> then

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
and the number of strands you use then

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.839 
and the number of strands you use then
will<00:00:27.750> be<00:00:27.869> doubled<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:29.130> know<00:00:29.250> when<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.519> after

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
will be doubled you know when you after

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:30.980 
will be doubled you know when you after
you<00:00:29.939> cut<00:00:30.179> them<00:00:30.359> they'll<00:00:30.570> be<00:00:30.660> doubled<00:00:30.960> by

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
you cut them they'll be doubled by

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.520 
you cut them they'll be doubled by
folding<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:32.809> you<00:00:33.809> can<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.050> as<00:00:34.140> many<00:00:34.230> strands

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
folding and you can do as many strands

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.770 
folding and you can do as many strands
as<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.770> want<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.210> be<00:00:36.329> your

as you want it's going to be your

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.420 
as you want it's going to be your
preference<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.410> what<00:00:37.649> kind<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.890> thickness<00:00:38.100> you

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
preference on what kind of thickness you

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.030 
preference on what kind of thickness you
want<00:00:38.670> how<00:00:39.450> poufy<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.020> want<00:00:40.200> your<00:00:40.410> fringe<00:00:40.829> to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
want how poufy you want your fringe to

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.930 
want how poufy you want your fringe to
be<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.600> prefer<00:00:42.600> mine<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.960> be<00:00:43.430> pretty<00:00:44.430> mild<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
be I prefer mine to be pretty mild and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.310 
be I prefer mine to be pretty mild and
I'm<00:00:45.239> actually<00:00:45.420> going<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> be<00:00:45.870> spreading<00:00:46.200> my

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
I'm actually going to be spreading my

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.670 
I'm actually going to be spreading my
now<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:47.010> can<00:00:47.160> see<00:00:47.309> I've<00:00:47.430> already<00:00:47.579> got<00:00:48.680> I've

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
now you can see I've already got I've

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.439 
now you can see I've already got I've
already<00:00:49.980> got<00:00:50.160> two<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.940> here<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.360> I

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
already got two going here and I

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.910 
already got two going here and I
actually<00:00:52.610> have<00:00:53.610> inserted<00:00:54.090> them<00:00:54.800> into<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
actually have inserted them into the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.340 
actually have inserted them into the
stitches<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.510> skipped<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.109> stitch

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
stitches and I have skipped a stitch

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.840 
stitches and I have skipped a stitch
because<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.770> like<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> little<00:00:59.190> bit<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.430> spacing

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
because I like a little bit of spacing

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.119 
because I like a little bit of spacing
between<00:01:00.000> them<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.050> larger<00:01:01.859> yarn

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
between them and this is a larger yarn

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.189 
between them and this is a larger yarn
so<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.910> takes<00:01:03.390> up<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.570> little<00:01:03.719> bit<00:01:03.870> more<00:01:03.960> space

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
so it takes up a little bit more space

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.770 
so it takes up a little bit more space
so<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.159> am<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.369> my<00:01:05.549> third<00:01:05.700> one<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.479> I'll

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
so here I am on my third one and I'll

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.580 
so here I am on my third one and I'll
pull<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.470> out<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:09.360> I'll<00:01:09.540> show<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.840> exactly

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
pull this out and I'll show you exactly

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.660 
pull this out and I'll show you exactly
what<00:01:10.890> I'm<00:01:10.979> doing<00:01:11.540> these<00:01:12.540> are<00:01:12.689> my<00:01:12.979> my<00:01:13.979> strands<00:01:14.549> I

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
what I'm doing these are my my strands I

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.820 
what I'm doing these are my my strands I
have<00:01:14.850> six<00:01:15.210> said<00:01:15.390> leave<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.659> hat<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:16.740> two

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
have six said leave a hat just one two

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.200 
have six said leave a hat just one two
three<00:01:16.950> four<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.189> yet<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.549> six<00:01:17.790> strands

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
three four but yet I have six strands

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.070 
three four but yet I have six strands
and<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:19.049> what<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.350> fold<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.799> half<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:21.080> want

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
and so what I fold that in half I want

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.170 
and so what I fold that in half I want
to<00:01:22.140> try<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:22.740> even<00:01:23.070> as<00:01:23.490> possible<00:01:23.729> at

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
to try and get it as even as possible at

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.880 
to try and get it as even as possible at
the<00:01:24.210> ends<00:01:24.720> but<00:01:24.930> not<00:01:24.960> crucial<00:01:25.380> because<00:01:25.680> I'll<00:01:25.770> be

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
the ends but not crucial because I'll be

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.249 
the ends but not crucial because I'll be
snipping<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.310> at<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> end<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.840> I've

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
snipping it at the end so that I've

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.190 
snipping it at the end so that I've
created<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.799> loop<00:01:29.689> now<00:01:30.689> what<00:01:30.900> we're<00:01:31.049> going<00:01:31.170> to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
created a loop now what we're going to

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.380 
created a loop now what we're going to
do<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.829> we're<00:01:32.100> going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.369> choose<00:01:33.320> my<00:01:34.320> next

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
do is we're going to choose my next

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.030 
do is we're going to choose my next
stitch<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.140> I'm<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.829> go<00:01:37.979> to

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
stitch is here but I'm going to go to

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.550 
stitch is here but I'm going to go to
this<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.880> once<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.750> start<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.350> side

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
this one and once you start on one side

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.230 
this one and once you start on one side
where<00:01:40.920> you're<00:01:41.159> pulling<00:01:41.579> from<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:41.909> side<00:01:42.119> you

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
where you're pulling from one side you

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.490 
where you're pulling from one side you
kind<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.479> want<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.689> stay<00:01:42.869> consistent<00:01:43.470> with

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
kind of want to stay consistent with

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.520 
kind of want to stay consistent with
that<00:01:43.740> because<00:01:44.070> otherwise<00:01:44.960> you<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.110> see<00:01:46.320> how

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
that because otherwise you can see how

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.539 
that because otherwise you can see how
it<00:01:46.680> looks<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.450> this<00:01:48.450> side<00:01:49.070> it<00:01:50.070> creates<00:01:50.430> a

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
it looks on this side it creates a

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.920 
it looks on this side it creates a
little<00:01:51.350> here<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.649> here<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.250> little<00:01:53.689> now<00:01:54.689> if<00:01:54.840> you

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
little here and here a little now if you

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.260 
little here and here a little now if you
look<00:01:55.049> at<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.229> other<00:01:55.380> side<00:01:55.880> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.000> see<00:01:57.030> it

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
look at the other side you can see it

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.780 
look at the other side you can see it

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
creates a band across too so they look

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.639 
creates a band across too so they look
different<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:00.299> either<00:02:00.509> side<00:02:00.840> it's<00:02:01.170> not<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.409> big

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
different on either side it's not a big

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.120 
different on either side it's not a big
deal

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
deal

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.770 
deal
but<00:02:02.250> if<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.430> start<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:02.880> way<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.600> should

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
but if you start one way you should

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.120 
but if you start one way you should
probably<00:02:03.960> stay<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.439> way<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:05.009> it's

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
probably stay that way so that it's

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.560 
probably stay that way so that it's
consistent<00:02:05.340> throughout

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
consistent throughout

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.160 
consistent throughout
throughout<00:02:08.290> your<00:02:08.410> edging<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:10.149> I'm<00:02:10.960> going<00:02:11.140> to

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
throughout your edging so I'm going to

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.360 
throughout your edging so I'm going to
go<00:02:11.320> here<00:02:11.770> to<00:02:11.970> my<00:02:12.970> other<00:02:13.210> side<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:14.650> can<00:02:14.830> see<00:02:14.860> and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
go here to my other side you can see and

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.970 
go here to my other side you can see and
I'm<00:02:16.150> just<00:02:16.510> going<00:02:16.960> to<00:02:16.990> slide<00:02:17.710> my<00:02:18.310> hook<00:02:19.980> through

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
I'm just going to slide my hook through

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.730 
I'm just going to slide my hook through
all<00:02:21.040> through<00:02:21.850> that<00:02:21.880> loop<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:22.810> created<00:02:23.440> and

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
all through that loop that I created and

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.590 
all through that loop that I created and
it's<00:02:24.460> just<00:02:24.610> going<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.790> make<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:24.940> easier<00:02:25.480> to

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
it's just going to make it easier to

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.520 
it's just going to make it easier to
pull<00:02:25.810> everything<00:02:26.110> through<00:02:27.120> okay<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:29.170> now<00:02:29.350> I'm

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.960 
pull everything through okay so now I'm
going<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.740> take<00:02:29.890> my<00:02:30.040> hook<00:02:30.160> off<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.610> now<00:02:30.730> I've

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
going to take my hook off and now I've

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.720 
going to take my hook off and now I've
got<00:02:31.180> this<00:02:31.620> lovely<00:02:32.620> little<00:02:32.950> loop<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.430> threads

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
got this lovely little loop of threads

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.790 
got this lovely little loop of threads
and<00:02:33.970> everything<00:02:34.420> hanging<00:02:34.630> down<00:02:34.870> below<00:02:35.020> so<00:02:35.770> I

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
and everything hanging down below so I

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.470 
and everything hanging down below so I
want<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.100> grab<00:02:36.310> everything<00:02:36.970> that's<00:02:37.300> hanging

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
want to grab everything that's hanging

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.160 
want to grab everything that's hanging
down<00:02:37.720> below<00:02:39.270> okay<00:02:40.270> I'm<00:02:40.720> just<00:02:40.930> going<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.140> open

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
down below okay I'm just going to open

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.630 
down below okay I'm just going to open
it<00:02:41.470> up<00:02:41.620> I'm<00:02:42.010> going<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.220> grab<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.400> with<00:02:42.520> my

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
through okay and then we're going to

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.750 
through okay and then we're going to
tighten<00:02:48.850> it<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.980> don't<00:02:51.130> want<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.340> gank<00:02:51.580> on

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.430 
tighten it you don't want to gank on
your<00:02:51.940> threads<00:02:52.180> too<00:02:52.420> much<00:02:52.630> but<00:02:52.930> just<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.320> know

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
your threads too much but just you know

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.970 
your threads too much but just you know
take<00:02:54.310> care<00:02:54.340> when<00:02:55.090> you<00:02:55.180> do<00:02:55.300> it<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.800> there<00:02:56.800> we've

take care when you do it and there we've
got<00:02:57.160> number<00:03:00.750> 3c<00:03:01.750> looks<00:03:02.590> pretty<00:03:02.830> good<00:03:04.530> okay<00:03:05.530> so

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
got number 3c looks pretty good okay so

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.000 
got number 3c looks pretty good okay so
now<00:03:06.750> we're<00:03:07.750> going<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.900> do<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.170> next<00:03:08.350> one<00:03:08.470> and

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
now we're going to do the next one and

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
bottoms as close as I can they're not

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.400 
bottoms as close as I can they're not
perfectly<00:03:18.010> cut<00:03:18.280> but<00:03:18.640> they<00:03:18.760> will<00:03:18.940> be<00:03:19.140> okay<00:03:20.140> got

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
perfectly cut but they will be okay got

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.860 
perfectly cut but they will be okay got
my<00:03:20.530> finger<00:03:20.890> in<00:03:21.010> there<00:03:24.360> I'm<00:03:25.360> going<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.630> skip

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
my finger in there I'm going to skip

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.759 
my finger in there I'm going to skip
this<00:03:26.590> stitch<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.340> go<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.880> next<00:03:28.000> one<00:03:28.769> and

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
this stitch and go to the next one and

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.130 
this stitch and go to the next one and
I'm<00:03:30.160> just<00:03:30.190> going<00:03:30.549> to<00:03:31.590> slide<00:03:32.590> my<00:03:33.870> hook<00:03:34.870> under

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
I'm just going to slide my hook under

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.750 
I'm just going to slide my hook under
there<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.799> know<00:03:35.980> honestly<00:03:36.220> I<00:03:36.489> should<00:03:36.670> be

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
there and you know honestly I should be

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.160 
there and you know honestly I should be
probably<00:03:37.060> using<00:03:37.299> a<00:03:37.390> bigger<00:03:37.570> a<00:03:37.630> larger<00:03:38.019> hook

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
probably using a bigger a larger hook

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.320 
probably using a bigger a larger hook
but<00:03:38.470> this<00:03:38.830> is<00:03:38.980> just<00:03:39.190> what<00:03:39.549> I<00:03:39.580> found<00:03:39.760> nearby<00:03:40.030> so

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
but this is just what I found nearby so

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.020 
but this is just what I found nearby so
like<00:03:40.420> this<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.560> then<00:03:42.100> I<00:03:42.220> use<00:03:42.370> my<00:03:42.519> finger<00:03:42.850> to

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
like this and then I use my finger to

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.820 
like this and then I use my finger to
open<00:03:43.630> up<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.110> loop<00:03:44.320> so<00:03:44.950> I<00:03:44.980> can<00:03:45.220> easily<00:03:46.830> pull

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
open up the loop so I can easily pull

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.960 
open up the loop so I can easily pull
through<00:03:48.070> everything<00:03:48.370> underneath<00:03:49.140> tighten<00:03:50.140> it

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
through everything underneath tighten it

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.090 
through everything underneath tighten it
if<00:03:51.970> there's<00:03:52.330> any<00:03:52.600> there's<00:03:53.500> any<00:03:53.650> pieces<00:03:53.890> that

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
if there's any there's any pieces that

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.410 
if there's any there's any pieces that
aren't<00:03:54.430> wanting<00:03:54.700> to<00:03:54.790> tighten<00:03:55.150> you<00:03:55.239> can

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
aren't wanting to tighten you can

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.940 
aren't wanting to tighten you can
tighten<00:03:55.720> them<00:03:55.840> individually<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:56.680> make<00:03:56.709> sure

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
tighten them individually and make sure

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.979 
tighten them individually and make sure
they're<00:03:57.130> snug<00:03:57.310> in<00:03:57.580> then<00:03:57.730> out<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:58.120> know<00:03:58.720> this

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
they're snug in then out I know this

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.229 
they're snug in then out I know this
seems<00:03:59.230> like<00:03:59.410> it's<00:03:59.799> going<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.190> come<00:04:00.519> undone<00:04:00.850> or

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
seems like it's going to come undone or

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.720 
seems like it's going to come undone or
come<00:04:01.420> unfurled<00:04:01.930> or<00:04:02.350> unraveled<00:04:03.310> in<00:04:03.400> some<00:04:03.610> way

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
come unfurled or unraveled in some way

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.789 
come unfurled or unraveled in some way
but<00:04:03.790> it<00:04:04.030> really<00:04:04.120> doesn't<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:04.720> you<00:04:05.440> can<00:04:05.590> put<00:04:05.709> it

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
but it really doesn't and you can put it
