scripture and having to consider we were
always<00:00:55.550> told<00:00:55.969> that<00:00:56.120> if<00:00:56.300> you<00:00:56.420> Old<00:00:56.719> Earth<00:00:56.899> you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.739 
always told that if you Old Earth you
had<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:57.980> depreciate<00:00:58.789> the<00:00:58.909> Bible<00:00:59.300> you<00:00:59.480> you

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
weren't really honoring to scripture so

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.660 
weren't really honoring to scripture so
to<00:01:02.629> read<00:01:02.960> something<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:03.769> to<00:01:04.159> encounter

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
to read something and to encounter

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.730 
to read something and to encounter
something<00:01:05.059> that<00:01:05.350> actually<00:01:06.350> held<00:01:06.590> up

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
something that actually held up

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.860 
something that actually held up
Scripture<00:01:07.280> right<00:01:07.640> as<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:08.390> uniquely

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
Scripture right as a uniquely

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.710 
Scripture right as a uniquely
authoritative<00:01:09.500> Sola<00:01:09.950> scriptura<00:01:10.100> and<00:01:10.700> then<00:01:11.390> I

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
authoritative Sola scriptura and then I

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.630 
authoritative Sola scriptura and then I
think<00:01:12.290> that's<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.530> very<00:01:12.650> key<00:01:12.920> element<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:13.520> do

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
think that's a very key element you do

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.219 
think that's a very key element you do
have<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:14.030> have<00:01:14.180> a<00:01:14.210> high<00:01:14.390> regard<00:01:14.570> for<00:01:14.899> Scripture

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
have to have a high regard for Scripture

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.600 
have to have a high regard for Scripture
no<00:01:15.380> matter<00:01:15.560> where<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:15.920> fall<00:01:16.100> down<00:01:16.280> yeah<00:01:16.490> it

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
no matter where you fall down yeah it

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.130 
no matter where you fall down yeah it
was<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.880> first<00:01:16.909> time<00:01:17.329> I'd<00:01:17.540> encountered<00:01:18.020> this

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
was the first time I'd encountered this

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.840 
was the first time I'd encountered this
and<00:01:18.439> yet<00:01:18.619> people<00:01:18.829> could<00:01:19.130> hold<00:01:19.340> to<00:01:19.490> Old<00:01:19.670> Earth

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
and yet people could hold to Old Earth

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.510 
and yet people could hold to Old Earth
and<00:01:20.119> so<00:01:20.299> once<00:01:21.049> once<00:01:21.680> I<00:01:21.799> was<00:01:21.920> introduced<00:01:22.399> to

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
and so once once I was introduced to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.420 
and so once once I was introduced to
this<00:01:22.670> it<00:01:22.909> started<00:01:23.360> me<00:01:23.479> on<00:01:23.509> a<00:01:23.600> journey<00:01:23.990> of

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
this it started me on a journey of

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.620 
this it started me on a journey of
looking<00:01:25.430> at<00:01:25.549> looking<00:01:26.000> at<00:01:26.119> it<00:01:26.240> too<00:01:26.450> but<00:01:26.570> you

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
looking at looking at it too but you

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.149 
looking at looking at it too but you
know<00:01:26.869> looking<00:01:27.170> at<00:01:27.229> both<00:01:27.380> sides<00:01:27.680> of<00:01:27.829> it<00:01:27.979> and

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
know looking at both sides of it and

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.249 
know looking at both sides of it and
then<00:01:28.280> eventually<00:01:28.670> moving<00:01:29.420> away<00:01:29.630> from<00:01:29.840> young

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
then eventually moving away from young

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.929 
then eventually moving away from young
earth<00:01:30.409> and<00:01:30.619> becoming<00:01:30.950> an<00:01:31.280> absolutely

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
earth and becoming an absolutely

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.760

convinced old earth creation what

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.100 
convinced old earth creation what
prompted<00:01:34.219> that<00:01:34.280> move<00:01:34.579> away<00:01:34.729> well<00:01:35.630> I<00:01:35.659> think

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
prompted that move away well I think

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.120

the<00:01:58.579> yann<00:01:59.109> mentioned<00:02:00.109> in<00:02:00.289> in<00:02:00.590> Genesis<00:02:01.070> 1<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.280> 2

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
the yann mentioned in in Genesis 1 and 2

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.749 
the yann mentioned in in Genesis 1 and 2
didn't<00:02:03.170> necessarily<00:02:03.259> and<00:02:03.950> in<00:02:04.070> fact<00:02:04.280> couldn't

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
didn't necessarily and in fact couldn't

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.419 
didn't necessarily and in fact couldn't
mean<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.060> literal<00:02:05.359> 24-hour<00:02:06.140> cycle<00:02:07.100> that's

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
mean a literal 24-hour cycle that's

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:08.770 
mean a literal 24-hour cycle that's
interesting<00:02:07.939> because<00:02:07.999> it<00:02:08.210> sounds<00:02:08.479> like<00:02:08.509> as

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
interesting because it sounds like as

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.630 
interesting because it sounds like as
you're<00:02:08.960> applying<00:02:09.229> sound<00:02:10.130> biblical

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
you're applying sound biblical

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.420 
you're applying sound biblical
hermeneutical<00:02:11.450> principles<00:02:11.990> you're<00:02:12.470> you

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
hermeneutical principles you're you

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.530 
hermeneutical principles you're you
realize<00:02:13.850> that<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.180> younger<00:02:14.420> the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
realize that the younger the

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.910 
realize that the younger the
interpretation<00:02:15.080> didn't<00:02:15.440> seem<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.710> be<00:02:15.800> the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
interpretation didn't seem to be the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.770 
interpretation didn't seem to be the
best<00:02:16.100> engine<00:02:16.310> yeah<00:02:16.490> it<00:02:16.760> didn't<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.599> was

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
best engine yeah it didn't and this was

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.540 
best engine yeah it didn't and this was
new<00:02:17.989> information<00:02:18.590> for<00:02:18.709> me<00:02:18.769> I<00:02:18.980> then<00:02:19.340> had<00:02:19.519> to

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
new information for me I then had to

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.220 
new information for me I then had to
grapple<00:02:19.909> with<00:02:20.090> some<00:02:20.180> of<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.420> theological

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
grapple with some of the theological

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.790 
grapple with some of the theological
implications

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
implications

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.100 
implications
of<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:22.160> such<00:02:22.820> arrows<00:02:23.150> well<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.900> the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
of that such arrows well the the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.110 
of that such arrows well the the
theological<00:02:24.710> implications<00:02:24.770> like<00:02:25.640> death

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
theological implications like death

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.910 
theological implications like death
before<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.690> fall<00:02:26.960> I<00:02:27.170> had<00:02:27.350> to<00:02:27.500> grapple<00:02:27.740> with

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
before the fall I had to grapple with

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.190 
before the fall I had to grapple with
that<00:02:28.040> because<00:02:28.280> I<00:02:28.520> was<00:02:28.670> told<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.540> Romans<00:02:29.960> five

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
that because I was told that Romans five

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.440 
that because I was told that Romans five
taught<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.770> Adam<00:02:31.250> introduced<00:02:31.700> death<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.300> all

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
taught that Adam introduced death to all

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.450 
taught that Adam introduced death to all
of<00:02:32.600> creation<00:02:32.810> including<00:02:33.530> animal<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.310> insect

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
of creation including animal and insect

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.880 
of creation including animal and insect
and<00:02:34.880> vegetation<00:02:35.270> life<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.470> really<00:02:36.680> had<00:02:36.800> to

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
and vegetation life so I really had to

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.830 
and vegetation life so I really had to
grapple<00:02:37.130> with<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.550> then<00:02:37.820> doing<00:02:38.630> the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
grapple with that and then doing the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.570 
grapple with that and then doing the
same<00:02:39.110> thing<00:02:39.350> looking<00:02:39.710> at<00:02:39.830> looking<00:02:40.400> at<00:02:40.520> the

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
same thing looking at looking at the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.880 
same thing looking at looking at the
Bible<00:02:40.760> using<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.240> same<00:02:41.420> principles<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:42.080> sound

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
Bible using the same principles of sound

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.220 
Bible using the same principles of sound
interpretation<00:02:43.580> hermeneutics<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.390> realized

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
interpretation hermeneutics I realized

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.050 
interpretation hermeneutics I realized
that<00:02:45.410> that<00:02:45.830> that<00:02:46.040> verse<00:02:46.280> in<00:02:46.460> Romans<00:02:46.610> five

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
that that that verse in Romans five

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.690 
that that that verse in Romans five
didn't<00:02:47.690> say<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.230> Adam<00:02:48.950> brought<00:02:49.160> death<00:02:49.460> to

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
didn't say that Adam brought death to

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.850 
didn't say that Adam brought death to
all<00:02:49.910> of<00:02:50.210> creation<00:02:50.240> he<00:02:50.960> introduced<00:02:51.380> death<00:02:51.620> to

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
all of creation he introduced death to

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.820 
all of creation he introduced death to
the<00:02:52.010> world<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:53.120> all<00:02:53.270> people<00:02:53.990> and<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.560> saw<00:02:54.710> that

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
the world to all people and I saw that

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.300 
the world to all people and I saw that
it<00:02:54.950> was<00:02:55.070> human<00:02:55.370> death<00:02:55.760> not<00:02:56.600> not<00:02:57.320> biological

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
it was human death not not biological

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.830 
it was human death not not biological
death<00:02:58.490> that<00:02:58.700> Adam<00:02:58.970> introduced<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.570> that<00:02:59.630> was

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
death that Adam introduced and that was

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.170 
death that Adam introduced and that was
that<00:03:00.380> that<00:03:00.590> became<00:03:00.950> once<00:03:01.250> once<00:03:01.580> I<00:03:01.730> solved<00:03:02.060> that

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
that that became once once I solved that

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.520 
that that became once once I solved that
all<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.570> other<00:03:02.690> things<00:03:02.990> just<00:03:03.080> fell<00:03:03.380> into

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
all the other things just fell into

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.740 
all the other things just fell into
place<00:03:03.620> really<00:03:04.160> so<00:03:04.790> that's<00:03:05.420> interesting

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
place really so that's interesting

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.020 
place really so that's interesting
because<00:03:06.110> I've<00:03:06.320> been<00:03:06.500> at<00:03:07.280> meetings<00:03:07.550> where

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
because I've been at meetings where

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.760 
because I've been at meetings where
we've<00:03:08.240> had<00:03:08.330> theologians<00:03:08.990> arguing<00:03:09.440> was<00:03:09.590> their

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
we've had theologians arguing was their

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.320 
we've had theologians arguing was their
death<00:03:09.950> before<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.460> fall<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:10.850> that's<00:03:10.970> exactly

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
death before the fall and that's exactly

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.820 
death before the fall and that's exactly
the<00:03:11.540> position<00:03:11.780> that<00:03:12.140> come<00:03:12.320> down<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:12.560> mean

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
the position that come down I mean

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.680 
the position that come down I mean
there's<00:03:13.040> young<00:03:13.250> earth<00:03:13.430> old<00:03:13.730> Earth<00:03:13.910> there<00:03:14.540> is

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
there's young earth old Earth there is

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.410 
there's young earth old Earth there is
there<00:03:14.960> isn't<00:03:15.310> what<00:03:16.310> there's<00:03:16.550> seems<00:03:17.240> to<00:03:17.330> be

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
there isn't what there's seems to be

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.900 
there isn't what there's seems to be
universal<00:03:17.990> agreement<00:03:18.080> on<00:03:18.500> is<00:03:18.770> that<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.670> fall

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
universal agreement on is that the fall

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.540 
universal agreement on is that the fall
brought<00:03:20.240> death<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.540> Adam<00:03:20.960> and<00:03:21.080> Eve<00:03:21.400> what<00:03:22.400> the

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
brought death to Adam and Eve what the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.460 
brought death to Adam and Eve what the
other<00:03:22.700> implications<00:03:23.420> are<00:03:23.570> a<00:03:23.600> lot<00:03:23.900> fuzzier<00:03:24.110> but

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
other implications are a lot fuzzier but

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.720 
other implications are a lot fuzzier but
that<00:03:24.590> again<00:03:24.830> is<00:03:25.010> something<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.430> is<00:03:25.550> taught

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
that again is something that is taught

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.220 
that again is something that is taught
as<00:03:26.000> though<00:03:26.120> death<00:03:26.390> before<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.780> fall<00:03:26.989> that

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
as though death before the fall that

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.380 
as though death before the fall that
that<00:03:27.560> just<00:03:27.739> didn't<00:03:27.980> happen<00:03:28.010> you<00:03:29.000> know<00:03:29.090> that's

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
that just didn't happen you know that's

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.670 
that just didn't happen you know that's
a<00:03:29.450> very<00:03:29.570> scriptural<00:03:30.080> principle<00:03:30.440> but<00:03:30.560> in

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
a very scriptural principle but in

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.130 
a very scriptural principle but in
reality<00:03:31.130> your<00:03:31.880> journey<00:03:32.330> says<00:03:32.540> no<00:03:33.080> you

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
reality your journey says no you

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.660 
reality your journey says no you
investigate<00:03:33.800> seriously<00:03:34.220> that's<00:03:34.370> not<00:03:34.459> what

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
investigate seriously that's not what

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.610 
investigate seriously that's not what
Scripture<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:35.060> saying<00:03:35.300> and<00:03:35.660> I<00:03:35.780> think<00:03:35.959> also<00:03:36.290> the

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
Scripture is saying and I think also the

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.860 
Scripture is saying and I think also the
big<00:03:36.800> picture<00:03:37.160> theology<00:03:37.640> -<00:03:37.820> of<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.180> Jeff<00:03:38.570> that

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
big picture theology - of it Jeff that

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.130 
big picture theology - of it Jeff that
that<00:03:39.470> did<00:03:39.830> God<00:03:40.070> present<00:03:40.550> the<00:03:40.910> earth<00:03:41.110> so<00:03:42.110> that

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
that did God present the earth so that

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.410 
that did God present the earth so that
it<00:03:42.410> could<00:03:42.560> be<00:03:42.680> looked<00:03:42.920> at<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:43.370> he<00:03:43.910> and<00:03:44.150> people

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
it could be looked at and he and people

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.960 
it could be looked at and he and people
could<00:03:44.540> be<00:03:44.660> fooled<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:45.860> think<00:03:46.100> that<00:03:46.370> you<00:03:46.850> know

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
could be fooled to think that you know

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.270 
could be fooled to think that you know
like<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.239> fully<00:03:47.570> gifted<00:03:47.989> creation<00:03:48.530> is<00:03:48.739> that<00:03:48.920> the

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
like a fully gifted creation is that the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.830 
like a fully gifted creation is that the
way<00:03:49.400> God<00:03:49.640> normally<00:03:50.060> does<00:03:50.239> things<00:03:50.570> does<00:03:50.810> he

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
way God normally does things does he

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.500 
way God normally does things does he
normally<00:03:51.290> present<00:03:51.500> something<00:03:52.060> so<00:03:53.060> that<00:03:53.090> it

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
normally present something so that it

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.810 
normally present something so that it
looks<00:03:53.780> like<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.739> exact<00:03:55.130> opposite<00:03:55.580> to<00:03:55.700> what

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
looks like the exact opposite to what

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.370 
looks like the exact opposite to what
he's<00:03:55.940> actually<00:03:56.120> done<00:03:56.420> right<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:56.989> I<00:03:57.080> had<00:03:57.230> to

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
he's actually done right and I had to

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.020 
he's actually done right and I had to
had<00:03:57.709> to<00:03:57.830> realize<00:03:58.130> that<00:03:58.340> this<00:03:58.459> is<00:03:58.610> not<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.880> god

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
had to realize that this is not the god

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.660 
had to realize that this is not the god
I<00:03:59.060> worship<00:03:59.209> he's<00:03:59.840> not<00:04:00.050> a<00:04:00.080> deceptive<00:04:00.770> God<00:04:01.010> and

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
I worship he's not a deceptive God and

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.120 
I worship he's not a deceptive God and
so<00:04:02.090> I<00:04:02.120> was<00:04:02.690> then<00:04:02.870> able<00:04:03.020> to<00:04:03.410> come<00:04:03.920> to<00:04:04.100> a

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
so I was then able to come to a

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.010 
so I was then able to come to a
theological<00:04:04.820> position<00:04:05.270> that<00:04:05.420> God<00:04:05.600> took<00:04:05.870> his

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
theological position that God took his

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.500 
theological position that God took his
time<00:04:06.320> in<00:04:06.500> creating<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:08.120> God<00:04:08.270> that<00:04:08.300> I

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
time in creating and the God that I

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.920 
time in creating and the God that I
worship<00:04:08.750> is<00:04:09.140> methodical<00:04:09.830> sovereign<00:04:10.550> and

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
worship is methodical sovereign and

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.870 
worship is methodical sovereign and
patient<00:04:11.930> and<00:04:12.110> it<00:04:12.530> actually<00:04:12.830> changed<00:04:13.190> changed

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
patient and it actually changed changed

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.330 
patient and it actually changed changed
my<00:04:14.030> my<00:04:14.360> grand<00:04:14.720> perception<00:04:15.380> of<00:04:15.470> God<00:04:15.530> because<00:04:16.190> of

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
my my grand perception of God because of

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.130 
my my grand perception of God because of
my<00:04:16.489> creation<00:04:17.000> theology<00:04:17.480> you<00:04:17.959> know<00:04:18.019> that's

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
my creation theology you know that's

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.990 
my creation theology you know that's
very<00:04:18.230> interesting<00:04:18.440> because<00:04:19.160> as<00:04:19.489> we<00:04:19.910> were

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
very interesting because as we were

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.849 
very interesting because as we were
looking<00:04:20.180> it<00:04:20.480> seems<00:04:20.690> like<00:04:20.870> as<00:04:21.260> a<00:04:21.290> pastor<00:04:21.769> you

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
looking it seems like as a pastor you

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.050 
looking it seems like as a pastor you
have<00:04:21.890> to<00:04:22.070> struggle<00:04:22.280> with<00:04:22.400> three<00:04:22.610> things<00:04:22.760> one

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
have to struggle with three things one

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.670 
have to struggle with three things one
do<00:04:23.210> you<00:04:23.300> hold<00:04:23.450> a<00:04:23.540> high<00:04:23.690> review<00:04:24.020> high<00:04:24.320> regard

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
do you hold a high review high regard

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.070 
do you hold a high review high regard
for<00:04:24.830> scripture<00:04:25.390> what<00:04:26.390> does<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.750> Bible

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
for scripture what does the Bible

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.020 
for scripture what does the Bible
actually<00:04:27.560> say<00:04:27.800> about<00:04:28.100> things<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:28.640> ultimately

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
actually say about things and ultimately

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.190 
actually say about things and ultimately
I<00:04:29.090> think<00:04:29.180> probably<00:04:29.540> maybe<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.080> most

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
I think probably maybe the most

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.830 
I think probably maybe the most
important<00:04:30.650> is<00:04:30.770> what<00:04:31.039> does<00:04:31.460> your<00:04:31.490> position<00:04:32.390> on

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
important is what does your position on

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.610 
important is what does your position on
