00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.140
 viva fall I am one of my desserts 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.710
 favorites are born for breakfast 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.060
 northern europe but they are so versatile 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.730
 cross that you can use them all 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.110
 the day for lunch as a dessert but 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.910
 also for the children's snack 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.609
 mine also love them because 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.500
 they can eat in hand like muffins 

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:36.449
 I try to propose him and there with the fruit 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.339
 fresh but of course they want them 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.499
 with chocolate stop they are much more 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:41.519
 good to do him good you should have a 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:43.739
 baker's mustache 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.659
 but if you don't have it you can do it with 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.920
 those practical grills from the stove that 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.079
 still allow you to create 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.719
 the effect with the typical booking of 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.030
 this sweet that is born in northern Europe 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.140
 I begin by mounting the whites of the two 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.140
 eggs stiff well 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.570
 I put these aside and now 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.700
 I proceed with the other bodies 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.550
 the yolks 80 g of sugar and then a bit of 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.660
 butter flour yeast milk and a 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.660
 teaspoon of vanilla extract 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.090
 this sweet a little unusual for us 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.130
 Italians for us is very easy to 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.630
 prepare and in my opinion also 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.630
 particularly scenic 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.660
 some natural vanilla extract 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:56.380
 now the flour when you're abroad 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.200
 you can see these sweets in 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.030
 many forms also make squares and 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.070
 also many different colors because then 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.130
 cook them for a long time and make them 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.840
 almost hard crunchy or leave them one 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.820
 little bit softer like those that 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.740
 I will do it today in this way it is easier 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.900
 eat them as a dessert using 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.940
 simply the fork and since then 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.310
 really combine them with many things 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:24.400
 even with ice cream it can also be used with 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:26.820
 glasses a pinch of yeast and then 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.820
 milk 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.590
 if you want to do for the children's snack 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.320
 I advise you to prepare this 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.390
 batter in advance even in the morning 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.490
 black poetry in the refrigerator separated from the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.560
 egg whites when children arrive 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.080
 at home from school you will only have to cook 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.380
 joining whites whipped to snow 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.380
 batter 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.090
 with this quantity or prepare ten 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.130
 those that you don't eat right away 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.690
 they can be safely stored 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:07.290
 just keep them in an arm container 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:08.760
 ethical amalgamates always starting 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.880
 from the outside and proceeding towards 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.830
 the inside gently in this case 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.460
 trying not to deflate too much 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.460
 white new 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.690
 I transfer a whole jug so as to 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.690
 to be able to dose the batter more easily 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.520
 I'm ready for cooking 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.510
 the most difficult part and use well 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.510
 so I have to be careful 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:50.810
 close prepare the other four on 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.790
 cooking time varies from 3 to 4 minutes 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:58.250
 depending on how much you want to roast them 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.530
 and very crunchy to do the best thing 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.110
 to cut them, use scissors from 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.580
 clean kitchen you have to cut them right away 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.430
 when they are still warm 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.930
 otherwise it will be very difficult for me later 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.670
 only a little icing sugar is missing 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.380
 and the shape is the same with chocolate 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.450
 of the mustache there is born just to hold 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:23.030
 the chocolate sauce and I find that 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:25.190
 this ready is very practical indeed 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.480
 and the sauce at hand will fix you 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.480
 really a snack 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.310
 according to the tastes of your family then 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.260
 also choose different combinations 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.600
 because it offered many good folk 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.490
 things for example you could decide to 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.980
 use fresh fruit like 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.800
 some strawberries and then add some 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.430
 top blacksmiths with berries or alla 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.170
 marine and why not also with pistachio 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.970
 a very scenic version less 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.770
 snack and more evening could be 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.240
 the one that accompanies the mustache 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.060
 with a scoop of fiordilatte ice cream 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.060
 and some black cherries inside the holes
