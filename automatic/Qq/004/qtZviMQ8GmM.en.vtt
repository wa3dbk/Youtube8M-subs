a grape is not and finish it's not great

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.060 
a grape is not and finish it's not great
p<00:03:44.860> you<00:03:45.860> probably<00:03:46.190> think<00:03:46.460> is<00:03:46.670> great<00:03:47.240> great<00:03:47.990> p<00:03:48.350> by

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
p you probably think is great great p by

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.300 
p you probably think is great great p by
its<00:03:49.700> nine<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:50.690> finish<00:03:51.080> it's<00:03:51.380> a<00:03:51.620> very<00:03:52.130> potter
