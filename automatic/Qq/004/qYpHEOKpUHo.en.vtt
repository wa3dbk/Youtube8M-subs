00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
to this spot on the map right here jump

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.460 
to this spot on the map right here jump
on<00:01:34.679> top<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.920> these<00:01:34.979> railings<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.659> do<00:01:37.140> see

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
on top of these railings and you do see

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.020 
on top of these railings and you do see
that<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.740> fail<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> little<00:01:38.189> bit<00:01:38.460> right<00:01:38.610> here<00:01:38.909> it's

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
that I fail a little bit right here it's

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.880 
that I fail a little bit right here it's
because<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.479> barrier<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.259> really<00:01:40.500> small

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
because the barrier is like really small

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.910 
because the barrier is like really small
and<00:01:41.780> it's<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:43.170> really<00:01:43.409> hard<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.829> get

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
and it's just really really hard to get

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.600 
and it's just really really hard to get
on<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.729> top<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.150> by<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.900> way<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:47.070> does<00:01:47.340> take<00:01:47.579> a

on on top of by the way this does take a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.760 
on on top of by the way this does take a
while<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.000> learn<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.360> anyway<00:01:48.750> yeah<00:01:49.079> do<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.320> do

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.500 
right here and then jump again so as you
can<00:02:15.840> see<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:17.160> are<00:02:17.280> on<00:02:17.310> top<00:02:17.549> of<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.760> map<00:02:17.940> but

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
can see you are on top of the map but

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.900 
can see you are on top of the map but
you<00:02:19.049> can<00:02:19.230> get<00:02:19.380> even<00:02:19.530> higher<00:02:19.890> but<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.670> thing<00:02:20.880> is

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
you can get even higher but the thing is

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.360 
you can get even higher but the thing is
like<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:21.390> can't<00:02:21.660> get<00:02:21.930> out<00:02:22.769> of<00:02:22.829> the<00:02:23.010> map<00:02:23.190> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
like you can't get out of the map the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.590 
like you can't get out of the map the
same<00:02:23.640> way<00:02:24.000> as<00:02:24.269> you<00:02:24.540> always<00:02:24.870> kind<00:02:25.079> of<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:26.600> that

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
same way as you always kind of so that

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.390 
same way as you always kind of so that
barrier<00:02:28.230> right<00:02:28.410> there<00:02:28.680> doesn't<00:02:28.859> work<00:02:29.160> there's

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
barrier right there doesn't work there's

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.890 
barrier right there doesn't work there's
like<00:02:29.549> a<00:02:29.579> massive<00:02:30.030> barrier<00:02:30.359> there<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:30.810> you

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
like a massive barrier there so you

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.420 
like a massive barrier there so you
can't<00:02:31.140> do<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:31.470> so<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.739> have<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.070> jump<00:02:32.280> around

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
can't do it so you have to jump around

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.360

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
the barrier so from here on out you know

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.400 
the barrier so from here on out you know
