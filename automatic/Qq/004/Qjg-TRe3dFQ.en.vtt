and cut off half my video and when you
go<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.980> video<00:00:41.190> properties<00:00:41.840> so<00:00:42.840> instead<00:00:43.140> of

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
go to the video properties so instead of

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.779 
go to the video properties so instead of
showing<00:00:43.410> how<00:00:43.649> long<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.980> video<00:00:44.190> should<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.460> it

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
showing how long the video should be it

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.350 
showing how long the video should be it
says<00:00:45.000> 0<00:00:45.360> minutes<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.989> 0<00:00:46.079> seconds<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.210> it<00:00:48.210> was

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
into vegas pro and i had to convert it

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.220 
into vegas pro and i had to convert it
into<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.789> different<00:00:54.149> kind<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.360> file<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.140> be

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
into a different kind of file just to be

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.410 
into a different kind of file just to be
able<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.469> get<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.370> even<00:00:56.850> then<00:00:57.149> half

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
you need to climb up here just toss the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.240 
you need to climb up here just toss the
bomb<00:01:07.890> down<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:08.310> now<00:01:08.430> blow<00:01:08.760> up<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:10.250> this

bomb down there now blow up this this

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.429 
bomb down there now blow up this this
rock<00:01:11.549> with<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.330> those<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.689> timeshift

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
rock with one of those the timeshift

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.590 
rock with one of those the timeshift
crystals<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.189> there<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.330> go<00:01:15.479> ahead

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
crystals in there so you just go ahead

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.350 
crystals in there so you just go ahead
and<00:01:15.689> toss<00:01:16.020> another<00:01:16.350> bomb<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:20.090> well<00:01:21.090> you

and toss another bomb in and well you
know<00:01:21.390> what<00:01:21.630> time<00:01:21.840> shift<00:01:22.170> crystals<00:01:22.680> do<00:01:22.920> by<00:01:23.100> now

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
know what time shift crystals do by now

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.429 
know what time shift crystals do by now
it's<00:01:23.549> going<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.850> cost<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.479> dramatic<00:01:24.930> change<00:01:25.170> to

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
it's going to cost a dramatic change to

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.200 
it's going to cost a dramatic change to
the<00:01:25.530> area<00:01:25.890> which<00:01:26.100> will<00:01:26.250> help<00:01:26.369> us<00:01:26.520> advance

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
here we go now this video is going to be

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.990 
here we go now this video is going to be
great<00:01:34.619> I'm<00:01:35.619> going<00:01:35.830> to<00:01:35.920> stand<00:01:36.250> still<00:01:36.610> for<00:01:36.970> just

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000

a second so I can explain some stuff
that<00:01:39.640> will<00:01:39.759> miss<00:01:43.710> we're<00:01:44.710> going<00:01:45.040> to<00:01:45.159> defeat

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
that will miss we're going to defeat

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.430 
that will miss we're going to defeat
these<00:01:45.550> guys<00:01:45.790> to<00:01:46.119> get<00:01:46.270> ourselves<00:01:46.390> an<00:01:46.899> upgraded

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
these guys to get ourselves an upgraded

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.040 
these guys to get ourselves an upgraded
beetle<00:01:47.800> which<00:01:47.979> can<00:01:48.190> carry<00:01:48.520> bombs<00:01:49.000> now<00:01:49.780> at<00:01:49.930> the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
beetle which can carry bombs now at the

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.700 
beetle which can carry bombs now at the
end<00:01:50.200> of<00:01:50.320> this<00:01:50.470> video<00:01:50.710> you<00:01:51.280> will<00:01:51.399> see<00:01:51.430> an<00:01:51.850> area

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
end of this video you will see an area

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.260 
end of this video you will see an area
to<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.740> right<00:01:54.159> side<00:01:54.490> and<00:01:54.850> I'll<00:01:54.940> point<00:01:55.119> out

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
to the right side and I'll point out

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.840 
to the right side and I'll point out
when<00:01:55.420> we<00:01:55.479> get<00:01:55.630> there<00:01:55.690> where<00:01:56.259> you<00:01:57.159> can<00:01:57.460> use<00:01:57.490> the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
when we get there where you can use the

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.359 
when we get there where you can use the
beetle<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:58.509> glide<00:01:58.899> over<00:01:59.200> grab<00:01:59.649> some<00:01:59.920> bombs<00:02:00.100> and

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
beetle to glide over grab some bombs and

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.010 
beetle to glide over grab some bombs and
drop<00:02:00.640> them<00:02:00.820> in<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:01.509> need<00:02:01.660> to<00:02:01.780> do<00:02:01.990> that

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
drop them in and you need to do that

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.020 
drop them in and you need to do that
which<00:02:02.950> will<00:02:03.070> allow<00:02:03.190> you<00:02:03.310> to<00:02:03.460> cross<00:02:03.789> the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
which will allow you to cross the

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.660 
which will allow you to cross the
quicksand<00:02:04.660> and<00:02:04.899> get<00:02:05.649> to<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:05.830> area<00:02:06.220> where<00:02:06.490> this

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
quicksand and get to the area where this

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.690 
quicksand and get to the area where this
next<00:02:06.970> video<00:02:07.420> will<00:02:07.750> pick<00:02:08.050> off<00:02:08.259> at<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:09.070> let's<00:02:09.580> go
