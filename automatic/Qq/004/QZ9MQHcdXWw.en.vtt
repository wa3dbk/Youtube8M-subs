good<00:00:05.930> morning<00:00:06.380> folks<00:00:06.620> there<00:00:07.190> is<00:00:07.279> a

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.310 
good morning folks there is a

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.430 
good morning folks there is a
significant<00:00:08.029> misunderstanding<00:00:08.960> being<00:00:09.230> made

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
significant misunderstanding being made

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.220 
significant misunderstanding being made
about<00:00:09.590> comet<00:00:10.130> Ison<00:00:10.550> stubbe<00:00:10.850> retail<00:00:11.299> looking

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
about comet Ison stubbe retail looking

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.500 
about comet Ison stubbe retail looking
down<00:00:12.440> from<00:00:12.650> the<00:00:12.740> north<00:00:13.039> here<00:00:13.400> this<00:00:13.969> is<00:00:14.180> how<00:00:14.330> it

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510 
down from the north here this is how it

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.720 
down from the north here this is how it
looks<00:00:14.539> so<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:15.200> departing<00:00:15.799> trajectory<00:00:16.340> of<00:00:16.520> ice

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
looks so the departing trajectory of ice

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.330 
looks so the departing trajectory of ice
on<00:00:16.990> appears<00:00:17.990> closer<00:00:18.440> to<00:00:18.710> the<00:00:18.830> earth<00:00:18.949> right

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
on appears closer to the earth right

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.570 
on appears closer to the earth right
well<00:00:20.180> that's<00:00:20.360> wrong<00:00:20.740> let<00:00:21.740> me<00:00:21.859> take<00:00:22.070> this<00:00:22.250> back

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
well that's wrong let me take this back

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.240 
well that's wrong let me take this back
to<00:00:22.609> where<00:00:23.029> we<00:00:23.210> are<00:00:23.240> now<00:00:23.420> and<00:00:23.839> then<00:00:24.560> let<00:00:24.740> me<00:00:24.920> tell

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
to where we are now and then let me tell

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.480 
to where we are now and then let me tell
from<00:00:25.550> directly<00:00:26.119> above<00:00:26.240> to<00:00:26.810> the<00:00:26.839> north<00:00:27.169> to<00:00:27.980> flat

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
from directly above to the north to flat

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.630 
from directly above to the north to flat
on<00:00:28.730> Earth's<00:00:29.150> orbital<00:00:29.839> plane<00:00:30.140> so<00:00:30.949> just<00:00:31.279> if<00:00:31.460> you

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
on Earth's orbital plane so just if you

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.030 
on Earth's orbital plane so just if you
had<00:00:31.820> no<00:00:32.029> other<00:00:32.180> facts<00:00:32.689> whatsoever<00:00:33.010> you<00:00:34.010> would

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
had no other facts whatsoever you would

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.950 
had no other facts whatsoever you would
have<00:00:34.310> to<00:00:34.490> begin<00:00:34.670> to<00:00:35.030> think<00:00:35.270> you'd<00:00:35.660> have<00:00:35.720> to

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
have to begin to think you'd have to

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.390 
have to begin to think you'd have to
begin<00:00:36.110> to<00:00:36.260> see<00:00:36.620> that<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:36.950> incoming

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
begin to see that the incoming

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.520 
begin to see that the incoming
trajectory<00:00:38.150> is<00:00:38.360> much<00:00:38.690> closer<00:00:39.080> to<00:00:39.260> Earth's

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530

if<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:44.630> departing<00:00:45.260> track<00:00:45.560> was<00:00:45.890> directly

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:46.490 
if that departing track was directly

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.730 
if that departing track was directly
over<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.030> earth<00:00:47.180> from<00:00:47.480> this<00:00:47.690> angle<00:00:47.900> it<00:00:48.230> would

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:48.740 
over the earth from this angle it would

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.160 
over the earth from this angle it would
still<00:00:49.010> be<00:00:49.040> very<00:00:49.730> very<00:00:50.090> high<00:00:50.510> above<00:00:50.900> Earth's

comets<00:00:56.540> the<00:00:57.350> timing<00:00:57.860> is<00:00:57.950> much<00:00:58.250> less<00:00:58.550> of<00:00:58.730> a

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.670 
comets the timing is much less of a
factor<00:00:59.030> than<00:00:59.480> where<00:00:59.750> it<00:00:59.900> crosses<00:01:00.290> our<00:01:00.650> path

look at the comet its path out is

look at the comet its path out is
nowhere<00:01:21.620> near<00:01:21.950> our<00:01:22.130> earth<00:01:22.580> but<00:01:23.330> since<00:01:23.600> we'll

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
nowhere near our earth but since we'll
