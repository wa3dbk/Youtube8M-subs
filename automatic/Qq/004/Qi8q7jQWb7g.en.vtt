well<00:03:14.460> it's<00:03:14.880> obvious<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.330> they've<00:03:15.660> been<00:03:15.900> in

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
well it's obvious that they've been in

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.290

the auto audio industry for a long time

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.660 
the auto audio industry for a long time
and<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:24.060> performance<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:25.170> is<00:03:25.670> really

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
and the the performance is is really

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.260

use these pre-selects down here like

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.110 
use these pre-selects down here like
there's<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.790> pause<00:03:48.350> I<00:03:49.350> wish<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:50.400> it<00:03:50.700> wasn't

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
the same button the other thing that I'm

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.229 
the same button the other thing that I'm
trying<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.660> find<00:04:00.930> here<00:04:01.260> is<00:04:01.430> there<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.610> a<00:04:02.640> remote

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
trying to find here is there is a remote

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.930 
trying to find here is there is a remote
control<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:03.959> comes<00:04:04.020> with<00:04:04.500> this<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:05.790> is

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
control that comes with this and that is

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.960 
control that comes with this and that is
something<00:04:06.150> that's<00:04:06.390> very<00:04:06.780> unique<00:04:07.080> for<00:04:08.070> any

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
something that's very unique for any

type of in-car device and I can't seem
to<00:04:13.950> find<00:04:14.190> it

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.659 

okay<00:04:19.030> so<00:04:19.090> I<00:04:19.329> managed<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:19.930> find<00:04:20.289> the<00:04:20.769> remote

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
okay so I managed to find the remote

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.340 
okay so I managed to find the remote
control<00:04:22.120> that<00:04:22.300> this<00:04:22.509> comes<00:04:22.780> with<00:04:22.990> one<00:04:23.169> of<00:04:23.199> my

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
control that this comes with one of my

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.020 
control that this comes with one of my
kids<00:04:23.620> had<00:04:23.800> hidden<00:04:24.130> it<00:04:24.250> away<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.699> actually

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
kids had hidden it away and actually

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.600 
kids had hidden it away and actually
that's<00:04:25.180> one<00:04:25.449> of<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:25.690> great<00:04:25.960> features<00:04:26.470> about

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
that's one of the great features about

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.249 
that's one of the great features about
this<00:04:27.610> X<00:04:27.880> plot<00:04:28.150> is<00:04:28.389> the<00:04:28.599> fact<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:28.990> it<00:04:29.080> does

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
this X plot is the fact that it does

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.710 
this X plot is the fact that it does
come<00:04:29.470> with<00:04:29.530> a<00:04:29.650> full-featured<00:04:30.550> fairly<00:04:31.449> big

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
come with a full-featured fairly big

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.950 
come with a full-featured fairly big
remote<00:04:32.849> you<00:04:33.849> can<00:04:33.880> then<00:04:34.270> give<00:04:34.630> it<00:04:34.750> to<00:04:34.930> a

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
remote you can then give it to a

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.749 
remote you can then give it to a
passenger<00:04:35.470> or<00:04:35.800> someone<00:04:36.069> in<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.280> back<00:04:36.490> and

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
passenger or someone in the back and

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.969 
passenger or someone in the back and
they<00:04:36.819> can<00:04:36.970> fully<00:04:37.180> control<00:04:37.449> all<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.770> functions

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
they can fully control all the functions

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.300 
they can fully control all the functions
of<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.910> X<00:04:40.150> plot

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
of the X plot

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.120 
of the X plot
so<00:04:42.310> overall<00:04:42.729> the<00:04:43.180> Sony<00:04:43.509> X<00:04:43.840> pot<00:04:44.169> is<00:04:44.410> a<00:04:44.440> great<00:04:44.860> in

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
so overall the Sony X pot is a great in

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.360 
so overall the Sony X pot is a great in
