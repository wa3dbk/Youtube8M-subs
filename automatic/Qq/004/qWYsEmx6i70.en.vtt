back to Fort Charlotte and restart there

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.350 
back to Fort Charlotte and restart there
to<00:01:43.800> get<00:01:43.950> more<00:01:44.160> pirate<00:01:44.550> hunters<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.940> come<00:01:45.030> after

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
to get more pirate hunters to come after

00:01:45.360 --> 00:02:00.280 
to get more pirate hunters to come after
you<00:01:45.420> faster<00:01:48.590> amiss

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.810 

so<00:02:01.290> we<00:02:01.380> don't<00:02:01.530> want<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.740> sink<00:02:01.979> them<00:02:02.250> because

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
so we don't want to sink them because

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.429 
so we don't want to sink them because
you<00:02:02.939> only<00:02:03.060> get<00:02:03.240> half<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.659> amount<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.960> plunder

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
you only get half the amount of plunder

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.919 
you only get half the amount of plunder
for<00:02:04.619> sinking<00:02:04.979> them<00:02:05.960> in<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.110> board<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:08.750> use<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
for sinking them in a board and use the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.800 
for sinking them in a board and use the
ship<00:02:10.730> either<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:12.569> repair<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.050> jackdaw<00:02:13.470> or

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
ship either to repair the jackdaw or

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.059 
ship either to repair the jackdaw or
alternatively<00:02:15.810> if<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.230> jackdaws<00:02:16.650> at<00:02:16.860> full

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
alternatively if the jackdaws at full

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.180 
alternatively if the jackdaws at full
health<00:02:17.660> we<00:02:18.660> can<00:02:18.690> send<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.230> Ken<00:02:19.650> Waze<00:02:19.860> fleet

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
health we can send it to Ken Waze fleet

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.930 
health we can send it to Ken Waze fleet
and<00:02:21.140> use<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.319> for<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.860> little<00:02:23.670> bit<00:02:23.849> of

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
and use it for a little bit of

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.870 
and use it for a little bit of
collateral<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:25.650> earn<00:02:25.830> some<00:02:26.130> more<00:02:26.310> gems<00:02:26.610> and

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
collateral to earn some more gems and

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:43.790 
collateral to earn some more gems and
some<00:02:27.060> more<00:02:27.180> rails<00:02:27.450> through<00:02:28.110> Ken<00:02:28.380> Ray's<00:02:28.560> fleet

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.000 

so<00:02:44.460> once<00:02:44.670> we've<00:02:44.880> done<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.690> successfully

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
so once we've done that successfully

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.570 
so once we've done that successfully
yeah<00:02:49.010> our<00:02:49.490> options<00:02:50.000> what<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.600> do<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.960> ship<00:02:51.580> you

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
yeah our options what to do the ship you

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.830 
yeah our options what to do the ship you
don't<00:02:52.790> want<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:52.970> lower<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.330> wanted<00:02:53.690> level

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
don't want to lower the wanted level

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.020 
don't want to lower the wanted level
because<00:02:54.410> having<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.160> pirate<00:02:55.520> hunters<00:02:55.850> come

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
because having the pirate hunters come

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.510 
because having the pirate hunters come
after<00:02:56.330> us<00:02:56.360> is<00:02:56.660> quite<00:02:57.530> helpful<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:57.980> speeds<00:02:58.310> up

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
after us is quite helpful and speeds up

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.410 
after us is quite helpful and speeds up
the<00:02:58.610> process<00:02:58.640> of<00:02:59.210> farming<00:03:00.940> then<00:03:01.940> we<00:03:02.090> can<00:03:02.240> go

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
the process of farming then we can go

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.750 
the process of farming then we can go
into<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.080> captain's<00:03:03.320> cabin<00:03:03.770> and<00:03:04.130> choose<00:03:04.580> our

into the captain's cabin and choose our

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.380 
into the captain's cabin and choose our
upgrades<00:03:05.860> personally<00:03:06.860> I'd<00:03:07.010> recommend<00:03:07.390> doing

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
upgrades personally I'd recommend doing

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.980 
upgrades personally I'd recommend doing
your<00:03:08.600> Holland<00:03:09.020> weapons<00:03:09.410> as<00:03:10.210> main<00:03:11.210> priority

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
your Holland weapons as main priority
