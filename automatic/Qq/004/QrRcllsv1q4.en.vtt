00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
to start off we'll be just removing this

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.600 
to start off we'll be just removing this
skeleton<00:00:10.700> from<00:00:10.850> this<00:00:11.000> hand<00:00:11.240> here<00:00:11.510> just<00:00:12.010> I<00:00:13.010> will

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
skeleton from this hand here just I will

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.310 
skeleton from this hand here just I will
show<00:00:13.820> you<00:00:13.880> how<00:00:13.970> the<00:00:14.360> skill<00:00:14.750> and<00:00:14.780> actually<00:00:15.349> work

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
show you how the skill and actually work

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.740 
show you how the skill and actually work
bloody<00:00:18.320> joint<00:00:19.060> what<00:00:20.060> once<00:00:20.240> it's<00:00:20.450> like<00:00:20.630> the

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
bloody joint what once it's like the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.750 
bloody joint what once it's like the
joint<00:00:21.020> you<00:00:21.200> can<00:00:21.380> just<00:00:21.560> move<00:00:21.770> it<00:00:21.949> around<00:00:22.039> but

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
joint you can just move it around but

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.960 
joint you can just move it around but
there<00:00:23.750> are<00:00:23.900> no<00:00:23.990> constraints<00:00:24.580> like<00:00:25.580> I<00:00:25.760> don't

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
there are no constraints like I don't

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.300 
there are no constraints like I don't
know<00:00:26.060> how<00:00:26.180> to<00:00:26.240> do<00:00:26.390> constraints<00:00:27.050> hit<00:00:27.199> so<00:00:27.529> it's

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
know how to do constraints hit so it's

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.310 
know how to do constraints hit so it's
going<00:00:28.939> to<00:00:29.000> be<00:00:29.060> pretty<00:00:29.240> messed<00:00:29.570> up<00:00:29.810> because<00:00:29.960> the

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
going to be pretty messed up because the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.380 
going to be pretty messed up because the
hand<00:00:30.769> will<00:00:30.890> be<00:00:31.010> able<00:00:31.100> to<00:00:31.220> revolve<00:00:31.880> back<00:00:32.210> on

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
hand will be able to revolve back on

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.299 
hand will be able to revolve back on
itself<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:33.190> we<00:00:34.190> pretty<00:00:34.400> messed<00:00:34.699> up<00:00:35.530> um<00:00:36.530> yep

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
itself and we pretty messed up um yep

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:46.560 
itself and we pretty messed up um yep
did<00:00:37.580> oh<00:00:37.880> bloody<00:00:38.809> hell<00:00:39.760> um<00:00:40.760> just<00:00:41.719> give<00:00:41.870> me<00:00:41.960> a<00:00:41.989> sec

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.040 

there<00:00:47.570> we<00:00:47.600> go

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.540 

still<00:00:52.050> like<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:53.540> all<00:00:54.540> right<00:00:54.660> start<00:00:55.050> off<00:00:55.550> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
still like that all right start off you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.479 
still like that all right start off you
might<00:00:56.700> want<00:00:56.880> to<00:00:56.940> put<00:00:57.060> you<00:00:57.239> i'm<00:00:57.690> into<00:00:58.489> x-ray

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
might want to put you i'm into x-ray

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.930 
might want to put you i'm into x-ray
mode<00:00:59.790> so<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.300> see<00:01:00.510> through<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.080> see

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
mode so you can see through it and see

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.640 
mode so you can see through it and see
the<00:01:02.940> skeleton<00:01:03.809> joints<00:01:04.229> when<00:01:04.350> you're<00:01:04.470> putting

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the skeleton joints when you're putting

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.240 
the skeleton joints when you're putting
them<00:01:04.800> in<00:01:06.710> once<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.860> get<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.220> wrist<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:10.250> go

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
them in once you get to the wrist you go

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.670 
them in once you get to the wrist you go
do<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> thumb<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.240> then<00:01:13.020> you'll<00:01:13.410> have<00:01:13.500> to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
click off on to like the move object

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.850 
click off on to like the move object
mode<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.000> can<00:01:18.270> go<00:01:18.990> back<00:01:19.170> onto<00:01:19.410> the<00:01:19.590> joint

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
mode so you can go back onto the joint

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.070 
mode so you can go back onto the joint
mode<00:01:20.040> select<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.820> wrist<00:01:21.119> again<00:01:21.479> go<00:01:21.840> from

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
mode select the wrist again go from

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.649 
mode select the wrist again go from
there<00:01:22.259> do<00:01:22.410> another<00:01:22.649> finger

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.910 

you<00:01:29.659> just<00:01:29.840> do<00:01:30.049> that<00:01:30.080> until<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:30.560> put<00:01:30.770> all<00:01:30.890> your

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.020 
that once that once that's done you have
to<00:01:56.049> select<00:01:56.320> your<00:01:56.530> skeleton<00:01:57.189> and<00:01:57.280> then<00:01:57.460> shift

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
to select your skeleton and then shift

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.459 
to select your skeleton and then shift
select<00:01:58.509> your<00:01:58.719> arm<00:01:59.759> I'll<00:02:00.759> wait<00:02:01.259> first<00:02:02.259> of<00:02:02.409> all

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
select your arm I'll wait first of all

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.130 
select your arm I'll wait first of all
you<00:02:02.560> got<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.859> put<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.759> joints<00:02:04.509> in<00:02:04.659> their

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
you got to put the joints in their

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.559 
you got to put the joints in their
proper<00:02:05.380> place<00:02:05.710> because<00:02:06.250> otherwise<00:02:07.149> they'll

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
proper place because otherwise they'll

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.180 
proper place because otherwise they'll
just<00:02:07.659> be<00:02:07.810> outside<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.259> arm<00:02:08.590> and<00:02:08.860> it<00:02:08.979> won't

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
just be outside the arm and it won't

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:23.640 
just be outside the arm and it won't
work<00:02:09.550> properly

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:31.350 

to<00:02:24.650> put<00:02:24.860> all<00:02:24.950> these<00:02:25.130> in<00:02:25.400> better<00:02:25.970> position

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.280 

I<00:02:32.190> know<00:02:33.190> that's<00:02:33.550> on<00:02:33.730> your<00:02:33.880> shift<00:02:34.660> select<00:02:35.080> them

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
I know that's on your shift select them

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.420 
I know that's on your shift select them
and<00:02:35.320> go<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.760> skin<00:02:36.760> bind<00:02:37.720> skin<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.590> select

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
and go to skin bind skin and select

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.120 
and go to skin bind skin and select
smooth<00:02:39.790> bind<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:41.440> that'll<00:02:41.680> just<00:02:41.800> give<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.070> a

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
smooth bind and that'll just give you a

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.130 
smooth bind and that'll just give you a
basic<00:02:42.340> binding<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.300> skin<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.870> armed

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
basic binding of the skin to the armed

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.870 
basic binding of the skin to the armed
and<00:02:45.090> should<00:02:46.920> be<00:02:47.920> able<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.280> just<00:02:48.400> move<00:02:48.670> around

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
and should be able to just move around

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.740 
and should be able to just move around
their<00:02:51.000> joints<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:53.460> yeah<00:02:54.460> it's<00:02:55.000> basically<00:02:55.510> how

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
their joints and yeah it's basically how

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.680 
their joints and yeah it's basically how
you<00:02:55.780> do<00:02:55.960> it<00:02:56.080> I<00:02:56.940> hope<00:02:57.940> you<00:02:58.120> enjoyed<00:02:58.510> this
