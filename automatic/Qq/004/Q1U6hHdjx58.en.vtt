protection ok looks really good looks

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.590 
protection ok looks really good looks
better<00:01:09.960> than<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.260> original<00:01:11.360> ipad<00:01:12.360> case

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
better than the original ipad case

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.100 
better than the original ipad case
that's<00:01:13.170> what<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.350> think<00:01:15.110> side-by-side

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
that's what I think side-by-side

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:27.219 
that's what I think side-by-side
comparison<00:01:17.810> on<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.049> bag

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.210 

it<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.530> be<00:01:28.770> stand<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:31.040> original<00:01:32.040> either

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
it can be stand like the original either

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:49.060 
it can be stand like the original either
case<00:01:32.580> and<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.510> extent<00:01:33.810> better

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.190 

ok

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.399 

a<00:01:56.460> true<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.610> angle<00:01:58.090> is<00:01:58.270> even<00:01:58.659> better<00:01:58.930> than<00:01:59.170> the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
a true the angle is even better than the

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.499 
a true the angle is even better than the
original<00:01:59.530> either<00:02:00.280> case<00:02:00.579> is<00:02:00.820> easier<00:02:01.180> for<00:02:01.390> you

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
original either case is easier for you

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:11.670 
original either case is easier for you
to<00:02:01.539> type<00:02:09.750> but<00:02:10.750> one<00:02:10.929> thing<00:02:11.110> I<00:02:11.260> don't<00:02:11.319> like<00:02:11.560> is

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
to type but one thing I don't like is

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.330 
to type but one thing I don't like is
the<00:02:12.489> protection<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.360> not<00:02:13.599> like<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.620> original

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
the protection is not like the original

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.490 
the protection is not like the original
either<00:02:15.550> case<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:15.849> can<00:02:16.180> see<00:02:16.209> you<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:17.080> can<00:02:17.290> get

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
either case you can see you you can get

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:26.640 
either case you can see you you can get
