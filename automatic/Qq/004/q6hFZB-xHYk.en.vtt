running<00:01:02.739> forward<00:01:03.160> you're<00:01:03.280> almost<00:01:03.579> taking<00:01:03.969> all

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
running forward you're almost taking all

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.290 
running forward you're almost taking all
that<00:01:04.210> power<00:01:04.539> straight<00:01:05.259> the<00:01:05.379> way<00:01:05.410> down<00:01:06.240> okay<00:01:07.240> so

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
that power straight the way down okay so

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.749 
that power straight the way down okay so
you're<00:01:07.509> bringing<00:01:07.780> yourself<00:01:07.869> into<00:01:08.289> the<00:01:08.470> height

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
you're bringing yourself into the height

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
hitting down it's you know gravity's

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.820 
hitting down it's you know gravity's
coming<00:01:13.600> into<00:01:13.750> effect<00:01:13.960> put<00:01:14.440> a<00:01:14.470> little<00:01:14.619> bit<00:01:14.740> of
