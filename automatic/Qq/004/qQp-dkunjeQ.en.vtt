00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.530 
someone to find out where you went on
that<00:01:04.559> first<00:01:04.799> link<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.309> have<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.820> visit<00:01:06.240> your

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
that first link you have to visit your

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.050 
that first link you have to visit your
second<00:01:06.990> link<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.860> your<00:01:08.430> session<00:01:08.880> will

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
second link and then your session will

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.810 
second link and then your session will
be<00:01:09.150> private<00:01:09.680> well<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.070> instance<00:01:11.490> I'll<00:01:11.670> go

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
be private well in this instance I'll go

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.570 
be private well in this instance I'll go
to<00:01:11.880> BGR<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.750> then<00:01:13.049> you'll<00:01:13.229> see<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.710> BGR<00:01:14.340> will

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
to BGR and then you'll see that BGR will

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.120 
to BGR and then you'll see that BGR will
not<00:01:14.790> be<00:01:14.970> saved<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.360> my<00:01:15.450> history<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:16.290> CNET<00:01:16.860> will

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
not be saved in my history but CNET will

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.640 
not be saved in my history but CNET will
so<00:01:17.400> let's<00:01:17.580> go<00:01:17.729> ahead<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.180> disable<00:01:19.049> private

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
so let's go ahead and disable private

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.510 
so let's go ahead and disable private
browsing<00:01:19.890> now<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:21.080> actually<00:01:22.130> probably<00:01:23.130> best

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
browsing now and actually probably best

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.950 
browsing now and actually probably best
just<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.790> go<00:01:23.939> ahead<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.180> close<00:01:24.360> out<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.689> tab

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
just to go ahead and close out this tab

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.749 
just to go ahead and close out this tab
here<00:01:25.490> alright<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.880> now<00:01:27.750> let's<00:01:28.049> try<00:01:28.549> type<00:01:29.549> in

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
here alright and now let's try type in

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.640 
here alright and now let's try type in
CNET<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.360> see<00:01:30.570> see<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.079> there<00:01:31.350> in

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
CNET and you see see that is there in

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.859 
CNET and you see see that is there in
the<00:01:31.799> history<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.939> private<00:01:33.299> browsing<00:01:33.509> was

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
the history so the private browsing was
