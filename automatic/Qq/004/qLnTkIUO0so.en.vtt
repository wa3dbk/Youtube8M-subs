personal<00:00:23.189> opinion<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.119> margarita<00:00:24.949> when<00:00:25.949> you

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
personal opinion on a margarita when you

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.870 
personal opinion on a margarita when you
make<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> margarita

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
make a margarita

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.179 
make a margarita
I<00:00:27.150> think<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> crappier<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.199> cheaper<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
I think the crappier and cheaper the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.890 
I think the crappier and cheaper the
tequila<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.670> better<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.240> margarita<00:00:30.689> tastes

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
tequila is better the margarita tastes

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.780 
tequila is better the margarita tastes
the<00:00:31.349> better<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.040> margarita<00:00:32.399> comes<00:00:32.610> out

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
the better the margarita comes out

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.790 
the better the margarita comes out
because<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.270> tequila<00:00:34.110> flavor<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
because the tequila flavor and the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.370 
because the tequila flavor and the
cheaper<00:00:35.100> crappier<00:00:35.520> tequila's<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.380> stronger

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
cheaper crappier tequila's is stronger

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.139 
cheaper crappier tequila's is stronger
as<00:00:37.710> opposed<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.430> like<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.850> higher-end

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
as opposed to like the higher-end

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.880 
as opposed to like the higher-end
tequila's<00:00:39.870> they<00:00:40.050> design<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.440> will<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.649> more

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
tequila's they design it will be more

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.889 
tequila's they design it will be more
smooth<00:00:41.219> once<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.090> put<00:00:42.270> all<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> mixers<00:00:42.750> in

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
smooth once you put all the mixers in

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.630 
smooth once you put all the mixers in
there<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.230> think<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.530> overpowers<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
there and I think it overpowers the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.940 
there and I think it overpowers the
flavor<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.329> tequila<00:00:45.629> was<00:00:45.989> just<00:00:46.140> my<00:00:46.289> opinion<00:00:46.770> I

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
flavor the tequila was just my opinion I

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.190 
flavor the tequila was just my opinion I
could<00:00:47.610> be<00:00:47.760> wrong<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.450> don't<00:00:48.719> think<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.020> had

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
could be wrong but I don't think I had

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.959 
could be wrong but I don't think I had
so<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:49.890> I'm<00:00:50.070> gonna<00:00:50.160> run<00:00:50.430> over<00:00:50.460> there<00:00:50.700> grab

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
so but I'm gonna run over there grab

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.250 
so but I'm gonna run over there grab
some<00:00:51.180> boiling<00:00:51.390> water<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.840> I'll<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.140> right

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260
