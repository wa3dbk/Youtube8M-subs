00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
question how far do you I think the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.230 
question how far do you I think the
Detroit<00:01:28.590> Pistons<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.250> make<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
Detroit Pistons can make it in the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.999 
Detroit Pistons can make it in the
playoffs<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.990> do<00:01:31.170> think<00:01:31.619> they're<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:31.920> to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
playoffs I do think they're going to

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.679 
playoffs I do think they're going to
make<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.310> playoffs<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.299> don't<00:01:33.479> think

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
make the playoffs but I just don't think

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.300 
make the playoffs but I just don't think
they're<00:01:33.840> getting<00:01:33.990> past<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.560> first<00:01:34.799> or<00:01:34.979> second

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
they're getting past the first or second

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.190 
they're getting past the first or second
round<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.790> second<00:01:36.240> round<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.570> farthest<00:01:36.930> I

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
round the second round is the farthest I

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.260 
round the second round is the farthest I
see<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> Detroit<00:01:37.890> Pistons<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.790> that's

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
see the Detroit Pistons going and that's

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.149 
see the Detroit Pistons going and that's
only<00:01:39.479> if<00:01:39.689> they<00:01:39.810> plan<00:01:40.079> certain<00:01:40.470> teams<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:41.009> if
