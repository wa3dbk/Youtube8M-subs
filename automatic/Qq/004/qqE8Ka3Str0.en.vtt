00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.370
 first match here on the pasar what 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.379
 does that with a soccer player 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.440
 gushing wings how those supporters 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.869
 stand behind the team and how they mail 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.980
 from we the team it feels good feels very 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.539
 yummy 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.400
 it feels good but it is also going well 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.590
 for you we Cor is almost good at it 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.090
 the as good as in every match and you 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.520
 are very present 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.470
 that's a nice feeling, I suppose 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.309
 yes i feel good here i feel 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.289
 home and yes we have good group and can 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.370
 just do my thing and there i am 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.050
 good at it 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.079
 you weren't really known as a like 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.489
 a goal scorer really one in the 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.440
 past but that ball and flow now 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.870
 nevertheless it also very smoothly ahead 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.660
 you yes certainly yes in itself in the youth choir 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.100
 the coco am so far have last year 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.980
 two years I didn't score that much 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.710
 but I do score something in the gentleman 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.379
 number of grains and now choice comes again 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.600
 trust has it all 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.219
 to do with confidence is this the the 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.930
 trainer who already gives so much confidence 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.969
 so that you get better returns 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.380
 I certainly think so because I think so 

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:09.970
 trust is very important for one 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.310
 mainly play offside or aerospace 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.860
 striker needs her confidence to 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.830
 thing to do and well i guess the 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.960
 trust there is the basis to perform 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.390
 after such a preparation you lie yourself 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.830
 Then targets on to order during season 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.630
 reach 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.290
 well i just want every wester it 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.150
 Give 100% and 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.160
 I don't have that recognizable goal 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.840
 natural goal omar I eavesdrop on me 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.200
 I just want to do my best 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.970
 the field and you have to see where 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.530
 the ship is stranded 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.660
 do you actually know which team that is 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.550
 played here today on at the 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.980
 informed that it was a first class there and 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.930
 that they are ambitious and so on 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.740
 I love that I am aware of them 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:55.280
 a Belgian first division club 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.800
 and still does with his previous one 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.450
 match what do you think of the van 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.770
 core of the group but that will become you 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.400
 got into it 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.910
 quality on a roof 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.070
 this season 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.500
 yes i think group was very strong 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.600
 and that they already work for each other 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.670
 with the outside the outside football also one 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.530
 good group is just a yes 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.030
 so everyone can work for each other 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.340
 I think what did you komodo 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.530
 because you still have 3 weeks left 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.959
 time to hack around first 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.560
 competition starts what is possible 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.650
 yet 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.940
 even better within that group of women I think 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.680
 how often come to play with each other 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.420
 I'm sure it's going to get better in the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.209
 Groups to the I see you are the basis of 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.250
 well so how we are going to play the better the 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.900
 I think it's going to be a group because that one 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.209
 automatic mission will indeed come 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.070
 well what tina you see me with a 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.290
 Kevin's behind you the ones you find 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.970
 each other yes yes certainly like me 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.590
 previously said where about that 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.090
 before we go here 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.980
 came that we would tell each other how much 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.299
 search and I see that it also works and 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.220
 works out well 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.720
 this is how you play each other in the in the 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.970
 team and that goes well 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.180
 yes that will certainly be good both 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.560
 from Dutch soil so fine Kevin 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.360
 name is who you still very successful 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.160
 upcoming practice matches and hopefully also 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.420
 in the competition you meant for the 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.420
 competition will be fine
