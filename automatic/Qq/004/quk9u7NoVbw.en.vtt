these are the ground and where's the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.589 
these are the ground and where's the
capacitors<00:03:43.590> somewhere<00:03:44.099> around<00:03:44.190> here<00:03:44.549> so<00:03:45.299> the

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
capacitors somewhere around here so the

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.210 
capacitors somewhere around here so the
capacitors<00:03:46.230> are<00:03:46.260> right<00:03:46.739> here<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:49.470> they're

go ahead and get that this is a you want
to<00:04:23.880> get<00:04:24.000> asadullin<00:04:24.330> that<00:04:24.720> has<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:24.870> thinner<00:04:25.260> tip

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
to get asadullin that has a thinner tip

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:38.750 
to get asadullin that has a thinner tip
this<00:04:26.910> one's<00:04:27.150> kind<00:04:27.389> of<00:04:27.450> bulky

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:49.230 

alright<00:04:40.199> then<00:04:41.199> let's<00:04:41.680> do<00:04:41.860> it<00:04:41.889> again<00:04:48.240> there's

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
alright then let's do it again there's

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.790 
alright then let's do it again there's
another<00:04:49.389> way<00:04:49.810> to<00:04:49.870> take<00:04:50.139> this<00:04:50.290> off<00:04:50.500> you<00:04:50.680> can

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
another way to take this off you can

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.770 
another way to take this off you can
just<00:04:50.860> heat<00:04:51.160> it<00:04:51.280> up<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:51.610> wiggle<00:04:52.570> it<00:04:52.600> off

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
just heat it up and wiggle it off

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:06.920 
just heat it up and wiggle it off
another<00:04:53.080> side

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.990 

that<00:05:07.930> was<00:05:08.020> a<00:05:08.080> good<00:05:08.260> one<00:05:08.380> and<00:05:08.680> now<00:05:09.250> you<00:05:09.310> had<00:05:09.760> that

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
that was a good one and now you had that

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.240 
that was a good one and now you had that
know<00:05:10.330> on<00:05:10.600> the<00:05:10.990> back<00:05:11.200> side<00:05:11.470> of<00:05:11.530> it<00:05:11.710> you<00:05:11.980> want<00:05:12.100> to

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
know on the back side of it you want to

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.670 
know on the back side of it you want to
like<00:05:12.370> slightly<00:05:12.820> pull<00:05:13.120> tug<00:05:13.450> on<00:05:13.600> it<00:05:13.660> and<00:05:13.990> then

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
like slightly pull tug on it and then

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.280 
like slightly pull tug on it and then
wiggle<00:05:15.580> that<00:05:15.880> out<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:18.480> we<00:05:19.480> will<00:05:19.720> that<00:05:19.960> side

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
wiggle that out and we will that side

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:26.310 
wiggle that out and we will that side
out<00:05:23.970> just<00:05:24.970> like<00:05:25.090> that<00:05:25.360> and<00:05:25.600> do<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:25.810> same<00:05:26.080> for

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
out just like that and do the same for

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:33.990 
out just like that and do the same for
the<00:05:26.530> other<00:05:26.680> one<00:05:30.780> see<00:05:31.780> that<00:05:32.610> then<00:05:33.610> you<00:05:33.730> got<00:05:33.850> them

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
the other one see that then you got them

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.110 
the other one see that then you got them
both<00:05:34.120> out<00:05:34.710> the<00:05:35.710> negative<00:05:36.130> the<00:05:36.490> stripe<00:05:36.790> is<00:05:37.000> the

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
both out the negative the stripe is the

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.720 
both out the negative the stripe is the
negative<00:05:37.300> by<00:05:38.020> the<00:05:38.080> way<00:05:38.260> and<00:05:38.560> see<00:05:39.460> there's<00:05:39.670> a

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
negative by the way and see there's a

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.800 
negative by the way and see there's a
bulge<00:05:39.970> you<00:05:40.510> could<00:05:40.690> definitely<00:05:40.870> tell

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
bulge you could definitely tell

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.980 
bulge you could definitely tell
and<00:05:43.810> this<00:05:43.930> one's<00:05:44.140> bulge<00:05:44.410> -<00:05:45.570> all<00:05:46.570> right<00:05:46.720> so

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
and this one's bulge - all right so

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.860 
and this one's bulge - all right so
let's<00:05:47.350> replace<00:05:47.650> those<00:05:47.950> as<00:05:48.160> a<00:05:48.190> 25<00:05:48.700> volt<00:05:48.870> 820

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
let's replace those as a 25 volt 820

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.100 
let's replace those as a 25 volt 820
micro<00:05:50.170> farts<00:05:50.500> and<00:05:51.000> give<00:05:52.000> me<00:05:52.090> those<00:05:52.240> capacitors

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
micro farts and give me those capacitors

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.630 
micro farts and give me those capacitors
right<00:05:53.290> there<00:05:53.500> we've<00:05:53.710> got<00:05:53.740> these<00:05:54.040> you<00:05:54.370> get<00:05:54.520> them

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
right there we've got these you get them

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.970 
right there we've got these you get them
anywhere

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
anywhere
