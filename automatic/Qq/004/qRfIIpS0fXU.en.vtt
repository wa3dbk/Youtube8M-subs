slide them in to your workbench and

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.890 
slide them in to your workbench and
choose<00:04:21.420> the<00:04:22.610> height<00:04:23.610> of<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:24.240> fence<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:24.750> you

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
choose the height of the fence that you

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.230 
choose the height of the fence that you
want<00:04:25.230> the<00:04:25.500> fence<00:04:25.919> itself<00:04:26.490> has<00:04:26.700> a
