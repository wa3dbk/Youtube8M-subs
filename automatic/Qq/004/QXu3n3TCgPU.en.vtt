00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
you how to do the recover effect recover

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.799 
you how to do the recover effect recover
is<00:00:14.009> one<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.429> best<00:00:14.790> products<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.389> Secret

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
is one of the best products that Secret

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.740 
is one of the best products that Secret
halves<00:00:16.020> uses<00:00:16.529> nanoparticles<00:00:17.600> basically<00:00:18.600> it's

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
halves uses nanoparticles basically it's

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.330 
halves uses nanoparticles basically it's
going<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.930> go<00:00:19.080> into<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.560> skin<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:19.920> create

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
going to go into the skin and create

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.450 
going to go into the skin and create
like<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.570> matrix<00:00:21.570> like<00:00:21.949> bladder<00:00:22.949> it's<00:00:23.250> going<00:00:23.400> to

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
like a matrix like bladder it's going to

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.759 
like a matrix like bladder it's going to
pull<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.970> skin<00:00:24.090> real<00:00:24.420> tight<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.470> Debbie

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
pull the skin real tight and a Debbie

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.769 
pull the skin real tight and a Debbie
will<00:00:26.010> be<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.369> great<00:00:26.730> candidate<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.180> us<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.630> see

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
will be a great candidate for us to see

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.779 
will be a great candidate for us to see
the<00:00:27.960> full<00:00:28.140> power<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.650> recover<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.490> fact

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the full power of the recover in fact

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.089 
the full power of the recover in fact
I'm<00:00:30.090> not<00:00:30.359> only<00:00:30.510> going<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.840> do<00:00:30.960> one<00:00:31.230> recover<00:00:31.650> I'm

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
I'm not only going to do one recover I'm

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.370 
I'm not only going to do one recover I'm
going<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.340> do<00:00:32.460> two<00:00:32.969> Ricard<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.750> call<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
going to do two Ricard I call this the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.100 
going to do two Ricard I call this the
double<00:00:34.980> recover<00:00:35.610> effect<00:00:36.030> basically<00:00:36.960> we're

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
double recover effect basically we're

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.709 
double recover effect basically we're
going<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.260> put<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.969> for<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> first<00:00:39.270> 15

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
going to put it on for the first 15

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.060 
going to put it on for the first 15
minutes<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.200> then<00:00:40.350> we're<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.649> wash<00:00:40.860> it

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
minutes and then we're going to wash it

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.340 
minutes and then we're going to wash it
off<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.460> do<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.700> at<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.180> end<00:00:42.210> for<00:00:42.690> another<00:00:42.930> 15

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
off and do it at the end for another 15

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.130 
off and do it at the end for another 15
minutes<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:44.129> we've<00:00:44.910> been<00:00:45.030> told<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.600> if<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:45.840> do

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
minutes so we've been told that if we do

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.619 
minutes so we've been told that if we do
it<00:00:46.170> together<00:00:46.440> back-to-back<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:48.059> results<00:00:48.510> are

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
it together back-to-back the results are

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:56.549 
it together back-to-back the results are
going<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:48.899> better<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.440> better

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.709 

how<00:00:57.559> do<00:00:57.620> you<00:00:57.769> do<00:00:57.949> the<00:00:58.100> recover<00:00:58.489> just<00:00:58.760> how<00:00:59.390> we<00:00:59.449> do

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
how do you do the recover just how we do

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.119 
how do you do the recover just how we do
the<00:00:59.930> first<00:01:00.199> thing<00:01:00.410> you<00:01:00.530> want<00:01:00.710> to<00:01:00.769> make<00:01:00.859> sure

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
the first thing you want to make sure

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.850 
the first thing you want to make sure
you<00:01:01.399> do<00:01:01.550> is<00:01:01.730> activate<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.629> product<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.230> most

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
you do is activate the product and most

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.249 
you do is activate the product and most
people<00:01:04.460> or<00:01:04.640> sometimes<00:01:05.540> you<00:01:05.690> can<00:01:05.840> forget<00:01:05.990> to

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
people or sometimes you can forget to

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:07.840 
people or sometimes you can forget to
activate<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.799> product<00:01:07.070> you<00:01:07.280> just<00:01:07.490> put<00:01:07.640> it<00:01:07.729> on

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
activate the product you just put it on

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.090 
activate the product you just put it on
the<00:01:08.000> on<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.690> skin<00:01:08.990> it's<00:01:09.229> not<00:01:09.440> going<00:01:09.649> to<00:01:09.710> work

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
the on the skin it's not going to work

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.649 
the on the skin it's not going to work
and<00:01:10.369> how<00:01:10.520> do<00:01:10.580> you<00:01:10.729> activate<00:01:11.000> it<00:01:11.210> you<00:01:11.240> just<00:01:11.479> take

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
and how do you activate it you just take

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.480 
and how do you activate it you just take
the<00:01:11.930> bag<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:12.470> you<00:01:12.500> shake<00:01:12.770> it<00:01:12.920> shake<00:01:13.100> it<00:01:13.159> shake

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
the bag and you shake it shake it shake

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.240 
the bag and you shake it shake it shake
it<00:01:13.549> shake<00:01:13.940> it<00:01:14.570> again<00:01:14.690> and<00:01:15.170> basically<00:01:15.649> the

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
it shake it again and basically the

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.160 
it shake it again and basically the
nanoparticles<00:01:17.030> are<00:01:17.149> activated<00:01:17.810> it's<00:01:18.020> going

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
nanoparticles are activated it's going

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.080 
nanoparticles are activated it's going
to<00:01:18.259> be<00:01:18.380> more<00:01:18.649> like<00:01:18.830> a<00:01:18.860> squishy<00:01:19.399> and

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
to be more like a squishy and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.570 
to be more like a squishy and
multiplying<00:01:20.750> almost<00:01:21.710> like<00:01:21.799> a<00:01:21.830> liquid<00:01:22.310> paste

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
multiplying almost like a liquid paste

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.969 
multiplying almost like a liquid paste
okay<00:01:22.970> that's<00:01:23.750> how<00:01:23.869> you<00:01:23.930> activate<00:01:24.289> and<00:01:24.860> when

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
okay that's how you activate and when

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.010 
okay that's how you activate and when
you<00:01:25.070> apply<00:01:25.340> onto<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.940> skin<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:26.750> want<00:01:26.869> to<00:01:26.960> make

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
you apply onto the skin you want to make

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.660 
you apply onto the skin you want to make
sure<00:01:27.200> that<00:01:27.350> face<00:01:27.590> is<00:01:27.830> a<00:01:27.860> little<00:01:28.220> damp<00:01:28.490> because

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
sure that face is a little damp because

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.850 
sure that face is a little damp because
it<00:01:28.940> literally<00:01:29.420> got<00:01:29.600> ten<00:01:29.929> seconds<00:01:30.409> before<00:01:30.590> it

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
it literally got ten seconds before it

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.760 
it literally got ten seconds before it
turns<00:01:31.159> like<00:01:31.399> paste<00:01:32.030> it<00:01:32.330> gets<00:01:32.780> hard<00:01:33.289> the

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
turns like paste it gets hard the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.950 
turns like paste it gets hard the
nanoparticles<00:01:34.490> in<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:35.210> you<00:01:35.270> know<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:35.659> take

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
nanoparticles in so you know you take

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.230 
nanoparticles in so you know you take
like<00:01:36.170> maybe<00:01:36.440> like<00:01:36.740> a<00:01:36.800> like<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.250> gauze<00:01:37.550> and<00:01:37.940> kind

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
like maybe like a like a gauze and kind

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.330 
like maybe like a like a gauze and kind
of<00:01:38.330> with<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.170> skin<00:01:39.409> a<00:01:39.440> little<00:01:39.679> bit<00:01:39.830> you<00:01:40.190> know

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
of with the skin a little bit you know

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.370 
of with the skin a little bit you know
just<00:01:41.300> make<00:01:41.569> sure<00:01:41.690> that<00:01:41.869> their<00:01:42.020> face<00:01:42.170> is<00:01:42.350> a

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
just make sure that their face is a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.740 
just make sure that their face is a
little<00:01:42.740> wet<00:01:43.159> before<00:01:43.550> you<00:01:43.759> apply<00:01:44.090> it<00:01:44.149> on<00:01:44.360> and

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
little wet before you apply it on and

okay<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:56.220> we're<00:03:56.370> actually<00:03:56.489> going<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:56.879> do<00:03:57.060> that

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
okay so we're actually going to do that

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.970 
okay so we're actually going to do that
on<00:03:57.390> top<00:03:57.569> of<00:03:57.629> the<00:03:57.810> recurring<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.470> think<00:03:58.829> the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
on top of the recurring I think the

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.059 
on top of the recurring I think the
results<00:03:59.400> would<00:03:59.519> be<00:03:59.670> enough<00:04:00.450> so<00:04:01.019> I'm<00:04:01.140> going<00:04:01.739> to

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
results would be enough so I'm going to

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.490 
results would be enough so I'm going to
take<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.910> face<00:04:03.120> area<00:04:03.360> now<00:04:03.989> I<00:04:04.049> want<00:04:04.200> you<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.349> put

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
take the face area now I want you to put

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.050 
take the face area now I want you to put
it<00:04:04.590> on<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.769> lap<00:04:04.980> line<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.549> kind<00:04:05.640> of<00:04:05.730> go<00:04:05.910> in<00:04:06.000> the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
it on the lap line and kind of go in the

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:14.089 
it on the lap line and kind of go in the
upward<00:04:06.390> direction<00:04:11.209> it<00:04:12.560> could<00:04:13.560> be<00:04:13.620> awkward<00:04:13.829> or

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
upward direction it could be awkward or

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.379

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.840 
perfect next time and if of the eye Sam
you<00:04:22.590> could<00:04:22.740> put<00:04:22.949> a<00:04:22.979> little<00:04:23.220> drop<00:04:23.430> under<00:04:23.729> the

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
you could put a little drop under the

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.210 
you could put a little drop under the
eye<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:24.240> could<00:04:24.419> do<00:04:24.600> semi<00:04:24.990> circles<00:04:25.560> like<00:04:25.949> that

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
eye you could do semi circles like that

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.860 
eye you could do semi circles like that
okay<00:04:26.610> so<00:04:27.510> I<00:04:27.780> can<00:04:28.440> do<00:04:28.650> this

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.360 

and<00:04:32.870> kind<00:04:33.140> of<00:04:33.200> underneath<00:04:33.590> dodge<00:04:33.890> like<00:04:34.130> that

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
and kind of underneath dodge like that

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.080 
and kind of underneath dodge like that
and<00:04:34.700> I<00:04:34.880> go<00:04:35.090> around<00:04:35.420> like<00:04:35.870> this<00:04:36.850> reason<00:04:37.850> we<00:04:37.940> do

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
and I go around like this reason we do

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.210 
and I go around like this reason we do
it<00:04:38.210> in<00:04:38.330> that<00:04:38.480> direction<00:04:38.690> because<00:04:39.290> by<00:04:39.920> pushing

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
it in that direction because by pushing

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.570 
it in that direction because by pushing
the<00:04:40.430> lymphatic<00:04:40.940> pull<00:04:41.150> it<00:04:41.240> out<00:04:41.440> and<00:04:42.440> around<00:04:43.430> the

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
the lymphatic pull it out and around the

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.090 
the lymphatic pull it out and around the

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
eyes and reduce the my bags by doing

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.130 
eyes and reduce the my bags by doing
that<00:04:46.220> you<00:04:46.370> just<00:04:46.580> do<00:04:46.700> it<00:04:46.820> gently<00:04:47.000> you<00:04:47.390> know<00:04:47.480> but

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140

the<00:04:51.500> neuro<00:04:51.740> peptides<00:04:52.070> and<00:04:52.520> kind<00:04:52.700> of<00:04:52.760> go<00:04:52.880> deep

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
the neuro peptides and kind of go deep

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.800 
the neuro peptides and kind of go deep
into<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:53.990> skin<00:04:54.140> edges

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810

face serum icing what's next I great now
I<00:05:02.120> can<00:05:02.300> we<00:05:02.570> just<00:05:02.750> do<00:05:02.840> the<00:05:02.960> same<00:05:03.110> thing<00:05:03.170> okay<00:05:04.240> but

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
I can we just do the same thing okay but

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.790 
I can we just do the same thing okay but
basically<00:05:05.690> it's<00:05:06.020> a<00:05:06.110> protein<00:05:06.470> it's<00:05:06.680> like<00:05:06.770> a

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
basically it's a protein it's like a

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.010 
basically it's a protein it's like a
