00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
100 about the card and I will try to

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.959 
100 about the card and I will try to
perform<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.700> data<00:00:51.090> recovery<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.940> you

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
perform a data recovery for it and you

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.660 
perform a data recovery for it and you
will<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.410> car<00:00:55.680> now<00:00:55.949> there<00:00:56.489> is

we'll see my okay my two partitions here

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.069 
we'll see my okay my two partitions here
and<00:01:27.450> then<00:01:27.659> there<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.960> another<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:30.420> f<00:01:30.600> drive

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
and then there is another the f drive

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.710 
and then there is another the f drive
which<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.710> my<00:01:31.979> card<00:01:32.280> when<00:01:33.000> one<00:01:33.329> gigabyte

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
which is the my card when one gigabyte

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.700 
which is the my card when one gigabyte
almost<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:35.240> what<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.720> do<00:01:36.930> basically

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the card and to look for files that were

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.950 
the card and to look for files that were
there<00:01:46.020> before<00:01:46.049> deletion<00:01:47.009> before<00:01:47.430> formatting

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
there before deletion before formatting

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.010 
there before deletion before formatting
okay<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.439> that's<00:01:50.130> taking<00:01:51.030> well<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.600> little<00:01:51.780> bit

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
okay and that's taking well a little bit

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.350 
okay and that's taking well a little bit
i<00:01:52.049> mean<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.740> hard<00:01:52.979> drives<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.909> take<00:01:54.090> up<00:01:54.329> to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
i mean for hard drives it can take up to

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.910 
i mean for hard drives it can take up to
you<00:01:55.079> know<00:01:56.060> 24<00:01:57.060> hours<00:01:57.420> 36<00:01:58.020> hours<00:01:58.200> depends<00:01:58.799> on

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
you know 24 hours 36 hours depends on

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.190 
you know 24 hours 36 hours depends on
how<00:01:59.219> much<00:01:59.399> data<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.090> there

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
and how damaged the data is but it does

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.529 
and how damaged the data is but it does
a<00:02:04.409> pretty<00:02:04.649> good<00:02:04.829> job<00:02:05.039> you<00:02:05.610> know<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.789> mean<00:02:06.299> if<00:02:06.450> you

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
a pretty good job you know I mean if you

never used it a lot but you know you
could<00:02:21.720> see<00:02:21.930> files<00:02:22.470> coming<00:02:23.239> identified<00:02:25.250> and

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
could see files coming identified and

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.309 
could see files coming identified and
then<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:26.819> will<00:02:26.940> see<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.209> results<00:02:27.630> afterwards

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
then you will see the results afterwards

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.140 
then you will see the results afterwards
you<00:02:29.010> see<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.519> I<00:02:29.640> can<00:02:29.670> get<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.950> pretty<00:02:31.950> decent

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
you see that I can get a pretty decent

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.180 
you see that I can get a pretty decent
amount<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.269> data<00:02:33.450> out<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:34.200> even<00:02:35.069> after

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
amount of data out of it even after

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.420 
amount of data out of it even after
deletion<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:37.010> sometimes<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.160> have<00:02:38.310> this

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430

the neighborhood yeah these are just

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.930 
the neighborhood yeah these are just
some<00:04:06.540> modems<00:04:06.989> I<00:04:07.200> used<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.530> yeah<00:04:08.190> install<00:04:08.910> a

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
some modems I used to yeah install a

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.140 
some modems I used to yeah install a
computer<00:04:09.510> but<00:04:10.019> anyway<00:04:10.409> these<00:04:11.370> files<00:04:11.790> were

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.509 
recovered and you can see there is a
little<00:04:14.159> bit<00:04:14.280> of<00:04:14.400> data<00:04:14.549> there<00:04:14.849> you<00:04:15.060> know<00:04:15.180> to

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
little bit of data there you know to

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:21.610 
little bit of data there you know to
60<00:04:16.519> mb<00:04:17.510> 50<00:04:18.350> mb<00:04:18.920> or<00:04:18.950> 58<00:04:19.730> and<00:04:20.060> be<00:04:20.209> so<00:04:20.900> you<00:04:21.320> know<00:04:21.410> if

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
60 mb 50 mb or 58 and be so you know if

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.180 
60 mb 50 mb or 58 and be so you know if
we<00:04:21.799> add<00:04:22.160> them<00:04:22.400> all<00:04:22.520> up<00:04:22.840> let's<00:04:23.840> see<00:04:24.080> we<00:04:24.860> can<00:04:24.980> see

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
we add them all up let's see we can see

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.550 
we add them all up let's see we can see
here<00:04:25.520> selected<00:04:26.240> five<00:04:26.750> point<00:04:27.110> zero<00:04:27.170> five

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
here selected five point zero five

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:35.110 
here selected five point zero five
gigabytes<00:04:27.890> of<00:04:28.220> data<00:04:31.360> 156<00:04:32.380> files<00:04:33.460> okay<00:04:34.460> I<00:04:34.490> think

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
gigabytes of data 156 files okay I think

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.970 
gigabytes of data 156 files okay I think
there<00:04:35.240> are<00:04:35.330> like<00:04:35.480> hidden<00:04:35.930> file<00:04:36.200> somewhere<00:04:36.530> or

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
there are like hidden file somewhere or

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.910 
there are like hidden file somewhere or
something<00:04:37.340> yeah<00:04:38.120> here<00:04:39.550> here<00:04:40.550> we<00:04:40.820> go<00:04:40.970> you<00:04:41.630> see

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
something yeah here here we go you see

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.390 
something yeah here here we go you see
so<00:04:43.030> from<00:04:44.030> a<00:04:44.180> 1<00:04:44.420> gigabyte<00:04:45.080> card<00:04:45.410> I<00:04:45.770> can<00:04:46.040> get<00:04:46.190> up

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
so from a 1 gigabyte card I can get up

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.060 
so from a 1 gigabyte card I can get up
to<00:04:46.580> five<00:04:46.850> point<00:04:47.300> zero<00:04:47.510> five<00:04:47.990> gigabytes<00:04:48.710> of

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
to five point zero five gigabytes of

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.780
