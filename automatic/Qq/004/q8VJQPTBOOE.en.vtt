00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.070
 hello welcome to a new episode 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.770
 roger tv today is about the topic 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.480
 Coffee kernels are these high and are there 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.250
 any alternative to have to 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.019
 first of all, these cores will become the ones 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.430
 does not come into one here in our hand 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:38.690
 from far away mainly from india 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.580
 the harvested and cashew kernels are the ones 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.780
 single cores outside the ford 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.190
 wax that means you have this cat 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.540
 fruit and items is growing at this 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.510
 Kashub years and st art would come 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.800
 in turn is of a hard layer 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.469
 surrounded by a shell armor and in 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.350
 this armor will crack in the 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.390
 usually the sinus evaporated that is 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.980
 with heat then they have 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.970
 no raw food quality so the 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.619
 pocket card the one in the supermarket 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.570
 Can not buy the raw food 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.610
 quality because it puts heat 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.670
 but so it is possible to this tank 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.450
 crack and then this can there 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.060
 rauszuholen 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.869
 if we can eat then there is 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:28.240
 internet a few providers the raw food 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:30.560
 guarantee quality at your core and 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.420
 say that he uses special procedures 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.570
 these cores are cracked without that 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.950
 heat into the game I do not know 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.420
 whether I should believe that that can be 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.950
 but in any case even if the then 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.920
 raw food quality can be said 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.000
 that these kernels are very expensive 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.439
 You always have to think about that 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.320
 its worth it that you are now 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.740
 once a cat like his power 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.530
 and then a small cup 567 euro 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.450
 costs or more you have to stop 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.890
 think 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.200
 In any case, for me I have 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.579
 I decided on cards 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.960
 now want to do without several 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.299
 founding or main reason is actually 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.219
 is but you have to let me think 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.679
 of course that we have this fruit 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.850
 this big fruit and then throw it 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.350
 this fruit off and eat 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.880
 actually only this core which we 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.620
 actually not from the heart of the 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.060
 shell does not manage here 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.950
 more people did it only when we did 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.230
 steam or special 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.090
 proceed to get this core out there and 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.260
 this tiny little kernel and effect 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.950
 that one was thinking then already 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.280
 whole fruit basket of 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.720
 kasch fruits are thrown away like that 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.849
 Of course you could eat but as well 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.780
 We like to buy the cash register and first 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.170
 we have nothing of this fruit 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.110
 seen so this is unnatural first 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.980
 then the working conditions are very high 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.060
 bad the people that kerne cores 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.099
 grow and harvest 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.709
 The munders wear the wear 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.390
 gloves because in this armor in 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.519
 this shell from the car show core 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.810
 toxic oil is and if that is one 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.629
 with or on the skin 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.010
 then that can have bad consequences 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.360
 So you have to think twice 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.709
 that's what nature wanted us to do 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.790
 to clarify this fight then really there 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.980
 get out and eat 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.720
 So I do not think so, too 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.980
 I support these working conditions 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.269
 You have to go there first 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.280
 be sent or by plane 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.260
 there we have the co2 problem again 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.540
 and so on and I think cashew kernels 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.459
 decompose made in a conscious 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.480
 healthy raw delicious and 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.700
 sensible nutrition much sense 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.140
 So how do we create the only I 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.200
 me because I thought the following and indeed 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.690
 these are hamsters 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.930
 Asked to tame 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.359
 nutritionally to the 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.959
 our highest quality oil fruits 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.760
 planet 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.889
 So we always have to move that 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:50.700
 they have tamed them here 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:52.620
 have similar kassow kernels of course 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.690
 many vitamins minerals like 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.530
 example magnesium potassium calcium 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.690
 phosphorus many b-vitamins are vitamin e 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.930
 clearly also present in kashi core but 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.000
 in addition, have a hand 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.160
 very high quality fatty acids in one 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.500
 perfect comedian 13 mega six 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.230
 relationship star are thus several times 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.079
 and polyunsaturated plants do not 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.000
 in fatty acids 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:20.220
 Many people think that you are the omega 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.470
 3 gets from fish oil capsules or 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.780
 directly from itself but no we know that 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.630
 So also with consumption of hand tame 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.090
 enable so besides these essential 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.270
 We have high quality fats in here 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.419
 all eight essential amino acids 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.280
 that means wonderfully usable proteins 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.400
 for us humans and they are also in 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.470
 a perfect relationship 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.760
 to each other these essential 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.250
 So amino acids are really one 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.600
 high quality food and why have 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.190
 I now think that the in 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.030
 Perfect a replacement for this cat 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.430
 like to pose 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.740
 Peru was similar in consistency 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.850
 if you cream milk now or 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.590
 Raw food cake or what do I know 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.840
 then you can represent 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.090
 city fund core these questions 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.550
 tame and now comes the joke 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.850
 they are even cheaper even if you 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.770
 the traditional cashew kernels from the 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.750
 Supermarket buys you more for it 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.870
 pay as we cost this hemp seed 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.130
 namely here the kilogram 18 euro one 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.169
 must also officially stated that 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.360
 my experience does not have that much of it 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.460
 Take it when I say my hand 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.410
 make milk or on the basis of flag 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.910
 You also want to be wonderful 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.100
 example mousse au chocolat from it 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.539
 So you can do so much out of it 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.300
 I almost only use magic 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.260
 and the cash register cores are the customs 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.880
 now the last ones too 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:45.260
 I will not think any more 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:49.990
 buy but what else is there too 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:52.520
 many people who on nuclear energy 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:57.919
 tame grow in our environment 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:06:01.460
 example so only benefits if it 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:04.060
 That's why Stadtkasse Kern tames hand in hand 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.990
 to include the diet 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.950
 video has you a bit further 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.450
 brought is a bit longer 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.530
 has become a bit much talked though 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.300
 I hope all the important facts 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.560
 to have called 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.220
 the topic a little closer to 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.700
 i would be happy if im 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.200
 Video 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.639
 thumbs up if you're in too 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.550
 future again turns on the channel 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:28.840
 I wish you all the best 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.840
 say see you soon
