00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.650
 whale peak observatory arizona 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.839
 sensational discovery scientists 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.859
 discover an asteroid which will be called in 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.859
 honor of the ancient Egyptian snake destroyer 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:27.990
 apophis he will not just be given and stoked 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.449
 on Friday, April 13, 2029, an asteroid 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.149
 weighing 50 million tons will cross 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.630
 orbit of the moon and blame to earth with 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.000
 speed of 45 thousand kilometers per hour but 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.030
 the force of gravity of the earth will unfold it 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.340
 and we will avoid the danger however during 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.579
 next visit exactly seven years later 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.250
 the land will be at the crossroads you smoke yet 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.530
 can cause a land object the size of 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.930
 two football fields according to scientists 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.320
 an asteroid strike will cause an explosion 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.620
 capacity of about one and a half thousand megaton 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.010
 this is equivalent to an explosion 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.030
 up to 10 thousand atomic bombs dropped on 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.450
 Hiroshima or the fall of the fifty 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.369
 Tunguska meteorite off 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.399
 in the preliminary data of the affected area 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.259
 may become a strip running through 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:21.259
 russia pacific ocean central america and 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.259
 Atlantic 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.869
 If Apophis falls into the ocean is formed 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.189
 funnel from which in all directions will gush 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.830
 huge wave 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:34.680
 wash away coastal areas 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.440
 shock wave can bypass the entire planet 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.960
 then a cloud of dust rises into the atmosphere 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.630
 which will not allow to penetrate the earth 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.420
 sun rays 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.860
 nuclear winter will come this is on earth already 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.170
 was 65 million years ago an asteroid 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.510
 15 kilometers in diameter collapsed on 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.110
 earth at a rate of twenty times more 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:01.420
 than the bullet created Siamese conditions 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.090
 scientists have suggested that because of this 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.270
 more than half of animal species died 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.429
 then dwelt on the planet among them 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.530
 there were dinosaurs 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.319
 where are the same merged 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.010
 asteroid killer alone scientists point out 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.409
 180 km crater chikslub 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.230
 Yucatan Peninsula in Central America 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:26.720
 others on boat shiva in india 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.959
 similar disaster for still smaller 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.739
 scale occurred in north america 13 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.659
 thousand years ago 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.939
 if you look in the telescope at the moon or 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.670
 mars we will see a lot of craters 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:43.549
 from space bombing the earth is not 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.519
 exception is just unlike these 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.650
 Earth's crater planets are good 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:51.290
 disguised with vegetation 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.040
 scientists assure extraterrestrial bodies fell 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.590
 fall and will fall in the twentieth century 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.719
 meteorites fell a hundred times but in 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.489
 the atmosphere of the earth entered them five times 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:03.829
 more 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.590
 where have the others gone since their strength 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.169
 impact could be a kiloton 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.120
 it's hard not to notice scientists say that 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:14.989
 many simply burned in dense layers 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.919
 the atmosphere is not threatened by the ill-starred 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.919
 asteroid apophis 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:25.419
 we will always live on the site
