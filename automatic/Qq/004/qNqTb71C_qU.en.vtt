I<00:04:18.780> guess<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:20.680> American<00:04:21.130> people<00:04:21.520> by<00:04:21.550> that<00:04:21.910> time

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
I guess the American people by that time

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.180 
I guess the American people by that time
were<00:04:23.790> indulging<00:04:24.790> in<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.090> American<00:04:25.660> dream<00:04:26.190> no

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190

remember with the late great George

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.090 
remember with the late great George
Carlin<00:04:30.580> said<00:04:30.960> they<00:04:31.960> call<00:04:32.200> it<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.500> American

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
Carlin said they call it the American

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.310 
Carlin said they call it the American
dream<00:04:33.490> because<00:04:33.940> you<00:04:34.090> have<00:04:34.120> to<00:04:34.360> be<00:04:34.540> sleeping<00:04:35.200> in

order<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.680> believe<00:04:36.040> it<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:39.280> they<00:04:39.460> must<00:04:39.610> have

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
order to believe it and they must have

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.900 
order to believe it and they must have
been<00:04:39.940> in<00:04:40.090> a<00:04:40.180> coma<00:04:40.420> back<00:04:40.870> then<00:04:41.140> because<00:04:41.910> that's

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
been in a coma back then because that's

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.140 
been in a coma back then because that's

like the Vatican does with religion so
our<00:06:18.180> deal<00:06:18.750> should<00:06:19.020> be<00:06:19.229> to<00:06:19.620> make<00:06:19.830> things

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
our deal should be to make things

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.450 
our deal should be to make things
smaller<00:06:21.030> and<00:06:21.449> smaller<00:06:22.050> and<00:06:22.530> make<00:06:22.740> it<00:06:22.919> harder

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.230 

also<00:06:29.410> that<00:06:29.620> way<00:06:29.830> our<00:06:30.010> politicians<00:06:30.640> would<00:06:31.030> be

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
also that way our politicians would be

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.060 
also that way our politicians would be
at<00:06:31.360> arm's<00:06:31.840> length<00:06:34.410> they<00:06:35.410> have<00:06:35.650> something<00:06:35.950> to

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.070 
at arm's length they have something to

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:42.060 
at arm's length they have something to
be<00:06:36.250> afraid<00:06:36.340> up<00:06:36.820> for<00:06:37.090> a<00:06:37.150> change<00:06:40.020> anyways<00:06:41.070> that's

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
be afraid up for a change anyways that's

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.240 
be afraid up for a change anyways that's
why<00:06:42.280> that<00:06:42.790> that's<00:06:43.150> my<00:06:43.420> opinion<00:06:43.810> I<00:06:44.620> think<00:06:44.800> the

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
why that that's my opinion I think the

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.540 
why that that's my opinion I think the
vote<00:06:45.490> is<00:06:45.760> a<00:06:45.790> complete<00:06:46.360> waste<00:06:46.690> of<00:06:46.990> time<00:06:47.400> and<00:06:48.400> I

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
vote is a complete waste of time and I

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.120 
vote is a complete waste of time and I
wouldn't<00:06:48.850> even<00:06:48.970> bother<00:06:49.530> predicting<00:06:50.530> on<00:06:50.800> which

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
wouldn't even bother predicting on which

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.670 
wouldn't even bother predicting on which
