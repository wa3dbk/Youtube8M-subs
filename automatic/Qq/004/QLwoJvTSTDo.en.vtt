00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
because the squirrels eat them I guess

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.090

there's something in it they like and
they'll<00:05:49.610> eat<00:05:49.820> it<00:05:49.850> but<00:05:50.120> it's<00:05:50.270> supposed<00:05:50.510> to<00:05:50.660> keep

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870
