00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
okay now let's go ahead and line up the

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.369 
okay now let's go ahead and line up the
rest<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.400> front<00:00:05.730> after<00:00:06.720> we've<00:00:07.049> cut<00:00:07.259> off

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
rest of the front after we've cut off

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.190 
rest of the front after we've cut off
this<00:00:07.589> little<00:00:07.859> mirror<00:00:08.700> segments<00:00:09.269> where<00:00:10.110> the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
this little mirror segments where the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.039 
this little mirror segments where the
mirrors<00:00:10.500> now<00:00:10.650> it's<00:00:10.920> pretty<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.820> line<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:12.809> up

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
mirrors now it's pretty to line this up

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.060 
mirrors now it's pretty to line this up
so<00:00:13.559> let's<00:00:15.020> turn<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.199> around<00:00:16.410> this<00:00:17.100> portion

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
so let's turn this around this portion

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.929 
so let's turn this around this portion
got<00:00:20.070> some<00:00:20.340> tape<00:00:20.609> already<00:00:21.350> taken<00:00:22.350> off<00:00:22.500> there<00:00:22.939> so

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
got some tape already taken off there so

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.519 
got some tape already taken off there so
let's<00:00:24.300> use<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.230> as<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.830> starting<00:00:26.789> point<00:00:27.529> and

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
let's use this as a starting point and

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.950 
let's use this as a starting point and
grab<00:00:28.920> another<00:00:29.099> piece<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.580> tape<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.119> just

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
grab another piece of tape and just

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.190 
grab another piece of tape and just
gently<00:00:31.969> it's<00:00:32.969> kind<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.270> look<00:00:33.510> at<00:00:33.750> how<00:00:33.930> this

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
gently it's kind of look at how this

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:43.970 
gently it's kind of look at how this
comes<00:00:34.559> across<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.130> bottom<00:00:42.620> a<00:00:43.620> little<00:00:43.710> bit

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
comes across the bottom a little bit

00:00:43.980 --> 00:01:01.040 
comes across the bottom a little bit
more<00:00:44.660> something<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:59.660> and<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.719> might

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
more something like that and I might

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:11.210 
more something like that and I might
move<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.469> back<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.980> way<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.609> hair<00:01:10.220> now

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
move it back this way just a hair now

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.060 
move it back this way just a hair now
let<00:01:12.030> me<00:01:12.060> tape<00:01:12.390> off<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.840> end<00:01:13.110> what's<00:01:13.560> up<00:01:13.830> duck

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
let me tape off the end what's up duck

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.810 
let me tape off the end what's up duck
overlap<00:01:14.939> missing<00:01:19.400> let's<00:01:20.400> take<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> look<00:01:20.790> at

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
overlap missing let's take a look at

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.450 
overlap missing let's take a look at
front<00:01:21.450> make<00:01:22.080> sure<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.380> comes<00:01:22.530> past<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.159> middle

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
front make sure it comes past the middle

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:31.120 
front make sure it comes past the middle
point<00:01:23.700> which<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.150> does<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:30.000> go<00:01:30.750> ahead<00:01:30.780> and

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
point which it does and go ahead and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.539 
point which it does and go ahead and
take<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.159> now<00:01:33.799> kind<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.829> make<00:01:35.009> sure<00:01:35.040> that

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
take that now kind of make sure that

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.859 
take that now kind of make sure that
I've<00:01:35.700> got<00:01:35.729> good<00:01:36.479> angle<00:01:36.990> here<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:39.450> I'm<00:01:39.720> not

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
I've got good angle here so I'm not

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.670 
I've got good angle here so I'm not
having<00:01:40.259> wrinkles<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> come<00:01:41.189> across<00:01:45.680> I'm

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
having wrinkles as I come across I'm

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.950 
having wrinkles as I come across I'm
sure<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.130> all<00:01:47.340> covered<00:01:47.759> up<00:01:48.000> there<00:01:48.270> looks

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960

sure it's all covered up there looks
good<00:01:49.259> got<00:01:49.710> enough<00:01:49.950> area<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.579> go<00:01:50.759> ahead<00:01:50.850> and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
good got enough area we can go ahead and

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.120 
good got enough area we can go ahead and
start<00:01:51.119> taking<00:01:51.960> off<00:01:52.320> some<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.770> backing

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
start taking off some of the backing

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.080 
start taking off some of the backing
let's<00:01:56.130> get<00:01:56.430> our<00:01:57.049> exactly<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.909> take<00:01:59.909> this

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
let's get our exactly and I take this

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.810 
let's get our exactly and I take this
edge<00:02:00.390> up<00:02:03.619> peel<00:02:04.619> away<00:02:04.770> some<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.310> backing

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
edge up peel away some of the backing

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:20.990 
edge up peel away some of the backing
and<00:02:07.069> cut<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.220> all

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.940 

I'm<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.120> going<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.450> hold<00:02:22.720> this<00:02:22.990> over<00:02:23.470> here<00:02:23.740> by

I'm just going to hold this over here by

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.760 
I'm just going to hold this over here by
holding<00:02:24.460> back<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.940> taping<00:02:25.210> it<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.570> itself<00:02:25.930> and

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
going to pull up to the edge make sure

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.199 
going to pull up to the edge make sure
we've<00:03:13.870> got<00:03:13.900> enough<00:03:14.050> edge<00:03:14.500> material<00:03:15.160> now<00:03:15.880> again

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
we've got enough edge material now again

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.699 
we've got enough edge material now again
for<00:03:16.480> this<00:03:16.570> section<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.290> want<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.530> make<00:03:17.680> sure
