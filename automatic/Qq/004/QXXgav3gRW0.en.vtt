alternate<00:00:45.949> picking<00:00:46.159> alternate<00:00:47.000> picking<00:00:47.210> is

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
alternate picking alternate picking is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.320 
alternate picking alternate picking is
when<00:00:47.750> you<00:00:48.080> pick<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:49.220> string<00:00:49.489> with<00:00:49.670> a<00:00:49.699> downward

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
when you pick the string with a downward

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:57.219 
when you pick the string with a downward
and<00:00:50.830> upward<00:00:53.140> stroke<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:55.420> you're<00:00:56.420> always

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:57.229 
and upward stroke and you're always

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:59.860 
and upward stroke and you're always
alternating<00:00:57.920> for<00:00:58.400> example<00:00:58.879> you<00:00:59.089> start<00:00:59.150> on<00:00:59.750> the

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
alternating for example you start on the

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.500 
alternating for example you start on the
downward<00:01:00.350> stroke<00:01:00.799> then<00:01:01.580> the<00:01:01.909> next<00:01:02.180> time<00:01:02.390> you

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
downward stroke then the next time you

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.360 
downward stroke then the next time you
pick<00:01:02.690> will<00:01:02.900> be<00:01:03.049> on<00:01:03.229> a<00:01:03.350> upward<00:01:04.129> stroke<00:01:04.670> down<00:01:05.180> up

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
pick will be on a upward stroke down up

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.920 
pick will be on a upward stroke down up
down<00:01:08.619> notice<00:01:09.619> my<00:01:09.799> hand<00:01:10.210> this<00:01:11.210> part<00:01:11.510> of<00:01:11.600> my<00:01:11.720> hand

okay you notice I'm always double

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.140 
okay you notice I'm always double
picking<00:03:08.340> even<00:03:09.340> though<00:03:09.489> there's<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.790> gap

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
picking even though there's a gap

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.920 
picking even though there's a gap
between<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:11.050> first<00:03:11.379> and<00:03:11.650> third<00:03:12.930> sixteenth

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
between the first and third sixteenth

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:26.490 
between the first and third sixteenth
note<00:03:14.260> I<00:03:14.640> still<00:03:15.640> alternate<00:03:16.269> pick<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:26.019> practice

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
note I still alternate pick and practice

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:35.330 
note I still alternate pick and practice
that<00:03:26.739> with<00:03:26.980> a<00:03:27.010> metronome

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.430 

start<00:03:36.340> out<00:03:36.459> slow<00:03:36.810> gradually<00:03:37.810> increase<00:03:38.410> the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
start out slow gradually increase the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.780 
start out slow gradually increase the
tempo<00:03:42.390> again<00:03:43.390> I'm<00:03:44.079> just<00:03:44.349> emphasizing<00:03:44.790> the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
tempo again I'm just emphasizing the

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:55.509 
tempo again I'm just emphasizing the
movement<00:03:46.390> in<00:03:46.569> my<00:03:46.780> thumb<00:03:47.079> and<00:03:47.380> forefinger

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:12.120 

and<00:03:56.519> again<00:03:56.760> 45-degree<00:03:57.689> angle

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.160 

okay<00:04:13.130> now<00:04:13.250> here's<00:04:13.490> a<00:04:13.990> alternate<00:04:14.990> way<00:04:15.140> of

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
okay now here's a alternate way of

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.010 
okay now here's a alternate way of
picking<00:04:15.710> it<00:04:16.010> is<00:04:17.200> on<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.530> first<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:19.400> third

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
picking it is on the first and third

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.290 
picking it is on the first and third
sixteenth<00:04:21.020> note<00:04:21.350> you<00:04:22.100> do<00:04:22.250> a<00:04:22.280> downward<00:04:22.850> stroke

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
sixteenth note you do a downward stroke

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.120 
sixteenth note you do a downward stroke
and<00:04:25.210> played<00:04:26.210> slow<00:04:26.540> it's<00:04:26.750> gonna<00:04:26.930> it's<00:04:27.860> going<00:04:28.070> to

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
and played slow it's gonna it's going to

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.740 
and played slow it's gonna it's going to
sound<00:04:28.280> identical<00:04:28.820> but<00:04:29.150> you're<00:04:29.300> just<00:04:29.480> picking

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
sound identical but you're just picking

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:50.509 
sound identical but you're just picking
it<00:04:29.990> differently<00:04:30.380> and<00:04:31.210> you<00:04:32.210> pick<00:04:32.390> it<00:04:32.480> like<00:04:32.630> this

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:50.519 

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:53.089 

learn<00:04:51.089> how<00:04:51.269> to<00:04:51.329> do<00:04:51.539> it<00:04:51.659> that<00:04:51.689> way<00:04:51.989> this<00:04:52.860> way

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
learn how to do it that way this way

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.489 
learn how to do it that way this way
might<00:04:53.489> be<00:04:53.519> a<00:04:53.909> little<00:04:54.329> bit<00:04:54.569> easier<00:04:55.079> to<00:04:55.139> learn

00:04:55.489 --> 00:04:55.499 
might be a little bit easier to learn

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:59.449 
might be a little bit easier to learn
for<00:04:56.249> it<00:04:56.339> for<00:04:56.579> a<00:04:56.610> beginner<00:04:57.619> as<00:04:58.619> opposed<00:04:59.069> to<00:04:59.219> just

00:04:59.449 --> 00:04:59.459 
for it for a beginner as opposed to just

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:18.369 
for it for a beginner as opposed to just
alternate<00:05:00.119> picking<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.599> whole<00:05:00.779> way<00:05:00.959> round

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:18.379 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:22.249 

now<00:05:19.379> another<00:05:19.799> way<00:05:20.009> of<00:05:20.159> doing<00:05:20.399> this<00:05:20.579> is<00:05:20.789> to<00:05:21.659> on

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
now another way of doing this is to on

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.209 
now another way of doing this is to on
the<00:05:22.829> first<00:05:23.219> and<00:05:23.519> third<00:05:23.959> sixteenth<00:05:24.959> note<00:05:25.289> use

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:26.219 
the first and third sixteenth note use

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:29.989 
the first and third sixteenth note use
an<00:05:26.459> upward<00:05:26.999> stroke<00:05:27.799> and<00:05:28.799> this<00:05:29.369> is<00:05:29.489> tricky<00:05:29.699> to

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:29.999 
an upward stroke and this is tricky to

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:57.350 
an upward stroke and this is tricky to
do

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.419 

sounds<00:05:58.360> the<00:05:58.419> same<00:05:58.559> but<00:05:59.559> you're<00:05:59.830> picking<00:06:00.309> it

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:00.429 
sounds the same but you're picking it

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:01.049 
sounds the same but you're picking it
differently

00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:01.059 
differently

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:13.920 
differently
so<00:06:01.719> just<00:06:02.349> to<00:06:02.469> recap<00:06:02.619> this<00:06:03.389> alternate<00:06:12.659> and<00:06:13.659> a

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
so just to recap this alternate and a

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.619 
so just to recap this alternate and a
downward<00:06:14.369> stroke<00:06:15.369> on<00:06:15.580> the<00:06:15.759> first<00:06:16.089> and<00:06:16.389> third

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:16.629 
downward stroke on the first and third

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:29.969 
downward stroke on the first and third
sixteenth<00:06:17.349> note<00:06:27.569> and<00:06:28.569> the<00:06:29.559> other<00:06:29.740> way

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:29.979 
sixteenth note and the other way

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:42.419 
sixteenth note and the other way
difficult<00:06:30.909> ways<00:06:40.769> just<00:06:41.769> to<00:06:41.919> show<00:06:42.099> you<00:06:42.189> what<00:06:42.339> my

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:42.429 
difficult ways just to show you what my

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:44.749 
difficult ways just to show you what my
left<00:06:42.610> hand<00:06:42.789> is<00:06:42.939> joining<00:06:43.179> I'm<00:06:43.389> playing<00:06:43.869> on<00:06:44.110> the

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 
left hand is joining I'm playing on the

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:56.279 
left hand is joining I'm playing on the
