00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
just experience it firsthand

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.380 
just experience it firsthand
unfortunately<00:01:03.170> I<00:01:03.229> wasn't<00:01:03.409> able<00:01:03.589> to<00:01:03.739> go<00:01:04.239> as<00:01:05.239> an

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
unfortunately I wasn't able to go as an

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.940 
unfortunately I wasn't able to go as an
undergrad<00:01:05.780> because<00:01:06.200> it's<00:01:06.560> pretty<00:01:06.799> expensive

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
undergrad because it's pretty expensive

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.190 
undergrad because it's pretty expensive
especially<00:01:07.700> compared<00:01:08.090> to<00:01:08.149> what<00:01:08.780> you<00:01:08.899> can<00:01:09.020> get

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
especially compared to what you can get

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.980 
especially compared to what you can get
here<00:01:09.470> in<00:01:10.009> Europe<00:01:10.399> so<00:01:11.240> I<00:01:11.270> had<00:01:11.509> to<00:01:11.600> wait<00:01:11.750> for<00:01:11.899> my

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
here in Europe so I had to wait for my

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.410 
here in Europe so I had to wait for my
masters<00:01:12.440> and<00:01:12.710> then<00:01:13.100> I<00:01:13.369> chose<00:01:13.580> a<00:01:13.640> program<00:01:14.149> that

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
masters and then I chose a program that

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.480 
masters and then I chose a program that
was<00:01:14.600> basically<00:01:14.929> doable<00:01:15.289> in<00:01:15.560> one<00:01:15.740> year<00:01:15.979> as

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
was basically doable in one year as

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.660 
was basically doable in one year as
compared<00:01:16.940> to<00:01:17.000> two<00:01:17.360> years<00:01:17.630> which<00:01:18.500> is<00:01:18.709> more<00:01:19.549> of

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
compared to two years which is more of

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.010 
compared to two years which is more of
the<00:01:19.819> the<00:01:20.179> standard<00:01:21.100> duration<00:01:22.100> here<00:01:22.369> in<00:01:22.490> Europe

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
the the standard duration here in Europe

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.740 
the the standard duration here in Europe
and<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:24.170> I<00:01:24.200> was<00:01:24.350> able<00:01:24.440> to<00:01:24.590> afford<00:01:24.979> it<00:01:25.179> and<00:01:26.179> so<00:01:26.479> as

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
and so I was able to afford it and so as

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.270 
and so I was able to afford it and so as
soon<00:01:26.869> as<00:01:26.959> I<00:01:27.020> got<00:01:27.170> a<00:01:27.200> chance<00:01:27.530> I<00:01:27.740> went<00:01:27.920> there<00:01:28.069> and

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
soon as I got a chance I went there and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.789 
soon as I got a chance I went there and
I<00:01:28.729> chose<00:01:29.090> Stanford<00:01:29.299> because<00:01:29.720> when<00:01:30.679> the

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
I chose Stanford because when the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
it's not about you know really how smart

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
it for a week or so and just do exercise

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.190 
it for a week or so and just do exercise
there's<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.200> lot<00:02:15.349> of<00:02:15.470> them<00:02:16.030> in<00:02:17.030> terms<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.630> the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
there's a lot of them in terms of the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.570 
there's a lot of them in terms of the
application<00:02:18.800> whether<00:02:19.099> it's<00:02:19.310> for<00:02:19.489> the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
application whether it's for the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.930 
application whether it's for the
Fulbright<00:02:19.790> or<00:02:20.239> for<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.870> university<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.530> the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
Fulbright or for the university the the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.190 
Fulbright or for the university the the
the<00:02:22.940> advice<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:23.420> would<00:02:23.480> give<00:02:23.599> is<00:02:23.840> just<00:02:24.050> be

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
the advice that I would give is just be

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.610 
the advice that I would give is just be
yourself<00:02:24.340> show<00:02:25.340> passion<00:02:25.880> enthusiasm<00:02:26.209> I<00:02:26.959> think

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
yourself show passion enthusiasm I think

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.140 
yourself show passion enthusiasm I think
that's<00:02:27.770> probably<00:02:27.890> why<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.280> actually<00:02:28.640> got<00:02:29.030> the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
that's probably why I actually got the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.110 
that's probably why I actually got the
the<00:02:29.420> Fulbright<00:02:29.840> scholarship<00:02:30.410> is<00:02:30.650> is<00:02:31.220> probably

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
the Fulbright scholarship is is probably

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.729 
the Fulbright scholarship is is probably
wasn't<00:02:32.450> by<00:02:32.540> any<00:02:32.569> better<00:02:32.930> than<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.380> other

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
wasn't by any better than the other

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.420 
wasn't by any better than the other
candidates<00:02:34.250> but<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.489> was<00:02:34.910> able<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.150> show

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
candidates but I was able to show

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.650 
candidates but I was able to show
genuine<00:02:37.430> passion<00:02:37.819> for<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.060> United<00:02:38.420> States

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
genuine passion for the United States

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.800 
genuine passion for the United States
and<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:38.959> think<00:02:39.200> once<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.519> talked<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:41.030> two<00:02:41.510> other

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
and I think once I talked to two other

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.449 
and I think once I talked to two other
applicants<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.560> think<00:02:42.769> that<00:02:42.860> that<00:02:43.130> might<00:02:43.310> have

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
applicants I think that that might have

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.460 
applicants I think that that might have
been<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:44.090> thing<00:02:44.120> that<00:02:44.420> differentiated<00:02:44.930> me<00:02:45.200> so

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
been the thing that differentiated me so

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.080 
been the thing that differentiated me so
if<00:02:46.160> you<00:02:46.280> can<00:02:46.489> actually<00:02:46.640> do<00:02:46.910> that<00:02:47.030> in

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
if you can actually do that in

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.430 
if you can actually do that in
application<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:47.959> do<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.200> during

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
application and do that during

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.160 
application and do that during
interviews<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:49.130> think<00:02:50.120> you've<00:02:50.269> you're<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:50.959> long

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
interviews I think you've you're a long

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.380 
interviews I think you've you're a long
way
