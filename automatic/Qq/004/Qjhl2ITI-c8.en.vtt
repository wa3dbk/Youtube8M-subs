 Permits not fulfilled so begins the 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.930
 chain of lies that they tried 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.960
 cover politics and the media 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.760
 responsible for the increase in the rate 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.780
 throwing the stone and hiding the hand 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.270
 on August 15, 2012 the pri and the bread 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.660

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.160
 Public transport of the state of Jalisco 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.219
 Aristotle sandoval through his 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.290
 substitute francisco ayón miguel castro a 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.719
 through his substitute marco antonio

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.370
 Gonzalo current member of the cabinet of 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.600
 Aristotle sandoval but they did not leave 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.969
 with it 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.610
 Alberto Uribe then mayor of 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.850
 tlajomulco voted against the deputies 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.880
 in movement citizen slowed the rise 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.650
 by putting a legal appeal before the 2nd of 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.409
 April 2013 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.960
 a few days later I read 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.319
 sandoval already as governor and arturo 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.090
 Zamora current secretary of government 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:25.829
 they promised that the rate would not increase 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.229
 unless there were improvements in the 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.939
 quality of service there has to be a 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.429
 agreement between must comply and respect 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.560
 an agenda of commitments to improve 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:38.490
 the conditions it meets is 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.030
 daily public transport lied and 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.640
 they continued lying arturo zamora in what 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.740
 Obscurito agreed to the increase with the octopus 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.020
 trucker long before the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.539
 condition of rates would meet 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.739
 discuss the increase 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.079
 enrique alfaro alerted the citizens 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:58.289
 about the deception and asked the secretary 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.599
 arturo zamora general government not 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.369
 I lied to people and that to consult 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.909
 the increase before taking a 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.030
 decision 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.609
 arturo zamora as always denied the 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.489
 indications of enrique alfaro but one 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:13.260
 Once again the truth came to light and 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.470
 turning a deaf ear to the claim 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.260

 we were at the inn and we celebrated 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.290
 the holidays 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.000
 in the middle of the holiday period secretly 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.460
 and for nothing 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.980
 they approved an unfair and illegal increase 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.500
 no improvements in service without 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.780
 restructuring of routes and without a new 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.780
 transport model old - fashioned 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.570
 of pri increased the rate to door 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.250
 closed back to people and without 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.220
 improvements that they themselves had 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.530
 promised to the citizenship they climbed the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.350

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.160
 Government of Jalisco and the PRI went up 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.500

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.250
 face to the citizenship but in this 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.049
