cheats<00:03:37.530> at<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.709> moment<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.579> structures

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
cheats at the moment and it structures

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.899 
cheats at the moment and it structures
are<00:03:39.420> building<00:03:39.690> normally<00:03:40.139> and<00:03:40.290> stuff<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.909> slow

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
are building normally and stuff and slow

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.160 
are building normally and stuff and slow
um<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:45.180> what<00:03:45.450> I'm<00:03:45.510> going<00:03:45.629> to<00:03:45.690> do<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:45.959> I'm<00:03:46.049> going

sonam had one add 10,000 credits you can

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.280 
sonam had one add 10,000 credits you can
see<00:04:00.120> slightly<00:04:01.310> that<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:03.049> points<00:04:04.049> are<00:04:04.139> going

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
see slightly that the points are going

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.629 
see slightly that the points are going
up<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:05.750> number<00:04:06.750> three<00:04:07.079> no<00:04:07.590> energy<00:04:08.069> consumed

up and number three no energy consumed
that<00:04:09.599> is<00:04:09.750> very<00:04:09.989> helpful<00:04:10.049> one<00:04:10.849> you<00:04:11.849> can<00:04:12.000> see<00:04:12.150> the

that is very helpful one you can see the

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:18.529 
that is very helpful one you can see the

as you can see I just held it down and I

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:42.649 
as you can see I just held it down and I
now<00:04:33.360> have<00:04:34.010> 10<00:04:35.570> people<00:04:37.370> simple<00:04:38.370> as<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:41.659> you

you<00:04:54.210> can<00:04:54.360> see<00:04:54.510> it's<00:04:54.659> got<00:04:54.840> its<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.320> start<00:04:55.590> to

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
you can see it's got its to start to

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.149 
you can see it's got its to start to
flash<00:04:55.979> such<00:04:56.970> as<00:04:57.120> quickly

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:00.159 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:08.380 

like<00:05:01.159> that<00:05:01.750> click

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.730 

and<00:05:08.990> they<00:05:09.140> go<00:05:09.670> as<00:05:10.670> easy<00:05:10.940> as<00:05:11.150> that<00:05:11.590> and<00:05:12.590> I've

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
and they go as easy as that and I've

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.890 
and they go as easy as that and I've
still<00:05:13.070> got<00:05:13.280> unlimited<00:05:13.760> point<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:15.520> so<00:05:16.900> the

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
still got unlimited point and so the

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.260 
still got unlimited point and so the
next<00:05:18.140> thing<00:05:18.760> I'm<00:05:19.760> going<00:05:19.820> to<00:05:20.090> do<00:05:20.270> is<00:05:21.220> zero<00:05:22.270> ammo

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
next thing I'm going to do is zero ammo

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.150 
next thing I'm going to do is zero ammo
and<00:05:23.450> bombs<00:05:23.920> I'm<00:05:25.180> not<00:05:26.180> sure<00:05:26.620> how<00:05:27.620> I<00:05:27.650> could<00:05:27.950> show

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
and bombs I'm not sure how I could show

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.910 
and bombs I'm not sure how I could show
you<00:05:28.190> that<00:05:28.520> and<00:05:29.890> because<00:05:30.890> it's<00:05:31.130> more<00:05:31.490> for<00:05:31.730> like

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
you that and because it's more for like

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.410 
you that and because it's more for like
jets<00:05:33.920> and<00:05:34.280> stuff<00:05:34.520> but<00:05:34.700> you've<00:05:34.850> got<00:05:35.030> a<00:05:35.060> select

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
jets and stuff but you've got a select

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.670 
jets and stuff but you've got a select

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
each jet for it to work for and so I

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.200 
each jet for it to work for and so I
won't<00:05:39.920> show<00:05:40.100> you<00:05:40.130> that<00:05:40.310> one<00:05:40.520> because<00:05:40.940> it's

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
won't show you that one because it's

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.310 
won't show you that one because it's
