my<00:00:03.000> paintings<00:00:03.510> and<00:00:03.720> drawings<00:00:03.750> are<00:00:04.290> inspired

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
my paintings and drawings are inspired

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.299 
my paintings and drawings are inspired
by<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.069> patterns<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.879> see<00:00:06.150> in<00:00:06.270> nature<00:00:07.040> if<00:00:08.040> you

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
by the patterns I see in nature if you

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.990 
by the patterns I see in nature if you
look<00:00:08.490> closely<00:00:09.170> patterns<00:00:10.170> are<00:00:10.320> abstract<00:00:11.000> yet

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
look closely patterns are abstract yet

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.860

there<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.509> intelligence<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.440> their<00:00:13.590> design<00:00:14.009> I

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
there is intelligence to their design I

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.930 
there is intelligence to their design I
make<00:00:15.870> studies<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.710> notations<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.730> these
