going<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.379> make<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.980> polysemous<00:00:44.430> screen<00:00:44.730> so

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
going to make just polysemous screen so

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.750 
going to make just polysemous screen so
you<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:44.969> see<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.980> i'll<00:00:46.980> take<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> drill<00:00:47.520> tool

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
we're going to do a little preview make

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.350

sure that's what we want so now we have
a<00:02:00.390> typical<00:02:01.159> upper<00:02:02.159> end<00:02:02.340> done<00:02:02.759> now<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.180> cool

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
a typical upper end done now the cool

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.420 
a typical upper end done now the cool
thing<00:02:03.810> about<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.500> when<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.159> drawn

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
thing about this is when this is drawn

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.830 
thing about this is when this is drawn
if<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:06.450> only<00:02:06.600> need<00:02:07.879> one<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:08.910> these<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.629> also

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
if you only need one of these and also

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.420 
if you only need one of these and also
we<00:02:10.050> can<00:02:10.080> rotate<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.679> if<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.129> grain

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
we can rotate this if it is grain

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.280 
we can rotate this if it is grain
direction<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.300> we<00:02:12.390> want<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.599> rotate<00:02:12.720> this<00:02:13.080> to

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
direction and we want to rotate this to

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.730 
direction and we want to rotate this to
allow

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
allow

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.860 
allow
grain<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.700> run<00:02:14.850> down<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.120> chute<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:15.480> way<00:02:15.660> we

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
grain to run down the chute this way we

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.080 
grain to run down the chute this way we
can<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:16.170> simply<00:02:16.440> rotate<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.070> so<00:02:17.850> if<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:17.970> need

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
can just simply rotate that so if I need

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.490 
can just simply rotate that so if I need
to<00:02:18.180> run<00:02:18.390> one<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.720> these<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:20.060> can<00:02:21.060> click<00:02:21.240> on

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
to run one of these I can click on

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:30.380 
to run one of these I can click on
