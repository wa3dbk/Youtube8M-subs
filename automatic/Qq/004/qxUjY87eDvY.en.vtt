third string with my middle finger again
and<00:01:00.289> then<00:01:00.680> play<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:01.010> eighth<00:01:01.160> fret<00:01:01.430> with<00:01:01.640> my

first finger so I'm doing the same shape
in<00:01:03.770> a<00:01:04.160> different<00:01:04.430> place

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.410

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
then I'm gonna move up to the 14th fret

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.649 
then I'm gonna move up to the 14th fret
and<00:01:14.430> do<00:01:14.549> again<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.270> same<00:01:15.450> thing<00:01:17.390> so<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
simply to get out of the lick what I'm

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.010 
simply to get out of the lick what I'm
gonna<00:01:27.720> do<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> bend

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
gonna do is a bend

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.880 
gonna do is a bend
on<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.740> 15th<00:01:31.159> fret<00:01:35.110> now<00:01:36.110> like<00:01:36.320> so<00:01:36.530> many<00:01:36.649> of<00:01:36.829> the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
on the 15th fret now like so many of the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.050 
on the 15th fret now like so many of the
other<00:01:37.040> licks<00:01:37.250> we've<00:01:37.430> been<00:01:37.579> talking<00:01:37.939> about

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
other licks we've been talking about

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.359 
other licks we've been talking about
with<00:01:38.330> this<00:01:38.450> particular<00:01:38.960> lick<00:01:39.250> depending<00:01:40.250> on

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
with this particular lick depending on

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.940 
with this particular lick depending on
the<00:01:40.460> speed<00:01:40.850> that<00:01:41.060> I<00:01:41.119> take<00:01:41.450> it<00:01:41.630> at<00:01:41.780> is<00:01:41.990> going<00:01:42.920> to

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
the speed that I take it at is going to

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.200 
the speed that I take it at is going to
determine<00:01:43.430> whether<00:01:43.580> or<00:01:43.670> not<00:01:43.729> I<00:01:43.820> should<00:01:43.909> play

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
determine whether or not I should play

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.179 
determine whether or not I should play
this<00:01:44.360> whole<00:01:44.570> lick<00:01:44.810> as<00:01:44.990> down<00:01:45.649> picking<00:01:46.039> or

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
this whole lick as down picking or

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.130 
this whole lick as down picking or
alternate<00:01:46.640> picking<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.509> if<00:01:47.600> I<00:01:47.689> was<00:01:47.840> doing<00:01:47.930> it

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
alternate picking so if I was doing it

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.690 
alternate picking so if I was doing it
nice<00:01:48.289> and<00:01:48.320> slow<00:01:53.950> or<00:01:54.950> even<00:01:55.250> with<00:01:55.399> a<00:01:55.429> straight

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
nice and slow or even with a straight

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.110 
nice and slow or even with a straight
rhythm

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:12.520 

but<00:02:02.120> as<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.360> get<00:02:02.420> faster

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.930 

it<00:02:13.530> becomes<00:02:13.920> more<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.220> more<00:02:14.310> imperative<00:02:14.760> that

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
it becomes more and more imperative that

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.150 
it becomes more and more imperative that
I<00:02:15.090> use<00:02:15.330> alternate<00:02:15.930> picking<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.950> what<00:02:17.070> I'm

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
I use alternate picking so what I'm

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.800 
I use alternate picking so what I'm
doing<00:02:17.190> here<00:02:17.460> is<00:02:17.670> simply<00:02:17.790> playing<00:02:18.180> down<00:02:18.480> up

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
doing here is simply playing down up

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.650 
doing here is simply playing down up
down<00:02:19.170> up<00:02:19.500> down<00:02:19.560> up<00:02:20.220> down<00:02:20.310> up<00:02:20.880> down<00:02:20.940> over<00:02:21.540> and

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
down up down up down up down over and

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.130 
down up down up down up down over and
over<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:21.840> over<00:02:26.660> which<00:02:27.660> if<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.900> think<00:02:28.020> about

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
over and over which if you think about

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.720 
over and over which if you think about
it<00:02:28.380> means<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.740> first<00:02:28.980> time<00:02:29.190> I<00:02:29.220> do<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.550> pattern

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
it means the first time I do the pattern

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.450 
it means the first time I do the pattern
I'm<00:02:30.000> doing<00:02:30.270> down<00:02:30.480> up<00:02:30.780> down<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.890> second<00:02:32.280> time<00:02:32.310> I

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
I'm doing down up down the second time I

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.790 
I'm doing down up down the second time I
do<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.760> pattern<00:02:33.030> I'm<00:02:33.150> doing<00:02:33.420> up<00:02:33.570> down<00:02:33.870> up<00:02:34.200> the

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
do the pattern I'm doing up down up the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.800 
do the pattern I'm doing up down up the
third<00:02:35.010> time<00:02:35.220> I'm<00:02:35.370> doing<00:02:35.640> down<00:02:35.760> up<00:02:35.970> down<00:02:36.120> the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
third time I'm doing down up down the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.450 
third time I'm doing down up down the
fourth<00:02:37.080> time<00:02:37.260> I'm<00:02:37.380> doing<00:02:37.620> up<00:02:37.800> down<00:02:38.010> up

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
fourth time I'm doing up down up

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:46.760 
fourth time I'm doing up down up
so<00:02:39.180> watch<00:02:39.330> very<00:02:39.570> carefully<00:02:39.690> here<00:02:45.380> now<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.410> find

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
so watch very carefully here now I find

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.800 
so watch very carefully here now I find
that<00:02:46.830> easier<00:02:47.340> because<00:02:47.550> it's<00:02:48.030> consistent<00:02:48.660> for

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
that easier because it's consistent for

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.270 
that easier because it's consistent for
me<00:02:48.900> I'm<00:02:49.020> not<00:02:49.050> thinking<00:02:49.560> about<00:02:49.800> whether<00:02:50.010> or<00:02:50.190> not

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
me I'm not thinking about whether or not

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.430 
me I'm not thinking about whether or not
I'm<00:02:50.520> starting<00:02:51.270> or<00:02:51.360> stopping<00:02:51.390> on<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.960> downer<00:02:52.260> and

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
I'm starting or stopping on a downer and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.880 
I'm starting or stopping on a downer and
up

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
up

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.710 
up
I'm<00:02:52.950> simply<00:02:53.580> playing<00:02:53.790> down<00:02:54.030> ups<00:02:54.210> the<00:02:54.390> entire

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
I'm simply playing down ups the entire

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.080 
I'm simply playing down ups the entire
time<00:02:55.050> okay<00:02:55.860> if<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.250> try<00:02:56.460> and<00:02:56.520> do<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:57.000> it

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
time okay if you try and do this and it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.210 
time okay if you try and do this and it
feels<00:02:57.300> awkward<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:58.080> by<00:02:58.650> all<00:02:58.800> means<00:02:59.040> you

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
feels awkward to you by all means you

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.070 
feels awkward to you by all means you
could<00:02:59.370> play<00:02:59.550> down<00:02:59.820> up<00:03:00.120> down<00:03:00.390> down<00:03:00.750> up<00:03:01.020> down

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
could play down up down down up down

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.740

down<00:03:01.410> up<00:03:01.680> down<00:03:02.010> down<00:03:02.430> up<00:03:02.580> down<00:03:02.820> if<00:03:03.270> that<00:03:03.300> seemed

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
down up down down up down if that seemed

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.020 
down up down down up down if that seemed
easier<00:03:04.050> for<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:07.700> start<00:03:08.700> with<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.880> down

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
easier for you to start with the down

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.470 
easier for you to start with the down
each<00:03:09.240> time

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.240 

and<00:03:14.480> please<00:03:15.080> always<00:03:15.290> remember<00:03:15.710> that<00:03:15.740> as<00:03:15.980> we<00:03:16.010> go

and please always remember that as we go

and please always remember that as we go
through<00:03:16.280> all<00:03:16.580> these<00:03:16.820> licks<00:03:17.180> it's<00:03:17.390> important

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
through all these licks it's important

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.540 
through all these licks it's important
for<00:03:17.900> you<00:03:17.990> to<00:03:18.140> understand<00:03:18.620> that<00:03:19.160> you<00:03:19.310> need<00:03:19.490> to

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
for you to understand that you need to

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.070 
for you to understand that you need to
adjust<00:03:19.850> them<00:03:20.240> to<00:03:20.300> what<00:03:20.600> feels<00:03:20.810> most

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
adjust them to what feels most

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.590

comfortable to you I will always suggest

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.120 
comfortable to you I will always suggest
ideas<00:03:23.810> of<00:03:24.320> things<00:03:24.470> that<00:03:24.590> I<00:03:24.710> would<00:03:24.860> like<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.070> to

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
ideas of things that I would like you to

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.460 
ideas of things that I would like you to
try<00:03:25.340> but<00:03:26.270> if<00:03:26.360> you<00:03:26.480> try<00:03:26.750> then<00:03:26.990> it<00:03:27.110> just<00:03:27.320> isn't

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
try but if you try then it just isn't

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.530 
try but if you try then it just isn't
making<00:03:27.710> sense<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.250> by<00:03:28.460> all<00:03:28.670> means<00:03:28.910> get<00:03:29.510> a

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
making sense to you by all means get a

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.090 
making sense to you by all means get a
hold<00:03:29.750> of<00:03:29.840> me<00:03:29.960> and<00:03:30.080> ask<00:03:30.200> me<00:03:30.290> questions<00:03:30.740> about<00:03:30.980> it

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
hold of me and ask me questions about it

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.010 
hold of me and ask me questions about it
or<00:03:31.190> simply<00:03:31.580> try<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.030> revamp<00:03:32.450> it<00:03:32.600> a<00:03:32.690> little<00:03:32.840> bit

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
or simply try and revamp it a little bit

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.710 
or simply try and revamp it a little bit
so<00:03:33.530> it<00:03:33.650> makes<00:03:33.860> sense<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.280> you<00:03:34.600> needless<00:03:35.600> to<00:03:35.690> say

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
so it makes sense to you needless to say

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.410 
so it makes sense to you needless to say
when<00:03:35.990> you<00:03:36.080> start<00:03:36.350> any<00:03:36.560> lick<00:03:36.830> as<00:03:37.820> we're<00:03:38.240> playing

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
when you start any lick as we're playing

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.200 
when you start any lick as we're playing
it<00:03:38.630> very<00:03:38.810> slow<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.410> most<00:03:39.650> you<00:03:40.400> know<00:03:40.430> beginner

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
it very slow the most you know beginner

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.000 
it very slow the most you know beginner
idea<00:03:41.690> to<00:03:41.900> think<00:03:42.110> about<00:03:42.350> is<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.860> pick

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
idea to think about is to pick

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.530 
idea to think about is to pick
everything<00:03:43.250> in<00:03:43.460> a<00:03:43.520> downward<00:03:43.970> sense<00:03:44.270> like<00:03:44.420> when

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
everything in a downward sense like when

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.110 
everything in a downward sense like when
you<00:03:44.600> play<00:03:44.750> your<00:03:44.870> scales<00:03:45.140> in<00:03:45.350> Spain<00:03:46.060> when<00:03:47.060> you

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
you play your scales in Spain when you

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.190 
you play your scales in Spain when you
first<00:03:47.330> start<00:03:47.510> learning<00:03:47.720> how<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.840> play<00:03:48.020> those

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
first start learning how to play those

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.350 
first start learning how to play those
but<00:03:48.410> as<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:48.740> get<00:03:48.920> better<00:03:49.160> at<00:03:49.370> those<00:03:49.580> and<00:03:49.880> the

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
but as you get better at those and the

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.020 
but as you get better at those and the
tempos<00:03:50.750> increase<00:03:51.200> obviously<00:03:52.130> at<00:03:52.580> some<00:03:52.790> point

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
tempos increase obviously at some point

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.150 
tempos increase obviously at some point
there's<00:03:53.180> gonna<00:03:53.300> there's<00:03:53.570> gonna<00:03:54.130> become<00:03:55.130> a

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
there's gonna there's gonna become a

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.500 
there's gonna there's gonna become a
wall<00:03:55.460> where<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:55.700> can't<00:03:56.000> really<00:03:56.150> get<00:03:56.270> past

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
wall where you can't really get past

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.150 
wall where you can't really get past
that<00:03:56.750> unless<00:03:57.410> you<00:03:57.590> start<00:03:57.800> learning<00:03:57.920> how<00:03:58.100> to

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
that unless you start learning how to

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.620 
that unless you start learning how to
alternate<00:03:58.610> pick<00:03:58.820> and<00:03:59.030> that's<00:03:59.150> why<00:03:59.300> I'm<00:03:59.420> always

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
alternate pick and that's why I'm always

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.630 
alternate pick and that's why I'm always
going<00:03:59.900> to<00:04:00.050> suggest<00:04:00.290> that<00:04:00.800> you<00:04:01.250> give<00:04:01.490> those

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
going to suggest that you give those

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.000 
going to suggest that you give those
ideas<00:04:01.970> a<00:04:02.060> try<00:04:02.390> as<00:04:03.260> you<00:04:03.320> continue<00:04:03.980> through

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
ideas a try as you continue through

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.060 
ideas a try as you continue through
these<00:04:04.460> licks<00:04:05.150> so<00:04:05.810> anyway<00:04:06.110> really<00:04:06.590> cool<00:04:06.860> this

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
these licks so anyway really cool this

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:14.550 
these licks so anyway really cool this
so<00:04:07.520> I've<00:04:07.670> showed<00:04:07.880> you<00:04:07.970> how<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.120> lick<00:04:08.330> goes

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.450 

okay<00:04:15.560> pretty<00:04:15.770> neat<00:04:15.980> there's<00:04:16.220> lots<00:04:16.370> of

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:16.460 
okay pretty neat there's lots of

different things we can do with that but
here's<00:04:18.170> the<00:04:18.290> other<00:04:18.320> thing<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:19.520> take<00:04:19.670> this<00:04:19.910> link

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
here's the other thing to take this link

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.840 
to the next level is I want you to think
about<00:04:22.220> how<00:04:22.670> every<00:04:23.210> time<00:04:23.450> you<00:04:23.630> shift<00:04:23.960> up<00:04:24.850> you're

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
about how every time you shift up you're

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.850 
about how every time you shift up you're
in<00:04:25.940> a<00:04:26.000> new<00:04:26.150> position<00:04:26.530> now<00:04:27.530> you're<00:04:27.740> either

in a new position now you're either

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.350 
in a new position now you're either
looking<00:04:28.100> at<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.490> fretboard<00:04:28.700> again<00:04:29.090> as<00:04:29.210> we've

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
looking at the fretboard again as we've

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.550 
looking at the fretboard again as we've
talked<00:04:29.540> about<00:04:29.600> many<00:04:29.930> times<00:04:30.230> you're<00:04:30.470> either

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
talked about many times you're either

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.730 
talked about many times you're either
looking<00:04:30.920> at<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.160> fretboard<00:04:31.400> as<00:04:32.740> minor

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
looking at the fretboard as minor

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.250 
looking at the fretboard as minor
pentatonic<00:04:34.100> as<00:04:34.460> major<00:04:35.240> pentatonic<00:04:35.570> or<00:04:35.990> most

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
pentatonic as major pentatonic or most

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.530 
pentatonic as major pentatonic or most
importantly<00:04:36.800> as<00:04:36.980> a<00:04:37.040> combination<00:04:37.940> of<00:04:38.360> both

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
importantly as a combination of both

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.560 
importantly as a combination of both
major<00:04:38.870> and<00:04:39.050> minor<00:04:39.260> pentatonic<00:04:40.420> which<00:04:41.420> is

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
major and minor pentatonic which is

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.240 
major and minor pentatonic which is
really<00:04:41.810> where<00:04:41.990> the<00:04:42.170> bread<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:42.950> butter<00:04:43.160> of

where all of this stuff is discussed do
that<00:05:04.400> lick<00:05:04.670> I<00:05:04.790> could<00:05:04.940> set<00:05:05.180> myself<00:05:05.330> up<00:05:05.660> to<00:05:05.840> do

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
that lick I could set myself up to do

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.740 
that lick I could set myself up to do
another<00:05:06.380> lick<00:05:06.740> or<00:05:06.950> an<00:05:07.040> idea<00:05:07.340> inside

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.990 

from<00:05:12.750> here<00:05:15.740> well<00:05:16.740> now<00:05:16.950> I'm<00:05:17.400> in<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.610> second

from here well now I'm in the second

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.200 
from here well now I'm in the second
position<00:05:18.090> of<00:05:18.450> minor<00:05:18.630> pentatonic<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:23.030> I<00:05:24.030> could

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
position of minor pentatonic and I could

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.820 
position of minor pentatonic and I could
do<00:05:24.300> something<00:05:24.690> there<00:05:24.870> so<00:05:25.350> the<00:05:25.590> great<00:05:25.800> thing

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
do something there so the great thing

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.530 
do something there so the great thing
about<00:05:26.040> this<00:05:26.460> lick<00:05:26.730> is<00:05:26.910> that<00:05:27.060> it<00:05:27.150> you<00:05:27.270> could<00:05:27.420> use

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
about this lick is that it you could use

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.720 
about this lick is that it you could use
it<00:05:27.690> as<00:05:27.810> just<00:05:28.140> a<00:05:28.230> lick<00:05:28.440> or<00:05:28.860> you<00:05:29.130> could<00:05:29.280> use<00:05:29.430> it<00:05:29.610> as

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
it as just a lick or you could use it as

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:38.330 
it as just a lick or you could use it as
position<00:05:30.210> shifting<00:05:30.630> so<00:05:31.140> I'm<00:05:31.230> going<00:05:37.130> like<00:05:38.130> for

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
position shifting so I'm going like for

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.120 
position shifting so I'm going like for
me<00:05:38.430> I<00:05:38.460> would<00:05:38.700> play<00:05:38.850> major<00:05:39.060> pentatonic<00:05:42.950> if<00:05:43.950> that

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
me I would play major pentatonic if that

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.260 
me I would play major pentatonic if that
sounds<00:05:44.400> familiar<00:05:44.550> it's<00:05:44.880> because<00:05:44.910> it's

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
sounds familiar it's because it's

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.490 
sounds familiar it's because it's
another<00:05:45.480> lick<00:05:45.690> that<00:05:45.840> I've<00:05:45.930> already<00:05:46.170> shown<00:05:46.380> you

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
another lick that I've already shown you

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.460 
another lick that I've already shown you
so<00:05:46.830> I<00:05:47.700> can<00:05:48.510> use<00:05:48.750> that<00:05:48.780> and<00:05:49.170> that's<00:05:49.290> what's

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
so I can use that and that's what's

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.780 
so I can use that and that's what's
great<00:05:49.620> about<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:49.950> fretboard<00:05:50.220> is<00:05:50.490> the<00:05:50.580> more<00:05:50.760> I

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
great about the fretboard is the more I

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.180 
great about the fretboard is the more I
can<00:05:51.030> break<00:05:51.300> down<00:05:51.570> not<00:05:52.200> only<00:05:52.260> how<00:05:52.740> to<00:05:52.770> play<00:05:53.160> a

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
can break down not only how to play a

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.310 
can break down not only how to play a
lick<00:05:53.430> how<00:05:54.360> that<00:05:54.540> lick<00:05:54.690> is<00:05:54.810> going<00:05:54.930> to<00:05:54.990> make<00:05:55.140> me<00:05:55.290> a

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
lick how that lick is going to make me a

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.020 
lick how that lick is going to make me a
better<00:05:55.470> player<00:05:55.710> in<00:05:56.010> terms<00:05:56.220> of<00:05:56.370> my<00:05:56.550> technical

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
better player in terms of my technical

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.410 
better player in terms of my technical
ability<00:05:57.450> my<00:05:57.990> visual<00:05:58.440> ability<00:05:59.090> you<00:06:00.090> know<00:06:00.210> my

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.420 
ability my visual ability you know my

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.870 
ability my visual ability you know my
flow<00:06:00.840> you<00:06:01.530> know<00:06:01.650> phrasing<00:06:02.430> all<00:06:02.550> those<00:06:02.700> sorts

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
flow you know phrasing all those sorts

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.990 
flow you know phrasing all those sorts
of<00:06:02.910> things<00:06:03.120> but<00:06:03.660> from<00:06:04.050> a<00:06:04.290> visual<00:06:05.000> guitar

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
of things but from a visual guitar

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.070 
of things but from a visual guitar
standpoint<00:06:06.600> how<00:06:07.140> can<00:06:07.380> I<00:06:07.470> use<00:06:07.770> the<00:06:07.950> licks<00:06:08.190> to

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
standpoint how can I use the licks to

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.630 
standpoint how can I use the licks to
slide<00:06:10.080> into<00:06:10.380> other<00:06:10.620> licks<00:06:10.890> or<00:06:11.100> slide<00:06:11.400> into

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
slide into other licks or slide into

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.280 
slide into other licks or slide into
other<00:06:11.820> movements<00:06:12.330> because<00:06:12.570> again<00:06:12.840> that's

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
other movements because again that's

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.810 
other movements because again that's
really<00:06:13.410> what<00:06:13.650> a<00:06:13.680> solo<00:06:13.920> is<00:06:14.130> it's<00:06:14.400> a<00:06:14.460> combination

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
really what a solo is it's a combination

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.210 
really what a solo is it's a combination

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.460 

you<00:06:56.820> see<00:06:57.000> so<00:06:57.420> I'm<00:06:57.510> moving<00:06:57.600> from<00:06:57.900> one<00:06:58.140> idea<00:06:58.290> to

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.470 
you see so I'm moving from one idea to

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:58.940 
you see so I'm moving from one idea to
the<00:06:58.590> next

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
the next

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.100 
the next
and<00:06:59.040> at<00:06:59.490> any<00:06:59.700> one<00:07:00.000> of<00:07:00.030> those<00:07:00.210> four<00:07:00.480> stops<00:07:00.810> along

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
and at any one of those four stops along

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.420 
and at any one of those four stops along
the<00:07:01.170> way<00:07:01.290> I<00:07:01.380> could<00:07:01.680> have<00:07:01.770> done<00:07:01.890> something<00:07:02.190> else

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430 
the way I could have done something else

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.510 
the way I could have done something else
so<00:07:03.390> again<00:07:03.960> it's<00:07:04.200> kind<00:07:04.320> of<00:07:04.620> a<00:07:04.710> deep<00:07:04.890> concept<00:07:05.430> but

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
so again it's kind of a deep concept but

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.220 
so again it's kind of a deep concept but
it<00:07:05.640> really<00:07:05.820> is<00:07:06.030> the<00:07:06.300> essence<00:07:06.690> of<00:07:06.810> learning<00:07:07.110> how

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.230

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.860 
it really is the essence of learning how
to<00:07:07.290> truly<00:07:07.620> free<00:07:08.610> yourself<00:07:09.000> and<00:07:09.150> be<00:07:09.270> able<00:07:09.360> to<00:07:09.480> to

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:09.870 
to truly free yourself and be able to to

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.890
