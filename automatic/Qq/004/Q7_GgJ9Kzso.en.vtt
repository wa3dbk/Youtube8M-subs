00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.070
 and when 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.080
 beautiful 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.619
 twelve years since there are several 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.619
 what are they? 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.130
 therefore it is worth 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.320
 the balance is certainly the case 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.940
 us or for how much 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.500
 it's about my experience and 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.500
 I also believe the experience generates 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.970
 greater awareness on the part 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.320
 publisher 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.050
 of those that are 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.950
 your own rights 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.950
 but above all 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.590
 but that anyway 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.590
 and it's always doing 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.410
 work for more 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.930
 the increase is increasing 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.000
 of the education that exists 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.900
 also because accidents as unfortunately 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.910
 we know they are there 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.470
 and therefore it is essential to understand that the 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.450
 freedom 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.530
 joins the militia employees 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.640
 ok 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.310
 my fun of it 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.060
 the fun 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.060
 no 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.790
 bathers to sleep 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.550
 I would like to 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.670
 to the bather and then you must see 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.670
 2 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.899
 capacity 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.820
 of alma in the sea 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.820
 the sea is never a challenge 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.160
 the beauty that is important 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.950
 serenely 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.189
 this period 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.189
 he lived 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.340
 of life 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.840
 the sea 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.770
 and friend but who asked us to curse the net 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.770
 the day of the 15th 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.710
 in all of eastern Sicily but I say 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.510
 to all and all 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.799
 dangerous 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.799
 where it is, let's enjoy ourselves 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.890
 this landscape mirror 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.040
 she in short 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.719
 Hey 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.719
 we avoid giving it to account 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.540
 but most of all 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.860
 is around 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.860
 kindness once 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.270
 what do you expect I bless? 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.350
 today 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.930
 therefore 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.910
 365 days a year as deployment of 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.670
 forces in particularly today than 15 with 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.650
 over 50 months of which currently there is 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.650
 more than half the sea 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.569
 in 27 none 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.200
 the prevention 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.410
 also to give 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.410
 sadness 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.030
 in the lost but she who is me 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.230
 Sometimes now we're the catenese 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.230
 engaging 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.110
 the fats of no 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.590
 it is good 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.760
 of the off-key type 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.760
 there 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.750
 bad of the sea to keep 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.750
 how many men are employed in the mind 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.160
 of the management about 30 naval units 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.840
 while with me 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.840
 and me like people love each other 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.550
 because we have ground teams for 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.950
 do the checks 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.380
 we are committed but not compact today 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.590
 in the day of August of me 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.920
 john this week of course 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.920
 guide 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.790
 the aircraft that she just picked up on 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.970
 particularly those aimed at 139 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.070
 the other 180 and the pr 42 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.010
 our patrolman is right in 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.370
 these moments is engaged for a long time 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.580
 coast of tourists 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.300
 but not adding together with the others 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.729
 aircraft 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.470
 here are some events they are 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.940
 the model 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:38.750
 there have been bars of this course 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.720
 when they have been engaged 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.430
 but certainly different activities 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.600
 sport days our helicopter is 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.650
 state 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.650
 research bari 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.639
 genoa 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.800
 for corpse 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.870
 the sea 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.090
 in the last hours the activities from the point 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.200
 of view 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.289
 mental one our period 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.270
 pollution the arch of Traiano 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.340
 and in these in these hours there 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.020
 I'm 20 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.660
 to have ongoing investigations for 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.260
 identify those responsible 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.210
 obviously today in the ambit of 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.390
 the aircraft's naval guard device 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.110
 we have been coastal senate 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.880
 general command 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.110
 the harbor authorities count 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.460
 a series of hunger activities 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.810
 of this increase in traffic 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.310
 the invited sea of death on the beaches 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.320
 this is also how you got 20 vector 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.900
 maritime with the sole objective of 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.759
 to guarantee 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.009
 a quiet mid-August to all 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:41.169
 users 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:43.569
 in the event of an emergency what is the practice 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.270
 what to do immediately but to 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:48.210
 beyond the advice of course that referred 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.460
 the maritime director speaks first 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:54.550
 to activate the rescue device 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.770
 at sea it is active 24 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.620
 360 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.370
 in Milan 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.710
 no absolutely free 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.320
 the trend can be reached both from the fixed network 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:08.510
 than by mobile network while on ours 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:11.740
 institutional site that address 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.740
 precisely on the coast guard 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.580
 and published an interesting handbook 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.300
 for bathers of information 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.300
 to boaters 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:33.420
 Yes No 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.420
 friends saw me ok
