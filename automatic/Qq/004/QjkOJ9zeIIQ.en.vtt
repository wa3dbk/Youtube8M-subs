are<00:03:22.940> my<00:03:23.150> go-to<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:24.110> think<00:03:24.380> everyone<00:03:24.829> should<00:03:24.860> try

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
are my go-to I think everyone should try

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.039 
are my go-to I think everyone should try
these<00:03:25.310> premises<00:03:25.850> out<00:03:26.360> from<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:26.720> dollar<00:03:26.930> tree

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.310 
and then I thought these recruiting
unique<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:29.600> these<00:03:29.690> are<00:03:29.840> actually<00:03:30.110> for<00:03:30.290> a

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.190 
unique and these are actually for a
