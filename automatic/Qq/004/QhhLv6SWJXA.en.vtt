00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.550
 Good Morning 

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.760
 ohno chemes depending on the time you are watching this video I am the axis 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.159
 bs 1985 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:12.780
 Today I am really enraged with a game that has been released on several consoles 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.240
 the so popular and at the same time annoying game guitar twist u 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.050
 this game is an offense to people who have killed themselves studying 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.839
 cramped coughing hands 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:25.789
 and pulling out cocks on the fingers to be able to learn at least as much 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.560
 simple how to play a guitar 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.929
 acoustic or electric does not matter which of the two 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.380
 Anyone who is a fan of this horrible game will say 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.130
 you are an ass only gives you envy because you do not know how to play it and you are a trauma 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.080
 Guitar 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.090
 I say suck, I know 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.740
 for your information if you play it I do not speak just for talking 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.920
 it is a stupid 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.560
 to start a guitar has six strings 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.560
 not a ridiculous lever that you move from top to bottom 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.370
 the standard electric guitar has 22 frets on each string that wants 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.890
 say that for the six strings has 132 frets 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.750
 no 5 button situation to the 132 bulls of this one 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.550
 and for the fans of this little game who do not know what a fret is 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.660
 divisions that the tuning fork has 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.060
 maybe they say 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.090
 I'm not so crazy to learn all that about frets and notes 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.119
 much less buy me a guitar that is worth at least two thousand pesos 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.820
 well I tell them I'm not so crazy to buy the guitar turn 1 2 three and 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:26.860
 I do not know how many more 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.640
 if we think about each game it costs at least 400 pesos in 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.660
 I do not know how much they cost but maybe you spend more than what it costs 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.520
 guitar 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.110
 but do not pay attention to my words, just check, tell me not to increase 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.140
 think these poor people who are great for discrete car a song 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.460
 with five little buttons and then check what it is to play the same song in a 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.460
 real guitar 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:12.539
 tohá 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:33.879
 the sand 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.879
 Hague 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:45.029
 but 

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:48.619
 for 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.359
 maybe they say some 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.600
 do not stain do not compare a real guitar with a toy one because that's the same 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:23.779
 I tell you 

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:25.210
 do not be delayed 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.030
 the reason why I made this video is because that time I saw a tournament of this 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.849
 game and the winner of a round 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:34.860
 when he finished the game he seemed possessed and was screaming that he was the 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.139
 better than anyone could win 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.949
 a friend of mine told him why he did not try that on a real guitar 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.050
 and the idiot of the game answered 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.360
 the people who play the guitars are unsuccessful who want to be in bands and 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.900
 they also did not achieve it, the guitar geroulanos guitars really are what 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.669
 same 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.469
 seriously is an idiot just tell me who is more traumas or one who touches 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:59.159
 the guitar because he liked some that makes a ridiculous scenic because 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:03.839
 won a child not older than 12 years in a game tell me who is the unsuccessful 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:08.349
 maybe they say that I take it to heart that only a game is right is 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:09.389
 just a game 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.180
 but there are people who take it very seriously and for that reason it bothers me so much 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.060
 another thing that happened to me was when I was in a video game store and they had 

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:22.559
 on display guitar jiraú 3 I wanted to try it out of curiosity and beside it 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:25.629
 put a child about nine or ten years old 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:29.559
 obviously I did not know the child chose the song and the difficulty 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:33.520
 obviously I did not know what and the child quickly told me 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.879
 so big and do not beat them to this 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:38.300
 that bothered me a lot 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.449
 oo are they children are more contesones today without even 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.080
 To know who you are 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.520
 another thing is the guitars that they use to play 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.590
 Devils go they are expensive 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.960
 and I can not believe they get excited with those plastic things just buy in 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.419
 those little things with real ones 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.169
 I do not retire saying that they should burn those games and try to 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.740
 a real one and if some people tell me they play that and they know the real ones 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.870
 well I talk about those who do not know
