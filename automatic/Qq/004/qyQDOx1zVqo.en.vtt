pretty<00:02:08.789> well<00:02:09.030> which<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.450> nice<00:02:09.630> they<00:02:10.590> have<00:02:10.710> a

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
pretty well which is nice they have a

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.870 
pretty well which is nice they have a
new<00:02:10.979> model<00:02:11.220> now<00:02:11.370> with<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.700> completely<00:02:12.150> one

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
new model now with a completely one

flip which will flip completely out of
the<00:02:15.640> way<00:02:15.820> which<00:02:16.240> is<00:02:16.420> kind<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:16.960> a<00:02:17.050> nice<00:02:17.200> touch<00:02:17.230> I

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
the way which is kind of a nice touch I

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.100 
the way which is kind of a nice touch I
think<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.970> bottom<00:02:19.240> of<00:02:19.360> course<00:02:19.510> easily

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
think so the bottom of course easily

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.260 
think so the bottom of course easily
clear<00:02:20.650> for<00:02:20.980> just<00:02:21.220> about<00:02:21.310> any<00:02:21.580> third<00:02:21.940> party

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
clear for just about any third party

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.450 
clear for just about any third party
docking<00:02:23.580> port<00:02:24.580> or<00:02:25.210> cable<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:26.740> no<00:02:27.070> problems

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
docking port or cable so no problems

there<00:02:27.700> although<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.210> can't<00:02:28.600> definitely<00:02:28.840> not

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
there although you can't definitely not

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.650 
there although you can't definitely not
use<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.590> in<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:29.950> dock<00:02:30.280> without<00:02:30.570> removing<00:02:31.570> the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
that you can tighten the case for a

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.120 
that you can tighten the case for a
better<00:02:42.730> fit<00:02:43.030> it's<00:02:43.600> definitely<00:02:44.050> very<00:02:44.590> unique
