opaque<00:02:05.549> er<00:02:06.529> to<00:02:07.529> come<00:02:07.740> back<00:02:07.950> from<00:02:08.100> this<00:02:08.310> color

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
opaque er to come back from this color

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.750 
opaque er to come back from this color
is<00:02:09.899> very<00:02:10.649> difficult<00:02:11.220> because<00:02:11.340> once<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.730> put

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
is very difficult because once you put

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.880 
is very difficult because once you put
your<00:02:11.940> composite<00:02:12.330> over<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.780> top<00:02:12.990> as<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.709> tends

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
your composite over the top as it tends

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.340 
your composite over the top as it tends
to<00:02:13.920> be<00:02:14.130> either<00:02:14.490> too<00:02:14.700> bright<00:02:15.000> or<00:02:15.270> white<00:02:16.140> and

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
to be either too bright or white and

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.900 
to be either too bright or white and
brown<00:02:16.560> can<00:02:16.860> bring<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.160> value<00:02:17.400> down<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.790> your

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
brown can bring the value down of your

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.399 
brown can bring the value down of your
restoration<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:18.810> we're<00:02:18.900> going<00:02:19.049> to<00:02:19.110> apply<00:02:19.200> our

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
restoration so we're going to apply our

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.910 
restoration so we're going to apply our
eyes<00:02:19.650> this

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
eyes this

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.040 
eyes this
second<00:02:22.480> next<00:02:23.480> we're<00:02:23.599> gonna<00:02:23.690> apply<00:02:23.990> the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
second next we're gonna apply the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.880 
second next we're gonna apply the
creative<00:02:24.620> color<00:02:24.800> pink<00:02:25.040> opaque<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.739> can

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
creative color pink opaque and you can

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.860 
creative color pink opaque and you can
see<00:02:28.099> you<00:02:28.700> want<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:28.940> put<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:29.150> on<00:02:29.209> in<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.720> nice

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
see you want to put that on in the nice

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.460 
see you want to put that on in the nice
even<00:02:30.319> coat<00:02:31.300> thinner<00:02:32.300> bet<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:32.780> better<00:02:32.989> to

even coat thinner bet the better to

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.170 
even coat thinner bet the better to
start<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.010> can<00:02:34.130> see<00:02:34.340> this<00:02:34.640> thin<00:02:34.940> coat

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
start and you can see this thin coat

start and you can see this thin coat
that<00:02:35.330> I'm<00:02:35.420> talking<00:02:35.599> about<00:02:36.099> just<00:02:37.099> lightly

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
that I'm talking about just lightly

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.010 
that I'm talking about just lightly
starts<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:38.750> change<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.350> color<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:39.920> that<00:02:39.980> tooth

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
starts to change the color of that tooth

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.300 
starts to change the color of that tooth
without<00:02:42.020> bringing<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.590> value<00:02:42.860> up<00:02:42.980> too<00:02:43.160> much

without bringing the value up too much
it<00:02:43.700> keeps<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.060> warm<00:02:44.270> then<00:02:44.989> we're<00:02:45.110> going<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.290> be

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
it keeps it warm then we're going to be

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.190 
it keeps it warm then we're going to be
polymerize<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.160> for<00:02:46.340> ten<00:02:46.489> seconds<00:02:50.170> then<00:02:51.170> add

polymerize this for ten seconds then add

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.509 
polymerize this for ten seconds then add
another<00:02:51.650> coat<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.840> surface<00:02:54.130> just<00:02:55.130> try

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
another coat to that surface just try

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.400 
another coat to that surface just try
and<00:02:55.670> neutralize<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.450> color<00:02:56.720> if<00:02:56.989> you<00:02:57.080> notice

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
and neutralize that color if you notice

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.820 
and neutralize that color if you notice
when<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.620> use<00:02:57.860> this<00:02:58.160> I'm<00:02:58.459> not<00:02:59.269> over<00:03:00.260> all<00:03:00.380> baking

when I use this I'm not over all baking
with<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.100> pink<00:03:01.310> opaque<00:03:01.640> I'm<00:03:02.299> just<00:03:02.660> using<00:03:02.870> it

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
with the pink opaque I'm just using it

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.070 
with the pink opaque I'm just using it
to<00:03:03.080> neutralize<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:04.310> keep<00:03:04.549> that<00:03:04.730> value<00:03:05.080> the

to neutralize and keep that value the

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.440 
to neutralize and keep that value the
gray<00:03:06.290> value<00:03:06.319> down<00:03:07.310> but<00:03:07.790> keep<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.060> value<00:03:08.360> of

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
the tooth up when I put the next

the tooth up when I put the next
material<00:03:10.010> over<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.370> top<00:03:10.549> we<00:03:10.730> will<00:03:10.850> cure<00:03:11.060> this

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
material over the top we will cure this

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.180 
material over the top we will cure this
for<00:03:11.450> 10<00:03:11.630> seconds<00:03:12.080> and<00:03:12.680> then<00:03:12.769> we'll<00:03:12.920> show<00:03:13.160> you

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
for 10 seconds and then we'll show you

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.559 
for 10 seconds and then we'll show you
the<00:03:13.340> difference<00:03:13.730> between<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.120> white<00:03:14.299> opaque

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
the difference between the white opaque

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.360 
the difference between the white opaque
and<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.810> big<00:03:14.959> okay<00:03:15.260> if<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.040> notice<00:03:16.250> on<00:03:16.340> the

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
and the big okay if you notice on the

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.490 
and the big okay if you notice on the
far<00:03:16.670> left<00:03:16.970> we<00:03:17.090> started<00:03:17.239> with<00:03:17.480> our<00:03:17.510> c4<00:03:17.959> shade

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.170 
far left we started with our c4 shade
tab<00:03:18.799> then<00:03:19.220> on<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.459> middle<00:03:19.700> we<00:03:19.790> placed<00:03:20.030> our

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
tab then on the middle we placed our

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.400 
tab then on the middle we placed our
pink<00:03:20.390> opaque<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:20.930> then<00:03:21.049> on<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.230> right<00:03:21.380> we

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
placed our white opaque as you can tell

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.270 
placed our white opaque as you can tell
between<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.410> pink<00:03:24.590> opaque<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.130> white

opaque the Pico pick incenses be more

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.099 
opaque the Pico pick incenses be more
warmer<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.850> absorbs<00:03:29.420> more<00:03:29.600> of<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.750> underlying

warmer it absorbs more of the underlying
color<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:30.799> by<00:03:31.340> being<00:03:31.549> warmer<00:03:31.910> when<00:03:32.060> you

color and by being warmer when you

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.819 
color and by being warmer when you
overlay<00:03:32.420> with<00:03:32.570> your<00:03:32.810> okay<00:03:33.200> your<00:03:33.470> composite

overlay with your okay your composite

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.310 
overlay with your okay your composite
let's<00:03:34.220> say<00:03:34.340> it's<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:34.670> one<00:03:35.030> composite<00:03:35.660> that<00:03:36.140> will

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
let's say it's a one composite that will

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.020 
let's say it's a one composite that will
allow<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.620> a<00:03:36.799> one<00:03:37.070> composite<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.730> look<00:03:37.850> more

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
allow the a one composite to look more

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.789 
allow the a one composite to look more
natural<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:38.690> lifelike<00:03:39.079> so<00:03:39.530> when<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:39.680> put

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
natural and lifelike so when you put

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.140 
natural and lifelike so when you put
your<00:03:39.829> next<00:03:40.010> composite<00:03:40.549> over<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.790> top<00:03:40.970> it

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
your next composite over the top it

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.720 
your next composite over the top it
keeps<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.600> value<00:03:41.900> up<00:03:42.109> on<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:43.190> far<00:03:43.370> right<00:03:43.609> when

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
keeps the value up on the far right when

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.220 
keeps the value up on the far right when
you'll<00:03:43.820> get<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.030> white<00:03:44.299> you<00:03:44.450> can<00:03:44.630> tell<00:03:44.870> just

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
you'll get the white you can tell just

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.780 
you'll get the white you can tell just
from<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.440> beginning<00:03:45.799> that<00:03:46.160> it<00:03:46.280> looks<00:03:46.489> so<00:03:46.609> more

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
from the beginning that it looks so more

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.569 
from the beginning that it looks so more
flat<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.480> little<00:03:48.200> bit<00:03:48.380> more<00:03:48.560> intense<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.340> a

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
flat a little bit more intense and a

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.160 
flat a little bit more intense and a
little<00:03:49.730> bit<00:03:49.820> more<00:03:49.940> all<00:03:50.030> patients<00:03:50.570> so<00:03:51.019> when<00:03:51.140> I

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
little bit more all patients so when I

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.870 
little bit more all patients so when I
put<00:03:51.350> my<00:03:51.380> layer<00:03:51.769> of<00:03:51.890> composite<00:03:52.459> over<00:03:52.609> the<00:03:52.700> top

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
put my layer of composite over the top

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.819 
put my layer of composite over the top
like<00:03:53.030> an<00:03:53.180> a.1<00:03:53.570> i'm<00:03:54.140> going<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.440> see<00:03:54.560> that<00:03:54.709> to

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
like an a.1 i'm going to see that to

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.160 
like an a.1 i'm going to see that to
come<00:03:54.980> out<00:03:55.010> sometimes<00:03:55.519> a<00:03:55.609> little<00:03:55.700> bit<00:03:55.880> brighter

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
come out sometimes a little bit brighter

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.660 
come out sometimes a little bit brighter
also<00:03:57.170> in<00:03:57.260> some<00:03:57.470> cases<00:03:57.500> you<00:03:58.040> can<00:03:58.160> see<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.430> value

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
also in some cases you can see the value

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.640 
also in some cases you can see the value
decrease<00:03:59.150> because<00:03:59.510> white<00:03:59.750> plus<00:04:00.019> brown<00:04:00.320> give<00:04:00.560> a

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
decrease because white plus brown give a

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.770 
decrease because white plus brown give a
little<00:04:00.739> bit<00:04:00.890> more<00:04:01.040> of<00:04:01.100> a<00:04:01.190> grey<00:04:01.370> or<00:04:01.400> value<00:04:01.880> so<00:04:02.570> we

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
little bit more of a grey or value so we

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.900 
little bit more of a grey or value so we
can<00:04:02.930> conclude<00:04:03.140> from<00:04:03.410> this<00:04:03.650> exercise<00:04:03.980> that

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
can conclude from this exercise that

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.330 
can conclude from this exercise that
pink<00:04:05.359> gives<00:04:06.079> you<00:04:06.170> more<00:04:06.319> natural<00:04:06.890> lifelike

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
pink gives you more natural lifelike

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.759 
pink gives you more natural lifelike
restoration<00:04:08.090> all<00:04:08.480> by<00:04:08.840> keeping<00:04:09.140> the<00:04:09.290> value<00:04:09.590> up

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
restoration all by keeping the value up

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.979 
restoration all by keeping the value up
and<00:04:09.980> by<00:04:10.430> giving<00:04:10.609> you<00:04:10.790> a<00:04:10.850> more<00:04:11.090> warmer<00:04:11.540> looking

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
and by giving you a more warmer looking
