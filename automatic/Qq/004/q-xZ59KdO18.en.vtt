00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
is fairly small and compact and it's

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.030 
is fairly small and compact and it's
round<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.170> thirty<00:00:37.380> years<00:00:37.650> old<00:00:37.830> and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
we've got no space here for any

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.200 
we've got no space here for any
additional<00:00:40.649> additional<00:00:41.430> instrumentation

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
additional additional instrumentation

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.389 
additional additional instrumentation
and<00:00:42.809> also<00:00:43.140> we've<00:00:43.320> got<00:00:43.350> separate<00:00:43.860> throttle<00:00:44.309> and

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
and also we've got separate throttle and

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.250 
and also we've got separate throttle and
gear<00:00:44.640> controls<00:00:45.120> which<00:00:45.660> actually<00:00:45.989> aren't<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
gear controls which actually aren't the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.389 
gear controls which actually aren't the
best<00:00:46.440> because<00:00:46.680> they're<00:00:46.829> not<00:00:46.980> good<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
best because they're not good for the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.209 
best because they're not good for the
engine<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:49.079> all<00:00:49.199> ready<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.469> go<00:00:49.739> I'm<00:00:50.070> going

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
that we've bolted this down now that's

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.929 
that we've bolted this down now that's
only<00:01:13.619> finger<00:01:13.979> tight<00:01:14.189> I'm<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> put<00:01:14.909> a

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
only finger tight I'm going to put a

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.640 
only finger tight I'm going to put a
wrench<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.270> at<00:01:15.479> some<00:01:15.630> point<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.530> bit

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
wrench on at some point it's a bit

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.749 
wrench on at some point it's a bit
wobbly<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.040> at<00:01:17.130> least<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.369> won't<00:01:17.520> fall<00:01:17.729> over

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
wobbly but at least it won't fall over

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
so now that we've done that that was

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.700 
so now that we've done that that was
looking<00:01:20.250> pretty<00:01:20.430> good<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.290> let's<00:01:22.290> go<00:01:22.470> ahead

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
looking pretty good and let's go ahead

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.080 
looking pretty good and let's go ahead
and<00:01:22.890> see<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> other<00:01:23.579> port<00:01:23.970> on

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
and see if we can get the other port on

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.210 
and see if we can get the other port on
here<00:01:24.329> get<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.659> other<00:01:24.780> instruments<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.439> put

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
here get the other instruments in put

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.039 
here get the other instruments in put
the<00:01:26.310> wheel<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.700> put<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.299> chartplotter<00:01:27.689> in

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the wheel on it put the chartplotter in

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.240 
the wheel on it put the chartplotter in
here<00:01:28.200> then<00:01:28.350> we<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.530> start<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.829> see<00:01:28.979> where<00:01:29.100> it's

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
here then we can start to see where it's

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
here then we can start to see where it's
gonna<00:01:29.310> can't<00:01:29.640> come<00:01:29.880> together<00:01:30.060> okay<00:01:30.720> fantastic

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270

wheel it's gonna fit on here we've got a
nice<00:01:36.990> new<00:01:37.229> wheel<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.649> go<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:37.979> here<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.850> don't

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
nice new wheel to go on here we don't

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.190 
nice new wheel to go on here we don't
want<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.180> put<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.689> yet<00:01:39.869> because

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
want to put that on just yet because

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.780 
want to put that on just yet because
when<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.409> get<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:40.710> way<00:01:40.890> but<00:01:41.520> what<00:01:41.640> we've

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
when you get in the way but what we've

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.429 
when you get in the way but what we've
got<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.270> there's<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:43.079> here<00:01:43.290> which

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
got is there's a and not here which

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.719 
got is there's a and not here which
would<00:01:43.530> actually<00:01:43.799> hold<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.130> wheel<00:01:44.310> on<00:01:44.520> and

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
would actually hold the wheel on and

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.149 
would actually hold the wheel on and
this<00:01:45.210> actually<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.750> shaft<00:01:46.079> break<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:47.130> that

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
this actually is a shaft break so that

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.429 
this actually is a shaft break so that
when<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.939> need<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.299> boat<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.110> lock<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
when you need the boat you can lock the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.590 
when you need the boat you can lock the
wheel<00:01:49.619> up<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.070> will<00:01:50.130> stop<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.600> tiller

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
wheel up and it will stop the tiller

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.120 
wheel up and it will stop the tiller
from<00:01:51.780> flapping<00:01:52.170> about<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.619> wind<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.009> so

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
from flapping about in the wind and so

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.499 
from flapping about in the wind and so
on<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.790> tell<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.119> what

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
on so I tell you what

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.209 
on so I tell you what
I<00:01:54.540> can't<00:01:55.229> wait<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.680> see<00:01:55.829> what<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.070> is

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
I can't wait just to see what this is

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.830 
I can't wait just to see what this is
gonna<00:01:56.310> look<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.549> hey<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.360> we<00:01:57.450> put<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.689> wheel

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
gonna look like hey can we put the wheel

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.010 
gonna look like hey can we put the wheel
sure<00:01:58.409> yeah<00:01:59.240> so<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.360> want<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.630> get<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.869> whole

now<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:05.969> an<00:02:06.119> unusual<00:02:06.659> looking<00:02:06.899> wheel

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
now this is an unusual looking wheel

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.410 
now this is an unusual looking wheel
right<00:02:07.710> yeah<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.310> kind<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.300> also

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
right yeah it's a kind of a this is also

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.120 
right yeah it's a kind of a this is also
from<00:02:09.690> made<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.020> new<00:02:10.170> as<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.619> made<00:02:10.800> us<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
from made to new as you made us the

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.480 
from made to new as you made us the
binnacle<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.260> what<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.380> is<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:13.890> if<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.310> look

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
binnacle and what it is is if you look

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.160 
binnacle and what it is is if you look
there's<00:02:14.670> obviously<00:02:14.910> it's<00:02:15.030> not<00:02:15.120> round<00:02:15.330> and

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
there's obviously it's not round and

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.280 
there's obviously it's not round and
it's<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.520> top<00:02:17.700> half<00:02:17.940> is<00:02:18.090> round<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.660> then<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
it's the top half is round and then the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.150 
it's the top half is round and then the
bottom<00:02:19.590> half<00:02:19.770> is

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
bottom half is

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.850 
bottom half is
this<00:02:20.700> sort<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.120> flattened<00:02:21.570> so<00:02:22.560> it's<00:02:22.710> like<00:02:22.830> a

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
this sort of flattened so it's like a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.700 
this sort of flattened so it's like a
wheel<00:02:23.070> with<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.280> flat<00:02:23.490> tire

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
wheel with a flat tire

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.740 
wheel with a flat tire
right<00:02:25.710> when<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.340> put<00:02:26.370> this<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:26.790> your<00:02:26.910> see<00:02:27.210> okay

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
right when I put this on your see okay

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.220 
right when I put this on your see okay
so<00:02:28.350> we'll<00:02:28.500> slide<00:02:28.620> this<00:02:28.920> on<00:02:29.130> here<00:02:30.020> okay<00:02:31.020> can<00:02:31.200> you

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
so we'll slide this on here okay can you

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:39.260 
so we'll slide this on here okay can you
hold<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.650> minute<00:02:31.710> yeah<00:02:32.160> okay<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:39.060> then

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
hold that a minute yeah okay and then

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.890 
hold that a minute yeah okay and then
this<00:02:39.870> last<00:02:40.170> thing<00:02:40.500> it's<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.740> sharp<00:02:41.040> break<00:02:41.900> the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
this last thing it's a sharp break the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.460 
this last thing it's a sharp break the
wheel<00:02:43.110> is<00:02:43.290> easy<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.650> rotate<00:02:43.830> okay<00:02:45.020> now<00:02:46.020> what's

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
wheel is easy to rotate okay now what's

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.810 
wheel is easy to rotate okay now what's
going<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.650> happen<00:02:46.740> is<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.160> this<00:02:47.280> dish<00:02:47.580> off

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
going to happen is that this dish off

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.580 
going to happen is that this dish off
break<00:02:48.120> we<00:02:48.270> tighten<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.720> up<00:02:48.840> just<00:02:49.080> thing<00:02:49.410> tight

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
break we tighten it up just thing tight

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.700 
break we tighten it up just thing tight
and<00:02:49.740> it<00:02:49.800> locks<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.070> wheel<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:52.080> because<00:02:54.710> when

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
and it locks the wheel so because when

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.780 
and it locks the wheel so because when
you<00:02:55.740> get<00:02:55.920> off<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.100> boat<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:58.310> if<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.520> Seas

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
you get off the boat and if the Seas

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.550 
you get off the boat and if the Seas
moving<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.480> rudder<00:03:00.660> around<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.110> wheels<00:03:01.320> not

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
moving the rudder around the wheels not

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
moving the rudder around the wheels not
going<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.740> be<00:03:01.800> spinning<00:03:02.070> backwards<00:03:02.340> and

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
going to be spinning backwards and

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.070 
going to be spinning backwards and
forwards<00:03:02.880> all<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.120> time<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.930> obviously

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
forwards all the time and obviously

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.170 
forwards all the time and obviously
normally<00:03:04.680> when<00:03:04.830> we're<00:03:05.010> sailing<00:03:05.430> it's<00:03:05.970> like

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
normally when we're sailing it's like

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.330 
normally when we're sailing it's like
this<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.750> as<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.380> can<00:03:07.470> see<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.800> top<00:03:08.010> off<00:03:08.190> the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
this and as you can see the top off the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.720 
this and as you can see the top off the
wheel<00:03:08.520> is<00:03:08.850> round<00:03:09.950> but<00:03:10.950> normally<00:03:11.400> obviously

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
wheel is round but normally obviously

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.980 
wheel is round but normally obviously
it's<00:03:11.850> loose<00:03:12.030> when<00:03:12.270> you're<00:03:12.390> steering<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.750> boat

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
it's loose when you're steering the boat

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.510 
it's loose when you're steering the boat
but<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.650> other<00:03:13.770> thing<00:03:13.980> is<00:03:14.100> we've<00:03:14.250> got<00:03:14.280> this

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
but the other thing is we've got this

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.110 
but the other thing is we've got this
out<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:14.880> round<00:03:15.330> access<00:03:16.020> will<00:03:16.430> so<00:03:17.430> when<00:03:17.970> you

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
out of round access will so when you

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.390 
out of round access will so when you
you're<00:03:18.840> anchored<00:03:19.260> all<00:03:19.440> your<00:03:19.620> board<00:03:20.010> up<00:03:20.190> and

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
you're anchored all your board up and

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.680 
you're anchored all your board up and
you<00:03:20.490> want<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.700> get<00:03:20.820> from<00:03:20.940> here<00:03:21.180> into<00:03:21.600> the

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
you want to get from here into the
