00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
okay guys welcome back thanks for the

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.619 
okay guys welcome back thanks for the
comments<00:00:04.650> on<00:00:04.770> my<00:00:04.859> last<00:00:04.890> video<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.670> I've<00:00:05.790> taken

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
comments on my last video and I've taken

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.750 
comments on my last video and I've taken
some<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:06.990> your<00:00:07.020> advice<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:07.799> I'm<00:00:08.340> gonna<00:00:08.519> try

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
some of your advice and I'm gonna try

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.860 
some of your advice and I'm gonna try
out<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:08.910> couple<00:00:09.150> things<00:00:09.480> with<00:00:09.690> this

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
out a couple things with this

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.390 
out a couple things with this
solar-powered<00:00:10.940> Bedini<00:00:11.940> SSG<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.190> I'm<00:00:14.190> running

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
solar-powered Bedini SSG and I'm running

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.700 
solar-powered Bedini SSG and I'm running
it<00:00:14.639> off<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:15.089> 15<00:00:16.020> watt<00:00:16.789> solar<00:00:17.789> panel<00:00:18.439> and<00:00:19.439> that's

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
it off a 15 watt solar panel and that's

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.470 
it off a 15 watt solar panel and that's
the<00:00:19.949> only<00:00:20.160> power<00:00:20.369> source<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.150> solar

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
the only power source is that solar

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.040 
the only power source is that solar
panel<00:00:22.100> and<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.670> suggestion<00:00:24.269> was<00:00:24.480> take<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
panel and the suggestion was take the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.660 
panel and the suggestion was take the
energy<00:00:25.199> on<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.160> back<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.240> Bedini<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.670> use

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
energy on the back of the Bedini and use

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.279 
energy on the back of the Bedini and use
it<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.029> make<00:00:30.240> some<00:00:30.480> kind<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.689> torque<00:00:31.019> either

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
it to make some kind of torque either

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.229 
it to make some kind of torque either
put<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.650> neumann<00:00:32.009> water<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.579> makes<00:00:32.820> torque

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
put in a neumann water that makes torque

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.030 
put in a neumann water that makes torque
or<00:00:33.510> try<00:00:33.750> something<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:34.320> makes<00:00:34.500> torque<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.010> I

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
or try something that makes torque so I

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.299 
or try something that makes torque so I
got<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.670> fan<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.890> this<00:00:37.890> was<00:00:38.100> one

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
got it in a fan and this was one

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.760 
got it in a fan and this was one
suggestion<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:40.050> other<00:00:40.170> thing<00:00:40.350> was<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> great

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
suggestion the other thing was a great

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.650 
suggestion the other thing was a great
big<00:00:40.920> capacitor<00:00:41.550> which<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.850> don't<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.540> I'm

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
big capacitor which I don't have but I'm

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.119 
big capacitor which I don't have but I'm
still<00:00:42.899> using<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.260> one<00:00:43.530> there<00:00:43.710> but<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.920> think

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
still using that one there but I think

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.889 
still using that one there but I think
you<00:00:44.250> ride<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> bigger<00:00:44.850> capacitor<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> bigger

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
you ride a bigger capacitor a bigger

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.500 
you ride a bigger capacitor a bigger
Bank<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.410> capacitors<00:00:46.590> would<00:00:47.280> help<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.820> then

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
Bank of capacitors would help and then

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.810 
Bank of capacitors would help and then
the<00:00:48.600> other<00:00:48.719> suggestion<00:00:49.350> was<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.770> store<00:00:50.190> store

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the other suggestion was a store store

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.090 
the other suggestion was a store store
the<00:00:50.940> energy<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.600> battery<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.649> kind<00:00:53.070> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the energy in a battery so I kind of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.020 
the energy in a battery so I kind of
implemented<00:00:53.699> all<00:00:53.850> three<00:00:55.219> words<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.430> wisdom<00:00:56.610> on

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
implemented all three words of wisdom on

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
implemented all three words of wisdom on
this<00:00:57.270> experiment<00:00:58.079> let<00:00:58.289> me<00:00:58.350> turn<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.770> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
this experiment let me turn it on to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.500 
this experiment let me turn it on to
show<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.100> how<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.370> works<00:00:59.579> okay<00:01:02.989> there's<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
show you how it works okay there's the

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.000 
show you how it works okay there's the
voltage<00:01:06.510> coming<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.960> from<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> solar<00:01:07.560> panel

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
voltage coming in from the solar panel

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.850 
voltage coming in from the solar panel
now<00:01:08.130> I'll<00:01:08.280> turn<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.610> motor<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.030> here

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.440 

okay<00:01:14.860> and<00:01:15.159> I'm<00:01:15.280> going<00:01:15.460> to<00:01:15.549> turn<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.880> phone<00:01:16.119> on

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.300 

there's<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:19.630> fan<00:01:19.899> gone<00:01:20.290> now<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:20.860> motors

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
there's the fan gone now the motors

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.819 
there's the fan gone now the motors
going<00:01:23.250> okay<00:01:24.250> this<00:01:24.549> is<00:01:24.759> the<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:26.500> is<00:01:26.710> the

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
going okay this is the this is the

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.419 
going okay this is the this is the
amperage<00:01:27.600> coming<00:01:28.600> into<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.960> system<00:01:29.369> from<00:01:30.369> the

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
amperage coming into the system from the

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.609 
amperage coming into the system from the
solar<00:01:30.850> panel<00:01:31.330> that's<00:01:31.630> where<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.929> solar<00:01:32.200> panel

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
solar panel that's where the solar panel

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.630 
solar panel that's where the solar panel
is<00:01:32.679> sitting<00:01:33.070> right<00:01:33.280> now<00:01:34.320> now<00:01:35.320> I've<00:01:35.619> also<00:01:35.860> got<00:01:36.369> a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
is sitting right now now I've also got a

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.300 
is sitting right now now I've also got a
battery<00:01:37.299> here<00:01:37.600> that's<00:01:37.869> being<00:01:38.140> charged<00:01:38.799> at<00:01:39.130> the

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
battery here that's being charged at the

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.160 
battery here that's being charged at the
same<00:01:39.549> time<00:01:39.880> now<00:01:40.060> I<00:01:40.090> had<00:01:40.360> to<00:01:40.479> use<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.659> smaller

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
same time now I had to use a smaller

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.289 
same time now I had to use a smaller
voltage<00:01:41.740> battery<00:01:42.250> to<00:01:42.460> get<00:01:42.640> any<00:01:42.820> kind<00:01:43.119> of<00:01:43.210> a

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
voltage battery to get any kind of a

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.690 
voltage battery to get any kind of a
charge<00:01:43.689> on<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.860> thing<00:01:45.070> I<00:01:45.189> couldn't<00:01:45.549> use

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
charge on the thing I couldn't use

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.639 
charge on the thing I couldn't use
twelve<00:01:46.149> it<00:01:46.360> couldn't<00:01:46.630> even<00:01:46.840> use<00:01:46.990> ten<00:01:47.319> it<00:01:47.500> had

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
twelve it couldn't even use ten it had

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.130 
twelve it couldn't even use ten it had
to<00:01:47.740> be<00:01:47.860> a<00:01:47.890> lower<00:01:48.190> amount<00:01:48.549> to<00:01:49.450> get<00:01:49.630> anything<00:01:49.990> to

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
to be a lower amount to get anything to

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.199 
to be a lower amount to get anything to
go<00:01:50.289> into<00:01:50.619> that<00:01:50.770> but<00:01:51.459> then<00:01:51.640> on<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:51.939> other<00:01:51.970> side

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209 
go into that but then on the other side

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.270 
go into that but then on the other side
here<00:01:52.810> I<00:01:52.840> found<00:01:53.200> out<00:01:53.439> that<00:01:53.679> I<00:01:53.740> can<00:01:54.039> take<00:01:54.250> a

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
here I found out that I can take a

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.020 
here I found out that I can take a
12-volt

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
12-volt

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.279 
12-volt
led<00:01:55.539> acid<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.580> hook<00:01:57.580> it<00:01:57.759> up<00:01:57.939> and<00:01:58.240> because<00:01:59.110> the

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
led acid and hook it up and because the

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.289 
led acid and hook it up and because the
panel<00:01:59.560> was<00:01:59.830> designed<00:02:00.220> for<00:02:00.459> a<00:02:00.520> 12-volt<00:02:01.060> system

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
panel was designed for a 12-volt system

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.190 
panel was designed for a 12-volt system
this<00:02:02.200> worked<00:02:02.530> also<00:02:03.299> now<00:02:04.299> you<00:02:04.360> can<00:02:04.720> see<00:02:04.959> it's

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
this worked also now you can see it's

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.410 
this worked also now you can see it's
it's<00:02:05.560> drawn<00:02:05.950> more<00:02:06.250> current<00:02:06.789> from<00:02:06.970> that<00:02:07.000> solar

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
it's drawn more current from that solar

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.499 
it's drawn more current from that solar
panel<00:02:07.750> now<00:02:08.049> and<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:09.640> is<00:02:09.849> sitting<00:02:10.149> at<00:02:10.239> twelve

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
panel now and this is sitting at twelve

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.140 
panel now and this is sitting at twelve
point<00:02:10.780> nine<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:11.530> there<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:12.489> goes<00:02:12.519> on<00:02:12.849> up<00:02:13.000> to

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
point nine and there it goes on up to

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.410 
point nine and there it goes on up to
thirteen<00:02:13.660> thirteen<00:02:14.620> one<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.340> that's<00:02:15.910> energy

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
thirteen thirteen one and that's energy

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.930 
thirteen thirteen one and that's energy
going<00:02:16.660> into<00:02:17.019> this<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:18.130> I'm<00:02:18.430> pulling<00:02:18.700> off

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
going into this so I'm pulling off

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.840 
going into this so I'm pulling off
energy<00:02:19.209> from<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:19.810> panel<00:02:20.109> more<00:02:21.040> than<00:02:21.579> before

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
energy from that panel more than before

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.849 
energy from that panel more than before
and<00:02:22.390> it's<00:02:22.930> going<00:02:23.200> into<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:24.120> battery<00:02:25.120> there

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
and it's going into that battery there

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.130 
and it's going into that battery there
now<00:02:26.859> the<00:02:27.280> other<00:02:27.430> thing<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.329> motor<00:02:28.930> is

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
now the other thing is the motor is

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.190 
now the other thing is the motor is
still<00:02:29.410> doing<00:02:30.130> its<00:02:30.310> thing<00:02:30.630> with<00:02:31.630> my<00:02:31.870> little

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
still doing its thing with my little

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.949 
still doing its thing with my little
generator<00:02:32.769> circuit<00:02:33.329> right<00:02:34.329> here<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:34.840> I'm

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
generator circuit right here and I'm

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.890 
generator circuit right here and I'm
also<00:02:35.380> charging<00:02:35.829> up<00:02:35.980> this<00:02:36.190> battery<00:02:36.609> here<00:02:37.000> it's

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
also charging up this battery here it's

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.080 
also charging up this battery here it's
not<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.260> lot<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.709> goes<00:02:39.130> in<00:02:39.340> there<00:02:39.489> but<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:39.880> does

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
not a lot that goes in there but it does

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.819 
not a lot that goes in there but it does
charge<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:40.720> battery<00:02:40.750> up<00:02:41.319> so<00:02:41.530> I've<00:02:41.650> got

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
charge that battery up so I've got

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.190 
charge that battery up so I've got
charging<00:02:42.310> going<00:02:42.579> on<00:02:42.760> there<00:02:43.090> I've<00:02:43.989> got

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
charging going on there I've got

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.830 
charging going on there I've got
charging<00:02:44.739> going<00:02:45.069> on<00:02:45.220> there<00:02:45.700> I've<00:02:46.569> got

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
charging going on there I've got

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.920 
charging going on there I've got
charging<00:02:47.350> going<00:02:47.680> on<00:02:47.859> there<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.630> I'm<00:02:49.630> staying

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
charging going on there and I'm staying

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.220 
charging going on there and I'm staying
cool<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.910> this<00:02:52.120> was<00:02:52.329> the<00:02:52.480> neatest<00:02:52.660> thing<00:02:52.989> was

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
cool and this was the neatest thing was

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.470 
cool and this was the neatest thing was
to<00:02:53.410> be<00:02:53.590> able<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:54.120> actually<00:02:55.120> drive<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.780> load<00:02:57.480> at

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
to be able to actually drive a load at

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.590 
to be able to actually drive a load at
the<00:02:58.720> same<00:02:58.959> time<00:02:59.230> you're<00:02:59.440> charging<00:02:59.920> stuff<00:03:00.190> up

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
the same time you're charging stuff up

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.960 
the same time you're charging stuff up
and<00:03:01.600> I<00:03:01.900> don't<00:03:01.959> know<00:03:02.319> whether<00:03:02.859> this<00:03:03.160> if<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.609> add

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
and I don't know whether this if you add

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.180 
and I don't know whether this if you add
off<00:03:04.209> all<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.690> different<00:03:05.019> amps<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:05.530> voltages

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
off all the different amps and voltages

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.800 
off all the different amps and voltages
and<00:03:06.519> drawers<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.120> everything<00:03:07.450> else<00:03:07.600> and

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
and drawers and everything else and

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.990 
and drawers and everything else and
jewels<00:03:08.109> and<00:03:08.410> coulombs<00:03:08.980> which<00:03:09.549> would<00:03:09.730> getting

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
jewels and coulombs which would getting

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.910 
jewels and coulombs which would getting
out<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.209> this<00:03:10.359> but<00:03:11.109> it<00:03:11.230> sure<00:03:11.470> is<00:03:11.650> interesting

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
out of this but it sure is interesting

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.830 
out of this but it sure is interesting
to<00:03:12.730> see<00:03:13.000> all<00:03:13.150> this<00:03:13.329> work<00:03:13.660> together<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:15.840> can

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
to see all this work together and I can

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.900 
to see all this work together and I can
say<00:03:16.959> there's<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.470> amount<00:03:18.280> of<00:03:18.400> energy<00:03:18.639> coming

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
say there's the amount of energy coming

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.140 
say there's the amount of energy coming
in<00:03:19.120> 620<00:03:19.989> milliamps

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
in 620 milliamps

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.539 
in 620 milliamps
and<00:03:21.690> it's<00:03:21.989> holding<00:03:22.379> this<00:03:22.530> voltage<00:03:23.069> here<00:03:23.310> right

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
and it's holding this voltage here right

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.430 
and it's holding this voltage here right
now<00:03:23.700> at<00:03:23.849> this<00:03:24.000> battery<00:03:24.390> this<00:03:24.540> will<00:03:24.720> climb<00:03:25.080> and

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
now at this battery this will climb and

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.460 
now at this battery this will climb and
you'd<00:03:26.159> really<00:03:26.370> have<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.760> have<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:27.470> controller

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
you'd really have to have a controller

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.800 
you'd really have to have a controller
on<00:03:28.739> that<00:03:29.099> to<00:03:29.250> not<00:03:29.459> overcharge<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:30.299> 12-volt

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
on that to not overcharge that 12-volt

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.610 
on that to not overcharge that 12-volt
battery<00:03:31.640> but<00:03:32.989> anyway<00:03:33.989> this<00:03:34.110> was<00:03:34.319> a<00:03:34.349> neat

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
battery but anyway this was a neat

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.740 
battery but anyway this was a neat
experiment<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.549> I<00:03:35.610> really<00:03:36.330> enjoyed<00:03:36.720> and

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
experiment that I really enjoyed and

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.289 
experiment that I really enjoyed and
this<00:03:37.200> was<00:03:37.379> a<00:03:37.409> solar<00:03:38.040> panel<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.519> got<00:03:38.700> on<00:03:38.849> eBay<00:03:39.060> to

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
this was a solar panel I got on eBay to

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.199 
this was a solar panel I got on eBay to
replace<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.959> one<00:03:40.110> that<00:03:40.140> I<00:03:40.290> broke<00:03:40.849> last<00:03:41.849> year

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
replace the one that I broke last year

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.020 
replace the one that I broke last year
it<00:03:42.329> was<00:03:42.450> on<00:03:42.569> my<00:03:42.750> sailboat<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.560> supplied

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
it was on my sailboat and it supplied

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.630 
it was on my sailboat and it supplied
energy<00:03:45.030> for<00:03:45.510> lighting<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.019> stuff<00:03:46.340> but<00:03:47.340> anyway

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
energy for lighting and stuff but anyway

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.990 
energy for lighting and stuff but anyway
now<00:03:47.760> I<00:03:47.790> got<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.060> fan<00:03:48.470> that's<00:03:49.470> kind<00:03:49.829> of<00:03:49.920> cool<00:03:50.159> so<00:03:50.879> I

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
now I got a fan that's kind of cool so I

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.509 
now I got a fan that's kind of cool so I
can<00:03:51.180> sit<00:03:51.360> here<00:03:51.599> and<00:03:51.989> be<00:03:52.590> nice<00:03:52.769> and<00:03:52.799> cool<00:03:53.190> with

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
can sit here and be nice and cool with

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.720 
can sit here and be nice and cool with
the<00:03:53.609> fan<00:03:54.049> while<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.590> solar<00:03:55.799> panel<00:03:56.190> charges<00:03:56.400> up

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
the fan while the solar panel charges up

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.859 
the fan while the solar panel charges up
my<00:03:56.879> battery<00:03:57.590> very<00:03:58.590> cool
