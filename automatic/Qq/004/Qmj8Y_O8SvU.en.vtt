I'm<00:00:50.600> afraid<00:00:50.750> it's<00:00:51.050> going<00:00:51.140> to<00:00:51.200> like

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
I'm afraid it's going to like

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.930 
I'm afraid it's going to like
overwhelming<00:00:52.100> cuz<00:00:52.280> in<00:00:52.399> high<00:00:52.579> school<00:00:52.879> is

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
overwhelming cuz in high school is

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.310 
overwhelming cuz in high school is
calling<00:00:53.059> to<00:00:53.270> breeze<00:00:53.510> through<00:00:53.540> i<00:00:53.840> think<00:00:54.230> that

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
calling to breeze through i think that

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.930 
calling to breeze through i think that
the<00:00:54.410> college<00:00:54.710> is<00:00:54.800> no<00:00:55.160> totally<00:00:55.520> different<00:00:55.820> it's

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
the college is no totally different it's

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.000 
the college is no totally different it's
harder<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:56.570> I'm<00:00:56.629> afraid<00:00:56.960> email<00:00:57.230> might<00:00:57.440> be<00:00:57.649> a

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
harder so I'm afraid email might be a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.130 
harder so I'm afraid email might be a
little<00:00:58.309> bit<00:00:58.460> overload<00:00:59.120> and<00:00:59.390> then<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.930> fact

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
little bit overload and then the fact
