00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.160
 our memories and many times

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.360
 of the most spectacular groups of 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.890
 good world jorge tell us a little bit 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.259
 of what we were doing on this day 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.060
 so wonderful we were very pleased that 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.670
 they could accompany us we saw the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.650
 pandas we saw the elephants side by 7 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.200
 the elephants were also the 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.370
 backstage is a wonderful thing that 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.620
 we have here at san zoo 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.930
 diego and one of the activity that I most 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.340
 loved it was the backstage step account the 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.500
 subway to half what we were 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.540
 doing there think that's one of 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.940
 the things that I love and the backstage 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.910
 is the see if it happens and people can come 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.040
 they can have fence animals like 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.260
 now we saw the kangaroo that is being 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.360
 to marcio pal highest in the world also 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.860
 this we had to see the flamingos in the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.380
 friends after much that the a 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.420
 We also love them and we also 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.090
 It touched to see the rowan and they remember that 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.800
 the rowan can jump super high the 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.630
 marine animals that we have in the 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.190
 backstage cars I did not love this one 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.989
 activity besides this I just say it 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.480
 distinguishes from the others zoo because 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.160
 we have pandas think that if 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.730
 we have here this display the pandas 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.500
 that lying 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.750
 the most popular that we have here in 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.450
 our zoo here we have the baby 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.640
 good was the baby because he already has three 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.970
 years we just received a baby the 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.440
 end of July the new baby and this one 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.110
 it's okay it's an exhibition of the people 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.299
 he loves to come and get that close 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.799
 to the pandas one of the animals most without 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.769
 common that are in captivity 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.500
 here in states in the USA there are only four 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.420
 they are rich who have these loaves a 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.400
 very very spectacular thing and they do 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.769
 with the pandas here because they have us 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.209
 here the reason that we all have here 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.190
 it's been because we are in many 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.260
 studies do not know much about these 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.180
 animals in china and here with us 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.250
 we have made many different types of 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.760
 studies that includes the sense of 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.709
 listen to the sense of vocalizing also 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.940
 this what many things eat 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.700
 then we are doing many 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.230
 studies in the last 14 16 years no 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.549
 definitely come all 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.819
 activities that we were doing in the 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.709
 today the day was spectacular 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.060
 surrounded by nature and for that 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.410
 there are the people who are watching us and 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.849
 they feel like doing everything 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.560
 we were doing today how 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.970
 We can access your page or 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.010

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.550
 all throughout the year we have 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.709

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.730
 different cameras that are focused 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.050
 in certain animals so they can see 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.670
 the animals do not matter where they are 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.440
