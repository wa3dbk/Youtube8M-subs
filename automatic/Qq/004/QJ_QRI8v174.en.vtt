00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.199 
again the last level as you can say I've
7<00:03:58.510> perch<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.989> increase<00:03:59.410> and<00:03:59.739> I<00:04:00.459> started<00:04:00.880> level

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
7 perch to increase and I started level

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.410 
7 perch to increase and I started level
18<00:04:01.780> I<00:04:01.810> believe<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:03.190> so<00:04:03.550> by<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:03.970> end<00:04:04.090> of<00:04:04.239> this

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
18 I believe and so by the end of this

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.480 
18 I believe and so by the end of this
you<00:04:04.690> should<00:04:04.930> have<00:04:05.140> a<00:04:05.470> pretty<00:04:06.040> good<00:04:06.099> amount<00:04:06.610> of

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
you should have a pretty good amount of

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.280 
you should have a pretty good amount of
increase<00:04:08.030> if<00:04:08.150> you're<00:04:08.270> an<00:04:08.510> even<00:04:08.810> lower<00:04:08.900> level

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
increase if you're an even lower level

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.980 
increase if you're an even lower level
and<00:04:09.380> you<00:04:09.440> should<00:04:09.590> have<00:04:09.620> a<00:04:09.710> lot<00:04:09.830> more<00:04:10.070> and

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
and you should have a lot more and

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.440 
and you should have a lot more and
having<00:04:11.990> a<00:04:12.440> lot<00:04:12.980> of<00:04:13.010> magica<00:04:13.520> definitely<00:04:14.150> helps

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450
