late<00:02:54.269> for<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.750> we're<00:02:55.080> able<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.350> score

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
late for that and we're able to score

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.590 
late for that and we're able to score
the<00:02:55.680> kill<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.010> we<00:02:56.489> were<00:02:56.580> also<00:02:56.730> fortunate<00:02:57.120> that

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
the kill and we were also fortunate that

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.180 
the kill and we were also fortunate that
because<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.500> pressure<00:02:58.680> we<00:02:58.920> had<00:02:59.040> on<00:02:59.160> the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
because of the pressure we had on the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.640 
because of the pressure we had on the
warrior<00:02:59.459> the<00:03:00.030> priest<00:03:00.330> wasn't<00:03:00.660> able<00:03:00.810> able<00:03:01.170> to

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
warrior the priest wasn't able able to

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.890 
warrior the priest wasn't able able to
blow<00:03:02.280> global<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.940> dispel<00:03:03.239> my<00:03:03.360> pallies<00:03:03.660> wings

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
blow global to dispel my pallies wings

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.630 
blow global to dispel my pallies wings
so<00:03:04.170> we<00:03:04.560> were<00:03:04.650> able<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.950> do<00:03:05.069> a<00:03:05.100> lot<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.400> damage

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
so we were able to do a lot of damage

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.430 
so we were able to do a lot of damage
that<00:03:05.760> warrior<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.959> can<00:03:07.080> see<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.230> the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
that warrior and you can see that the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.110 
that warrior and you can see that the
warrior<00:03:07.709> died<00:03:07.950> within<00:03:08.280> like<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.610> second<00:03:09.000> or<00:03:09.090> two

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
warrior died within like a second or two

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.460 
warrior died within like a second or two
into<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.480> blind<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:09.989> it's<00:03:10.110> not<00:03:10.170> like<00:03:10.350> the

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
into the blind so it's not like the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.229 
into the blind so it's not like the
blind<00:03:10.680> changed<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.430> game<00:03:11.580> but<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.000> can<00:03:12.120> see

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
blind changed the game but you can see

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.759 
blind changed the game but you can see
that<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.510> blinding<00:03:12.900> actually<00:03:13.350> interrupted

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
that the blinding actually interrupted

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.289 
that the blinding actually interrupted
the<00:03:13.860> flash<00:03:14.100> heal<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.519> that<00:03:14.670> might<00:03:14.850> have<00:03:15.000> you

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
the flash heal so that might have you

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.479 
the flash heal so that might have you
know<00:03:15.330> if<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.750> didn't<00:03:16.049> go<00:03:16.350> off<00:03:16.560> right<00:03:17.250> then

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
know if that didn't go off right then

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.740 
know if that didn't go off right then
and<00:03:17.609> there<00:03:17.670> he<00:03:17.910> could<00:03:18.060> have<00:03:18.180> got<00:03:18.329> that<00:03:18.480> flash

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
and there he could have got that flash

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.930 
and there he could have got that flash
heal<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.170> then<00:03:19.290> i<00:03:19.470> don't<00:03:20.220> know<00:03:20.430> i<00:03:20.459> mean<00:03:20.700> even

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
heal and then i don't know i mean even

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.789 
heal and then i don't know i mean even
if<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.239> flashy<00:03:21.420> went<00:03:21.780> off<00:03:21.900> we<00:03:22.320> had<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.530> full

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
if the flashy went off we had the full

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.170 
if the flashy went off we had the full
blind<00:03:23.040> afterwards<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:23.609> we<00:03:23.730> probably<00:03:23.970> would

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
blind afterwards so we probably would

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.640 
blind afterwards so we probably would
have<00:03:24.239> killed<00:03:24.390> him<00:03:24.540> either<00:03:24.660> way<00:03:24.780> they<00:03:25.590> were

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
have killed him either way they were

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.960 
have killed him either way they were
kind<00:03:25.890> of<00:03:25.920> just<00:03:25.980> behind<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:26.459> heels<00:03:26.700> when<00:03:26.790> we<00:03:26.880> had

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970
