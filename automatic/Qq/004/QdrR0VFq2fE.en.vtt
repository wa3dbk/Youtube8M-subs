00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
for some reason that doesn't seem to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.850 
for some reason that doesn't seem to
work<00:01:22.950> at<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.880> at<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> moment<00:01:24.780> doing<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.650> one

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
work at the at the moment doing this one

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.649 
work at the at the moment doing this one
I<00:01:26.040> don't<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.670> an<00:01:26.790> attachment<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.450> my

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
I don't have an attachment on my

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.929 
I don't have an attachment on my
Remington<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.320> later<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.829> do<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.430> find

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
Remington but later on I do and find

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.520 
Remington but later on I do and find
that<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.240> actually<00:01:30.270> doesn't<00:01:30.960> work<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.409> end

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
that it actually doesn't work so we end

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.899 
that it actually doesn't work so we end
up<00:01:31.619> switching<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.070> pistols<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.670> need<00:01:32.790> to

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
up switching to pistols but you need to

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.999 
up switching to pistols but you need to
keep<00:01:33.060> spraying<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.659> eggs<00:01:33.900> until<00:01:34.200> they

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
keep spraying the eggs until they

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:35.569 
keep spraying the eggs until they
explode

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
explode

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.730 
explode
it<00:01:36.000> may<00:01:36.180> take<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.540> quite<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.840> while<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.409> can

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
it may take you quite a while as you can

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.170 
it may take you quite a while as you can
see<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.070> gameplay<00:01:38.460> we<00:01:38.610> struggle<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.060> little

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
see in the gameplay we struggle a little

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.580 
see in the gameplay we struggle a little
bit<00:01:39.479> because<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.869> really<00:01:40.079> hard<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.320> keep<00:01:40.409> on

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
bit because it's really hard to keep on

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.319 
bit because it's really hard to keep on
target<00:01:41.040> when<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.250> keep<00:01:41.369> bouncing<00:01:41.909> around<00:01:42.000> you

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
target when you keep bouncing around you

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.960 
target when you keep bouncing around you
don't<00:01:42.509> exactly<00:01:42.780> bounce<00:01:43.229> straight<00:01:43.860> up<00:01:44.130> or<00:01:44.549> it's

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
don't exactly bounce straight up or it's

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.580 
don't exactly bounce straight up or it's
straightforward<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.780> kind<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.020> bounce<00:01:46.259> to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
straightforward you kind of bounce to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.469 
straightforward you kind of bounce to
left<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:46.950> right<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.549> kind<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.939> control<00:01:48.270> that

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
left and right to kind of control that

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.060 
left and right to kind of control that
but<00:01:48.659> once<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.229> you'll<00:01:49.710> know<00:01:49.890> you've<00:01:50.040> done

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
but once you do you'll know you've done

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.710 
but once you do you'll know you've done
it<00:01:50.250> because<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.640> actual<00:01:50.970> egg<00:01:51.060> will<00:01:51.240> explode

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
it because the actual egg will explode

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.080 
it because the actual egg will explode
now<00:01:52.140> annoyingly<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.979> actual<00:01:53.310> locations<00:01:53.850> of

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
now annoyingly the actual locations of

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.149 
now annoyingly the actual locations of
the<00:01:54.360> eggs<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.899> change<00:01:55.350> what<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.680> showed<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.009> in

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
the eggs can change what I showed you in

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.859 
the eggs can change what I showed you in
the<00:01:56.189> last<00:01:56.430> clip<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.030> was<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.299> my<00:01:57.420> right<00:01:57.450> but

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
the last clip is it was to my right but

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.569 
the last clip is it was to my right but
if<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:57.990> actually<00:01:58.259> bounce<00:01:58.439> up<00:01:58.680> here<00:01:58.920> you'll<00:01:59.369> see

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
if we actually bounce up here you'll see

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.389 
if we actually bounce up here you'll see
that<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.030> egg<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.240> now<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.170> left<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.920> when

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
that the egg is now in the left so when

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.980 
that the egg is now in the left so when
you<00:02:02.490> actually<00:02:02.640> play<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.299> eggs<00:02:03.540> might

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
you actually play the eggs might

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.649 
you actually play the eggs might
actually<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.520> location<00:02:05.880> rather<00:02:06.329> than

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
actually be in that location rather than

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.510 
actually be in that location rather than
the<00:02:06.750> other<00:02:06.899> location<00:02:07.469> but<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.129> second

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
the other location but the second

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.910 
the other location but the second
location<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.270> area<00:02:09.750> doesn't<00:02:10.530> move<00:02:10.709> from

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
location in this area doesn't move from

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.309 
location in this area doesn't move from
what<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.190> know<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.360> does<00:02:12.540> move<00:02:12.810> though<00:02:13.050> then

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
what I know if it does move though then

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.610 
what I know if it does move though then
it<00:02:13.410> will

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
it will

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.009 
it will
in<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.980> location<00:02:14.310> that's<00:02:14.580> very<00:02:15.030> near<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:15.959> you

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
in a location that's very near it so you

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.140 
in a location that's very near it so you
won't<00:02:16.319> miss<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:17.099> location<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.819> found

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
won't miss it so location that I found

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.330 
won't miss it so location that I found
the<00:02:18.269> second<00:02:18.660> egg<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:19.680> bounce<00:02:19.980> on<00:02:20.250> the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
the second egg on is to bounce on the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.220 
the second egg on is to bounce on the
same<00:02:20.550> mushroom<00:02:20.790> pad<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.420> look<00:02:21.629> to<00:02:21.810> your<00:02:21.959> left

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
same mushroom pad and look to your left

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.720 
same mushroom pad and look to your left
right<00:02:22.590> towards<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:22.950> spawn<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.550> when<00:02:23.640> you

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
right towards the spawn and when you

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.910 
right towards the spawn and when you
bounce<00:02:23.940> up<00:02:24.269> you'll<00:02:24.690> see<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.050> egg<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.410> this

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
bounce up you'll see the egg on this

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.470 
bounce up you'll see the egg on this
cliff<00:02:26.280> face<00:02:26.310> right<00:02:26.790> here<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.269> like<00:02:27.330> I

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
cliff face right here and like I

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.660 
cliff face right here and like I
mentioned<00:02:27.629> you<00:02:27.900> can't<00:02:28.200> chew<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.769> with<00:02:28.980> weapons

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
mentioned you can't chew it with weapons

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.789 
mentioned you can't chew it with weapons
with<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.970> ark<00:02:30.209> attached<00:02:30.569> onto<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:31.049> so<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.709> the

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
with the ark attached onto it so in the

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.009 
with the ark attached onto it so in the
end<00:02:31.830> we<00:02:32.580> end<00:02:32.730> up<00:02:32.849> using<00:02:32.879> pistols<00:02:33.299> again<00:02:33.810> for

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
end we end up using pistols again for

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.920 
end we end up using pistols again for
this<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.349> it<00:02:35.129> is<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.209> pretty<00:02:36.569> far

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
this and it is it is a pretty far

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.020 
this and it is it is a pretty far
distance<00:02:37.170> but<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.950> pistol<00:02:38.340> will<00:02:38.519> manage<00:02:38.849> to

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
distance but the pistol will manage to

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.520 
distance but the pistol will manage to
get<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.269> pretty<00:02:39.480> quickly<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.080> as<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.349> can<00:02:40.470> see

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
get it pretty quickly and as you can see

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.979 
get it pretty quickly and as you can see
the<00:02:41.040> egg<00:02:41.160> definitely<00:02:41.670> does<00:02:41.879> explode<00:02:42.299> there<00:02:42.599> so

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
the egg definitely does explode there so

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.350 
the egg definitely does explode there so
now<00:02:43.140> let's<00:02:43.379> move<00:02:43.560> on<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.190> second<00:02:44.640> area<00:02:44.970> so

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
now let's move on to the second area so

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.390 
now let's move on to the second area so
to<00:02:45.390> get<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.049> second<00:02:46.440> area<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:46.920> have<00:02:47.160> to

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
to get to the second area you have to

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.150 
to get to the second area you have to
complete<00:02:47.910> all<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.420> hives<00:02:48.840> within<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.860> first

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
complete all the hives within the first

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.920 
complete all the hives within the first
area<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.730> will<00:02:50.880> unlock<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.450> access<00:02:51.900> to

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
area and that will unlock you access to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.170 
area and that will unlock you access to
the<00:02:52.260> second<00:02:52.620> area<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.340> get<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.790> section

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
the second area so to get to the section

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.059 
the second area so to get to the section
come<00:02:54.450> through<00:02:54.690> up<00:02:55.230> on<00:02:55.530> here<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.739> then<00:02:55.950> you

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
come through up on here and then you

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.860 
come through up on here and then you
want<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.280> be<00:02:56.430> hopping<00:02:57.000> onto<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.420> mushroom<00:02:57.720> pad

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
want to be hopping onto the mushroom pad

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.600 
want to be hopping onto the mushroom pad
here<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.140> this<00:02:58.379> is<00:02:58.530> where<00:02:58.739> we<00:02:58.890> want<00:02:59.129> to<00:02:59.280> end<00:02:59.430> up

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
here and this is where we want to end up

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.880 
here and this is where we want to end up
but<00:02:59.849> you<00:03:00.000> can't<00:03:00.209> simply<00:03:00.569> jump<00:03:00.870> up<00:03:01.049> there<00:03:01.290> so

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
but you can't simply jump up there so

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.830 
but you can't simply jump up there so
just<00:03:02.340> follow<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.670> path<00:03:02.849> that<00:03:02.879> I<00:03:03.090> do<00:03:03.209> the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
just follow the path that I do the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.449 
just follow the path that I do the
verticality<00:03:04.230> on<00:03:04.500> this<00:03:04.650> map<00:03:04.829> is<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.069> little<00:03:05.340> bit

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
verticality on this map is a little bit

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.039 
verticality on this map is a little bit
confusing<00:03:05.849> at<00:03:06.030> times<00:03:06.060> but<00:03:06.540> once<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.810> get<00:03:06.900> used

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
confusing at times but once you get used

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.690 
confusing at times but once you get used
to<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.319> using<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.860> mushroom<00:03:08.220> pad<00:03:08.400> actually

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
to it using the mushroom pad actually

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.460 
to it using the mushroom pad actually
turns<00:03:08.940> out<00:03:09.060> quite<00:03:09.299> well<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:09.930> if<00:03:10.049> in<00:03:10.170> here<00:03:10.349> you

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
turns out quite well so if in here you

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.990 
turns out quite well so if in here you
will<00:03:10.560> come<00:03:10.769> across<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:11.160> mammoth<00:03:11.519> which<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.849> the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
will come across a mammoth which is the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.819 
will come across a mammoth which is the
new<00:03:12.209> Rhino<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:13.079> once<00:03:13.319> you<00:03:13.379> completed<00:03:13.799> that

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
new Rhino and once you completed that

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.680 
new Rhino and once you completed that
come<00:03:14.129> through<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.549> you<00:03:14.670> will<00:03:14.819> see<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.209> egg<00:03:15.480> on

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
come through and you will see the egg on

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.750 
come through and you will see the egg on
top<00:03:16.079> of<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.470> little<00:03:16.680> crevice<00:03:16.980> there<00:03:17.340> our

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
top of that little crevice there our

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.970 
top of that little crevice there our
mentioned<00:03:18.209> earlier<00:03:18.510> gotta<00:03:19.380> shoot<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.799> with

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
mentioned earlier gotta shoot it with

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.319 
mentioned earlier gotta shoot it with
weapons<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.370> don't<00:03:20.609> have<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.790> arc<00:03:20.970> on<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.209> as

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
weapons that don't have the arc on it as

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.670 
weapons that don't have the arc on it as
you<00:03:21.450> can<00:03:21.480> see<00:03:21.600> it's<00:03:21.959> not<00:03:22.109> affecting<00:03:22.560> it

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
you can see it's not affecting it

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.129 
you can see it's not affecting it
whatsoever<00:03:23.090> hope<00:03:24.090> we<00:03:24.180> switch<00:03:24.359> to<00:03:24.569> our<00:03:24.600> pistols

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
whatsoever hope we switch to our pistols

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.559 
whatsoever hope we switch to our pistols
and<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:26.040> egg<00:03:26.340> experts<00:03:26.880> really<00:03:27.389> really

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
and the egg experts really really

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.059 
and the egg experts really really
quickly<00:03:27.870> so<00:03:28.049> that's<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.620> third<00:03:28.859> location

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
quickly so that's the third location

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.819 
quickly so that's the third location
that<00:03:29.489> location<00:03:30.329> may<00:03:30.540> move<00:03:30.780> if<00:03:31.019> it<00:03:31.380> does<00:03:31.590> it

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
that location may move if it does it

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.589 
that location may move if it does it
will<00:03:32.040> be<00:03:32.069> somewhere<00:03:32.519> very<00:03:32.730> very<00:03:32.849> close<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.450> it

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
will be somewhere very very close to it

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.660 
will be somewhere very very close to it
and<00:03:33.720> that's<00:03:34.170> we<00:03:34.349> want<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.889> last<00:03:35.220> location

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
and that's we want to the last location

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.490 
and that's we want to the last location
now<00:03:36.120> this<00:03:36.269> fourth<00:03:36.540> egg<00:03:36.750> could<00:03:37.019> either<00:03:37.200> be

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
now this fourth egg could either be

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.050 
now this fourth egg could either be
slightly<00:03:37.889> to<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.160> left<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.730> where<00:03:38.880> the

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
slightly to the left of where the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.479 
slightly to the left of where the
original<00:03:39.150> third<00:03:39.810> egg<00:03:40.109> was<00:03:40.349> located<00:03:40.709> but<00:03:41.160> this

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
original third egg was located but this

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.860 
original third egg was located but this
is<00:03:41.639> where<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.880> other<00:03:42.030> location<00:03:42.480> for<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.720> could

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
is where the other location for it could

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.509 
is where the other location for it could
be<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:43.230> this<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.650> one<00:03:43.859> of<00:03:43.889> the<00:03:44.010> little<00:03:44.250> kind<00:03:44.430> of

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
be and this is one of the little kind of

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:45.740 
be and this is one of the little kind of
little<00:03:44.700> crevasses<00:03:45.239> which<00:03:45.269> has<00:03:45.599> the

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
little crevasses which has the

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.360 
little crevasses which has the
schematics<00:03:46.230> in<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.650> you'll<00:03:46.950> come<00:03:47.099> across<00:03:47.220> a

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
schematics in and you'll come across a

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.729 
schematics in and you'll come across a
few<00:03:47.669> cryptids<00:03:48.150> including<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.810> rhino<00:03:49.139> which<00:03:49.530> is

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
few cryptids including a rhino which is

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.680 
few cryptids including a rhino which is
a<00:03:49.769> not<00:03:50.489> very<00:03:50.519> pleasant<00:03:50.910> but<00:03:51.209> if<00:03:51.299> you<00:03:51.389> have<00:03:51.540> the

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
a not very pleasant but if you have the

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.750 
a not very pleasant but if you have the
ark<00:03:51.870> attachment<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.590> really<00:03:53.220> really<00:03:53.430> helps<00:03:53.639> in

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
ark attachment it really really helps in

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.580 
ark attachment it really really helps in
dealing<00:03:54.060> with<00:03:54.090> cryptids<00:03:55.019> it<00:03:55.200> kills<00:03:55.410> them<00:03:55.560> a

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
dealing with cryptids it kills them a

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.159 
dealing with cryptids it kills them a
lot<00:03:55.769> more<00:03:55.799> quickly<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:56.880> once<00:03:57.329> we<00:03:57.510> do<00:03:57.690> take<00:03:57.959> care

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
lot more quickly so once we do take care

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.809 
lot more quickly so once we do take care
of<00:03:58.230> this<00:03:58.380> Rhino<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.980> hop<00:03:59.130> back<00:03:59.160> into<00:03:59.549> here

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
of this Rhino and hop back into here

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.030 
of this Rhino and hop back into here
you'll<00:04:00.389> see<00:04:00.599> that<00:04:00.780> there<00:04:00.959> will<00:04:01.049> be<00:04:01.079> an<00:04:01.230> arc<00:04:01.440> for

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
you'll see that there will be an arc for

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.770 
you'll see that there will be an arc for
you<00:04:02.130> but<00:04:02.400> behind<00:04:02.760> this<00:04:03.000> little<00:04:03.359> area<00:04:03.599> here

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
you but behind this little area here

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.440 
you but behind this little area here
you'll<00:04:04.680> actually<00:04:04.829> see<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.190> bright<00:04:05.700> extinction

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
you'll actually see a bright extinction

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.870 
you'll actually see a bright extinction
egg<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:06.959> that<00:04:06.989> is<00:04:07.410> our<00:04:07.590> fourth<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.250> last<00:04:08.579> one

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
egg and that is our fourth and last one

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.360 
egg and that is our fourth and last one
so<00:04:09.150> when<00:04:09.299> you<00:04:09.419> do<00:04:09.599> shoot<00:04:09.900> this<00:04:10.049> it<00:04:10.739> produces

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
so when you do shoot this it produces

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.640 
so when you do shoot this it produces
something<00:04:11.549> very<00:04:12.239> very<00:04:12.540> cool<00:04:12.810> so<00:04:13.260> on<00:04:13.440> our

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
something very very cool so on our

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.979 
something very very cool so on our
screen<00:04:14.010> we<00:04:14.430> can<00:04:14.579> see<00:04:14.819> this<00:04:14.970> very<00:04:15.090> very<00:04:15.630> weird
