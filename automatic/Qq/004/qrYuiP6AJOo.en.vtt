00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.200
 It's not that hard, but if it's going to cost you 000 won, it's good and it's short. 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.700

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.880

 Why try to write down why I Hangul Hangul but hard to put down the milk 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:35.060

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.549
 Because 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.980
 And because it is not our country, of course it is difficult for us. 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:57.820
 Yeah. Yeah. I do not think you really need to pronounce it. 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.810
 For right ah 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:08.350
 But for example, than when I came before Wheesung's Love Letter 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:10.660
 I think a lot of it splashes it sounds, I pointed to where talking to convince examples 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:15.480
 I am afraid the seniors Te 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.480

 For the same year, so today there is now a lot of courage and a lot of nonsense word 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:56.910
 I have a lot of flaws and my son has a lot of muscles. 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:02.040
 I saw the jacket. 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:05.780
 I have become a fully rosy muscular man with a jacket opposite and my earth is king 2 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.780

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:15.780
 I am confident of where I am most. 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.239
 Da 4 to 5 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.970

 Ah, your heart is your best self. 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.640
 Here 's the deal here 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.470
 Oh, that tone that finally places the seniors who have workout to hear the word Yes 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.280
 I do not like muscle workouts. 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.780

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.220
 I do not like why 4 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.220
 Wisdom in foreign life 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.500
 Yes 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:00.410
 Oh, that's not good and cool so full and so they changed the appearance, feel 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.860
 Good hair style. 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:08.840
 Alas, I also got double eyelids and I've got to mix pre-condition 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:11.570
 I blame this on the homepage that I had a surgery on. 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.100
 You would not be the only one there on your own. 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:20.150
 This was so overworked that I then finished my treasure 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:25.430
 Then I close in more than 30 concerts a 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:30.110
 So while one eye gone from 4 emissions and so rather the snow 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:33.080
 It was like this when I poured it down. 5 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.860
 And many women who see this 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.470
 Four bumps lead to double eyelids. 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.310
 Leia 4 3g Do not 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:49.280
 Just geuraetneunde the foreign language you also think a lot of this music - as an external color 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:54.199
 At first it's not like that, it's a ballad-style R &amp; B music 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:59.360
 You've changed a lot and now I think another color so as Trouble 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:05:00.680
 If the case is now a ballad song, it's a bit like my rmd style 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.800
 Excluded 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:09.409
 If you like this song now it ahningeo increased tonk 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:14.930
 But the enemy does not know the feeling to say it once. 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:19.310
 If you can not do it now , change the ratio of Hee Sung c to your voice. 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.789
 I do not want to sing nine songs lately 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.020
 do 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.789
 Yes 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.789
 Um, that's fast. 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:35.610

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.610
 I love you . 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:48.160
 If you know a little bit of my mind why 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:55.660
 Bulmyeonseo more awkward'll know the past, uh, weeping just so no view 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:59.680
 Tende now , now my dollar is my yes, it is awkward, but the voice itself is easier 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.180
 I think it's something. I tried to pursue it myself. 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.949
 Okay 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:09.180
 If you know what that Whitesong knows , you can sing well but you can dance 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.180
 There are also two minutes in sight. 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:17.860
 So in today's world , 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:23.860
 We have a wonderful dance again 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:26.750
 Even when I was singing the first song of the song, 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.900
 That moment is the moment to stab 2 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:33.200
 Oh this is just like this 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:37.370
 It's two . It's almost like that. 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:40.430
 Oh, it sounds very good. Yes. 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:45.260
 For one, why continue to meet La deulyidaetda 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:46.220
 So, listening to the new song and then the next two Google songs, 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.980
 In the beginning 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.980
 Thank you. Yes.
