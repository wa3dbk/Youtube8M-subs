00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
watch the rest of it it did seem a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.779 
watch the rest of it it did seem a
little<00:00:57.809> like<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.710> were<00:00:58.890> either<00:00:59.039> overpowered

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
little like we were either overpowered

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.849 
little like we were either overpowered
or<00:01:00.030> he<00:01:00.180> was<00:01:00.300> under<00:01:00.539> leveled<00:01:00.960> because<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> lot<00:01:01.829> of

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
or he was under leveled because a lot of

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.380 
or he was under leveled because a lot of
us<00:01:02.039> were<00:01:02.160> doing<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.430> ton<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.670> damage<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.090> him

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
us were doing a ton of damage to him

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.719 
us were doing a ton of damage to him
which<00:01:04.049> probably<00:01:04.530> should<00:01:04.949> not<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> case<00:01:05.489> he

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
which probably should not be the case he

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.600
