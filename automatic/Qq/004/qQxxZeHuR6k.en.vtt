00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.680
 hi everyone knows that when the 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.830
 31st so here in the first 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.170
 unpacking videos about the 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.130
 playstation 4 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.100
 currently I'm going to introduce you all 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.420
 first the dualshock four versions 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.070
 red magna the playstation camera and 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.470
 killzone shadows fall so for 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.070
 start i'm going to do by the dualshock 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.570
 So I do not feel for the moment 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.480
 I you are oysters and click 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.110
 the other videos when they are 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.360
 so do the dualshock four years already 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.659
 here is a little packaging so it's up to 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.860
 time if the magma to red 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.540
 here they put in behind the 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.830
 specifications at the function level 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.909
 sharing the touchpad we proceed from 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.909
 Bunker unpacking 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.560
 so it's really complicated for a 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:44.350
 handle it's clear it'll be more 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.670
 complicated for the playstation 4 up so 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.780
 always delivered two women a little 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.300
 manual that nobody reads in general 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.990
 so here is the dualshock 4 controller so 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.690
 at the level of functionality already so 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.160
 the lice tic sticks were dug but 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.350
 it's not if you see it well but it 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.149
 now they are dug so we have 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.649
 the finger that likes it well and it does not 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.770
 slide more like before on the dualshock 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:12.510
 3 we still have the playstation button 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.520
 to return to the home there is a 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.200
 speaker that actually allows for 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.459
 give some noises for how 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.820
 you can I try nac in a space 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.400
 cultural leclerc and we heard the 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.890
 sounds of 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.049
 as soon as we say the noises that are 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.230
 at the character level so always 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.590
 the four believe keys came into play 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.420
 either the companies the option buttons 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.249
 that actually makes it a little bit the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.859
 menu the pause menu ie a 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:46.810
 influence options all options 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.840
 game settings etc 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.859
 the share button that I ask you 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.120
 will also find in another video 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.430
 with the playstation 4 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.739
 that's all that's sharing 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.709
 photos sharing videos and streaming 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.239
 live from your parties so I 'll do 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.099
 surely also streaming parts 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.299
 that is to say you can follow me 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.060
 directly doing the 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.609
 gameplay and live 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.840
 here is the touchpad then the pavement 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.239
 touch do not know if you're going 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.980
 to be able to see it 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.840
 here you see the small dots at 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.129
 on it and when you put your finger on it 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.090
 in one feels that it is a rubi chouïa years 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.250
 hank and the little dots when we 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.819
 scratch a little bit and you have to know 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.819
 that it is clickable 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:34.310
 he heard there clickable and so in fact 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:36.590
 it allows to 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.880
 than to say to validate certain actions 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:45.470
 and it's then at the level of the triggers 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:48.380
 so we look at a l2 r1 r2 and at level 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.390
 triggers 1 they are dug it's 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.220
 to say let our fingers for for 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.830
 shoot in the streets shooting eg 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.459
 where the car game the finger he goes he 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.519
 will stay in place 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.280
 he will not he will not slip how 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.120
 it was on the grant radio then 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.300
 behind 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.450
 good there is nothing special after at 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.430
 texture level where we can 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.140
 feel it's a bit rough 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.819
 while above it is all smooth 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.060
 so in fact the joystick is the theme 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.169
 well in hand and how to say ben 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.889
 Kenyan weyts even that she is not going us 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:25.400
 slip hands here and finally there is 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.690
 in front of a light terminal a small 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.970
 little like there is on the playstation move 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.370
 it's exactly the same thing that has allowed 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.889
 made of 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.810
 to recognize that they finally 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:38.199
 joystick and where through 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.560
 playstation camera here is finally here he 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:44.020
 there is a micro usb port for part for 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.430
 reload the controller and go 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.440
 is not the same as there is on the 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.510
 dualshock 3 of the playstation 3 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.520
 so it will take you another our cable 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.290
 which will be provided with the playstation 4 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.290
 so now I'm going to you 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.100
 show both joysticks side by side 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:02.290
 the story we saw a little bit 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:08.350
 difference so already there you do not have 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:11.860
 necessarily well see the dualshock 4 and 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.470
 a chouïa longer than the oc radio 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.449
 three monkeys blow there is a it is played at 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.100
 not much 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.449
 we will say that it is played half a 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.340
 centimeter 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.110
 the kick is played out to the crisis 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.020
 joke 3 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.940
 we feel that when to say that the hand she 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.960
 perfectly marry the forms of art 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.630
 of the joystick 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.789
 while on the dualshock 4 the hand 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.960
 encompasses well thanks to the curved part 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:39.010
 that there is the joystick below 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.110
 after that you are really well in hand 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.340
 when we are shooting by 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.580
 example together we are really 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:48.520
 in koala ah yes and I forgot to 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.229
 tell you one down there is then is this 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.650
 you will see there a socket 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:57.930
 jack to put water helmet by 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.930
 example is here 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.900
 thin already a hole I know more what 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.900
 I do not know what it is 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:13.370
 I do not know anymore I think I know 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.410
 remember from my favorite nonsense 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.780
 so I will say nothing but in any case you 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.760
 can put your speakers on for 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.889
 to have the sense of TV 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.750
 directly in your ears thanks to the 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:25.190
 handle in front of that you avoid that you 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.290
 will avoid having to a cable that goes 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.770
 hang out between your TV or console 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:33.740
 and and you the cable will be directly 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:36.440
 between the controller and your head 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:40.370
 so here I am going to stop there for this 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.919
 video if you want to see the videos of 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.889

 videos from the playstation camera and if

 killzone I invite you to click here
