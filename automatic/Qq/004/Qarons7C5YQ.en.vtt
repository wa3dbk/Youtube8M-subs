00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
to mushroom comes past the washer

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.530 
to mushroom comes past the washer
actually<00:04:01.200> starts<00:04:01.530> off<00:04:02.150> already<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.239> little<00:04:03.390> bit

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
actually starts off already a little bit

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.199 
actually starts off already a little bit
over<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.860> width<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.250> washer<00:04:05.549> or<00:04:05.790> exactly

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
over the width of the washer or exactly

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.270 
over the width of the washer or exactly
the<00:04:06.299> same<00:04:06.570> so<00:04:07.380> you<00:04:07.470> just<00:04:07.590> want<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:07.860> keep

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
the same so you just want to keep

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.400 
the same so you just want to keep
tightening<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:11.610> until<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:13.049> starts<00:04:13.350> to

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
tightening this until it starts to

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.470 
tightening this until it starts to
mushroom<00:04:13.799> a<00:04:13.829> little<00:04:14.100> bit<00:04:14.220> at<00:04:14.459> least<00:04:14.610> that's

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
mushroom a little bit at least that's

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.969 
mushroom a little bit at least that's
what<00:04:15.600> I've<00:04:15.720> gathered<00:04:16.109> from<00:04:16.290> what<00:04:16.650> I<00:04:16.680> was<00:04:16.890> able

to find information online you probably

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.140 
to find information online you probably
want<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.130> check<00:04:20.190> in<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.489> couple<00:04:20.760> weeks<00:04:20.850> just<00:04:21.030> to

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.860 
pressure that's being put on
but<00:04:27.280> his<00:04:27.400> rubber<00:04:27.580> bushings<00:04:27.999> on<00:04:28.150> I<00:04:28.419> don't<00:04:28.689> think

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
but his rubber bushings on I don't think

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.969 
but his rubber bushings on I don't think
would<00:04:28.960> be<00:04:29.080> even<00:04:29.349> possible<00:04:29.879> for<00:04:30.879> this<00:04:30.969> nut<00:04:31.449> to

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
would be even possible for this nut to

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.070 
would be even possible for this nut to
unwind<00:04:32.979> itself<00:04:33.270> so<00:04:34.270> I'll<00:04:34.419> see<00:04:34.659> you<00:04:34.689> guys<00:04:34.900> in<00:04:35.020> a

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
unwind itself so I'll see you guys in a

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.249 
unwind itself so I'll see you guys in a
bit

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
bit

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.790 
bit
another<00:04:35.979> thing<00:04:36.279> worth<00:04:36.610> mentioning<00:04:36.849> is<00:04:37.240> that

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
another thing worth mentioning is that

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.469 
another thing worth mentioning is that
more<00:04:38.800> than<00:04:38.979> likely<00:04:39.189> when<00:04:39.909> you<00:04:39.969> put<00:04:40.150> this<00:04:40.270> new

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
more than likely when you put this new

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.439 
more than likely when you put this new
shock<00:04:40.719> on<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.860> hole<00:04:42.039> in<00:04:42.219> the<00:04:42.310> shock<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:42.729> in

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
shock on the hole in the shock and in

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.320 
shock on the hole in the shock and in
your<00:04:43.599> suspension<00:04:44.550> and<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:45.669> arm<00:04:45.819> here<00:04:46.060> won't

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
your suspension and the arm here won't

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.059 
your suspension and the arm here won't
line<00:04:46.539> up<00:04:46.569> these<00:04:47.379> that's<00:04:47.590> what<00:04:47.740> happened<00:04:48.009> in

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 
line up these that's what happened in

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:50.760 
line up these that's what happened in
both<00:04:48.189> of<00:04:48.340> mine<00:04:49.289> basically<00:04:50.289> what<00:04:50.439> you<00:04:50.529> need<00:04:50.620> to

right at the top washer as you can see
and<00:05:56.050> just<00:05:56.289> came<00:05:56.469> right<00:05:56.620> out<00:05:56.729> was<00:05:57.729> no<00:05:57.879> point<00:05:58.120> is

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:01.719 
it was just rusted to a point where it

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:05.339 
it was just rusted to a point where it
wouldn't<00:06:01.870> budge<00:06:03.810> now<00:06:04.810> you<00:06:04.930> want<00:06:05.080> to<00:06:05.169> want<00:06:05.289> to

wouldn't budge now you want to want to

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:05.820 
wouldn't budge now you want to want to
measure

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
measure

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.889

once you're done I can see here this is

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:10.019 
once you're done I can see here this is
mushrooming<00:06:08.680> a<00:06:08.740> little<00:06:08.919> bit<00:06:09.039> coming<00:06:09.370> past<00:06:09.819> the

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:10.029 
mushrooming a little bit coming past the

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:12.119 
mushrooming a little bit coming past the
washer<00:06:10.870> but<00:06:11.080> you<00:06:11.349> might<00:06:11.529> want<00:06:11.710> to<00:06:11.770> measure<00:06:11.949> to

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129 
washer but you might want to measure to

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:13.709 
washer but you might want to measure to
make<00:06:12.310> sure<00:06:12.460> there's<00:06:12.639> enough<00:06:12.699> at<00:06:13.360> the<00:06:13.569> same

attached<00:06:21.270> in<00:06:22.270> your<00:06:23.229> bump<00:06:23.469> stop<00:06:23.740> I<00:06:24.149> think<00:06:25.149> the

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
attached in your bump stop I think the

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:30.320 
attached in your bump stop I think the
dealer<00:06:25.719> also<00:06:25.870> causes<00:06:26.319> auxiliary

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.140 

Zillah<00:06:31.199> II<00:06:31.340> can't<00:06:32.340> remember<00:06:32.430> the<00:06:32.849> name<00:06:33.000> they

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
Zillah II can't remember the name they

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.890 
Zillah II can't remember the name they
use<00:06:33.300> it<00:06:33.449> to<00:06:33.479> deal<00:06:33.689> I<00:06:33.720> want<00:06:33.900> to<00:06:34.050> purchase<00:06:34.379> them

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
use it to deal I want to purchase them

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.129 
use it to deal I want to purchase them
something<00:06:36.900> about<00:06:37.110> axillary<00:06:38.780> suspension<00:06:39.780> part

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
something about axillary suspension part

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.100 
something about axillary suspension part
or<00:06:40.349> I'm<00:06:40.889> not<00:06:41.099> sure<00:06:41.310> but<00:06:42.090> it's<00:06:42.210> a<00:06:42.389> progressive

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
or I'm not sure but it's a progressive

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.709 
or I'm not sure but it's a progressive
bump<00:06:43.439> stop<00:06:43.680> I<00:06:43.860> think<00:06:43.919> is<00:06:44.219> one<00:06:44.430> name<00:06:44.610> it<00:06:45.330> goes<00:06:45.479> by

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:45.719 
bump stop I think is one name it goes by

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:48.920 
bump stop I think is one name it goes by
and<00:06:46.650> it's<00:06:46.979> just<00:06:47.129> a<00:06:47.250> rubber<00:06:47.430> piece<00:06:48.060> that<00:06:48.389> stops

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
and it's just a rubber piece that stops

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.170 
and it's just a rubber piece that stops
the<00:06:49.080> car<00:06:49.289> from<00:06:49.469> bottoming<00:06:49.830> out<00:06:50.180> that's

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
the car from bottoming out that's

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.059 
the car from bottoming out that's
actually<00:06:51.270> when<00:06:51.629> you<00:06:51.750> put<00:06:51.990> the<00:06:52.229> tires<00:06:52.439> on<00:06:52.710> and<00:06:52.919> I

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:53.069 
actually when you put the tires on and I

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:54.920 
actually when you put the tires on and I
let<00:06:53.340> the<00:06:53.460> car<00:06:53.610> down<00:06:53.759> this<00:06:53.939> is<00:06:54.060> going<00:06:54.240> to<00:06:54.330> lay

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
let the car down this is going to lay

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.330 
let the car down this is going to lay
down<00:06:54.960> on<00:06:55.439> this<00:06:55.830> piece<00:06:56.039> here<00:06:56.310> rest<00:06:57.060> on<00:06:57.240> it<00:06:58.340> at

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
down on this piece here rest on it at

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.890 
down on this piece here rest on it at
least<00:06:59.460> in<00:06:59.580> the<00:06:59.669> h3<00:07:00.030> it<00:07:00.150> does<00:07:00.300> have<00:07:00.449> seen<00:07:00.629> my

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 
least in the h3 it does have seen my

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.420 
least in the h3 it does have seen my
neighbor's<00:07:01.199> truck<00:07:01.439> that's<00:07:01.830> actually<00:07:02.159> up<00:07:02.280> to

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430 
neighbor's truck that's actually up to

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.730 
neighbor's truck that's actually up to
higher<00:07:03.180> a<00:07:03.330> little<00:07:03.569> bit<00:07:03.690> past<00:07:03.870> it<00:07:04.110> so<00:07:04.530> I<00:07:04.560> guess

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
higher a little bit past it so I guess

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.899 
higher a little bit past it so I guess
it<00:07:04.860> depends<00:07:05.099> on<00:07:05.190> the<00:07:05.340> car<00:07:07.159> and<00:07:08.159> this<00:07:08.580> is<00:07:08.729> pretty

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:08.909 
it depends on the car and this is pretty

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:10.700 
it depends on the car and this is pretty
much<00:07:09.000> it<00:07:09.150> I'm<00:07:09.419> gonna<00:07:09.569> put<00:07:10.050> the<00:07:10.139> wheels<00:07:10.319> back<00:07:10.379> on

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:10.710 
much it I'm gonna put the wheels back on

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.450 
much it I'm gonna put the wheels back on
and<00:07:10.949> I'm<00:07:11.159> done<00:07:11.370> I<00:07:11.400> mean<00:07:11.699> the<00:07:11.940> whole<00:07:12.060> job<00:07:13.460> on

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 
and I'm done I mean the whole job on

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.059 
and I'm done I mean the whole job on
this<00:07:14.520> car<00:07:14.580> both<00:07:15.569> sides<00:07:15.979> shouldn't<00:07:16.979> really

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:17.069 
this car both sides shouldn't really

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:18.770 
this car both sides shouldn't really
take<00:07:17.250> more<00:07:17.460> than<00:07:17.550> two<00:07:17.729> hours<00:07:18.030> I<00:07:18.240> think<00:07:18.479> if

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 
take more than two hours I think if

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.390 
take more than two hours I think if
you're<00:07:18.960> doing<00:07:19.050> it<00:07:19.259> together<00:07:19.379> maybe<00:07:20.129> a<00:07:20.250> little

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 
you're doing it together maybe a little

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.300 
you're doing it together maybe a little
bit<00:07:20.550> more<00:07:21.440> try<00:07:22.440> to<00:07:22.500> do<00:07:22.680> a<00:07:22.710> video<00:07:22.889> on<00:07:23.039> the<00:07:23.190> rear

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310 
bit more try to do a video on the rear

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.309 
bit more try to do a video on the rear
shocks<00:07:23.610> when<00:07:23.759> I<00:07:23.849> do<00:07:23.909> them<00:07:24.180> in<00:07:24.750> the<00:07:24.810> next<00:07:25.020> couple

shocks when I do them in the next couple

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:26.749 
shocks when I do them in the next couple
of<00:07:25.349> weeks<00:07:25.409> I<00:07:25.860> haven't<00:07:26.069> purchased<00:07:26.310> them<00:07:26.580> yet
