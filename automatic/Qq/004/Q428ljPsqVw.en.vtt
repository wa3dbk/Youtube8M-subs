from<00:00:02.070> this<00:00:02.310> diagram<00:00:02.639> we<00:00:03.210> are<00:00:03.240> going<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.720> learn

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:04.430 
from this diagram we are going to learn

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.900 
from this diagram we are going to learn
how

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
how

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.400 
how
basically<00:00:06.750> an<00:00:07.069> automobile<00:00:08.069> engine<00:00:08.460> works

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
basically an automobile engine works

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.890 
basically an automobile engine works
this<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:11.690> cylinder<00:00:13.610> this<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.670> basically<00:00:15.450> one

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
this is a cylinder this is basically one

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.099 
this is a cylinder this is basically one
cylinder<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:17.100> have<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.750> these

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
cylinder that we have and this is these

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.870 
cylinder that we have and this is these
are<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> walls<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.070> cylinder<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.580> this

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
are the walls of this cylinder and this

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.240 
are the walls of this cylinder and this
is<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.210> piston<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:22.050> have<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.769> this

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
is the piston that we have and this

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.870 
is the piston that we have and this
piston<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.820> what<00:00:24.119> moves<00:00:24.449> up<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.170> down<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:26.010> we

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
piston is what moves up and down and we

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.589 
piston is what moves up and down and we
have<00:00:27.119> two<00:00:27.420> inlets<00:00:27.710> one<00:00:28.710> inlet<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.300> for<00:00:30.300> fuel

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
have two inlets one inlet is for fuel

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.770 
have two inlets one inlet is for fuel

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
and ox and air to come in a mixture and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.590 
and ox and air to come in a mixture and
this<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> valve<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.370> opens<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.360> closes

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
this is a valve that opens and closes

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.240 
this is a valve that opens and closes
and<00:00:37.079> there<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.890> another<00:00:38.129> outlet<00:00:39.030> here<00:00:39.480> that

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
and there is another outlet here that

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.220 
and there is another outlet here that
takes<00:00:41.250> out<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.850> exhaust<00:00:42.239> gasses<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.079> there

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
takes out the exhaust gasses and there

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.470 
takes out the exhaust gasses and there
is<00:00:43.320> another<00:00:43.680> valve<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.670> opens<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.270> closes

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
is another valve that opens and closes

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.049 
is another valve that opens and closes
at<00:00:45.780> appropriate<00:00:46.110> times<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.070> when<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> fuel

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
at appropriate times and when the fuel

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.779 
at appropriate times and when the fuel
and<00:00:48.239> air<00:00:48.360> mixture<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.930> inside<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:50.340> spark

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
and air mixture is inside this spark

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.139 
and air mixture is inside this spark
plug<00:00:50.879> provides<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:52.140> spark<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:53.100> ignite<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
plug provides a spark to ignite the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.010 
plug provides a spark to ignite the
mixture<00:00:54.469> now<00:00:55.469> let's<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.010> sequence<00:00:56.550> what

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
mixture now let's see in sequence what

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.560 
mixture now let's see in sequence what
happens<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.559> cylinder<00:00:59.100> this<00:01:00.000> piston

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
happens in this cylinder this piston

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.110 
happens in this cylinder this piston
basically<00:01:01.109> moves<00:01:01.350> up<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.920> down<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> first

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
basically moves up and down so the first

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.870 
basically moves up and down so the first
step<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.680> bring<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.159> fuel<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.670> oxidizer

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
step is to bring the fuel and oxidizer

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.070 
step is to bring the fuel and oxidizer
or<00:01:06.720> air<00:01:07.080> inside<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:07.979> mixture<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.540> valve

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
or air inside the mixture so this valve

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.100 
or air inside the mixture so this valve
opens<00:01:10.409> up<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.880> valve<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.360> course<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.780> closed

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
opens up this valve of course is closed

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.550 
opens up this valve of course is closed
and<00:01:13.549> this<00:01:14.549> fuel<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.270> air<00:01:15.450> mixture<00:01:15.630> comes<00:01:16.200> in

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
and this fuel and air mixture comes in

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.090 
and this fuel and air mixture comes in
as<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.580> push<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.659> piston<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.320> pushed

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
as the push as this piston is pushed

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.810 
as the push as this piston is pushed
down<00:01:20.479> this<00:01:21.479> acts<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.409> syringe<00:01:23.159> medical

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
down this acts like a syringe medical

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.950 
down this acts like a syringe medical
syringe<00:01:24.240> when<00:01:24.840> we<00:01:25.110> push<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.710> down<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:27.060> fuel

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
syringe when we push this down the fuel

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.080 
syringe when we push this down the fuel
and<00:01:28.140> air<00:01:28.320> mixture<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.920> basically<00:01:29.369> sucked<00:01:29.790> in

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and air mixture is basically sucked in

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.440 
and air mixture is basically sucked in
and<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.930> fills<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.650> entire<00:01:32.280> wall<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.240> as

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
and it fills up this entire wall you as

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.969 
and it fills up this entire wall you as
this<00:01:33.810> piston<00:01:34.200> comes<00:01:34.470> down<00:01:35.720> that<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.650> first

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
this piston comes down that is the first

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.700 
this piston comes down that is the first
step<00:01:38.549> or<00:01:38.790> stroke<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> four<00:01:40.380> stroke

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
step or stroke this is a four stroke

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.710 
step or stroke this is a four stroke
engine<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.369> are<00:01:41.430> talking<00:01:41.790> about<00:01:42.000> first

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
engine that we are talking about first

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.960 
engine that we are talking about first
stroke<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.880> intake<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:47.070> second<00:01:47.520> stroke

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
stroke is intake and the second stroke

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.190 
stroke is intake and the second stroke
now<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:49.470> second<00:01:49.890> step<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.549> we<00:01:51.390> close<00:01:51.659> both<00:01:51.990> of

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
now the second step is we close both of

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.550 
now the second step is we close both of
these<00:01:52.380> valves<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.479> push<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.750> mixture<00:01:55.320> this

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
these valves and push this mixture this

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.580 
these valves and push this mixture this
mixture<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.460> again<00:01:57.060> by<00:01:57.570> pushing<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.200> piston

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
mixture is again by pushing the piston

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.810 
mixture is again by pushing the piston
up<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:59.579> mixture<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.689> here<00:02:01.229> is

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
up this mixture that is in here is

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.660 
up this mixture that is in here is
compressed<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.979> compressed<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.159> very<00:02:05.430> high

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
compressed is compressed to very high

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.589 
compressed is compressed to very high
pressures<00:02:06.500> roughly<00:02:07.500> about<00:02:07.640> eight<00:02:08.640> times<00:02:09.119> to

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
pressures roughly about eight times to

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.850 
pressures roughly about eight times to
nine<00:02:09.840> times

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
nine times

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.910 
nine times
and<00:02:11.070> this<00:02:11.610> piston<00:02:12.030> moves<00:02:12.300> back<00:02:12.630> up<00:02:12.870> here<00:02:13.470> and

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
and this piston moves back up here and

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.240 
and this piston moves back up here and
again<00:02:14.220> we<00:02:14.520> have<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:15.230> spend<00:02:16.230> energy<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.980> move

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
again we have to spend energy to move

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.030 
again we have to spend energy to move
this<00:02:17.580> piston<00:02:18.090> up<00:02:18.270> or<00:02:18.630> compress<00:02:19.350> this<00:02:19.620> mixture

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
this piston up or compress this mixture

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.690 
this piston up or compress this mixture
here<00:02:20.960> when<00:02:21.960> this<00:02:22.200> mixture<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.800> compressed<00:02:23.460> to

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
here when this mixture is compressed to

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.370 
here when this mixture is compressed to
the<00:02:23.910> rococo<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.690> predetermined

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
pressures at that time the spark plug

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.450 
pressures at that time the spark plug
ignites<00:02:29.480> this<00:02:30.480> mixture<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.350> this<00:02:32.040> flame

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
ignites this mixture and this flame

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.230 
ignites this mixture and this flame
front<00:02:32.960> travels<00:02:33.960> all<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.740> way<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.280> burns<00:02:35.880> all

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
front travels all the way and burns all

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.780 
front travels all the way and burns all
this<00:02:36.570> fuel<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.710> fuel<00:02:38.010> reaches<00:02:38.490> really

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
this fuel and this fuel reaches really

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.790 
this fuel and this fuel reaches really
high<00:02:38.970> temperatures<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:40.140> pushes<00:02:40.620> the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
high temperatures and it pushes the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.020 
high temperatures and it pushes the
piston<00:02:41.010> all<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.910> way<00:02:42.030> down<00:02:42.360> all<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.050> way<00:02:43.650> down

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
piston all the way down all the way down

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.300 
piston all the way down all the way down
so<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:45.210> is<00:02:45.450> actually<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.380> power<00:02:46.680> stroke<00:02:47.100> the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
so this is actually the power stroke the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.270 
so this is actually the power stroke the
first<00:02:47.580> stroke<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.090> intake<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.500> second<00:02:49.920> stroke

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
first stroke is intake the second stroke

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:59.510 
first stroke is intake the second stroke
is<00:02:51.140> compression<00:02:55.370> compression<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:59.220> third

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
is compression compression and the third

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.130 
is compression compression and the third
stroke<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:01.440> power<00:03:01.860> stroke<00:03:02.570> that<00:03:03.570> is<00:03:03.900> the

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
stroke is the power stroke that is the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.240 
stroke is the power stroke that is the
stroke<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.890> gives<00:03:05.250> us<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:06.510> power<00:03:07.040> from<00:03:08.040> this

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
stroke that gives us the power from this

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.630 
stroke that gives us the power from this
engine<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.620> first<00:03:10.890> stroke<00:03:11.370> in<00:03:11.550> the

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
engine and the first stroke in the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.970 
engine and the first stroke in the
second<00:03:12.000> stroke<00:03:12.270> we<00:03:12.930> have<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.500> supply<00:03:13.830> the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
second stroke we have to supply the

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.410 
second stroke we have to supply the
energy<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:15.209> is<00:03:15.450> required<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.940> bring<00:03:18.180> in

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
energy that is required to to bring in

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.050 
energy that is required to to bring in
the<00:03:18.600> oxidizer<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.800> fuel<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.610> also<00:03:20.820> to

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
the oxidizer and fuel and also to

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.090 
the oxidizer and fuel and also to
compress<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:22.650> after<00:03:23.220> this<00:03:23.780> after<00:03:24.780> this

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
compress and after this after this

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.910

down<00:03:29.660> this<00:03:30.660> valve<00:03:31.019> this<00:03:31.350> exhaust<00:03:31.860> valve<00:03:32.250> will

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
down this valve this exhaust valve will

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.630 
down this valve this exhaust valve will
open<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:33.230> of<00:03:34.230> course<00:03:34.530> this<00:03:34.830> valve<00:03:35.100> is<00:03:35.340> still

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
open and of course this valve is still

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.960 
open and of course this valve is still
closed<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.900> put<00:03:37.170> piston<00:03:37.739> again<00:03:38.070> moves

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
closed and the put piston again moves

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.470 
closed and the put piston again moves
back<00:03:39.360> up<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:40.170> which<00:03:40.980> for<00:03:41.700> which<00:03:41.850> we<00:03:42.060> have<00:03:42.330> to

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
back up and which for which we have to

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.920 
back up and which for which we have to
supply<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.900> power<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.730> all<00:03:44.730> these<00:03:45.090> gases<00:03:45.720> go

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
supply the power and all these gases go

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.370 
supply the power and all these gases go
out<00:03:46.140> through<00:03:46.500> this<00:03:46.650> exhaust<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:48.170> once<00:03:49.170> the

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
out through this exhaust and once the

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.220 
out through this exhaust and once the
exhaust<00:03:49.800> gases<00:03:50.280> around<00:03:50.430> this<00:03:51.000> cylinder<00:03:51.810> close

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
exhaust gases around this cylinder close

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.100 
exhaust gases around this cylinder close
this<00:03:52.590> valve<00:03:52.920> closes<00:03:53.519> again<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:54.120> this<00:03:54.870> valve

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
this valve closes again and this valve

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.530 
this valve closes again and this valve
opens<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.830> entire<00:03:56.220> cycle<00:03:56.640> again<00:03:57.120> repeats

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
opens and the entire cycle again repeats

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.800 
opens and the entire cycle again repeats
so<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.230> fourth<00:03:58.530> stroke<00:03:59.070> is<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.940> exhaust

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
so the fourth stroke is the exhaust

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.850 
so the fourth stroke is the exhaust
stroke<00:04:03.290> so<00:04:04.290> this<00:04:04.470> is<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.680> force<00:04:05.570> basically

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
stroke so this is a force basically

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.930 
stroke so this is a force basically
four-stroke<00:04:07.860> engine<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.489> we<00:04:08.610> are<00:04:08.700> talking

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
four-stroke engine that we are talking

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.360 
four-stroke engine that we are talking
about<00:04:09.239> we<00:04:09.989> need<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.320> know<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.620> four<00:04:10.890> strokes

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
about we need to know the four strokes

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.710 
about we need to know the four strokes
and<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:12.150> important<00:04:12.720> components<00:04:13.500> of<00:04:13.590> this<00:04:14.720> of

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
and the important components of this of

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.390 
and the important components of this of
this<00:04:16.410> engine<00:04:17.340> cylinder<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:19.200> there<00:04:19.560> generally

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
this engine cylinder and there generally

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.360 
this engine cylinder and there generally
will<00:04:20.609> be<00:04:21.620> multiple<00:04:22.620> cylinders

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
will be multiple cylinders

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.210 
will be multiple cylinders
talk<00:04:23.669> about<00:04:23.850> one<00:04:24.270> here<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:24.900> it<00:04:25.620> could<00:04:25.770> be<00:04:25.949> for

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
talk about one here and it could be for

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.920 
talk about one here and it could be for
there<00:04:26.550> could<00:04:26.699> be<00:04:26.820> six<00:04:27.180> there<00:04:27.419> could<00:04:27.570> be<00:04:27.600> eight

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
there could be six there could be eight

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.550 
there could be six there could be eight
or<00:04:28.260> even<00:04:28.949> 10<00:04:29.310> or<00:04:29.340> even<00:04:29.520> 12<00:04:30.030> sometimes<00:04:30.720> so<00:04:31.380> as

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
or even 10 or even 12 sometimes so as

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.590 
or even 10 or even 12 sometimes so as
the<00:04:31.770> engine<00:04:32.100> becomes<00:04:32.400> bigger<00:04:32.699> and<00:04:32.970> bigger<00:04:33.240> you

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
the engine becomes bigger and bigger you

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.159 
the engine becomes bigger and bigger you
have<00:04:33.840> more<00:04:34.229> cylinders<00:04:34.889> and<00:04:35.630> that<00:04:36.630> gives<00:04:36.930> us

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
have more cylinders and that gives us

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.800 
have more cylinders and that gives us
more<00:04:37.470> power
