00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
drops so that's just fine and dandy but

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.399 
drops so that's just fine and dandy but
i<00:01:57.390> can<00:01:57.570> still<00:01:57.689> threaten<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.380> a

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
i can still threaten it with a

i can still threaten it with a
thunderbolt<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.070> don't<00:01:59.310> think<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.610> thing

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
thunderbolt I don't think that thing

thunderbolt I don't think that thing
wants<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.180> stay<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.719> take<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.920> I'm<00:02:02.250> just

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
wants to stay in and take it so I'm just

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.840 
wants to stay in and take it so I'm just
gonna<00:02:02.640> Thunderbolt<00:02:03.630> anyway<00:02:04.020> because<00:02:04.790> I'd<00:02:05.790> oh

time<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.530> feel<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.099> damage<00:02:11.580> was<00:02:11.790> more<00:02:12.120> useful

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
and then the off chance he did stay in I

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.800 
and then the off chance he did stay in I
didn't<00:02:15.920> want<00:02:16.130> my<00:02:16.310> aptos<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.120> go<00:02:17.240> down<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.510> a

I<00:02:20.510> just<00:02:21.410> decided<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.920> Thunderbolt<00:02:22.340> I

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
stealth rock is on the field and it

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.160 
stealth rock is on the field and it
obviously<00:02:36.920> takes<00:02:37.280> outs<00:02:37.640> Carm<00:02:37.970> but<00:02:38.810> Fire<00:02:39.020> Blast

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
obviously takes outs Carm but Fire Blast

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.260 
obviously takes outs Carm but Fire Blast
also<00:02:39.620> did<00:02:39.770> a<00:02:39.800> decent<00:02:40.160> amount<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.610> Flygon<00:02:41.210> I

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
also did a decent amount to a Flygon I

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.820 
also did a decent amount to a Flygon I
think<00:02:41.540> that's<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.750> two<00:02:41.900> at<00:02:42.020> ko<00:02:42.200> with<00:02:42.560> stealth

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
think that's a two at ko with stealth

think that's a two at ko with stealth
rock<00:02:43.330> but<00:02:44.330> I<00:02:44.510> decided<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.020> go<00:02:45.110> for<00:02:45.260> hidden

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
rock but I decided to go for hidden

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.500 
rock but I decided to go for hidden
power<00:02:45.620> ice<00:02:45.890> here<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:46.640> off<00:02:46.790> chance<00:02:46.820> he

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
power ice here and the off chance he

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.780 
power ice here and the off chance he
used<00:02:47.720> like<00:02:48.020> Thunder<00:02:48.800> punch<00:02:48.980> or<00:02:49.250> something<00:02:49.610> I

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
used like Thunder punch or something I

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.620 
used like Thunder punch or something I
don't<00:02:49.850> know<00:02:50.090> but<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.930> just<00:02:51.020> decided<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.830> go<00:02:51.980> from

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630

don't know but I just decided to go from
hidden<00:02:53.630> power<00:02:53.840> ice<00:02:54.020> there<00:02:54.290> but<00:02:54.730> now<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:55.760> got

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
hidden power ice there but now I got

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.030 
hidden power ice there but now I got
paralyzed<00:02:56.660> when<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:56.930> use<00:02:57.050> Thunderbolt<00:02:57.740> I<00:02:57.860> mean

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
paralyzed when I use Thunderbolt I mean

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.390 
paralyzed when I use Thunderbolt I mean
he<00:02:58.100> used<00:02:58.220> toxic<00:02:58.580> so<00:02:59.710> that<00:03:00.710> kind<00:03:00.890> of<00:03:00.950> pisses<00:03:01.130> me

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
he used toxic so that kind of pisses me

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.810 
he used toxic so that kind of pisses me
off<00:03:01.430> but<00:03:01.730> at<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:01.970> same<00:03:02.180> time<00:03:02.950> its<00:03:03.950> parallax<00:03:04.550> I

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
off but at the same time its parallax I

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.220 
off but at the same time its parallax I
can't<00:03:05.060> really<00:03:05.240> control<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:05.870> I'm<00:03:05.930> not<00:03:06.050> going

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
can't really control it so I'm not going

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.730 
can't really control it so I'm not going
to<00:03:06.290> beat<00:03:06.500> myself<00:03:06.530> up<00:03:07.070> over<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.700> now<00:03:08.600> I<00:03:08.930> go

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
to beat myself up over it and now I go

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.890 
to beat myself up over it and now I go
into<00:03:09.980> gengar<00:03:10.430> I<00:03:10.460> think<00:03:10.790> here<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.210> revenge<00:03:11.570> kill

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
into gengar I think here to revenge kill

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.170 
into gengar I think here to revenge kill
with<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.290> choice<00:03:12.950> spec<00:03:13.280> Shadow<00:03:13.640> Ball<00:03:13.910> I'm

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
with a choice spec Shadow Ball I'm

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.970 
with a choice spec Shadow Ball I'm
guessing<00:03:14.990> he<00:03:15.200> thought<00:03:15.410> I<00:03:15.440> was<00:03:15.530> going<00:03:15.770> to<00:03:15.830> do

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
guessing he thought I was going to do

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.000 
guessing he thought I was going to do
something<00:03:16.010> like<00:03:16.460> trick<00:03:16.910> or<00:03:17.620> another<00:03:18.620> move<00:03:18.860> of

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
something like trick or another move of

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.330 
something like trick or another move of
that<00:03:19.220> sort<00:03:19.900> but<00:03:20.900> i<00:03:20.930> just<00:03:21.680> wanted<00:03:21.890> to<00:03:21.950> go<00:03:22.070> for

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
that sort but i just wanted to go for

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.070 
that sort but i just wanted to go for
the<00:03:22.430> kill<00:03:22.670> at<00:03:23.060> this<00:03:23.180> point<00:03:23.420> i<00:03:23.630> didn't<00:03:23.840> have<00:03:23.930> any

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080

the kill at this point i didn't have any
many<00:03:24.470> other<00:03:24.680> options<00:03:24.950> because<00:03:25.880> i<00:03:26.120> needed<00:03:26.330> to

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
many other options because i needed to

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.840 
many other options because i needed to
get<00:03:26.690> some<00:03:26.990> offensive<00:03:27.980> momentum<00:03:28.430> going<00:03:28.580> for

claw like it's basically nothing I mean
it<00:03:34.910> didn't<00:03:35.240> do<00:03:35.300> too<00:03:35.330> much<00:03:35.540> damage<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:36.560> I'm

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
it didn't do too much damage and I'm

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.160 
it didn't do too much damage and I'm
going<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.340> use<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.640> as<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.790> quote-unquote<00:03:38.630> pivot

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
going to use it as a quote-unquote pivot

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.340 
going to use it as a quote-unquote pivot
switch<00:03:40.540> it's<00:03:41.540> basically<00:03:41.870> when<00:03:42.080> you<00:03:42.110> use<00:03:42.320> a

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
switch it's basically when you use a

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.350 
switch it's basically when you use a
Pokemon<00:03:42.890> to<00:03:43.340> take<00:03:43.520> a<00:03:43.550> hit<00:03:43.820> and<00:03:44.000> then<00:03:44.060> switch

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
Pokemon to take a hit and then switch

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.699 
Pokemon to take a hit and then switch
into<00:03:44.600> something<00:03:45.020> that<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.290> know<00:03:45.410> is<00:03:45.440> going<00:03:45.590> to

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
into something that you know is going to

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.920 
into something that you know is going to
take<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.100> predicted<00:03:46.610> move<00:03:46.850> that<00:03:47.780> your

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
take the predicted move that your

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.830 
take the predicted move that your
opponent<00:03:48.080> uses<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:49.240> indeed<00:03:50.240> seismic<00:03:50.690> toss

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
opponent uses and indeed seismic toss

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.420 
opponent uses and indeed seismic toss
does<00:03:51.140> nothing<00:03:51.560> because<00:03:51.709> gengar<00:03:52.310> is<00:03:52.370> a

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
does nothing because gengar is a

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.420 
does nothing because gengar is a
ghost-type<00:03:52.880> and<00:03:53.180> et<00:03:53.660> waves<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:54.170> was<00:03:55.070> kind<00:03:55.340> of

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
ghost-type and et waves I was kind of

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.890 
ghost-type and et waves I was kind of
hoping<00:03:55.490> he<00:03:55.790> would<00:03:55.910> use<00:03:56.060> stealth<00:03:56.300> rock<00:03:56.600> there

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
hoping he would use stealth rock there

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.290 
hoping he would use stealth rock there
but<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:57.500> mean<00:03:58.130> I<00:03:58.190> got<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.400> tricked<00:03:58.850> which<00:03:59.150> is

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
but I mean I got a tricked which is

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.360 
but I mean I got a tricked which is
really<00:03:59.480> what<00:03:59.630> I<00:03:59.690> wanted<00:04:00.080> to<00:04:00.140> do<00:04:00.380> when<00:04:01.100> I<00:04:01.160> saw

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
really what I wanted to do when I saw

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.130 
really what I wanted to do when I saw
registeel<00:04:01.850> I<00:04:01.880> knew<00:04:02.180> I<00:04:02.209> wanted<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.660> trick<00:04:02.930> that

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
registeel I knew I wanted to trick that

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.860 
registeel I knew I wanted to trick that
thing<00:04:03.350> and<00:04:03.610> ambipom<00:04:04.610> comes<00:04:05.030> in<00:04:05.180> i<00:04:05.330> predicted

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
thing and ambipom comes in i predicted

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.050 
thing and ambipom comes in i predicted
that<00:04:06.290> or<00:04:06.650> i<00:04:06.709> just<00:04:07.070> wanted<00:04:07.280> to<00:04:07.340> get<00:04:07.430> damaged<00:04:07.850> on

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
that or i just wanted to get damaged on

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.930 
that or i just wanted to get damaged on
registeel<00:04:08.630> and<00:04:08.780> i<00:04:08.810> use<00:04:08.930> focus<00:04:09.200> blast<00:04:09.560> and<00:04:10.010> I

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
registeel and i use focus blast and I

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.030 
registeel and i use focus blast and I
actually<00:04:11.120> hit<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:11.600> I<00:04:11.690> was<00:04:11.840> highly<00:04:12.440> surprised<00:04:12.830> i

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
actually hit it I was highly surprised i

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.780 
actually hit it I was highly surprised i
hit<00:04:13.220> through<00:04:13.459> paralysis<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:14.270> the<00:04:14.750> fact<00:04:14.989> that

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
hit through paralysis and the fact that

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.030 
hit through paralysis and the fact that
what<00:04:16.790> you<00:04:16.910> call<00:04:17.180> it<00:04:17.209> is<00:04:17.480> only<00:04:17.750> 70<00:04:18.380> accuracy

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
what you call it is only 70 accuracy

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.240 
what you call it is only 70 accuracy
focus<00:04:19.400> blast<00:04:19.609> and<00:04:20.000> now<00:04:20.200> night<00:04:21.200> /<00:04:21.560> is<00:04:21.799> obviously

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
focus blast and now night / is obviously

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.310 
focus blast and now night / is obviously
going<00:04:22.430> to<00:04:22.490> take<00:04:22.669> me<00:04:22.820> out<00:04:22.850> I<00:04:23.240> knew<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:24.110> was

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
going to take me out I knew it was

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.740 
going to take me out I knew it was
coming<00:04:24.650> but

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
coming but

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.990 
coming but
sometimes<00:04:26.140> heracross<00:04:26.620> carries<00:04:26.950> pursuit<00:04:27.370> so<00:04:27.970> I

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
sometimes heracross carries pursuit so I

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.730 
sometimes heracross carries pursuit so I
felt<00:04:28.330> switching<00:04:28.750> out<00:04:28.900> was<00:04:29.140> just<00:04:29.170> not<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.530> good

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
felt switching out was just not a good

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.640 
felt switching out was just not a good
option<00:04:29.800> so<00:04:30.550> I<00:04:30.580> decided<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.120> stay<00:04:31.330> in<00:04:31.360> I<00:04:31.780> was<00:04:32.440> my

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
option so I decided to stay in I was my

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.200 
option so I decided to stay in I was my
gang<00:04:32.830> guard<00:04:33.070> but<00:04:33.220> it<00:04:33.280> was<00:04:33.400> paralyzed<00:04:33.850> anyway

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
gang guard but it was paralyzed anyway

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.780 
gang guard but it was paralyzed anyway
so<00:04:34.270> whatever<00:04:34.780> and<00:04:35.200> I<00:04:35.560> stone<00:04:35.830> edge<00:04:36.010> here<00:04:36.220> hoping

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
so whatever and I stone edge here hoping

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.670 
so whatever and I stone edge here hoping
I<00:04:36.940> can<00:04:37.000> take<00:04:37.300> it<00:04:37.450> out<00:04:37.600> because<00:04:38.110> I<00:04:38.350> am<00:04:38.440> life

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
I can take it out because I am life

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.880 
I can take it out because I am life
formed<00:04:39.070> but<00:04:39.550> it<00:04:40.300> lives<00:04:40.660> probably<00:04:41.410> with<00:04:41.590> around

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
formed but it lives probably with around

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.450 
formed but it lives probably with around
10<00:04:42.220> 20<00:04:43.120> HP<00:04:43.450> and<00:04:44.290> takes<00:04:44.890> me<00:04:45.040> all<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.250> close

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
10 20 HP and takes me all the close

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.030 
10 20 HP and takes me all the close
combat<00:04:45.760> so<00:04:46.330> I'm<00:04:46.900> at<00:04:47.170> least<00:04:47.410> I<00:04:47.530> got<00:04:47.650> rid<00:04:47.800> of<00:04:47.830> hair

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
combat so I'm at least I got rid of hair

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.040 
combat so I'm at least I got rid of hair
cross<00:04:48.340> who<00:04:48.580> I<00:04:48.610> know<00:04:48.850> could<00:04:49.450> tear<00:04:49.690> through<00:04:49.930> my

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
cross who I know could tear through my

team other than maybe 10 accrual who I

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.050 
team other than maybe 10 accrual who I
should<00:04:52.000> probably<00:04:52.360> should<00:04:52.810> have<00:04:52.900> gone<00:04:53.110> out<00:04:53.350> to

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
should probably should have gone out to

expect<00:06:04.390> to<00:06:04.419> win<00:06:04.510> at<00:06:04.720> this<00:06:04.840> point<00:06:05.110> so<00:06:05.350> anything

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
expect to win at this point so anything

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.159 
expect to win at this point so anything
I<00:06:06.130> would<00:06:06.640> take<00:06:06.820> anything<00:06:07.120> but<00:06:07.450> he<00:06:07.630> flinches<00:06:07.990> me

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
I expected that as well because sixty

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.409 
I expected that as well because sixty
percent<00:06:10.810> flinched<00:06:11.440> chance<00:06:11.820> is<00:06:12.820> generally

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
percent flinched chance is generally

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.260 
percent flinched chance is generally
higher<00:06:13.870> than<00:06:14.380> seventy<00:06:15.010> percent<00:06:15.160> accuracy<00:06:15.910> in

higher than seventy percent accuracy in

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.420 
higher than seventy percent accuracy in
the<00:06:16.660> case<00:06:16.840> of<00:06:16.870> comparing<00:06:17.590> focus<00:06:18.010> blast<00:06:18.190> and

the case of comparing focus blast and
air<00:06:18.550> /<00:06:18.900> usually<00:06:19.900> you're<00:06:20.080> going<00:06:20.229> to<00:06:20.290> see

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
air / usually you're going to see

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.870 
air / usually you're going to see
yourself<00:06:20.800> getting<00:06:20.890> flinched<00:06:21.400> more<00:06:21.610> than<00:06:21.850> a

yourself getting flinched more than a

yourself getting flinched more than a
focus<00:06:22.270> blast<00:06:22.450> will<00:06:22.690> go<00:06:22.840> off<00:06:23.080> like<00:06:23.440> that<00:06:23.919> Anna

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
focus blast will go off like that Anna
