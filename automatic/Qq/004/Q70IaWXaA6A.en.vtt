guys attaching the plastic guys into it

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.499 
guys attaching the plastic guys into it
to<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.570> fly<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:10.170> have<00:00:11.070> this<00:00:11.340> nice<00:00:11.820> little<00:00:11.849> head

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
to the fly I have this nice little head

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.400 
to the fly I have this nice little head
that<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:13.080> demonstrate<00:00:13.620> out<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.130> pack<00:00:15.410> the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
that I demonstrate out to pack the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:24.410 
that I demonstrate out to pack the
fibers<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.250> I'm<00:00:18.240> gonna<00:00:18.449> use<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:22.850> and<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.150> show

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
fibers so I'm gonna use this and to show

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.040 
fibers so I'm gonna use this and to show
you<00:00:24.480> how<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:25.170> do<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:26.510> you'll<00:00:27.510> see<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:27.990> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
you how to do that you'll see it's a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.859 
you how to do that you'll see it's a
very<00:00:28.080> simple<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.480> what<00:00:30.480> you're<00:00:30.599> going<00:00:30.750> to

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
very simple and what you're going to

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.690 
very simple and what you're going to
need<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.380> pretty<00:00:31.800> much<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:33.110> decolorize<00:00:34.110> tool

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
need it pretty much is a decolorize tool

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.750 
need it pretty much is a decolorize tool
because<00:00:35.700> if<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.030> needed<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.450> burn<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:38.579> make

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
because if we needed to burn and make

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.700 
because if we needed to burn and make
room<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.510> eyes<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.170> have<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.440> create<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
room for the eyes so we have to create a

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.310 
room for the eyes so we have to create a
little<00:00:41.010> socket<00:00:41.250> over<00:00:41.489> there<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.690> if<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.050> come

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
little socket over there so if you come

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.450 
little socket over there so if you come
close<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.340> me<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:45.170> will<00:00:46.170> surely<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.620> circle<00:00:47.160> gets

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
close to me I will surely a circle gets

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.029 
close to me I will surely a circle gets
done<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.030> then<00:00:48.750> after<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.200> you'll<00:00:49.500> said<00:00:49.800> you

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
done and then after that you'll said you

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.350 
done and then after that you'll said you
will<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.340> no<00:00:50.550> problem<00:00:52.789> attached<00:00:53.789> any<00:00:54.090> eyes

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
will have no problem attached any eyes

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.970 
will have no problem attached any eyes
or<00:00:54.750> any<00:00:54.960> flies<00:00:55.820> follow<00:00:56.820> me

or any flies follow me

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.220 
or any flies follow me
okay<00:00:58.730> here<00:00:58.970> we<00:00:59.120> are<00:01:01.480> these<00:01:02.480> are<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:02.750> plastic

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
okay here we are these are the plastic

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.640 
okay here we are these are the plastic
guys<00:01:03.410> I<00:01:03.740> use<00:01:03.980> it<00:01:04.280> for<00:01:04.460> all<00:01:04.610> my<00:01:04.640> clients<00:01:05.300> and<00:01:06.020> the

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
guys I use it for all my clients and the

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.620 
guys I use it for all my clients and the
reason<00:01:06.980> I<00:01:07.070> use<00:01:07.250> it<00:01:07.460> is<00:01:07.610> plastic<00:01:07.880> guys<00:01:08.300> is

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
reason I use it is plastic guys is

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.400 
reason I use it is plastic guys is
because<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:12.470> stem<00:01:12.830> that<00:01:13.160> is<00:01:13.220> behind<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:14.060> eyes

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
because the stem that is behind the eyes

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.320 
because the stem that is behind the eyes
why<00:01:15.410> is<00:01:15.470> this

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
why is this

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.300 
why is this
it's<00:01:17.330> basically<00:01:19.600> we<00:01:20.600> needed<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:21.200> of<00:01:21.680> course<00:01:21.950> to

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
it's basically we needed to of course to

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.410 
it's basically we needed to of course to
carry<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.790> stand<00:01:23.120> but<00:01:23.330> live<00:01:24.080> a<00:01:25.090> tiny<00:01:26.090> bit<00:01:26.390> of

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
carry the stand but live a tiny bit of

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.800 
carry the stand but live a tiny bit of
the<00:01:26.750> stem<00:01:26.990> behind<00:01:27.640> of<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.910> eyes<00:01:29.090> just<00:01:29.600> like

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
the stem behind of the eyes just like

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.160 
the stem behind of the eyes just like
that<00:01:30.050> you<00:01:30.680> should<00:01:30.920> be<00:01:31.040> able<00:01:31.160> to<00:01:31.310> see<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:33.970> okay

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
that you should be able to see it okay

what did that does is the glue is gonna

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.350 
what did that does is the glue is gonna
grab<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.410> little<00:01:39.590> stem<00:01:40.009> over<00:01:40.250> there<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.759> it's

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
grab the little stem over there and it's

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.290 
grab the little stem over there and it's
gonna<00:01:41.770> grow<00:01:42.770> into<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:45.400> into<00:01:46.400> the<00:01:46.550> fibers<00:01:47.030> and

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
gonna grow into the into the fibers and

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.570 
gonna grow into the into the fibers and
once<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.990> glue<00:01:48.110> is<00:01:48.200> dry<00:01:48.350> it's<00:01:49.100> gonna<00:01:49.280> stay

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
once the glue is dry it's gonna stay

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.510 

it's<00:02:44.540> very<00:02:44.900> important<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.950> understand

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
it's very important that you understand

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.630 
it's very important that you understand
at<00:02:46.790> this<00:02:46.970> point<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:48.380> fiber<00:02:48.680> is<00:02:48.920> a<00:02:48.950> kid<00:02:49.280> over

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
at this point the fiber is a kid over

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.720 
at this point the fiber is a kid over
here<00:02:49.850> they<00:02:50.150> kind<00:02:50.330> of<00:02:50.510> lose<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:51.200> don't<00:02:51.730> stroke

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
here they kind of lose so don't stroke

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.110 
here they kind of lose so don't stroke
the<00:02:52.970> fibers<00:02:53.800> backwards<00:02:54.910> otherwise<00:02:55.910> you're

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
the fibers backwards otherwise you're

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.570 
the fibers backwards otherwise you're
gonna<00:02:56.180> pull<00:02:56.450> those<00:02:56.630> fibers<00:02:57.080> with<00:02:57.319> you<00:02:57.470> just<00:02:58.459> to

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
gonna pull those fibers with you just to

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.910 
gonna pull those fibers with you just to
make<00:02:58.790> sure<00:02:58.819> you<00:02:59.209> have<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.390> nice<00:02:59.770> socket<00:03:00.770> over

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
make sure you have a nice socket over
