or<00:02:46.349> maybe<00:02:46.379> there<00:02:46.769> well<00:02:47.700> let's<00:02:47.849> look<00:02:48.000> around<00:02:48.150> a

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
or maybe there well let's look around a

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.869 
or maybe there well let's look around a
little<00:02:48.450> bit<00:02:49.200> further<00:02:49.650> now<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.609> we're<00:02:50.730> down

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
little bit further now that we're down

little bit further now that we're down
here<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.090> don't<00:02:51.299> think<00:02:51.359> anyone's<00:02:51.750> gonna<00:02:51.810> go

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
here I don't think anyone's gonna go

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.300 
here I don't think anyone's gonna go
straight<00:02:52.379> for<00:02:52.530> here<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:52.799> I<00:02:52.859> think<00:02:52.920> we're<00:02:53.160> good

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
straight for here so I think we're good

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.190 
straight for here so I think we're good
for<00:02:53.519> at<00:02:53.670> least<00:02:53.819> just<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.239> few<00:02:54.420> minutes<00:02:54.599> so<00:02:55.170> that

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
for at least just a few minutes so that

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.360 
for at least just a few minutes so that
we<00:02:55.349> can<00:02:55.470> look<00:02:55.650> around<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:56.099> see<00:02:56.250> if<00:02:56.280> there's

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
we can look around and see if there's

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.610 
we can look around and see if there's
any<00:02:56.609> other<00:02:56.879> better<00:02:57.390> spots<00:02:57.930> inside<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.560> this

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
any other better spots inside of this

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.470 
any other better spots inside of this
whole<00:02:58.799> area<00:02:59.099> try<00:02:59.579> to<00:02:59.640> drop<00:02:59.819> down<00:03:00.030> oh<00:03:00.239> there's<00:03:00.450> a

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
whole area try to drop down oh there's a

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.190 
whole area try to drop down oh there's a
ladder<00:03:00.629> here<00:03:00.810> should<00:03:01.109> go<00:03:01.230> down<00:03:01.409> here<00:03:01.680> and

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
ladder here should go down here and

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.289 
ladder here should go down here and
maybe<00:03:04.200> maybe<00:03:04.829> just<00:03:05.010> maybe<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.730> was<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:05.970> best

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
maybe maybe just maybe that was the best

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.300 
maybe maybe just maybe that was the best
fly<00:03:06.510> down<00:03:06.659> here<00:03:06.810> um<00:03:07.079> I<00:03:07.680> don't<00:03:07.890> know<00:03:08.040> maybe

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
fly down here um I don't know maybe
