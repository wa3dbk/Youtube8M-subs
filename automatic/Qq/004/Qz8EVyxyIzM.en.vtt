that same engines that they used back

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.480 
that same engines that they used back
then<00:01:48.140> they're<00:01:49.140> nine<00:01:49.439> cylinder<00:01:50.039> radial

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
then they're nine cylinder radial

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.419 
then they're nine cylinder radial
engines<00:01:50.880> smoke<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> lot<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.409> burn<00:01:53.069> a<00:01:53.100> lot<00:01:53.280> of
