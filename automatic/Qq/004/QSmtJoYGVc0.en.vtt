00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.790
 and of course everyone knows that dsk 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.170
 today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.750
 little video announcement that I had said that 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.630
 I would do at the end of the witcher 3 which 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.060
 so is an ad for a live 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.189
 special that I'm going to do this June 19th on 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.910
 the fantasy xiv extension 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.529
 even a live marathon that will last 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.270
 more than 24 hours and that will have for 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.430
 goal of mounting one of the three 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.230
 new classes that will come out just 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.020
 on this new extension these three 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.030
 new classes answered no from the dark 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.040
 Knight of the Astral Youth and Mc Innis 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.890
 the dark knight a tank the fraud jallet 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.180
 tyler and the mc innis and a physical dps 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.489
 distance 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.100
 kuzeo rogen by the way and so that's it 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.590
 with our little olive team weaving and 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.750
 rage and well we'll all assign a role 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.609
 I'm going to take dark knight rises going 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.410
 take the astrologer young elders small 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.930
 it was going to take the maquis nist 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.549
 and we will start a marathon 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.040
 to be able rdpc new class 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.040
 up to the maximum level new level 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.340
 maximum that is now of 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.140
 so will now be level 60 and 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.700
 so here we are going to do this little challenge 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.830
 because we had just discovered 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.720
 these new classes and at the same time 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.040
 since we will stay more than 24 hours in 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.930
 live we will also discover new 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.510
 zones devon tonight but we will start therefore 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.830
 by the raised part ling that will be 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.450
 maybe a little tedious at first 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.520
 we will return to the former zones 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.350
 to be able to ep so that will not have 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.390
 maybe nothing to do with is good this 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.790
 evening of sight that it will be the game content 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.050
 so just for rhdp up that should 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.270
 go fast by the way, because we're going 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.040
 starts directly at level 30 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.190
 so I think that level 30 years that 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.930
 count it will be fast enough I would say 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.720
 maybe 10 hours maximum 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.570
 if we are lucky and if we are fast 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.930
 if we are talented too and above all 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.970
 So here is live marathon good we go to 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.380
 peno class up to level 60 and also 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.630
 discover an evening of the same 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.300
 opportunity for more than 24 hours 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.630
 and yes you have of course 24 hours 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.910
 1 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.050
 finally you are right right tense 24 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.580
 hours yes because this is the first 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.560
 time I want to do a live 24 hours 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.050
 the last time I tried it was 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.390
 not very well passed I quickly gave up 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.650
 unfortunately I did not feel great 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.130
 so here I hope everything will happen 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.170
 well 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.030
 we're going to plan the drinks all that for 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.380
 hold all the night all 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.769
 all these gorgeous there or is it 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.880
 we are going to cover the mob together 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.040
 now I know it will not please 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.940
 everybody 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.350
 I think 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.510
 some may not necessarily 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.310
 adhere to that kind of things me 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.810
 personally i love i love this kind 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.400
 of joe i love to watch streamer do 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.200
 of the velly even though it's true that 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.330
 sometimes it's a little annoying to me 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.400
 will confess and here I wanted to 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.170
 do it because you ff xiv for me 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.180
 it's one of the best mmorpg of its 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.350
 generation for now I find 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.080
 that he does not have a lot of competition 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.390
 after warcraft and I counted well 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.100
 two beautiful years on it again as seen 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.690
 it's been almost two years since I 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.540
 I'm on it and I just wanted 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.160
 to share that overflowing passion that 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.640
 I have for this game is a bit too 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.400
 overflowing even with my friends 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.470
 so that's it for the objective part 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.640
 mara for sas seduced then I hold 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.110
 still to warn you 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.820
 warn against what everything 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.960
 just because this is the 19th this 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.120
 is not official release of good 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.010
 are those early access and who will say 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.500
 the general accessions big worries 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.240
 techniques that I hope will not happen 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.930
 it's a pity that it's a waste of 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.190
 live so by his technique on these 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.110
 techniques I mean for example the 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.570
 know who spit the long ones that the 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.970
 queues or even a 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.820
 now what would happen totally 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.320
 by chance or indefinite duration 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.390
 was not rare it happened his role of 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.120
 warcraft on the latest extension by 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.739
 example warlord rae north and well what 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.780
 happened is that the game was 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.970
 limit unplayable for more than one 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.470
 week 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.780
 so here I do not wish it shakes 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.240
 I do not know what fantasy 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.340
 suffer at haven evening because otherwise 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.620
 it'll ruin my plans my live it 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.270
 would be a little weak and unfortunately 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.390
 we are not immune to this kind of 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.319
 things there is something that happens if 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.130
 never happens 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:15.170
 well we will try to improvise so 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.299
 that's if there are technical problems or 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.690
 if for example imagine one that could 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.489
 arrive 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.810
 imagine that early access we did 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.190
 no access to new low classes 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.720
 if that's so it's the case and not this 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.910
 what we will do is understand our 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.430
 current classes there will pass 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.080
 and level 50 to 60 I think until 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.580
 unlock but I think classes 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.840
 will be one of the classes will 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.240
 available directly their bed and 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.910
 access so that will be the primary goal 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.330
 that is to say we will arrive we will 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.010
 log on 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.710
 we will unlock the classes and the press 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.320
 and roll youth we will go and type 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.320
 mobs in loop until having that fucking 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.720
 level 50 and will discover together 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.360
 the mails viscount drafts custody for those 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.250
 who know so well this is a 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.470
 just about everything I had to say 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.400
 so to summarize so if you want 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.070
 you can see directly in the 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.580
 description it does not cost anything and if 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.990
 never have you understood me enough 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.460
 it's always better we'll say to have 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.660
 a writing I express myself better in writing 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.700
 that in oral more that's what is 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.750
 annoying I am like that 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.960
 unfortunately my teachers of 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.390
 IT is his youth 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.160
 I deleted really naked 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.770
 on paper than in oral but good 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:25.020
 here we have all our faults so for 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:28.220
 so summarize this job between 9am and 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.220
 11h the lay will be launched 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.960
 if you follow me his twitter way there 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.730
 will have a big ad will see it in 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.030
 great that live is launched all that all 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.850
 it 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.620
 so that's 19 between 9 and 11 o'clock 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.420
 it will depend when a server on europe 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.430
 but hey, we'll go straight to 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.560
 the adventure puts so that's it will last 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.420
 more than 24 hours maybe even a 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.970
 thirty hours if I'm really 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:53.030
 motivated if if I really have the flame in 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.970
 I Do With youth as it looks 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.550
 is called my tho gaye the power of the 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.530
 youth in me because I start to 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.760
 make me old but hey this program 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.360
 which québec here I hope you 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.520
 will be numerous 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.290
 of course as they say live events 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.970
 ward there will be no play at a rock a 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.920
 other I do not expect other 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.500
 thing to have that that and that 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.000
 that it limits if ever there is a concern 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.340
 technique we may go to another 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.140
 play but not fluorite and that's 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.090
 clear and good evening and nothing 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.840
 else so here I know that some 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.980
 do not like fantasy xiv 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.990
 so much for you huh 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.790
 unfortunately I can not do anything about it 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.470
 I love this game I want to do 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.510
 share my passion for this game 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.520
 maybe some people will like is that 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.350
 some of the morons downright not here 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.680
 we each have our opinion 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.430
 I personally love the game I do not 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.450
 almost can not coach others 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.570
 open and I have this one have 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.890
 Besides, it's not just fast 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.890
 to give you an example before you 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.090
 From World of Warcraft is a genre that 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.580
