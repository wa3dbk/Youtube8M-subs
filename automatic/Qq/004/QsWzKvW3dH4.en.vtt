orderly

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.050 

so<00:03:09.530> we're<00:03:09.680> talking<00:03:09.830> about<00:03:10.099> the<00:03:10.670> blowout

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
so we're talking about the blowout

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.119 
so we're talking about the blowout
smooth<00:03:13.000> shampoo<00:03:14.000> which<00:03:14.959> it<00:03:15.890> looks<00:03:16.159> like<00:03:16.430> that

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
smooth shampoo which it looks like that

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.619 
smooth shampoo which it looks like that
I'm<00:03:19.129> not<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.670> hugest<00:03:20.120> user<00:03:20.480> of<00:03:20.720> shampoos<00:03:21.200> um<00:03:21.739> I

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
I'm not the hugest user of shampoos um I

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.759 
I'm not the hugest user of shampoos um I
usually<00:03:23.629> just<00:03:23.959> go<00:03:24.110> wash<00:03:24.290> my<00:03:24.500> hair<00:03:24.650> with

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
usually just go wash my hair with

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.259 
usually just go wash my hair with
conditioner<00:03:24.920> because<00:03:25.370> shampoos<00:03:26.090> have<00:03:26.120> a

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
conditioner because shampoos have a

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.850 
conditioner because shampoos have a
tendency<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.870> be<00:03:26.989> kind<00:03:27.200> of<00:03:27.230> stripping<00:03:27.650> on<00:03:27.739> my

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
tendency to be kind of stripping on my

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.100 
tendency to be kind of stripping on my
hair<00:03:28.069> and<00:03:28.280> this<00:03:28.819> is<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.030> rinse<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.659> red<00:03:29.840> color

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
hair and this is a rinse the red color

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.050 
hair and this is a rinse the red color
isn't<00:03:30.470> so<00:03:30.560> shampoos<00:03:30.950> make<00:03:31.340> my<00:03:31.489> hair<00:03:31.640> wash<00:03:31.849> out

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
isn't so shampoos make my hair wash out

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.780 
isn't so shampoos make my hair wash out
faster<00:03:32.599> means<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.319> have<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.530> redo<00:03:33.950> mine<00:03:34.190> rinse

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
faster means I have to redo mine rinse

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.619 
faster means I have to redo mine rinse
faster<00:03:35.329> but<00:03:35.540> this<00:03:36.109> actually<00:03:36.859> was<00:03:37.370> not<00:03:37.730> drying

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
faster but this actually was not drying

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.630 
faster but this actually was not drying
my<00:03:38.959> hair<00:03:39.140> felt<00:03:39.410> really<00:03:39.739> nice<00:03:39.980> when<00:03:40.340> I<00:03:40.400> washed

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
my hair felt really nice when I washed

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.309 
my hair felt really nice when I washed
it<00:03:40.819> out<00:03:40.910> it<00:03:41.209> didn't<00:03:41.540> take<00:03:41.690> much<00:03:41.900> for<00:03:42.200> it<00:03:42.230> to

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
it out it didn't take much for it to

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.910 
it out it didn't take much for it to
lather<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:42.980> lathered<00:03:43.519> beautifully<00:03:44.890> so<00:03:45.890> I

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
lather and lathered beautifully so I

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.059 
lather and lathered beautifully so I
actually<00:03:46.489> liked<00:03:47.269> this<00:03:47.659> um<00:03:48.109> and<00:03:48.170> I've<00:03:48.530> used<00:03:48.890> a

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
actually liked this um and I've used a

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.890
