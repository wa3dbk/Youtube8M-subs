reason<00:00:22.470> here<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> minute<00:00:23.160> but<00:00:23.400> for<00:00:24.119> many

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
reason here in a minute but for many

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.259 
reason here in a minute but for many
reasons<00:00:24.720> not<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.680> least<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.189> which<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
reasons not the least of which is the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.420 
reasons not the least of which is the
fact<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.599> it's<00:00:27.840> extremely<00:00:28.019> flexible

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.910 

versatile<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.730> probably<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.180> better<00:00:33.390> word<00:00:33.920> you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
versatile is probably a better word you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.560 
versatile is probably a better word you
can<00:00:36.829> convert<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.460> extreme<00:00:38.969> low<00:00:39.210> angle

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
can convert this for extreme low angle

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.310 
can convert this for extreme low angle
work<00:00:39.809> macro<00:00:40.770> work<00:00:41.010> etc<00:00:41.239> you're<00:00:42.239> basically<00:00:42.719> two

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
work macro work etc you're basically two

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.810 
work macro work etc you're basically two
inches<00:00:43.620> off<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.829> floor<00:00:44.010> there<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:44.670> your

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
ball head or whatever this this one is

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.799 
ball head or whatever this this one is
the<00:00:49.829> pro<00:00:50.100> pro<00:00:50.579> model<00:00:50.969> which<00:00:51.090> allows<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.629> do

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
the pro pro model which allows you to do

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.990 
the pro pro model which allows you to do
that<00:00:52.050> conversion<00:00:52.410> here<00:00:53.010> with<00:00:53.219> these<00:00:53.370> with<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
that conversion here with these with the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.650 
that conversion here with these with the
center<00:00:54.270> column

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
center column

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.139 
center column
there's<00:00:55.620> also<00:00:55.800> version<00:00:56.340> without<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.910> center

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
there's also version without the center

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.130 
there's also version without the center
column<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.629> does<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.129> but<00:00:59.780> just<00:01:00.780> wanted<00:01:01.050> to

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
column that does that but just wanted to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.569 
column that does that but just wanted to
talk<00:01:01.410> about<00:01:01.440> some<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> things<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.489> I

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
talk about some of the things that I

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.679 
talk about some of the things that I
love<00:01:02.879> about<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.409> firstly<00:01:05.420> that<00:01:06.420> when<00:01:06.570> you're

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
love about it firstly that when you're

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.929 
love about it firstly that when you're
running<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.170> gunning<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:07.740> as<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.430> often<00:01:08.610> am

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
running and gunning as as I often am

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.200 
running and gunning as as I often am
either<00:01:09.840> video<00:01:10.409> or<00:01:10.860> photo<00:01:11.189> it's<00:01:11.760> important<00:01:12.150> to

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
either video or photo it's important to

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.219 
either video or photo it's important to
be<00:01:12.330> able<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.540> move<00:01:13.080> quickly<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.659> if<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.840> open

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
be able to move quickly and if you open

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.080 
be able to move quickly and if you open
this<00:01:16.439> they<00:01:16.890> basically<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.700> extend

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
this they basically is to extend

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.539 
this they basically is to extend
automatically<00:01:18.840> by<00:01:19.200> gravity<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.159> push

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
automatically by gravity you can push

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.249 
automatically by gravity you can push
them<00:01:20.700> all<00:01:20.939> three<00:01:21.150> up<00:01:21.299> at<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> same<00:01:21.689> time<00:01:21.720> and

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
them all three up at the same time and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.980 
them all three up at the same time and
then<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.560> roll<00:01:22.740> right<00:01:22.890> around<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.810> close<00:01:24.810> it

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
then just roll right around and close it

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.760 
then just roll right around and close it
close<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.860> latches<00:01:26.070> back<00:01:26.400> down<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.770> that's

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
close the latches back down so that's

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.460 
close the latches back down so that's
what<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:28.979> love<00:01:29.189> about<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.869> however<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.170> have

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
with this as a Steadicam and if I need

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.070 
with this as a Steadicam and if I need
added<00:02:50.510> stability

I<00:02:55.910> will<00:02:56.060> do<00:02:56.180> another<00:02:56.390> video<00:02:56.630> showing<00:02:57.170> how<00:02:57.830> that

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
I will do another video showing how that

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.800 
I will do another video showing how that
works<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.580> then<00:02:58.640> show<00:02:58.910> you<00:02:58.970> some<00:02:59.060> resultant

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
works and then show you some resultant

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.140 
works and then show you some resultant
footage<00:03:00.230> from<00:03:00.770> that<00:03:01.010> but<00:03:01.489> if<00:03:01.610> you're<00:03:01.790> looking

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
footage from that but if you're looking

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.490 
footage from that but if you're looking
for<00:03:02.390> extremely<00:03:03.050> versatile<00:03:03.470> tripod<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:05.080> you

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.430 

are<00:03:09.500> even<00:03:09.950> considering<00:03:10.400> carbon<00:03:11.239> fiber<00:03:11.510> I

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
are even considering carbon fiber I

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.100 
are even considering carbon fiber I
would<00:03:13.070> recommend<00:03:13.670> either<00:03:14.239> of<00:03:14.510> these<00:03:14.660> hands

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
would recommend either of these hands

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.440 
would recommend either of these hands
down<00:03:15.410> if<00:03:16.070> I<00:03:16.250> could<00:03:16.430> only<00:03:16.549> have<00:03:16.730> one<00:03:16.790> drive<00:03:17.239> out

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
down if I could only have one drive out

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.520 
down if I could only have one drive out
of<00:03:17.480> my<00:03:17.660> bag

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
of my bag

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.280 
of my bag
to<00:03:18.860> do<00:03:19.070> everything<00:03:19.489> length<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.540> would<00:03:20.720> be<00:03:20.900> one

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
to do everything length it would be one

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.360 
to do everything length it would be one
of<00:03:21.320> these<00:03:21.500> guys<00:03:22.239> my<00:03:23.239> only<00:03:23.769> concern<00:03:24.769> about<00:03:24.799> this

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
of these guys my only concern about this

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.610 
of these guys my only concern about this
one<00:03:25.610> is<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:25.970> it's<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:26.420> light<00:03:26.660> that<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.320> may

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
one is that it's so light that it may

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.550 
one is that it's so light that it may
not<00:03:27.799> have<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:29.260> steadying<00:03:30.260> effect<00:03:30.400> that<00:03:31.400> the

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
not have the steadying effect that the

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.140 
not have the steadying effect that the
aluminum<00:03:33.560> version<00:03:33.590> does<00:03:34.130> and<00:03:34.400> if<00:03:34.850> that's<00:03:35.000> the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
aluminum version does and if that's the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.030 
aluminum version does and if that's the
case<00:03:35.269> call<00:03:36.019> me<00:03:36.170> silly<00:03:36.440> but<00:03:36.769> I'm<00:03:36.860> actually

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
case call me silly but I'm actually

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.640 
case call me silly but I'm actually
going<00:03:37.489> to<00:03:37.549> either<00:03:37.760> in<00:03:38.030> bed<00:03:38.269> or<00:03:40.570> fasten<00:03:41.650> lead

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
going to either in bed or fasten lead

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.509 
going to either in bed or fasten lead
weights<00:03:42.920> on<00:03:43.220> one<00:03:43.549> of<00:03:43.579> the<00:03:43.760> legs<00:03:43.940> so<00:03:44.810> that<00:03:45.170> I<00:03:45.890> can

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
weights on one of the legs so that I can

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.039 
weights on one of the legs so that I can
swing<00:03:46.820> it<00:03:46.970> out<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.120> little<00:03:47.329> further<00:03:47.600> and<00:03:47.930> get

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
swing it out a little further and get

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:49.810 
swing it out a little further and get
better<00:03:48.200> counterbalance<00:03:48.980> when<00:03:49.340> I'm<00:03:49.430> using<00:03:49.610> it

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
better counterbalance when I'm using it

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.640 
better counterbalance when I'm using it
as<00:03:49.910> a<00:03:49.940> Steadicam<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:50.989> there's<00:03:51.320> one<00:03:51.500> other

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
as a Steadicam and there's one other

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.819 
as a Steadicam and there's one other
feature<00:03:51.769> that<00:03:52.130> I<00:03:52.519> don't<00:03:52.760> use<00:03:52.970> frequently<00:03:53.829> but

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
feature that I don't use frequently but

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.940 
feature that I don't use frequently but
I<00:03:55.340> feel<00:03:56.030> like<00:03:56.209> I<00:03:56.450> should<00:03:56.750> mention<00:03:56.900> it<00:03:57.170> is<00:03:57.380> you

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
I feel like I should mention it is you

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.750 
I feel like I should mention it is you
can<00:03:58.130> actually<00:03:58.519> use<00:03:58.730> this<00:03:58.910> as<00:03:59.090> a<00:03:59.180> monopod<00:04:00.760> if

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
can actually use this as a monopod if

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.590 
can actually use this as a monopod if
you<00:04:02.980> extend<00:04:03.980> that<00:04:04.250> if<00:04:04.579> you<00:04:04.820> extend<00:04:05.180> that<00:04:05.329> leg

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
you extend that if you extend that leg

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.650 
you extend that if you extend that leg
and<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.320> center<00:04:06.620> column<00:04:07.299> you<00:04:08.299> can<00:04:08.480> actually

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
and the center column you can actually

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.050 
and the center column you can actually
use<00:04:09.049> this<00:04:09.200> as<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.410> monopod<00:04:10.010> so<00:04:10.280> it's<00:04:10.610> basically

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
use this as a monopod so it's basically

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.170 
use this as a monopod so it's basically
a<00:04:11.420> do<00:04:12.019> all<00:04:12.260> tripod<00:04:12.829> with<00:04:13.250> a<00:04:13.280> very<00:04:13.640> low<00:04:13.880> ground

tripod but in the end I felt like the
lighter<00:05:00.680> weight<00:05:00.919> was<00:05:01.100> worth<00:05:01.310> it<00:05:01.490> for<00:05:01.669> me<00:05:01.850> so<00:05:02.030> I

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
lighter weight was worth it for me so I

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.960 
lighter weight was worth it for me so I
got<00:05:02.360> it<00:05:02.540> so<00:05:02.750> anyhow<00:05:03.500> that's<00:05:03.800> a<00:05:03.919> review<00:05:04.250> of<00:05:04.550> the
