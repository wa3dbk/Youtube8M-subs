now once you have that down once you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.370 
now once you have that down once you
practice<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.369> land<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.180> maybe<00:01:30.750> say<00:01:31.050> 10<00:01:31.290> to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
practice it land on it maybe say 10 to

practice it land on it maybe say 10 to
15<00:01:31.530> times<00:01:32.039> it's<00:01:32.970> time<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.330> add<00:01:33.509> that

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
15 times it's time to add that

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.529 
15 times it's time to add that
comfortable<00:01:34.880> this<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.000> perhaps<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.509> most

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539

your body to do with gorgeous kid all
you<00:01:56.640> need<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.909> do<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.450> do<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.719> scoop

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
you need to do is just do the scoop

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.959 
you need to do is just do the scoop
correctly<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.009> then<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.460> board<00:01:59.700> does<00:01:59.819> all

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
correctly and then the board does all

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.870 
correctly and then the board does all
the<00:02:00.090> work<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.829> with<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.920> shove<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.700> want

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
to get into position

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.120 
to get into position
or<00:02:06.040> you're<00:02:06.220> back<00:02:06.400> on<00:02:06.730> board<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.770> you<00:02:08.800> want<00:02:09.010> to

mistake<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.530> do<00:02:38.770> is<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.760> think<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.090> that

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
mistake is to do is to think of that

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.670 
mistake is to do is to think of that
once<00:02:40.420> you<00:02:40.510> put<00:02:40.570> both<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:40.930> your<00:02:41.080> feet<00:02:41.260> on<00:02:41.410> here

once you put both of your feet on here

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.010 
once you put both of your feet on here
make<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.340> either<00:02:42.460> need<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.970> scoop<00:02:43.450> then<00:02:43.720> jump

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
make you either need to scoop then jump

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.800 
make you either need to scoop then jump
or<00:02:44.590> jump<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.130> scoop<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.790> that's<00:02:46.540> just

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
or jump and scoop and that's just

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.740 
or jump and scoop and that's just
absolutely<00:02:47.740> impossible<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.610> kid<00:02:48.880> choke<00:02:49.480> and

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
absolutely impossible you kid choke and

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.260 
absolutely impossible you kid choke and
then<00:02:49.810> scoop<00:02:50.560> down<00:02:50.830> it's<00:02:51.580> going<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.820> be<00:02:51.910> quite

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
then scoop down it's going to be quite

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.240 
then scoop down it's going to be quite
so<00:02:52.450> much<00:02:52.570> for<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:52.900> think<00:02:53.140> about<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:54.220> you

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
so much for you think about and you

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.750 
so much for you think about and you
can't<00:02:54.760> scoop<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:56.110> jump<00:02:56.530> or<00:02:57.130> else<00:02:57.280> your<00:02:57.490> board

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
can't scoop that jump or else your board

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.340 
can't scoop that jump or else your board
and<00:02:58.090> your<00:02:58.210> body<00:02:58.480> you're<00:02:58.720> going<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.900> go<00:02:58.990> to

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
and your body you're going to go to

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.620 
and your body you're going to go to
different<00:02:59.500> areas<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.940> what<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.240> need<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.450> do

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
different areas so what you need to do

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.619 
different areas so what you need to do
is<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.650> time<00:03:02.920> your<00:03:03.400> scoop<00:03:03.760> and

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
is you to time your scoop and

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.030 
is you to time your scoop and
so<00:03:05.140> that<00:03:05.290> there's<00:03:05.469> simultaneous

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
so that there's simultaneous

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.250 
so that there's simultaneous
so<00:03:07.400> scoop<00:03:08.110> right<00:03:09.110> Luger<00:03:09.879> okay<00:03:11.049> so<00:03:12.049> that's

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
so scoop right Luger okay so that's

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.960 
so scoop right Luger okay so that's
really<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.590> key<00:03:13.900> right<00:03:14.900> what<00:03:15.110> do<00:03:15.170> you<00:03:15.230> jump

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
really the key right what do you jump

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.960 
really the key right what do you jump
and<00:03:16.970> then<00:03:17.930> lend<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:18.620> call<00:03:19.159> a<00:03:19.189> bulk<00:03:19.549> at<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.760> same

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
and then lend I call a bulk at the same

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.119 
and then lend I call a bulk at the same
time<00:03:20.209> that's<00:03:21.200> how<00:03:21.379> I<00:03:21.409> do<00:03:21.590> shove<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:22.010> on<00:03:22.040> a
