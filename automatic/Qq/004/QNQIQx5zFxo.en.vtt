00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.499 
to look at fish diseases all the same
way<00:00:26.720> I<00:00:26.960> mean<00:00:27.109> if<00:00:27.230> I<00:00:27.320> see<00:00:27.500> a<00:00:27.529> sore<00:00:28.119> on<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:29.330> side

way I mean if I see a sore on the side

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.870 
way I mean if I see a sore on the side
of<00:00:29.539> my<00:00:29.720> fish<00:00:29.990> then<00:00:30.650> I<00:00:30.679> would<00:00:31.130> treat<00:00:31.369> a<00:00:31.609> sore

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
of my fish then I would treat a sore

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.280 
of my fish then I would treat a sore
right<00:00:32.390> or<00:00:32.720> if<00:00:33.140> I<00:00:33.260> saw<00:00:34.210> you<00:00:35.210> know<00:00:35.300> slimy<00:00:35.720> fish<00:00:36.079> or

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
right or if I saw you know slimy fish or

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.750 
right or if I saw you know slimy fish or
whatever<00:00:36.560> then<00:00:36.950> obviously<00:00:37.370> we<00:00:37.490> know<00:00:37.610> that's

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
whatever then obviously we know that's

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.060 
whatever then obviously we know that's
trick<00:00:38.060> Idina<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:38.780> we<00:00:39.050> would<00:00:39.170> want<00:00:39.350> to<00:00:39.650> treat

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
trick Idina so we would want to treat

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.890 
trick Idina so we would want to treat
your<00:00:40.250> slimy<00:00:40.490> fish<00:00:40.850> with<00:00:41.090> an<00:00:41.180> antiparasite

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
your slimy fish with an antiparasite

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.240 
your slimy fish with an antiparasite
remedy<00:00:42.590> and<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:42.890> answer<00:00:43.250> is<00:00:43.430> no<00:00:44.980> when<00:00:45.980> you<00:00:46.070> see

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
remedy and the answer is no when you see

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.860 
remedy and the answer is no when you see
a<00:00:46.280> sore<00:00:46.580> on<00:00:46.820> a<00:00:46.850> fish<00:00:47.180> that's<00:00:47.510> usually<00:00:47.840> a

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
a sore on a fish that's usually a

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.150 
a sore on a fish that's usually a
bacterial<00:00:48.500> sore<00:00:48.770> or<00:00:48.980> an<00:00:49.070> ulcer<00:00:49.280> and<00:00:51.040> when<00:00:52.040> you

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
bacterial sore or an ulcer and when you

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.340 
bacterial sore or an ulcer and when you
see<00:00:52.370> that<00:00:52.750> it<00:00:53.750> usually<00:00:54.080> means<00:00:54.200> that

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
see that it usually means that

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.840 
see that it usually means that
something's<00:00:54.740> been<00:00:54.860> going<00:00:55.370> on<00:00:55.490> with<00:00:55.700> it

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
something's been going on with it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.250 
something's been going on with it
there's<00:00:56.060> something<00:00:56.390> to<00:00:56.510> stress<00:00:56.810> it<00:00:56.960> out<00:00:57.110> to

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
there's something to stress it out to

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.080 
there's something to stress it out to
where<00:00:57.410> it<00:00:57.440> would<00:00:57.920> be<00:00:58.190> vulnerable<00:00:58.520> to<00:00:59.060> a

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
where it would be vulnerable to a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.340 
where it would be vulnerable to a
bacterial<00:00:59.600> infection<00:00:59.660> I<00:01:00.050> always<00:01:00.230> say

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
bacterial infection I always say

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.080 
bacterial infection I always say
bacteria<00:01:00.860> do<00:01:01.010> not<00:01:01.040> cause<00:01:01.370> bacterial

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
bacteria do not cause bacterial

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.780 
bacteria do not cause bacterial
infections<00:01:03.309> environmental<00:01:04.309> issues<00:01:04.610> and

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
infections environmental issues and

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.249 
infections environmental issues and
handling<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:05.299> that<00:01:05.420> sort<00:01:05.630> of<00:01:05.659> thing<00:01:05.810> usually

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
handling and that sort of thing usually

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.320 
handling and that sort of thing usually
are<00:01:06.439> what<00:01:06.590> causes<00:01:06.830> bacteria<00:01:07.330> bacterial

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
are what causes bacteria bacterial

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.240 
are what causes bacteria bacterial
infections<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:08.990> of<00:01:09.650> course<00:01:09.890> those<00:01:10.070> would

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
infections and of course those would

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.520 
infections and of course those would
manifest<00:01:10.490> as<00:01:10.820> sores<00:01:11.090> or<00:01:11.420> dropsy<00:01:11.900> or<00:01:12.050> Gill<00:01:12.290> rot

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
manifest as sores or dropsy or Gill rot

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.290 
manifest as sores or dropsy or Gill rot
or<00:01:12.740> fin<00:01:12.950> rot<00:01:13.190> or<00:01:13.370> whatever<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:14.030> we'll<00:01:14.120> talk

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
or fin rot or whatever and we'll talk

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.570 
or fin rot or whatever and we'll talk
about<00:01:14.450> bacterial<00:01:15.050> infection<00:01:15.440> someday<00:01:15.860> soon

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
about bacterial infection someday soon

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.670 
about bacterial infection someday soon
but<00:01:17.270> let's<00:01:17.300> talk<00:01:17.570> about<00:01:17.870> fish<00:01:18.350> disease

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
but let's talk about fish disease

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.260 
but let's talk about fish disease
outbreaks<00:01:19.130> when<00:01:19.340> you<00:01:19.460> see<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.700> fish<00:01:19.909> disease

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
outbreaks when you see a fish disease

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.300

outbreaks they're all handled exactly
the<00:01:22.460> same<00:01:22.700> way<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:23.180> this<00:01:23.600> is<00:01:23.750> so<00:01:23.900> you<00:01:23.960> don't

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
the same way and this is so you don't

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.230 
the same way and this is so you don't
miss<00:01:24.500> anything<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:25.400> make<00:01:25.550> no<00:01:25.820> assumptions

about what's going on with a fish when
they're<00:01:27.980> sick<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:28.370> it's<00:01:28.880> real<00:01:29.210> easy<00:01:29.980> first

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
they're sick and it's real easy first

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.700 
they're sick and it's real easy first
thing<00:01:31.250> you<00:01:31.370> do<00:01:31.550> when<00:01:32.000> you<00:01:32.030> see<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.659> fish<00:01:33.380> disease

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
thing you do when you see a fish disease

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.920 
thing you do when you see a fish disease
outbreak<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:34.940> look<00:01:35.120> at<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.360> crowding

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
outbreak to look at the crowding

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.800 
outbreak to look at the crowding
situation<00:01:36.560> in<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.770> pond<00:01:36.979> ponds<00:01:37.460> crowded<00:01:38.030> this

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
situation in the pond ponds crowded this

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.570 
situation in the pond ponds crowded this
could<00:01:39.020> be<00:01:39.110> a<00:01:39.140> good<00:01:39.350> cause<00:01:39.590> of<00:01:39.800> illness<00:01:40.010> what

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
could be a good cause of illness what

believe<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:37.860> or<00:02:37.950> not<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.570> it's<00:02:39.570> interesting

fish with bacterial sores sometimes you

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.570 
fish with bacterial sores sometimes you
just<00:02:45.209> fix<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.750> water<00:02:45.959> quality<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.590> the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
just fix the water quality and the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.460 
just fix the water quality and the
bacteria<00:02:48.120> sores<00:02:48.360> go<00:02:48.630> away<00:02:48.810> on<00:02:48.959> their<00:02:49.140> own<00:02:49.170> this

bacteria sores go away on their own this

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.800 
bacteria sores go away on their own this
is<00:02:49.530> particularly<00:02:50.040> true<00:02:50.340> if<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.300> bacterial

schooling if the fish is eating and
schooling<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.340> probably<00:02:56.640> don't<00:02:56.790> need<00:02:56.880> to

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
schooling you probably don't need to

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.110 
schooling you probably don't need to
mess<00:02:57.150> with<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:58.040> if<00:02:59.040> your<00:02:59.310> water<00:02:59.489> quality<00:02:59.730> is

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
mess with it if your water quality is

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.390 
mess with it if your water quality is
absolutely<00:03:00.410> perfect<00:03:01.410> then<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.890> next<00:03:02.220> thing

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
to consider would be parasites don't

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.490

to the parasite thing then what you

to the parasite thing then what you
would<00:03:09.540> do<00:03:09.690> is<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:09.989> would<00:03:10.019> try<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.260> find<00:03:10.380> out<00:03:10.620> if

net<00:03:45.810> so<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.200> next<00:03:46.350> step<00:03:46.560> after<00:03:46.709> water<00:03:47.040> quality

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
net so the next step after water quality

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.759 
net so the next step after water quality
is<00:03:47.519> biopsy<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.390> if<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.079> said<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.440> don't<00:03:49.500> wanna

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
is biopsy and if you said I don't wanna

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.250 
is biopsy and if you said I don't wanna
biopsy<00:03:50.370> okay<00:03:51.120> then<00:03:51.540> basically<00:03:51.810> you're<00:03:52.170> gonna

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
biopsy okay then basically you're gonna

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.039 
biopsy okay then basically you're gonna
end<00:03:52.500> up<00:03:52.590> just<00:03:52.829> guest<00:03:53.220> treating<00:03:53.760> for<00:03:54.540> parasites

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049

that<00:03:55.350> can<00:03:55.890> be<00:03:56.070> a<00:03:56.100> mistake<00:03:56.549> but<00:03:57.030> salt<00:03:57.780> is<00:03:58.019> great

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
that can be a mistake but salt is great

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.660 
that can be a mistake but salt is great
for<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.739> there's<00:03:58.890> article<00:03:59.280> on<00:03:59.370> salt

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
for that and there's article on salt

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.840 
for that and there's article on salt
over<00:03:59.850> employ<00:04:00.120> that<00:04:00.299> calm<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:01.049> to<00:04:01.739> review<00:04:02.100> it

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
over employ that calm so to review it

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.330 
over employ that calm so to review it
would<00:04:03.000> basically<00:04:03.150> be<00:04:03.420> water<00:04:03.810> quality<00:04:04.350> testing

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
would basically be water quality testing

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.330 
would basically be water quality testing
nitrogen<00:04:05.850> and<00:04:06.060> pH

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
nitrogen and pH

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.460 
nitrogen and pH
then<00:04:07.760> you<00:04:07.910> would<00:04:08.030> go<00:04:08.180> on<00:04:08.390> to<00:04:08.629> a<00:04:08.660> diagnosis<00:04:09.319> of

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
then you would go on to a diagnosis of

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.449 
then you would go on to a diagnosis of
parasites<00:04:10.010> if<00:04:10.400> you<00:04:10.730> need<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:12.440> then<00:04:13.069> if<00:04:13.340> you

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
parasites if you need to and then if you

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.820 
parasites if you need to and then if you
had<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:13.970> guess<00:04:14.420> treatment<00:04:14.900> if<00:04:15.410> your<00:04:15.650> water

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
had to guess treatment if your water

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.289 
had to guess treatment if your water
quality<00:04:16.310> is<00:04:16.370> perfect<00:04:16.760> and<00:04:16.880> there<00:04:17.030> are<00:04:17.150> no

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
quality is perfect and there are no

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.969 
quality is perfect and there are no
parasites<00:04:17.840> in<00:04:18.019> there<00:04:18.199> then<00:04:18.470> it<00:04:18.500> has<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:18.949> be

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
parasites in there then it has to be

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.870 
parasites in there then it has to be
environmental<00:04:19.760> or<00:04:19.940> maybe<00:04:20.239> even<00:04:20.389> viral<00:04:21.320> and

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
environmental or maybe even viral and

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.550 
environmental or maybe even viral and
when<00:04:22.880> you<00:04:22.970> get<00:04:23.150> into<00:04:23.449> those<00:04:23.720> types<00:04:24.050> of<00:04:24.169> cases

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
when you get into those types of cases

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.000 
when you get into those types of cases
then<00:04:24.770> you<00:04:24.800> probably<00:04:25.460> need<00:04:25.610> to<00:04:25.639> call<00:04:25.940> koi<00:04:26.270> lab

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
then you probably need to call koi lab

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.850 
then you probably need to call koi lab
ko<00:04:28.010> ila<00:04:28.820> be<00:04:29.360> calm<00:04:29.930> there's<00:04:30.260> a<00:04:30.350> phone<00:04:30.530> number<00:04:30.560> on

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.260 
ko ila be calm there's a phone number on
there<00:04:31.100> you<00:04:31.190> call<00:04:31.370> and<00:04:31.580> find<00:04:31.790> out<00:04:31.910> what<00:04:32.030> kind<00:04:32.060> of

there you call and find out what kind of

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.760 
there you call and find out what kind of
samples<00:04:32.630> you<00:04:32.720> should<00:04:32.900> send<00:04:33.080> down<00:04:33.290> but<00:04:33.620> then

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
samples you should send down but then

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.469 
samples you should send down but then
because<00:04:34.310> you<00:04:34.760> don't<00:04:34.910> find<00:04:35.090> it<00:04:35.240> in<00:04:35.270> water

got fish with our quarantine and if you

got fish with our quarantine and if you

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
get into a dire situation then you might

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.370 
get into a dire situation then you might
end<00:05:04.310> up<00:05:04.400> having<00:05:04.729> to<00:05:04.760> get<00:05:05.240> with<00:05:05.419> a<00:05:05.660> koi<00:05:05.930> lab<00:05:06.139> and

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
end up having to get with a koi lab and

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.980 
end up having to get with a koi lab and
have<00:05:06.500> samples<00:05:06.919> done<00:05:07.100> per<00:05:07.370> kg<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.449> war

that<00:06:05.880> pH<00:06:06.240> crash<00:06:06.540> did<00:06:06.810> so<00:06:07.440> you<00:06:07.530> have<00:06:07.740> to<00:06:07.920> cover

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
that pH crash did so you have to cover

you<00:06:22.170> would<00:06:22.350> want<00:06:22.560> to<00:06:22.650> do<00:06:22.740> it<00:06:22.890> in<00:06:22.950> that<00:06:23.040> order<00:06:23.220> -

you would want to do it in that order -
just<00:06:23.790> so<00:06:23.880> you<00:06:23.910> can<00:06:24.150> miss<00:06:24.390> anything<00:06:24.690> you

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
just so you can miss anything you

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.330 
just so you can miss anything you
covered<00:06:25.200> all<00:06:25.290> your<00:06:25.470> bases<00:06:25.650> make<00:06:26.190> no

covered all your bases make no

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.470 
covered all your bases make no
assumptions<00:06:26.700> and<00:06:27.060> you<00:06:27.120> played<00:06:27.450> the

assumptions and you played the
statistics<00:06:28.290> that<00:06:28.740> 70%<00:06:29.310> of<00:06:29.520> the<00:06:29.640> problems<00:06:29.970> are

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060

20% parasites and 10% bacterial and
