 victories 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.530
 the high normans absolutely want 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.119
 to put on the ground in Paris a pfc which 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.980
 presents himself without his last recruit 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.320
 pellenard who is not yet qualified 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.870

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.220
 of the season for tiecoro keita a 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:51.000
 beautiful breakthrough is followed by a strike 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.940
 says stephen milosavljevic and is 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.720
 defeated in the goal Le Havre and the match 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.720
 is well launched 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.239
 the next opportunity and Le Havre with 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:02.010
 this recovery of the head the balloon 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.229
 ends at the bottom of the nets but 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.170
 the referee johan droissart reports a 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.140
 fault a whistle that cancels this 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.270
 goal we're left so 1 0 but the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.490
 Le Havre insists new luck new 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.150
 goals and again refused this 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.470
 this time for an offside position 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.110
 the pfc is doing well and 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.030
 start again with this attempt 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.130
 from center on the part of Roman barn a 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.170
 center that turns into shooting but the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.350

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.600
 once again at the half time paris 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.910

 0 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.350

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.970
 bastia being beaten 2-1 at the stadium 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.470
 ocÃ©ane paris fc would like to score 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.600
 a second goal to be a little bit 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.920
 quieter but it's the people of Le Havre 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.519
 who come back from the locker room 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:12.140
 with this striking too crossed 

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:12.140
 an interesting first intention 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.910
 but not followed by effect in this 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.980
 second period since the Parisians 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.000
 put back to play and get this

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.810
 directly on mios beach but 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.160
 the Le Havre goalkeeper does not manage to 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.990
 divert the ball 2 0 to the 48th minute 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.370

 the pfc is well launched to victory 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.040
 in the rest of this second period 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.230
 Le Havre can not reduce 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.920
