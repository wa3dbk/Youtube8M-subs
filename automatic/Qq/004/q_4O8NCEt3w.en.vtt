 I do not want to fall into the bean curd now before I go in . 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:43.539
 I'll show you today and you'll have a lot of help when you make the drain. 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:49.030
 Dyeing is usually the least difficult for you to color. 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:55.120
 Segundo has to squeeze into two parts edaga model requires only a small amount of clay ready for a bit 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.350
 The color is 8 colors, red, purple, and 3 colors are available. 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.720
 I will 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:07.409
 I do not move out because a lot of barrels of paint are geocham woojjamyeon 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:09.850
 The faster you get ready for vinyl, and when you dye yourself, a small amount 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:16.509
 Moving 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:23.229
 Dyeing is done while folding. So red, brown, purple, little by little . 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:28.689
 While looking at the color of the bean paste , this way, you get less hands. 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:31.209
 I do not know how to do it. 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:37.209
 Until the primary color comes out 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:39.210
 It looks a little like this, and now it's pretty red, so it's a little brown purple. 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:44.820

 Gradually progressively looking at the colors 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:58.590
 You play the role of checking . 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:02.610
 Now I 'm going to repeat the color again. 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.140
 Nowadays, the color is completed first, 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:10.780
 By mixing 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:16.060
 If you do this like this while you're young, 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:20.560
 Well it states that eight colors is going on now, how much and when dry 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:27.190

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.180
 I'd like to get rid of the rest of our guests. 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:42.310
 After that, 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:45.400
 Ah, I pay five maldeut Can I please hold while the kids kept very small amount 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.840
 I can not handle transfer of the transfer at once. 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:54.610
 Because it was too much in the meantime, the score became dry , 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.310
 There's no catch, so only a small wo ready to fast highway is approximately one 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.239
 When we do catch a more and more convergent 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.440
 If the speed is gradually to practice jijyo then a little more Raising the amount 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.340
 It's 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.340
 And here 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:17.050
 We will size it according to the ratio, but here, 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:20.920
 Catch and jump and use 2 goals and call it at your fingertips. 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:24.790
 Hatch earlier sitting to the side slightly lifted 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:30.730
 It looks like this . It 's not full of caves. It's elongated. 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:35.680
 Can you create a slide while giving slightly elongated bean with this condition 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:41.590

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:46.000
 And laugh significant hasiguyo going to live a little bit so grab control the amount of clay 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.220
 Once you get caught in a mountain flower , you catch it, 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.140
 The plate shape is completed. 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:58.030
 Also you get the amount due with a very small group is now much simpler Newark 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:02.620
 I have to make it because I can not make a bean curd when I get out of bed. 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.820
 But in this consul note, you can also make a pretty pass 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.670
 Will 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.260
 Even at that time 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:15.780
 Letting go of the topping I make myself 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:20.790
 This is where toppings can not be found, 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:23.970
 You can use it when you make fishermen. 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:29.580
 So clay is a small amount, but you have to hold it. 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:31.500
 Put a self-Aire again, yielding additional breathing when a lot when the cell is also not yet Rocks 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.120

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:43.910
 Be careful not to catch a lot of spice 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:47.150
 When that happens 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:53.420
 This way, Panyu is so complete. 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:56.960
