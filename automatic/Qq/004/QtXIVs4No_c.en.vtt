00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello my name is andrÃ© fernandes is this 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.330
 kickboxing rate president xa people 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.099
 There will be a doubt that some 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.259
 people came to ask me about it 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.109
 how you do a combat with the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.279
 and it's bigger than you, that's it. 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.980
 Do you have a lot of difficulties? 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.939
 precisely for this larger scale 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.369
 your opponent 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.260
 another important basis was a 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.570
 guard what happens in the difficulty 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.510
 When you compare higher when you 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.969
 extends forearm arm 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.500
 he was right and you can not 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.690
 get right 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.980
 then this is a difficulty then what 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.469
 It happens now I'm normally the guy is 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.980
 the higher it will have the priority of occupying 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.860
 this central space that stays there you 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.039
 the opponent because they take the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.920
 flames are fast I'm going to beat together 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.870
 with him and he always hit me first 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.960
 be a leg movement or whatever 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.270
 arm movement because exactly 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.810
 By this matter of having a longer range 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.189
 is inscribed on the world's 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.530
 surname afrontas in which he has 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.930
 advantage then the tip that I can 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.310
 give you a fight with a bigger guy 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.330
 fight with a guy who has a bigger 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.100
 wingspan 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.409
 the first is to avoid this struggle because 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.150
 eventually when you enter today 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.759
 unlock a front kick it goes 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.200
 beating then it's no good that you 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.299
 It will take very good. 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.430
 entering your opponent and made a 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.619
 blow fill can be fatal and can 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.200
 Finish the fight, what are you going to do? 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.000
 You'll get the diagonals when you 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.450
 enter you will get to play the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.970
 movement and then the side came crashing 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.829
 both worth this exit on the right side 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.290
 to combine 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.950
 Ok I'll go on the left side and I 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.380
 Can you play? 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.310
 so the first tip I give is that 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.310
 choose the diagonals draw a line 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.229
 diagonal here for both sides and games 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.500
 and I realized law got 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:18.720
 the best use against athletes 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.180
 larger than touch was fantastic commented 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.900
 I hope you liked it. 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.900
 This is the fx channel.
