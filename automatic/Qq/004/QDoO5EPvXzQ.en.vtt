start cooking them now so that's just

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.959 
start cooking them now so that's just
sort<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.710> couple<00:00:59.280> different<00:00:59.550> ways<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.850> you

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
sort of a couple different ways that you

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.549 
sort of a couple different ways that you
can<00:01:00.120> prepare<00:01:00.329> them<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:00.780> I'm<00:01:01.079> going<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.260> drain

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
can prepare them so I'm going to drain

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.369 
can prepare them so I'm going to drain
this<00:01:01.829> water<00:01:01.890> off<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.940> as<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.870> said<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.110> did

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
this water off and as I said I did

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.320 
this water off and as I said I did
change<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.860> water<00:01:05.070> once<00:01:05.519> about<00:01:05.970> halfway

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
change the water once about halfway

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.100 
change the water once about halfway
through<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.260> soaking<00:01:07.650> process<00:01:08.869> so<00:01:09.869> now<00:01:09.990> I'm

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
through the soaking process so now I'm

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.609 
through the soaking process so now I'm
going<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.290> go<00:01:10.380> ahead<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.740> place<00:01:11.010> them<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.549> a

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
going to go ahead and place them in a

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.670 
going to go ahead and place them in a
stockpot<00:01:14.540> I'm<00:01:15.540> going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> cover<00:01:16.110> them<00:01:16.409> with
