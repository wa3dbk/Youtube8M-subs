Simon's younger sister that was kind of

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.550 
Simon's younger sister that was kind of

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
random but other than that I mean yeah I

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.590

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.230 
believe Simon talked about his younger
sister<00:01:31.990> before<00:01:32.350> I<00:01:32.770> believe<00:01:33.160> it's<00:01:33.430> been<00:01:33.610> such<00:01:34.210> a

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
sister before I believe it's been such a

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.470 
sister before I believe it's been such a
long<00:01:34.450> time<00:01:34.660> since<00:01:35.200> since<00:01:36.070> we<00:01:36.250> seen<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:37.150> July

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
long time since since we seen the July

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.030 
long time since since we seen the July
art<00:01:37.780> you<00:01:38.530> know<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.890> tower<00:01:39.520> art<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.960> I<00:01:41.200> think

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
art you know the tower art but I think

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.230 
art you know the tower art but I think
he<00:01:42.160> did<00:01:42.280> talk<00:01:42.430> about<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.700> younger<00:01:42.880> sister<00:01:43.120> but

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
he did talk about the younger sister but

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.060 
he did talk about the younger sister but
it<00:01:43.540> was<00:01:43.900> kind<00:01:44.110> of<00:01:44.170> random<00:01:44.320> by<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.650> same<00:01:44.860> time

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
it was kind of random by the same time

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.830 
it was kind of random by the same time
it<00:01:45.340> kind<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.790> made<00:01:45.940> sense<00:01:46.060> but<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.540> review

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
it kind of made sense but the review

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.930 
it kind of made sense but the review
wasn't<00:01:47.170> that<00:01:47.290> it<00:01:47.650> was<00:01:47.710> very<00:01:47.950> anti-climactic

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
wasn't that it was very anti-climactic

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.420 
wasn't that it was very anti-climactic
to<00:01:49.720> say<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:50.020> least<00:01:50.050> so<00:01:50.770> that<00:01:51.100> was<00:01:51.190> like<00:01:51.250> the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
to say the least so that was like the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.980 
to say the least so that was like the
only<00:01:51.460> complaint<00:01:51.910> that<00:01:52.030> I<00:01:52.180> have<00:01:52.330> and<00:01:52.600> it's

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
only complaint that I have and it's

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.320 
only complaint that I have and it's
Italian<00:01:53.470> chapter<00:01:53.920> so<00:01:54.460> this<00:01:54.700> chapter<00:01:55.060> is<00:01:55.150> very

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
Italian chapter so this chapter is very

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.660 
Italian chapter so this chapter is very
straightforward<00:01:55.830> obviously<00:01:56.830> it<00:01:57.220> was<00:01:57.460> just

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
straightforward obviously it was just

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.900 
straightforward obviously it was just
Arzo<00:01:58.290> vs<00:01:59.290> Kagura<00:01:59.800> and<00:02:00.070> Erza<00:02:00.460> was<00:02:00.670> just

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
Arzo vs Kagura and Erza was just

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.350 
Arzo vs Kagura and Erza was just
absolutely<00:02:01.720> getting<00:02:02.080> annihilated<00:02:02.800> by<00:02:03.430> Kagura

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
absolutely getting annihilated by Kagura

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.660 
absolutely getting annihilated by Kagura
and<00:02:04.600> other<00:02:05.080> did<00:02:05.440> all<00:02:05.590> these<00:02:05.710> different<00:02:06.010> armor

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
and other did all these different armor

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.699 
and other did all these different armor
transformations<00:02:07.390> didn't<00:02:07.990> matter<00:02:08.110> still

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
transformations didn't matter still

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.649 
transformations didn't matter still
getting<00:02:09.069> annihilated<00:02:09.519> and<00:02:10.030> then<00:02:10.450> at<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.569> very

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
getting annihilated and then at the very

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.309 
getting annihilated and then at the very
end<00:02:10.869> we<00:02:11.590> see<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.280> girl<00:02:12.489> unshift<00:02:13.000> blade<00:02:13.390> well

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
end we see the girl unshift blade well

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.930 
end we see the girl unshift blade well
we<00:02:14.620> don't<00:02:14.769> know<00:02:14.890> if<00:02:14.980> this<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:15.220> blood<00:02:15.700> that
