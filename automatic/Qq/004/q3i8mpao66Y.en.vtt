00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.010
 It is Ashin 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.740
 The cost is 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.350
 Unexpectedly not well known not to consider winter 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:13.479
 ny had been a bit like it 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:16.660
 Well the school has a little bit of that time 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.720
 Though we think that we want to guide eco 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.039
 Hundreds of thousands of desktops are considered to be one of fop 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:26.569
 The 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.050
 Though it is in the cabinet 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.190
 Make some icons on your desktop 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.970
 I think this is with excel 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.420
 Only a part of the video size is taken so much 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.580
 I get it through only part of the desktop 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.420
 But 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.740
 8 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.360
 This is my blog-like icons 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.610
 Though 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.390
 The net so far 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.360
 Let me see 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.180
 Desktop delivery 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.110
 Yeah icon 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.630
 all 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.370
 Yeah 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.339
 next month 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.900
 Temporarily 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.370
 It doesn't mean you're physically searching 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.000
 Direction to make it nothing more than it looks 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.500
 I'm going to use it at the lakeside, but what is it? 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 When I make that video 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.130
 I must improve the desktop by all means 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.020
 At its desktop- 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.920
 After all, I adjusted in the future 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.640
 I think it's a bit hard to see that sealed form 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.340
 Why waited a little 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.320
 Anno this time 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.220
 Laughed at it 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.570
 A little without 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.010
 I wonder if I can get a name list 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.640
 It is data 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.960
 Create a circle on your desktop and its icon 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.130
 Your desktop director is also abused this year 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.490
 I think I'm not doing a chat after 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.490
 Right, then right-click 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.910
 Hey this 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.870
 Overwintering can be done here without getting caught gradually 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:13.869
 right click 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:16.799
 If you go to the exhibition site 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.650
 Though nep has disappeared for a moment 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.549
 Because the icon of the desktop is displayed 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.699
 It is a state where fixation is contained that 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:28.779
 Normally 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:30.239
 In this 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.889
 It's 4 straight wins to say completely Oimachi species when you pochi 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.909
 Why use this and use it? 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.909
 Now on my desktop 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.399
 Nothing at all for one filling 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.489
 Try this for the first time in a while 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:50.749
 Terrific 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:51.929
 Something 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:54.929
 I'm relieved in southern England 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:59.099
 Stop in the wireless year to try to return to Etogen 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.719
 Right-click anywhere you like 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:06.600
 Even on the display of the desktop icon that was 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.600
 If you go back to the starting belt 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:15.619
 It is spring chopsticks raw information It is thrown away Kakimachi concert 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:19.289
 If it is said that play is done, it may not be capacity 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:21.149
 Eh well 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:22.899
