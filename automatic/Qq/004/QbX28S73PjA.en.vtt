 By the fingertips 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.440
 Mix the flour with the zina well 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.440
 Drop the pot over the working area 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.000

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.440

 Place the cream over medium heat 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.440

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.440

 When the sweets are cooked, remove them from the mold 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.440
 And let it cool some minutes 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.440
 About two tablespoons of cream 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.440
