it's<00:00:10.870> the<00:00:11.020> salt<00:00:11.200> molest<00:00:11.560> later<00:00:12.240> now<00:00:13.240> what<00:00:13.600> you

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
it's the salt molest later now what you

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.320 
it's the salt molest later now what you
want<00:00:13.900> to<00:00:13.960> do<00:00:14.110> is<00:00:14.410> you<00:00:14.889> should<00:00:15.550> notice<00:00:15.820> that<00:00:16.180> I'm

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
want to do is you should notice that I'm

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.450 
want to do is you should notice that I'm
if<00:00:16.630> you<00:00:17.110> crawl<00:00:17.320> the<00:00:17.410> yellows<00:00:17.710> on<00:00:17.830> the<00:00:17.950> side<00:00:18.160> and

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
if you crawl the yellows on the side and

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.550 
if you crawl the yellows on the side and
after<00:00:18.700> you<00:00:18.760> have<00:00:18.820> you<00:00:19.000> personally<00:00:19.180> I<00:00:19.360> saw<00:00:19.630> um

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
after you have you personally I saw um

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.720 
after you have you personally I saw um
on<00:00:21.490> this<00:00:21.670> side<00:00:21.880> um<00:00:22.150> is<00:00:22.930> like<00:00:23.710> there's<00:00:24.520> four

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
on this side um is like there's four

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.880 
on this side um is like there's four
yellows<00:00:25.090> and<00:00:25.119> there's<00:00:25.420> four<00:00:25.660> whites<00:00:25.869> and<00:00:26.230> I

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
yellows and there's four whites and I

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.010 
yellows and there's four whites and I
folios<00:00:27.340> on<00:00:27.579> one<00:00:27.759> side<00:00:27.939> then<00:00:28.180> there's<00:00:28.720> no<00:00:28.840> much

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
folios on one side then there's no much

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.769 
folios on one side then there's no much
but<00:00:29.230> over<00:00:29.349> here<00:00:29.529> so<00:00:30.189> you<00:00:30.279> have<00:00:30.460> a<00:00:30.489> color<00:00:31.029> laface

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
but over here so you have a color laface

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.569 
but over here so you have a color laface
solved<00:00:32.529> but<00:00:32.829> you<00:00:32.920> don't<00:00:33.040> have<00:00:33.130> the<00:00:33.250> side<00:00:33.550> of

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
solved but you don't have the side of

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.530 
solved but you don't have the side of
itself<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:36.040> what<00:00:36.880> you<00:00:36.970> want<00:00:37.090> to<00:00:37.180> do<00:00:37.239> to<00:00:37.360> fix

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
itself so what you want to do to fix

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.849 
itself so what you want to do to fix
that<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:40.620> there<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.870> is<00:00:44.050> where<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.350> this<00:00:44.620> is

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
that is there this is where the this is

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:46.770 
that is there this is where the this is
a<00:00:44.920> long<00:00:45.070> algorithm<00:00:45.609> right<00:00:45.760> here<00:00:45.940> what<00:00:46.510> it<00:00:46.629> does

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
a long algorithm right here what it does

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:54.630 
a long algorithm right here what it does
is<00:00:46.989> it<00:00:47.050> switches<00:00:47.980> these<00:00:48.760> two<00:00:48.969> pieces<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
is it switches these two pieces and the

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.319 
is it switches these two pieces and the
algorithm<00:00:54.879> is<00:00:56.160> well<00:00:57.160> first<00:00:57.399> we<00:00:57.489> put<00:00:57.609> you<00:00:57.730> to

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
algorithm is well first we put you to

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:59.869 
algorithm is well first we put you to
mess<00:00:58.480> up<00:00:58.600> pieces<00:00:58.780> that<00:00:59.050> you<00:00:59.079> want<00:00:59.289> right<00:00:59.530> here

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
mess up pieces that you want right here

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.250 
mess up pieces that you want right here
and<00:01:00.879> it<00:01:01.089> will<00:01:01.179> fix<00:01:01.390> them<00:01:01.570> and<00:01:01.780> i'll<00:01:02.079> switch

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
and it will fix them and i'll switch

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:21.410 
and it will fix them and i'll switch
them<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:05.370> the<00:01:06.370> algorithm<00:01:06.610> is<00:01:08.190> slice<00:01:10.140> d<00:01:14.730> slice<00:01:16.860> f

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:36.630 

slice<00:01:24.480> d<00:01:25.480> inverted<00:01:26.970> slice<00:01:28.170> g<00:01:29.670> slice<00:01:32.070> um<00:01:35.640> you

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
slice d inverted slice g slice um you

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.120 
slice d inverted slice g slice um you
inverted<00:01:37.120> the<00:01:37.650> inverted<00:01:39.060> slice<00:01:42.480> the<00:01:43.480> inverted

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
inverted the inverted slice the inverted

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.850 
inverted the inverted slice the inverted
slice<00:01:46.650> d<00:01:47.650> 2<00:01:47.860> and<00:01:48.930> what<00:01:49.930> that<00:01:49.960> did<00:01:50.230> is<00:01:50.290> it<00:01:50.620> switch

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
slice d 2 and what that did is it switch

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.470 
slice d 2 and what that did is it switch
these<00:01:51.040> two<00:01:51.100> pieces<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:54.330> you're<00:01:55.330> going<00:01:55.420> to

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
these two pieces and you're going to

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.090 
these two pieces and you're going to
have<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.660> do<00:01:55.720> that<00:01:55.780> either<00:01:56.050> once<00:01:56.350> or<00:01:56.470> twice<00:01:56.590> in

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
have to do that either once or twice in

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.680 
have to do that either once or twice in
this<00:01:57.670> case<00:01:57.880> have<00:01:58.090> to<00:01:58.120> do<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.360> twice<00:01:58.480> because

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
this case have to do it twice because

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.860 
this case have to do it twice because
these<00:01:58.930> two<00:01:59.080> are<00:01:59.140> messed<00:01:59.350> up<00:01:59.440> to<00:02:00.390> now<00:02:01.390> if<00:02:01.720> you

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
these two are messed up to now if you

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.600 
these two are messed up to now if you
don't<00:02:02.050> like<00:02:02.290> using<00:02:02.530> algorithms<00:02:02.800> and<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.430> want

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
don't like using algorithms and you want

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.510 
don't like using algorithms and you want
to<00:02:03.670> use<00:02:03.760> an<00:02:03.940> easier<00:02:04.300> method<00:02:04.450> of<00:02:05.190> solving<00:02:06.190> these

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
to use an easier method of solving these

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.000 
to use an easier method of solving these
two<00:02:06.760> um<00:02:07.470> here's<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.500> little<00:02:08.709> trick<00:02:08.860> I<00:02:08.979> use<00:02:09.269> look

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
two um here's a little trick I use look

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.170 
two um here's a little trick I use look
book<00:02:12.010> without<00:02:12.190> using<00:02:12.430> notation<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:12.940> can<00:02:13.060> use

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
book without using notation you can use

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.920 
book without using notation you can use
this<00:02:14.069> what<00:02:15.069> I'm<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:16.180> can<00:02:16.330> call<00:02:16.510> me<00:02:16.599> weird<00:02:16.810> if

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
this what I'm you can call me weird if

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.230 
this what I'm you can call me weird if
you<00:02:16.959> want<00:02:17.200> because<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:18.040> way<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.760> memorized<00:02:19.210> it

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
you want because the way I memorized it

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.790 
you want because the way I memorized it
is<00:02:19.450> kind<00:02:19.630> of<00:02:19.660> weird<00:02:19.840> what<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.860> works

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
is kind of weird what it works

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.340 
is kind of weird what it works
um<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:22.460> call<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:23.180> like<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.720> highway<00:02:24.140> or

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
um I call this like a highway or

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.180 
um I call this like a highway or
something<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.900> like<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:27.380> then<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:27.920> yellow

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
something so like and then the yellow

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.020 
something so like and then the yellow
beep<00:02:28.820> guys<00:02:29.390> are<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.660> people<00:02:30.730> so<00:02:32.230> um<00:02:33.880> what<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:34.910> do

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
beep guys are the people so um what I do

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.500 
beep guys are the people so um what I do
is<00:02:35.210> like<00:02:35.270> you<00:02:36.020> slice<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.410> down<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.330> then<00:02:38.330> I'm

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
is like you slice it down and then I'm

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.540 
is like you slice it down and then I'm
one<00:02:38.990> guy<00:02:39.170> gets<00:02:39.590> off<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:39.890> highway<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.370> then

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
one guy gets off the highway and then

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.150 
one guy gets off the highway and then
they<00:02:40.910> get<00:02:41.090> split<00:02:41.330> up<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.530> slice<00:02:42.800> it<00:02:42.950> again

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
they get split up and you slice it again

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.580 
they get split up and you slice it again
and<00:02:43.400> then<00:02:44.180> this<00:02:44.390> guy<00:02:44.570> gets<00:02:45.110> off<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.350> highway

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
and then this guy gets off the highway

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.110 
and then this guy gets off the highway
as<00:02:45.770> sky<00:02:46.520> goes<00:02:46.730> in<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.600> then<00:02:48.160> slice<00:02:49.160> it<00:02:49.190> down<00:02:49.400> he

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
as sky goes in and then slice it down he

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.810 
as sky goes in and then slice it down he
goes<00:02:50.240> in<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:50.720> getting<00:02:50.930> rid<00:02:51.050> of<00:02:51.140> that<00:02:51.260> guy<00:02:51.820> but

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
goes in and getting rid of that guy but

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.940 
goes in and getting rid of that guy but
I<00:02:52.850> slice<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:53.450> again<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.050> then<00:02:54.440> he<00:02:54.590> gets<00:02:54.710> back

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
I slice it again and then he gets back

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.600 
I slice it again and then he gets back
on<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.130> highway<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:56.920> then<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.070> slice<00:02:58.400> it

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
on the highway and then you slice it

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.190 
on the highway and then you slice it
again<00:02:58.910> and<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:01.760> want<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:02.090> guy<00:03:02.240> to<00:03:02.630> match<00:03:02.990> it

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
again and you want that guy to match it

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.900 
again and you want that guy to match it
up<00:03:03.290> with<00:03:03.380> that<00:03:03.650> guy<00:03:03.770> again<00:03:05.350> so<00:03:06.350> now<00:03:07.250> let's

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
up with that guy again so now let's

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.120 
up with that guy again so now let's
together<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.480> then<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.710> want<00:03:09.860> them<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.040> go

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
together and then you want them to go

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.840 
together and then you want them to go
back<00:03:10.310> up<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.970> then<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.650> then<00:03:16.460> the<00:03:16.550> two<00:03:16.700> that

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
back up and then and then the two that

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.480 
back up and then and then the two that
worm<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.270> then<00:03:17.420> this<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:18.410> d2<00:03:18.770> is<00:03:19.010> optional

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
worm and then this the d2 is optional

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.630 
worm and then this the d2 is optional
because<00:03:19.610> um<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:21.860> two<00:03:22.010> that<00:03:22.220> one<00:03:22.370> messed<00:03:22.520> up

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
because um the two that one messed up

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.430 
because um the two that one messed up
before<00:03:22.730> that<00:03:23.660> were<00:03:23.750> over<00:03:23.870> here<00:03:24.080> or<00:03:24.260> over<00:03:24.290> here

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
before that were over here or over here

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.500 
before that were over here or over here
now<00:03:24.710> so<00:03:25.430> if<00:03:25.520> you<00:03:25.640> want<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:25.880> to<00:03:26.000> be<00:03:26.090> in<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.360> same

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
now so if you want it to be in the same

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.270 
now so if you want it to be in the same
place<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.780> us<00:03:26.900> before<00:03:26.989> we<00:03:27.200> have<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:27.500> do<00:03:27.770> the<00:03:27.950> d2

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
place to us before we have to do the d2

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.610 
place to us before we have to do the d2
but<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.030> t2<00:03:29.270> is<00:03:29.300> optional<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:29.959> don't<00:03:30.170> even<00:03:30.260> use

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
but the t2 is optional I don't even use

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.010 
but the t2 is optional I don't even use
the<00:03:30.830> T<00:03:30.950> 2<00:03:31.130> i'm<00:03:31.730> just<00:03:32.239> skiing<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:32.690> for<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.870> sake

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
the T 2 i'm just skiing it for the sake

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.840 
the T 2 i'm just skiing it for the sake
of<00:03:33.050> this<00:03:33.170> tutorial<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.800> that's<00:03:34.670> how<00:03:34.790> you

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
of this tutorial and that's how you

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.540 
of this tutorial and that's how you
solve<00:03:35.090> LS<00:03:35.540> later

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.560 

now<00:03:41.550> for<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.510> middle<00:03:42.750> layer<00:03:42.930> um<00:03:43.650> in<00:03:44.570> the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
now for the middle layer um in the

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.020 
now for the middle layer um in the
beginning<00:03:45.690> I<00:03:45.930> said<00:03:46.140> there<00:03:46.260> was<00:03:46.350> only<00:03:47.030> three

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
beginning I said there was only three

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.790 
beginning I said there was only three
algorithms<00:03:48.180> yeah<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:48.780> lied<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:49.140> think<00:03:49.650> there's

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
algorithms yeah I lied I think there's

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.460 
algorithms yeah I lied I think there's
like<00:03:50.090> four<00:03:51.090> or<00:03:51.210> five<00:03:51.240> but<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:52.020> doesn't<00:03:52.230> matter

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
like four or five but it doesn't matter

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.280 
like four or five but it doesn't matter
it<00:03:52.620> these<00:03:52.770> are<00:03:52.920> really<00:03:53.040> short<00:03:53.690> if<00:03:54.690> you<00:03:55.020> have<00:03:55.170> in

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
it these are really short if you have in

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.740 
it these are really short if you have in
this<00:03:55.350> case<00:03:55.610> or<00:03:56.610> it's<00:03:56.790> all<00:03:56.910> solved<00:03:57.360> with<00:03:57.510> this

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
this case or it's all solved with this

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.590 
this case or it's all solved with this
and<00:03:58.260> this<00:03:58.590> is<00:03:58.650> switch<00:03:59.060> the<00:04:00.060> algorithm<00:04:00.450> for

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
and this is switch the algorithm for

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.340 
and this is switch the algorithm for
this<00:04:00.720> is<00:04:00.960> slice<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:03.110> slice<00:04:04.110> me<00:04:04.770> to<00:04:06.350> slice

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
this is slice you to slice me to slice

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.400 
this is slice you to slice me to slice
you<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:09.440> then<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.530> solved<00:04:11.540> okay<00:04:12.540> when<00:04:13.290> you

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
you to and then it solved okay when you

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.550 
you to and then it solved okay when you
have<00:04:13.590> this<00:04:13.950> case<00:04:14.300> where<00:04:15.300> the<00:04:15.750> middle<00:04:16.019> is<00:04:16.260> all

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
have this case where the middle is all

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:28.640 
have this case where the middle is all
messed<00:04:16.769> up<00:04:20.780> what<00:04:21.780> you<00:04:21.870> do<00:04:22.049> is<00:04:23.870> slice<00:04:24.870> em<00:04:27.650> slice

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
messed up what you do is slice em slice

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:41.810 
messed up what you do is slice em slice
em<00:04:33.110> plus<00:04:34.110> em<00:04:36.770> slice<00:04:37.770> em<00:04:39.290> and<00:04:40.460> that<00:04:41.460> will<00:04:41.670> either

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
em plus em slice em and that will either

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.210 
em plus em slice em and that will either
bring<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.420> to<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.590> case<00:04:43.830> i<00:04:43.980> showed<00:04:44.160> you

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
bring you to the case i showed you

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.250 
bring you to the case i showed you
before<00:04:44.340> or<00:04:45.210> to<00:04:46.050> this<00:04:46.200> case<00:04:46.440> or<00:04:46.890> it'll<00:04:47.370> solve<00:04:47.580> it

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
before or to this case or it'll solve it

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.680 
before or to this case or it'll solve it
now<00:04:49.260> when<00:04:49.680> you<00:04:49.770> get<00:04:49.890> this<00:04:50.040> case<00:04:50.419> when<00:04:51.419> there's

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
now when you get this case when there's

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.630 
now when you get this case when there's
two<00:04:52.140> on<00:04:52.470> each<00:04:52.710> side<00:04:52.740> that<00:04:53.100> need<00:04:53.220> to<00:04:53.280> be<00:04:53.310> flipped

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
two on each side that need to be flipped

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.970 
two on each side that need to be flipped
but<00:04:54.240> when<00:04:54.360> you<00:04:54.450> just<00:04:54.630> remove<00:04:54.900> it<00:04:55.050> it<00:04:55.620> messes<00:04:55.830> up

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
but when you just remove it it messes up

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.450 
but when you just remove it it messes up
the<00:04:56.040> other<00:04:56.190> two<00:04:57.530> this<00:04:58.530> algorithm<00:04:58.830> is<00:04:59.280> only

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
the other two this algorithm is only

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:25.739 
the other two this algorithm is only
three<00:05:00.000> moves<00:05:00.180> it's<00:05:01.760> slice<00:05:03.020> em<00:05:05.060> 2<00:05:06.410> plus

00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:25.749 

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:28.149 

the<00:05:26.749> final<00:05:27.050> part<00:05:27.169> of<00:05:27.259> this<00:05:27.349> tutorial<00:05:27.830> is<00:05:27.949> just

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:28.159 
the final part of this tutorial is just

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:30.159 
the final part of this tutorial is just
going<00:05:28.249> to<00:05:28.309> be<00:05:28.369> all<00:05:28.550> walk<00:05:28.729> through<00:05:28.909> salt<00:05:29.179> if<00:05:29.839> you

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
going to be all walk through salt if you

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.139 
going to be all walk through salt if you
think<00:05:30.379> you<00:05:30.469> can<00:05:30.619> already<00:05:30.770> solve<00:05:31.099> it<00:05:31.249> solve<00:05:31.999> you

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:32.149 
think you can already solve it solve you

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:35.379 
think you can already solve it solve you
two<00:05:32.360> by<00:05:32.479> two<00:05:32.539> by<00:05:32.629> three<00:05:32.959> then<00:05:33.999> you're<00:05:34.999> fine<00:05:35.179> you

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
two by two by three then you're fine you

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.209 
two by two by three then you're fine you
don't<00:05:35.449> need<00:05:35.629> to<00:05:35.689> watch<00:05:35.779> this<00:05:36.050> but<00:05:36.319> you<00:05:37.069> might

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:37.219 
don't need to watch this but you might

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:40.989 
don't need to watch this but you might
just<00:05:37.339> want<00:05:37.550> to<00:05:37.580> watch<00:05:37.669> it<00:05:37.729> um<00:05:39.879> we're<00:05:40.879> learning

00:05:40.989 --> 00:05:40.999 
just want to watch it um we're learning

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:43.480 
just want to watch it um we're learning
now<00:05:41.990> normally<00:05:42.770> what<00:05:42.919> i<00:05:42.949> would<00:05:43.099> do<00:05:43.189> in<00:05:43.399> this

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
now normally what i would do in this

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.100 
now normally what i would do in this
case<00:05:43.669> is<00:05:43.729> since<00:05:44.209> this<00:05:44.330> is<00:05:44.479> all<00:05:44.569> messed<00:05:44.749> up<00:05:44.929> like

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
case is since this is all messed up like

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.269 
case is since this is all messed up like
I<00:05:45.379> would<00:05:45.529> just<00:05:45.709> um<00:05:46.389> bring<00:05:47.389> my<00:05:47.919> white<00:05:48.919> corner

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:49.279 
I would just um bring my white corner

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:51.969 
I would just um bring my white corner
down<00:05:49.569> using<00:05:50.569> that<00:05:51.199> algorithm<00:05:51.469> i<00:05:51.769> showed<00:05:51.919> you

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
down using that algorithm i showed you

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.529 
down using that algorithm i showed you
before<00:05:52.300> but<00:05:53.300> um<00:05:54.159> 44<00:05:55.159> learning<00:05:55.459> for<00:05:56.300> teaching

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
before but um 44 learning for teaching

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.909 
before but um 44 learning for teaching
purposes<00:05:56.569> i'm<00:05:57.110> just<00:05:57.409> gonna<00:05:57.499> sell<00:05:57.769> vlsi<00:05:58.219> first

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
purposes i'm just gonna sell vlsi first

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.579 
purposes i'm just gonna sell vlsi first
ok<00:06:00.919> so<00:06:01.069> my<00:06:02.029> yellow<00:06:02.389> and<00:06:02.749> my<00:06:02.839> red<00:06:03.050> I<00:06:03.289> want<00:06:03.439> to<00:06:03.499> get

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:03.589 
ok so my yellow and my red I want to get

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:07.659 
ok so my yellow and my red I want to get
the<00:06:03.919> ill<00:06:04.039> on<00:06:04.189> red<00:06:04.369> corner<00:06:05.499> put<00:06:06.499> it<00:06:06.589> right<00:06:06.830> above

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
the ill on red corner put it right above

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:12.669 
the ill on red corner put it right above
here<00:06:09.069> bring<00:06:10.069> it<00:06:10.129> down<00:06:10.719> another<00:06:11.719> yellow<00:06:12.499> and

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:12.679 
here bring it down another yellow and

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:16.899 
here bring it down another yellow and
blue<00:06:14.889> over<00:06:15.889> here<00:06:15.919> you<00:06:16.399> can<00:06:16.550> just<00:06:16.580> bring<00:06:16.849> that

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:16.909 
blue over here you can just bring that

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:22.449 
blue over here you can just bring that
back<00:06:17.149> up<00:06:17.300> and<00:06:18.610> put<00:06:19.610> it<00:06:19.729> above<00:06:19.969> that<00:06:20.149> and<00:06:21.459> those

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:22.459 
back up and put it above that and those

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:24.429 
back up and put it above that and those
two<00:06:22.639> are<00:06:22.699> already<00:06:22.909> met<00:06:23.059> matched<00:06:24.019> up<00:06:24.229> so<00:06:24.379> I

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:24.439 
two are already met matched up so I

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:27.790 
two are already met matched up so I
don't<00:06:24.619> need<00:06:24.740> to<00:06:24.949> do<00:06:25.579> that<00:06:25.610> thing<00:06:26.529> so<00:06:27.529> I<00:06:27.559> have<00:06:27.709> my

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
don't need to do that thing so I have my

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.040 
don't need to do that thing so I have my
first<00:06:27.979> layer<00:06:28.159> solved<00:06:29.379> so<00:06:30.849> now<00:06:31.849> I<00:06:32.269> need<00:06:32.930> to

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
first layer solved so now I need to

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.379 
first layer solved so now I need to
switch<00:06:33.259> these<00:06:33.379> two<00:06:33.439> um<00:06:35.050> ok<00:06:36.050> so<00:06:37.180> I'm<00:06:38.180> going<00:06:38.360> to

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389 
switch these two um ok so I'm going to

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:44.109 
switch these two um ok so I'm going to
speed<00:06:38.599> my<00:06:38.689> algorithm<00:06:41.289> or<00:06:42.289> hand<00:06:42.519> recite<00:06:43.519> the

00:06:44.109 --> 00:06:44.119 
speed my algorithm or hand recite the

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:53.980 
speed my algorithm or hand recite the
little<00:06:44.389> trick<00:06:44.599> in<00:06:44.689> my<00:06:44.779> head

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.470 

and<00:06:54.990> the<00:06:55.350> middle<00:06:55.590> air<00:06:55.970> and<00:06:56.970> you<00:06:57.150> leave<00:06:57.360> that

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:57.480 
and the middle air and you leave that

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:04.790 
and the middle air and you leave that
thing<00:07:00.170> okay<00:07:01.170> so<00:07:01.770> i<00:07:03.200> hope<00:07:04.200> this<00:07:04.320> helped<00:07:04.620> and

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
thing okay so i hope this helped and

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:13.290 
thing okay so i hope this helped and
thank<00:07:05.640> you<00:07:05.700> for<00:07:05.880> watching

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.360
