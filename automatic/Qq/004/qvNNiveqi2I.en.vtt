00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.909
 This ensures we have the next guests and healthier income 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:14.599

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:16.999
 makes a worn-out honor 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:23.329
 Anna comes out there and he is amazed that even 2 declan hard one is 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.409
 for one more and none for Mandla's own so it was legit before a few 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.409
 Years too and the routers follow us on this tradition 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.800
 18 three 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.870

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.200
 Corresponding KSC is a sample-abo break that has an object money with us 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.450
 It was also considerably off the table you dive into the arbor 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.080
 you dive think 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.680
 Jalloh IBM 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.280
 the this year still behind him the bank is not in Germany 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.770

 Tobe offered 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.009
 also underpasses here occurs the immigration task force gives Dr 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.740
 has it of course 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 examined the question 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.610
 Tichon and furniture that is his 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.890
 hans-peter Mayer 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.950
 the Vilmaris Neustar Euro 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.070
 and we also have Steve Kelly parts for me 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.070
 Unfortunately they do not see it but are quoted as saying 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.280
 we show that helped the diesel has been colorful 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.700
 who set idea come with construction supervision 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.750
 i had last year i was in a delle and celebrate two years 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.860
 next door 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.140
 Yes, Water White lies in the full meaning of the series 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.700
 she necessarily and has 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.420
 she simply asked again if it would be possible less than six percent 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.840
 if this is only one-time, it remains that his party, even if he is still 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.260
 This evening 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
 then we are actually exclusive 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.070
 the current ones 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.070
 is there a story about it? 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.410
 so 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.920
 All well so if name is well on the processes 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:11.050
 1 Civil Code 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.050
 That's a serious development of Ebba 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.709
 Trawniki check 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.329
 it is exactly misplaced 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.029
 you are 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:24.029
 actually Noma also in appearance 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.969
 but if you see different Keesing next to you 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.949
 you suddenly notice Haupt 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:35.459
 the tables have frost and the buys buy research center 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.169
 16 goal 2 assists 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:40.439
 In this example, Essene's doctors 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.760
 the Swiss Jungstar Notes and that is actually the cut injuries 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.889
 of great aesthetic and that in two parts only the team enjoys it very much 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.239
 beautiful pictures 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.509
 that's the special thing about it each 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:57.989
 the voice is rough and therefore at the skiflug corpse that is logically believed 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.049
 that her prayer was believed is also a test 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.890
 the whole collection come behind the gate 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.650
 the 7 percent small series or introspective 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.639
 and that's just the special one 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.659
 BYD Eddie Leung with 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.769
 Here's a creeping one-man operation in Lucerne with me 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.590
 Collaboration is easy and producers 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.409
 that we made completely in Switzerland 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.030
 There is also "always the Dutch the preferential papers at the 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.129
 Surface and noisy around and solar cell is of course my style 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.659
 Alkis the stainless steel or you can not see why 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.640
 I the strikes have sentenced him dead 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.160
 in the contours and Dawid only on mouse made that is small 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.510
 my work and the surfaces that are just as equal to five professionals 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.510
 could Force10 m5000 Samantha actually 

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:49.759
 into self-employment 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:54.259
 Forster cement from them are very exclusive about either way they are 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:55.689
 not at the tour 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:00.069
 one encounters the daily round almost more important and not alone on the 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.620
 Spur Theodor Storm and I believe and that is actually one 

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:06.889
 Collaborate with four times 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.889
 where you could save that expenses 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.109
 you have to be running 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.109
 myself said this also Zieschang the in 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.329
 because it makes both cool together 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:23.569
 because you do not prescribe 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:25.809
 where does the ideas come from? 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:27.610
 we see a video here 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.750
 in every year to a completely synonymous with a trailer at 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.919
 none 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.949
 the same as the eyes 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.430
 still stands out 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.800
 I'm just the one you accept the visible 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.849
 And to inspire all sorts of possible livelihoods guaranteed throughout the country 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:48.330
 so it now feels a very difficult question 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.480
 How can I ask her job only difficult questions that is our specialty 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.270
 but the people 8 have reduced rates 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.349
 they help when EHC could hit smaller and place 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.540
 Babette's paragraph in life a favorite Bates is surely the 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.529
 the desire to respond to the entry 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:08.089
 one hardly 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:09.279
 she should 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:14.000
 a personal light a personal ambience rigid times 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 83 very important role 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.039
 how do you bring now 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.689
 in a bower are the dust of the Mainova and occupied rank 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.110
 what is that is completely 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.059
 what is possible 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:32.059
 you can not generalize that 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.569
 individually leave depending on 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:39.620
 in which direction you do not want the Mini now 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.110
 each little Edgar better a frame ball and they wanted this lamp 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.900
 simply reduce even more 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.979
 with a weird year 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.909
 leave the starting point until this lamp 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:51.839
 also with all other countries 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:54.360
 there the starting point was quite different 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.169
 So that's not the last in the gaddafi opponents individually were none 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.169
 History is important Children from the day care center St 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:03.210
 both fell 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.050
 I want my furniture and Christian Turck with the light we will aim 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.900
 be counted 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.689
 this is not going on anymore 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:15.049
 Undertaker and the flexibility of the Berghain an important aspect and the 

00:06:15.049 --> 00:06:18.189
 he reads that has come with the highlights of adjustability 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:21.569
 Altar space for use from actually yes one 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:24.010
 an important aspect of this product etc 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.580
 that is of course correct and a small Spindelegger a common 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.440
 development 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.800
 Volker Mester the lecturer consumer can hardly believe it 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.800
 the fight to the ground can be determined 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:40.419
 I'm from the clubs and I think that's exactly what is required 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:41.960
 like his vessels 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.979
 Felix i believe IT 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:46.969
 this is an expression of 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:48.900
 consumer 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.720
 Some of us had the design options we have, of course 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.070
 nice with these 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.930
 lamps 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.159
 you just bring it up as you need it 

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:03.279
 Euro came 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:08.110
 a final word 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.409
 wegberg -eck on the job market 

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:13.020
 the association achieved culture represented locally 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.500
 for whom is to be aligned in the happy family 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.339
 Hamilton is crazy about value 

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:22.069
 the first is in series a and c 

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:24.249
 Pakistan offers 

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:29.020
 I think that's a really good one on behalf of the one station of the guests 

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:31.360
 invited 92 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.910
 that is silent from the forum 

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.819
 and Escobar like out 

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:38.520
 congratulations 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.849
 in the air 

00:07:39.849 --> 00:07:40.210
 Oh whatever
