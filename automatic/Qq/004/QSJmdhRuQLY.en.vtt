00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
Pistons back in and then you get to the

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.970 
Pistons back in and then you get to the
point<00:00:58.579> where<00:00:58.789> hey<00:00:59.120> my<00:01:00.109> screwdriver<00:01:00.620> isn't

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
point where hey my screwdriver isn't

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.700 
point where hey my screwdriver isn't
wide<00:01:01.129> enough<00:01:01.160> to<00:01:01.699> do<00:01:01.999> anymore<00:01:02.350> so<00:01:03.350> what<00:01:03.469> I<00:01:03.499> did

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
wide enough to do anymore so what I did

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.069 
wide enough to do anymore so what I did
which<00:01:03.859> is<00:01:03.980> just<00:01:04.100> took<00:01:04.250> a<00:01:04.400> wrench<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:04.939> I<00:01:05.869> laid

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:06.079 
which is just took a wrench and I laid

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.300 
which is just took a wrench and I laid
it<00:01:06.110> in<00:01:06.320> here<00:01:06.650> on<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:07.729> left<00:01:07.939> hand<00:01:08.119> side<00:01:08.240> like<00:01:08.600> so

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
it in here on the left hand side like so

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.700 
it in here on the left hand side like so
and<00:01:10.310> then<00:01:10.340> I<00:01:10.520> used<00:01:10.759> that<00:01:11.000> against<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:12.200> pad<00:01:12.409> and

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
and then I used that against the pad and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.260 
and then I used that against the pad and
I<00:01:12.860> gave<00:01:13.040> me<00:01:13.159> more<00:01:13.340> room<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:13.549> I<00:01:13.759> was<00:01:13.880> able<00:01:13.939> to<00:01:14.150> get

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
I gave me more room so I was able to get

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.460 
I gave me more room so I was able to get
both<00:01:14.390> those<00:01:14.659> out<00:01:14.810> took<00:01:15.049> me<00:01:15.140> about<00:01:15.229> five

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
both those out took me about five

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.990 
both those out took me about five
minutes<00:01:15.500> to<00:01:15.890> get<00:01:16.009> them<00:01:16.189> both<00:01:16.310> pushed<00:01:16.610> back<00:01:16.790> in

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
minutes to get them both pushed back in

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.700 
minutes to get them both pushed back in
but<00:01:17.210> had<00:01:17.810> I<00:01:17.899> known<00:01:18.020> about<00:01:18.049> this<00:01:18.320> little<00:01:18.500> trick

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
but had I known about this little trick

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.590 
but had I known about this little trick
it<00:01:18.860> beforehand<00:01:19.399> I<00:01:19.579> would<00:01:19.880> have<00:01:20.060> been<00:01:20.240> able<00:01:20.329> to

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
it beforehand I would have been able to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.870 
it beforehand I would have been able to
do<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:20.930> a<00:01:20.960> little<00:01:21.079> quicker<00:01:21.640> so<00:01:22.640> we<00:01:22.759> can

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
do it a little quicker so we can

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.130 
do it a little quicker so we can
actually<00:01:23.000> take<00:01:23.299> we<00:01:23.600> have<00:01:23.720> no<00:01:23.840> more<00:01:23.960> use<00:01:24.110> for

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
actually take we have no more use for

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.899 
actually take we have no more use for
these<00:01:24.470> old<00:01:24.680> brake<00:01:24.890> pads<00:01:25.159> they<00:01:25.460> served<00:01:25.759> your

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
these old brake pads they served your

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.749 
these old brake pads they served your
purpose<00:01:26.119> well<00:01:26.890> got<00:01:27.890> me<00:01:28.009> to<00:01:28.100> stop<00:01:28.310> many<00:01:28.549> many

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
purpose well got me to stop many many

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.899 
purpose well got me to stop many many
times<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:30.009> they're<00:01:31.009> making<00:01:31.250> way<00:01:31.430> for<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.790> new

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
is actually on spring so you can just

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.410 
is actually on spring so you can just
kind<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.370> like<00:02:21.490> set<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.790> down<00:02:21.880> in<00:02:22.060> there<00:02:22.150> like

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
okay we put the spring it was getting

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.390 
okay we put the spring it was getting
crooked<00:02:43.439> i<00:02:43.500> guess<00:02:43.650> all<00:02:43.829> the<00:02:43.920> work<00:02:44.099> I<00:02:44.250> was<00:02:44.280> doing

in<00:02:44.640> there<00:02:44.819> okay<00:02:45.239> now<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.659> in<00:02:45.780> there<00:02:45.930> flat<00:02:46.519> and

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
in there okay now it's in there flat and

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.880 
in there okay now it's in there flat and
now<00:02:47.670> we<00:02:47.730> can<00:02:47.969> work<00:02:48.120> on<00:02:48.269> putting<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.650> pads<00:02:49.650> back

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
now we can work on putting the pads back

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.710 
now we can work on putting the pads back
in<00:02:51.560> flat<00:02:52.560> here<00:02:52.939> this<00:02:53.939> does<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.180> real<00:02:54.359> pain<00:02:54.599> in

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
in flat here this does a real pain in

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.940 
in flat here this does a real pain in
the<00:02:54.750> butt<00:02:54.989> when<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.379> it<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.590> first<00:02:55.769> time

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
the butt when you do it the first time

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.289 
the butt when you do it the first time
just<00:02:56.189> because<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.609> don't<00:02:56.730> know<00:02:56.939> what<00:02:57.120> to

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
just because you don't know what to

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.390 
just because you don't know what to
expect<00:02:57.329> other<00:02:57.959> than<00:02:58.140> what<00:02:58.290> you've<00:02:58.409> read<00:02:58.650> and

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
expect other than what you've read and

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.679 
expect other than what you've read and
then<00:02:59.640> when<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.790> get<00:02:59.879> out<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.150> actually<00:03:00.299> doing

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
then when you get out to actually doing

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.960 
then when you get out to actually doing
it<00:03:00.900> it's<00:03:01.019> like<00:03:01.200> huh<00:03:01.549> nobody<00:03:02.549> told<00:03:02.760> me<00:03:02.879> about

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
it it's like huh nobody told me about

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.809 
it it's like huh nobody told me about
this<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:03.989> this<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.069> one<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.400> reason<00:03:05.670> why<00:03:05.700> I

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
this so this is one of the reason why I

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.250 
this so this is one of the reason why I
like<00:03:06.030> doing<00:03:06.239> these<00:03:06.359> little<00:03:06.540> videos<00:03:06.780> because

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
like doing these little videos because

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.319
