00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.230 
thanking it's got a slightly higher top
speed<00:01:27.960> as<00:01:28.409> well<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:29.430> great<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:29.759> offroad

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
speed as well it's great for offroad

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.550 
speed as well it's great for offroad
then<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.509> holds<00:01:30.659> its<00:01:30.900> ground<00:01:30.930> really<00:01:31.320> well

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
then it holds its ground really well

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.410 
then it holds its ground really well
it's<00:01:31.710> got<00:01:31.860> some<00:01:32.009> amazing<00:01:32.250> traction<00:01:32.700> huge

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
it's got some amazing traction huge

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.719 
it's got some amazing traction huge
amounts<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.840> torque<00:01:34.280> much<00:01:35.280> more<00:01:35.520> than<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
amounts of torque much more than the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.910 
amounts of torque much more than the
shanking<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.450> because<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> guy<00:01:37.259> doesn't

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
shanking and because the guy doesn't

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.010 
shanking and because the guy doesn't
like<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.250> top<00:01:38.460> or<00:01:38.490> suspension<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.509> reacts<00:01:39.900> with

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
like a top or suspension it reacts with

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.170 
like a top or suspension it reacts with
rough<00:01:40.560> terrain<00:01:40.890> one<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.310> shanking<00:01:41.729> making<00:01:42.060> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
rough terrain one the shanking making it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.160 
rough terrain one the shanking making it
harder<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.450> offroad

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
harder to offroad

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.139 
harder to offroad
whereas<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.979> sand<00:01:44.250> king<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.640> got<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> soft

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
whereas the sand king it's got a soft

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.580 
whereas the sand king it's got a soft
suspension<00:01:45.630> with<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> higher<00:01:46.020> ride<00:01:46.350> height

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
suspension with a higher ride height

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.410 
suspension with a higher ride height
which<00:01:46.860> makes<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.490> much<00:01:47.640> easier<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:48.180> maneuver

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
which makes it much easier to maneuver

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.749 
which makes it much easier to maneuver
of<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.840> tricky<00:01:49.170> terrain

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
of a tricky terrain

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.660 
of a tricky terrain
now<00:01:50.759> despite<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:52.590> sand<00:01:52.890> king<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.250> really

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
now despite that the sand king is really

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.149 
now despite that the sand king is really
bouncy<00:01:54.509> because<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.930> its<00:01:55.049> soft<00:01:55.259> suspension<00:01:55.860> so

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
bouncy because of its soft suspension so

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.410 
bouncy because of its soft suspension so
when<00:01:56.340> you're<00:01:56.490> going<00:01:56.610> really<00:01:56.939> quickly<00:01:57.329> over

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
when you're going really quickly over

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.910 
when you're going really quickly over
some<00:01:57.630> tough<00:01:57.840> terrain<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.740> sort<00:01:58.890> of

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
some tough terrain you just sort of

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.319 
some tough terrain you just sort of
bouncing<00:01:59.369> off<00:01:59.460> everything<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.030> hard<00:02:00.090> to

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
bouncing off everything it's hard to

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.600 
bouncing off everything it's hard to
hold<00:02:00.630> your<00:02:00.869> ground<00:02:00.960> whereas<00:02:01.890> The<00:02:02.070> Guardian

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
hold your ground whereas The Guardian

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.069 
hold your ground whereas The Guardian
you<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:02.969> just<00:02:03.149> sort<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.420> go<00:02:03.659> over<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:03.960> all

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
you can just sort of go over it all

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.350 
you can just sort of go over it all
really<00:02:04.320> quickly<00:02:04.829> on<00:02:05.310> unless<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.880> obviously

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
really quickly on unless you obviously

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.270 
really quickly on unless you obviously
hit<00:02:06.780> something<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.500> tough<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:08.069> get<00:02:08.220> off

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
hit something really tough to get off

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.650 
hit something really tough to get off
