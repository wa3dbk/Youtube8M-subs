an<00:01:53.549> amazing<00:01:54.000> difference<00:01:54.329> between<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.229> prices

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
an amazing difference between the prices

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.550 
an amazing difference between the prices
of<00:01:56.009> different<00:01:56.759> solar<00:01:57.030> panels<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:58.140> find<00:01:58.380> out

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
of different solar panels to find out

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.319 
of different solar panels to find out
why<00:01:58.829> they<00:01:59.070> are<00:01:59.100> different<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.880> really<00:02:00.149> need

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
why they are different you really need

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.420 
why they are different you really need
to<00:02:00.450> step<00:02:00.689> back<00:02:00.960> into<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.590> manufacturing

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
to step back into that manufacturing

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.609 
to step back into that manufacturing
process<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.270> see<00:02:03.479> what<00:02:04.020> you're<00:02:04.229> looking<00:02:04.500> at

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
process you see what you're looking at

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.639 
process you see what you're looking at
here<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.700> man-made<00:02:06.420> crystal<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.619> is

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
here is a man-made crystal that is

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.889 
here is a man-made crystal that is
essentially<00:02:08.580> grown<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.300> they<00:02:09.390> grow<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
essentially grown so they grow the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.750 
essentially grown so they grow the
crystal<00:02:10.110> then<00:02:10.830> they<00:02:11.009> slice<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.340> up<00:02:11.610> into

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
crystal then they slice it up into

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.880 
crystal then they slice it up into
pieces<00:02:12.120> at<00:02:12.450> once<00:02:12.660> those<00:02:12.870> solar<00:02:13.200> cells

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
pieces at once those solar cells

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.490 
pieces at once those solar cells
all<00:02:14.010> sliced<00:02:14.430> up<00:02:14.790> there<00:02:15.330> then<00:02:15.570> tested<00:02:16.200> for

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
all sliced up there then tested for

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.980 
all sliced up there then tested for
efficiency<00:02:17.430> now<00:02:17.730> some<00:02:18.180> products<00:02:18.630> like<00:02:18.840> your

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
efficiency now some products like your

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.540 
efficiency now some products like your
little<00:02:19.110> garden<00:02:19.590> lights<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:19.980> put<00:02:20.160> around<00:02:20.370> your

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
little garden lights you put around your

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.640 
little garden lights you put around your
house<00:02:20.760> they<00:02:21.510> can<00:02:21.750> handle<00:02:22.110> being<00:02:22.320> why

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
house they can handle being why

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.910 
house they can handle being why
efficiency<00:02:23.280> off<00:02:23.430> cuts<00:02:23.850> now<00:02:24.300> Redick<00:02:24.810> only<00:02:25.560> use

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
efficiency off cuts now Redick only use

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.760 
efficiency off cuts now Redick only use
high<00:02:26.460> grade<00:02:26.880> cells<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:27.660> essentially<00:02:28.290> you're

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
high grade cells so essentially you're

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.580 
high grade cells so essentially you're
getting<00:02:29.250> exactly<00:02:30.030> what<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:30.750> paid<00:02:31.020> for<00:02:31.050> but

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
getting exactly what you paid for but

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.740 
getting exactly what you paid for but
the<00:02:31.710> efficiency<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.490> that<00:02:32.520> solar<00:02:33.000> panel<00:02:33.360> isn't

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
the efficiency of that solar panel isn't

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.870 
the efficiency of that solar panel isn't
the<00:02:33.960> only<00:02:34.170> thing<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.770> need<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:34.980> look<00:02:35.310> at<00:02:35.550> you

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
the only thing you need to look at you

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.610 
the only thing you need to look at you
also<00:02:36.090> want<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.540> look<00:02:36.660> at<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.930> overall

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
also want to look at the overall

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.490 
also want to look at the overall
structural<00:02:38.340> efficiency<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:40.110> portable

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
structural efficiency of the portable

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.440 
structural efficiency of the portable
solar<00:02:40.890> panel<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.910> want<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.270> make<00:02:42.420> sure

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
solar panel so you want to make sure

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.290 
solar panel so you want to make sure
that<00:02:42.930> it's<00:02:43.080> got<00:02:43.290> strong<00:02:43.709> support<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.760> hinges

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
that it's got strong support the hinges

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.080 
that it's got strong support the hinges
are<00:02:45.810> tidy<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.620> really<00:02:47.010> strong<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.790> want

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
are tidy and really strong and you want

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.780 
are tidy and really strong and you want
to<00:02:48.150> make<00:02:48.300> sure<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.990> materials<00:02:49.680> used<00:02:50.130> are

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
to make sure that the materials used are

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.570 
to make sure that the materials used are
