00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:40.260
 tried to figure it out at all 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.550

 depicted a completely different car bp 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.080

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.670
 although the numbers of the region as 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.000

 there are very many people here 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.009
 except that in the morning they are here with 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.789
 last night and all due to the fact that 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.120
 the helpline indicated in the receipt 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.620
 simply not available it turns out not 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.840

 such a question today 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:43.650
 of course in the world of women after 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.349

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.359
 getting into the office to a specialist 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.180

 Sergey hooks could still get his wife 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.669

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.540
 Having examined the documents of the applicant send him 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.290
