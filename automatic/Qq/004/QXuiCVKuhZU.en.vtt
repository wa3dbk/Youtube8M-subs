00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.029
 and metabolic nurses like the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.670
 Type 2 diabetes and obesity no doubt 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.680
 some are stronger in Mexico and 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.000
 also in Latin America 'however 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.890
 science confirms that both 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.079
 diseases that are linked to 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.540
 bad eating habits and in addition to 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.640
 have a sedentary lifestyle now you know by 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.469
 science that there is a new kind of 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.840
 type 3 diabetes that is also 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.700
 linked to excess carbohydrates and 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.590
 sugars but what are the reactions 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.879
 and what are the consequences of this 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.260
 well then according to a 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.530
 research done by the doctor 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.079
 david bernier author of the book the brain 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.750
 of bread indicates that the worst enemy of the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.579
 humanity is gluten to make it a 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.590
 idea are not only those people 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.629
 who are gluten intolerant who are 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.700
 the so-called people who suffer the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.690
 celiac disease but above all 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.940
 there is a strong connection 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.580
 the amount of sugars they contain 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.590
 as the neuronal damage since it is known by 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.360
 example with the science that the excess of 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.860
 gluten in our body are going to 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.020
 affect the way of thinking 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.910
 remember and obviously they are also going to 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.250
 cause neuronal damage that can be 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.110
 irreversible hence the recommendation of the 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.270
 client we have better habits 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.190
 Foods that we consume vegetables 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.020
 proteins and we started to reduce the 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.910
 carbohydrates and sugars since 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.190
 invariably not only cause a 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.110
 damage at the physical level but also at the 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.180
 neuronal that remembers that there the 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.130
 consequences are fatal but if you 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.470
 still like raisins or cookies 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.210
 choose preferably those that are 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.970
 gluten-free this is not an equation 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.920
 fashionable but a reason and question of 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.920
 health if you want more information I will
