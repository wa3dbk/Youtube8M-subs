two<00:01:31.680> rubber<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> most<00:01:32.490> popular<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.150> we

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
two rubber is the most popular as we

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.870 
two rubber is the most popular as we

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
recommend to stainless braided hoses on

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.080 
recommend to stainless braided hoses on
the<00:01:36.000> high<00:01:36.270> pressure<00:01:36.630> lines<00:01:37.460> two<00:01:38.460> returns<00:01:38.820> can

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the high pressure lines two returns can

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.170 
the high pressure lines two returns can
be<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.299> rubber<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.140> actually<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.740> all<00:01:41.400> four

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
be in rubber we can actually do all four

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.249 
be in rubber we can actually do all four
in<00:01:42.270> rubber<00:01:42.509> but

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
in rubber but

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:45.959 
in rubber but
it's<00:01:44.649> not<00:01:44.829> that<00:01:44.950> much<00:01:45.100> cheaper<00:01:45.399> than<00:01:45.549> two

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
it's not that much cheaper than two

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.090 
it's not that much cheaper than two
stainless<00:01:46.539> and<00:01:46.719> it's<00:01:47.409> better<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.920> two

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
stainless and it's better that the two

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.249 
stainless and it's better that the two
hyperfine<00:01:48.549> lines<00:01:49.030> be<00:01:49.210> stainless<00:01:49.479> anyways<00:01:49.990> so

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
hyperfine lines be stainless anyways so

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.880 
hyperfine lines be stainless anyways so
that<00:01:50.820> makes<00:01:51.820> our<00:01:52.060> two<00:01:52.420> stainless<00:01:52.689> two<00:01:53.649> rubber

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
that makes our two stainless two rubber

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.380 
that makes our two stainless two rubber
