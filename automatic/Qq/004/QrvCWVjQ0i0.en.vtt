it's<00:04:25.160> got<00:04:25.640> a<00:04:25.850> million<00:04:26.450> leg<00:04:26.900> you<00:04:27.710> know<00:04:27.800> what

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
it's got a million leg you know what

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.580 
it's got a million leg you know what
let's<00:04:28.640> do<00:04:28.820> what<00:04:29.180> if<00:04:29.270> I<00:04:29.390> hit<00:04:29.720> with<00:04:29.870> my<00:04:30.020> flip-flop

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
let's do what if I hit with my flip-flop

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.750 
let's do what if I hit with my flip-flop
first<00:04:30.830> and<00:04:31.040> then<00:04:31.160> we'll<00:04:31.250> follow<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.580> ground

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
first and then we'll follow the ground

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.360 
first and then we'll follow the ground
and<00:04:31.940> then<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:32.150> can<00:04:32.300> smash<00:04:32.570> it<00:04:32.780> flip-flop<00:04:33.710> new

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
and then I can smash it flip-flop new

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.040 
and then I can smash it flip-flop new
balance<00:04:34.490> it's<00:04:35.330> gonna<00:04:35.450> be<00:04:35.570> deadly<00:04:35.810> combination

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
balance it's gonna be deadly combination
