00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.330 
design means it's going to plunge down
to<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.940> depth<00:00:45.180> really<00:00:45.420> quickly<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.559> some

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
to that depth really quickly so some

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.830 
to that depth really quickly so some
solid<00:00:47.730> cranks<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.239> handle<00:00:48.539> are<00:00:48.660> going<00:00:48.780> to

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
solid cranks of the handle are going to

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.510 
solid cranks of the handle are going to
get<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.170> little<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.559> dive<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.070> depth<00:00:50.340> I

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
get that little to dive to the depth I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.069 
get that little to dive to the depth I
want<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.969> then<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.719> hold<00:00:51.899> that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
get that lowered down to the bottom if

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.609 
get that lowered down to the bottom if
I'm<00:01:09.030> fishing<00:01:09.420> water<00:01:09.720> that's<00:01:09.990> less<00:01:10.200> than<00:01:10.229> 4

I'm fishing water that's less than 4

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.170 
I'm fishing water that's less than 4
meters<00:01:10.920> deep<00:01:11.100> I'm<00:01:11.580> going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.790> crank<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.119> down

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
meters deep I'm going to crank it down

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.179 
meters deep I'm going to crank it down
to<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> bottom<00:01:12.810> once<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.619> feel<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.040> lower

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
to the bottom once I feel that lower

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.380 
to the bottom once I feel that lower
hitting<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> bottom<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.090> going<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.330> be

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
hitting the bottom it's going to be

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.359 
hitting the bottom it's going to be
banging<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> big<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.470> bibs<00:01:16.740> designed<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
banging on the big the bibs designed to

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.030 
banging on the big the bibs designed to
deflect<00:01:17.939> snags<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.750> deflects<00:01:19.110> rocks<00:01:19.470> it's

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
deflect snags and deflects rocks it's

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.289 
deflect snags and deflects rocks it's
also<00:01:20.159> going<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.460> create<00:01:20.700> quite<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.030> lot<00:01:21.180> of

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
also going to create quite a lot of

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.600 
also going to create quite a lot of
noise<00:01:21.479> down<00:01:21.810> there<00:01:22.080> because<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.979> body<00:01:23.159> design

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
noise down there because the body design

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.280 
noise down there because the body design
is<00:01:23.820> made<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.150> bowl<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.750> very<00:01:24.960> high

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
is made of bowl so it's very high

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.499 
is made of bowl so it's very high
buoyancy<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.369> as<00:01:26.580> soon<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.000> start<00:01:27.299> feeling

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
buoyancy so as soon as I start feeling

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.179 
buoyancy so as soon as I start feeling
that<00:01:27.840> little<00:01:28.110> banging<00:01:28.500> into<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.770> bottom<00:01:29.100> or

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
that little banging into the bottom or
