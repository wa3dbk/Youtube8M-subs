currently<00:00:14.099> we're<00:00:14.250> using<00:00:14.280> ArchiCAD<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.509> model

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
currently we're using ArchiCAD to model

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.750 
currently we're using ArchiCAD to model
everything<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.920> that's<00:00:17.100> helping<00:00:17.369> us<00:00:17.550> with

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
everything so that's helping us with

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.300 
everything so that's helping us with
with<00:00:17.970> quantity<00:00:18.330> takeoffs<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.050> all<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.220> our

now error-free
relative<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.830> previous<00:00:26.460> times<00:00:26.880> when<00:00:27.150> we<00:00:27.269> would

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
relative to previous times when we would

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.230 
relative to previous times when we would
have<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:28.289> drawing<00:00:28.980> not<00:00:29.279> matching<00:00:29.820> some<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
have a drawing not matching some of the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.910 
have a drawing not matching some of the
part<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.599> drawings<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.199> creating

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
part of the drawings and creating

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.459 
part of the drawings and creating
problems<00:00:32.279> for<00:00:32.340> us<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.239> ark<00:00:33.360> attend<00:00:34.140> at<00:00:34.320> up

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
problems for us so the ark attend at up

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.160 
problems for us so the ark attend at up
and<00:00:34.620> helped<00:00:34.890> us<00:00:35.040> significantly<00:00:36.170> specifically

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
and helped us significantly specifically

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.240 
and helped us significantly specifically
on<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> latest<00:00:37.649> project<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.070> we're<00:00:38.219> working

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
on the latest project that we're working

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.880 
on the latest project that we're working
on<00:00:38.610> well<00:00:38.910> all<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.239> our<00:00:39.329> all<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.600> our<00:00:39.890> apartment

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
on well all of our all of our apartment

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.440 
on well all of our all of our apartment
buildings<00:00:41.190> have<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> component<00:00:42.120> that's

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
buildings have a component that's

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.420 
buildings have a component that's
affordable<00:00:42.840> housing<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.129> will<00:00:44.280> be

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
affordable housing on it so this will be

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.790 
affordable housing on it so this will be
on<00:00:44.670> 37<00:00:45.270> units<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.690> which<00:00:45.840> three<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.559> units

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
on 37 units of which three of the units

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.979 
on 37 units of which three of the units
will<00:00:46.920> be<00:00:47.390> affordable<00:00:48.390> housing<00:00:48.809> which

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
will be affordable housing which

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.260 
will be affordable housing which
basically<00:00:49.350> means<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.370> about<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.640> third<00:00:51.030> of

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
basically means it's about a third of

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.439 
basically means it's about a third of
the<00:00:51.449> cost<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> typical<00:00:53.129> housing<00:00:53.489> for

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the cost of the typical housing for

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.270 
the cost of the typical housing for
people<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.809> qualify<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.590> Greg<00:00:56.100> and

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
people that qualify for that Greg and

and now with the new release hopefully

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.080 
and now with the new release hopefully
it'll<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.199> rendered<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:02.190> ArchiCAD<00:01:02.760> which<00:01:02.969> will

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
it'll be rendered in ArchiCAD which will

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.670 
it'll be rendered in ArchiCAD which will
be<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> fat<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.600> know<00:01:03.690> fantastic<00:01:04.049> because<00:01:04.439> it's

be a fat you know fantastic because it's

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.770 
be a fat you know fantastic because it's
really<00:01:04.890> important<00:01:05.339> when<00:01:06.210> we<00:01:06.450> build<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
really important when we build the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.410 
really important when we build the
physical<00:01:07.229> models<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:08.420> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
physical models to have the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.760 
physical models to have the
differentiation<00:01:10.170> between<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.500> two

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
differentiation between the two

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.380 
differentiation between the two
materials<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.640> don't<00:01:11.790> usually<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.270> we

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
materials we don't usually do that we

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.260 
materials we don't usually do that we
build<00:01:12.570> white<00:01:12.780> models<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:14.189> they<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.970> ideas

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
build white models so they are the ideas

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.420 
build white models so they are the ideas
that<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.540> architecture<00:01:16.200> has<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.470> work<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.040> a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that the architecture has to work in a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.609 
that the architecture has to work in a
monolithic<00:01:18.890> color<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.880> work<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
monolithic color to work and that the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.140 
monolithic color to work and that the
modeling<00:01:23.100> would<00:01:23.220> happen<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> computer

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
modeling would happen in the computer

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.539 
modeling would happen in the computer
that<00:01:24.750> would<00:01:24.900> show<00:01:25.380> us<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.680> real<00:01:25.830> deviations

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
that would show us the real deviations

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.460 
that would show us the real deviations
or<00:01:26.670> differentiations<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.570> happen<00:01:27.930> with<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
or differentiations that happen with the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.800 
or differentiations that happen with the
different<00:01:28.740> materials<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.220> textures<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.880> think

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
different materials and textures I think

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.840 
different materials and textures I think
the<00:01:30.900> most<00:01:31.200> valuable<00:01:31.500> part<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.950> any<00:01:32.130> computer

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the most valuable part of any computer

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.030 
the most valuable part of any computer
tool<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.390> me<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> ability<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.079> change<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
tool for me is the ability to change and

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.179 
tool for me is the ability to change and
we<00:01:35.130> change<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.520> lot<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.030> ArchiCAD<00:01:37.189> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
we change a lot and the ArchiCAD the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.819 
we change a lot and the ArchiCAD the
ability<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.610> put<00:01:38.880> component<00:01:39.479> parts<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.350> to

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
ability to put component parts in and to

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.740 
ability to put component parts in and to
be<00:01:40.920> able<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.159> change<00:01:41.400> them<00:01:41.729> quickly<00:01:41.759> is

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
be able to change them quickly is

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.749 
be able to change them quickly is
extremely<00:01:43.439> extremely<00:01:44.040> important<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.610> us

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
extremely extremely important to us

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.179 
extremely extremely important to us
especially<00:01:45.390> when<00:01:45.689> we're<00:01:45.810> doing<00:01:46.189> buildings

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
especially when we're doing buildings

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.880 
especially when we're doing buildings
out<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.399> repetitive<00:01:47.700> design<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.740> if<00:01:49.740> we're

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
out of repetitive design so if we're

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.039 
out of repetitive design so if we're
gonna<00:01:49.979> quickly<00:01:50.220> lay<00:01:50.549> out<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> building<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.540> we

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
gonna quickly lay out a building and we

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.050 
gonna quickly lay out a building and we
can<00:01:52.229> take<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.409> component<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.310> let's<00:01:53.729> call<00:01:53.880> it

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
can take a component of it let's call it

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.690 
can take a component of it let's call it
unit<00:01:54.420> when<00:01:54.899> we<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.140> lay<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.890> know<00:01:56.040> those<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.670> a

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
unit when we can lay you know those on a

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.289 
unit when we can lay you know those on a
certain<00:01:57.360> pattern<00:01:58.009> that<00:01:59.009> ability<00:01:59.549> there's<00:02:00.060> no

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
certain pattern that ability there's no

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.450 
certain pattern that ability there's no

can that can compete with that

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.810 
can that can compete with that
there's<00:02:04.439> no<00:02:04.530> drawing<00:02:04.890> capabilities<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.610> can

compete with that and the the Expediency
that<00:02:09.060> starts<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.450> happen

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
that starts to happen

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.270 
that starts to happen
is<00:02:11.150> pretty<00:02:11.540> incredible<00:02:11.710> I've<00:02:12.710> seen<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.100> of

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
is pretty incredible I've seen that of

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.580 
is pretty incredible I've seen that of
all<00:02:13.460> over<00:02:13.790> my<00:02:13.940> career<00:02:14.000> as<00:02:14.420> an<00:02:14.540> architect<00:02:14.690> the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
all over my career as an architect the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.990 
all over my career as an architect the
ability<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:15.890> change<00:02:16.250> instead<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.820> know<00:02:16.880> we

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
ability to change instead of you know we

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.970 
ability to change instead of you know we
still<00:02:17.150> have<00:02:17.210> these<00:02:17.390> erasers<00:02:17.770> that<00:02:18.770> would<00:02:18.860> make

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
still have these erasers that would make

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.550 
still have these erasers that would make
these<00:02:19.100> little<00:02:19.340> things<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.150> Neal<00:02:20.560> mylar

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
these little things and the Neal mylar

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.560 
these little things and the Neal mylar
over<00:02:21.590> mylar<00:02:22.190> it's<00:02:22.730> it's<00:02:23.120> really<00:02:23.390> fantastic

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
over mylar it's it's really fantastic

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.570 
over mylar it's it's really fantastic
the<00:02:24.050> way<00:02:24.140> that's<00:02:24.290> changed<00:02:24.680> when<00:02:25.400> health

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
the way that's changed when health

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.700 
the way that's changed when health
architecture<00:02:25.790> become<00:02:26.450> better<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.590> know

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
architecture become better you know

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.710 
architecture become better you know
necessarily<00:02:28.130> became<00:02:28.940> less<00:02:29.120> expensive<00:02:29.630> you

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
necessarily became less expensive you

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.500 
necessarily became less expensive you
just<00:02:29.870> were<00:02:30.170> able<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.500> explore<00:02:30.950> more<00:02:31.510> because

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
just were able to explore more because

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.680 
just were able to explore more because
you<00:02:32.630> had<00:02:32.810> more<00:02:33.050> opportunities
