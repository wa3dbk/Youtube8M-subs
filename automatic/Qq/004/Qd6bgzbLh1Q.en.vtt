when<00:00:01.110> we're<00:00:01.290> out<00:00:01.560> any<00:00:01.829> effect<00:00:02.220> we<00:00:02.370> basically

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
when we're out any effect we basically

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.360 
when we're out any effect we basically
have<00:00:02.790> two<00:00:02.970> choices<00:00:03.210> in<00:00:03.600> line<00:00:03.990> or<00:00:04.259> parallel<00:00:04.770> for

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
have two choices in line or parallel for

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.789 
have two choices in line or parallel for
execs<00:00:06.299> like<00:00:06.509> compression<00:00:06.810> limit<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.470> gates

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
execs like compression limit and gates

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.070 
execs like compression limit and gates
we<00:00:07.980> normally<00:00:08.429> use<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.700> inline<00:00:09.150> approach<00:00:09.540> the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
we normally use the inline approach the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.660 
we normally use the inline approach the
entire<00:00:10.469> similar<00:00:10.889> gets<00:00:11.130> effect<00:00:11.460> in<00:00:11.550> other

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
entire similar gets effect in other

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.910 
entire similar gets effect in other
words<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.969> output<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.360> these<00:00:12.540> drums<00:00:12.840> go<00:00:13.410> into

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
words the output of these drums go into

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.029 
words the output of these drums go into
a<00:00:13.950> compressor<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.820> then<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.120> gets<00:00:15.269> placed

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
a compressor and then that gets placed

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.460 
a compressor and then that gets placed
further<00:00:17.039> through<00:00:17.460> into<00:00:18.150> your<00:00:18.449> mixer<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.260> like

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
further through into your mixer so like

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.990 
further through into your mixer so like
I<00:00:19.560> said<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:19.949> called<00:00:20.189> in<00:00:20.460> line<00:00:20.699> because

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
I said this is called in line because

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.259 
I said this is called in line because
that<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:23.039> case<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.519> compressor<00:00:24.000> is

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
that the in this case this compressor is

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.660 
that the in this case this compressor is
in<00:00:24.510> line<00:00:24.869> with<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.170> signal<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.680> whole<00:00:25.980> signal

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
in line with the signal the whole signal

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.509 
in line with the signal the whole signal
goes<00:00:26.849> through<00:00:27.180> everything<00:00:27.930> gets<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.710> process

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
goes through everything gets a process

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.609 
goes through everything gets a process
and<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:30.029> normally<00:00:30.480> makes<00:00:30.660> sense<00:00:30.990> with<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> lot

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and this normally makes sense with a lot

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.540 
and this normally makes sense with a lot
of<00:00:32.750> dynamic<00:00:33.750> dynamic<00:00:34.710> effect<00:00:34.980> processes

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
of dynamic dynamic effect processes

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.209 
of dynamic dynamic effect processes
however<00:00:36.329> if<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.989> were<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.200> split<00:00:37.500> your<00:00:37.800> signal

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
however if you were to split your signal

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.280 
however if you were to split your signal
and<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.730> go<00:00:38.760> through<00:00:38.969> unaffected<00:00:39.899> as

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
and have it go through unaffected as

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.549 
and have it go through unaffected as
well<00:00:41.210> that's<00:00:42.210> what<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.600> call<00:00:42.870> parallel

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
well that's what we call parallel

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.090 
well that's what we call parallel
processing<00:00:44.780> now<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:46.140> mean<00:00:46.440> why<00:00:46.829> would<00:00:47.010> you

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
processing now I mean why would you

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.639 
processing now I mean why would you
actually<00:00:47.280> want<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.649> corrective

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
actually want to do that in corrective

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.310 
actually want to do that in corrective
dynamics<00:00:50.550> processing<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.539> want<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.809> affect

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
dynamics processing you want to affect

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.029 
dynamics processing you want to affect
the<00:00:52.649> entire<00:00:53.340> signal<00:00:54.000> or<00:00:54.420> basically<00:00:55.379> doctor<00:00:55.920> or

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
the entire signal or basically doctor or

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.189 
the entire signal or basically doctor or
change<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.579> waveform<00:00:56.820> now<00:00:57.570> pull<00:00:57.870> down<00:00:57.899> it

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
change that waveform now pull down it

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.260 
change that waveform now pull down it
speaks<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.680> killer<00:00:59.010> background<00:00:59.550> noise<00:00:59.940> with<00:01:00.239> a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
speaks of killer background noise with a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.260 
speaks of killer background noise with a
gate<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.690> know<00:01:00.780> whatever<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.640> this<00:01:02.640> instance

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
gate you know whatever in this instance

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.469 
gate you know whatever in this instance
you<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.140> send<00:01:04.409> your<00:01:04.589> entire<00:01:05.280> signal<00:01:05.700> through

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
you just send your entire signal through

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.100 
you just send your entire signal through
right<00:01:07.100> however<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:09.210> want<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.659> color

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
right however if you want to just color

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.020 
right however if you want to just color
your<00:01:10.380> sound<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:10.920> compression<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.820> might

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
your sound with compression you might

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.350 
your sound with compression you might
want<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.420> split<00:01:12.900> off<00:01:13.110> your<00:01:13.590> signal<00:01:14.360> absolutely

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
want to split off your signal absolutely

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.899 
want to split off your signal absolutely
crush<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.680> get<00:01:16.979> some<00:01:17.159> grunge<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.759> that

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
crush it and get some grunge on that

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.969 
crush it and get some grunge on that
sound<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:18.600> mix<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.229> back<00:01:19.560> together

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
sound and then mix that back together

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.520 
sound and then mix that back together

for some added character to yourself in

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.740 
for some added character to yourself in
a<00:01:22.590> lot<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.860> circles<00:01:23.369> they<00:01:23.820> call<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.119> new<00:01:24.390> new

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
a lot of circles they call this new new

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.170 
a lot of circles they call this new new
york-style<00:01:25.080> compression<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.670> was<00:01:26.790> using<00:01:27.150> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
york-style compression as it was using a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.539 
york-style compression as it was using a
lot<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.390> drums<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:28.080> new<00:01:28.500> york<00:01:28.740> studios<00:01:29.159> way

lot of drums in new york studios way
back<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.540> day<00:01:31.020> let's<00:01:31.950> see<00:01:32.280> an<00:01:32.610> example<00:01:32.790> of

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
back in the day let's see an example of

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.200 
back in the day let's see an example of
this<00:01:34.009> okay<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.070> let's<00:01:35.400> see<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.909> action

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
this okay so let's see this in action

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.810 
this okay so let's see this in action
and<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:37.170> right<00:01:37.590> now<00:01:37.619> we're<00:01:37.920> back<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.100> reason<00:01:38.579> we

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
and we right now we're back in reason we

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.640 
and we right now we're back in reason we
have<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.240> drum<00:01:39.540> loop<00:01:39.750> here<00:01:40.020> let's<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.350> play

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
have a drum loop here let's just play

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.700 
have a drum loop here let's just play
that<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.210> see<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.509> we<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.710> rack

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
that so you can see that we have rack

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.260 
that so you can see that we have rack
around<00:01:46.829> we've<00:01:47.189> just<00:01:47.340> got<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> output<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
around we've just got the output of the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.510 
around we've just got the output of the
drum<00:01:49.229> machine<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.890> straight<00:01:50.250> into<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
drum machine going straight into the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.429 
drum machine going straight into the
first<00:01:50.880> input<00:01:51.149> here<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:51.750> how<00:01:51.960> about<00:01:52.110> if<00:01:52.409> we

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
first input here but how about if we

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.649 
first input here but how about if we
want<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.860> compress<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.670> I'm<00:01:54.509> going<00:01:54.630> to

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
want to compress that and I'm going to

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.600 
want to compress that and I'm going to
be<00:01:54.780> using<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.200> specific<00:01:55.470> type<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.009> compressor

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
be using a specific type of compressor

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.660 
be using a specific type of compressor
they<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> very<00:01:57.930> cool<00:01:58.369> compressor<00:01:59.369> here

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
they have a very cool compressor here

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.109 
they have a very cool compressor here
called<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> pulverizer<00:02:01.110> which<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.790> not<00:02:02.790> known

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
called the pulverizer which is not known

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.510 
called the pulverizer which is not known
for<00:02:03.149> its<00:02:03.600> subtleties<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.469> tends<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.950> really

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
for its subtleties it tends to really

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.690 
for its subtleties it tends to really
just<00:02:05.850> kind<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.090> crush<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:07.409> sound<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.310> let's

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
just kind of crush the sound so let's

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.340 
just kind of crush the sound so let's
have<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.270> listen<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.660> how<00:02:10.020> that

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
have a listen to how that

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.160 
have a listen to how that
sounds<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.460> as<00:02:11.820> you<00:02:12.240> would<00:02:12.330> imagine<00:02:12.420> we<00:02:12.990> just

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
sounds so as you would imagine we just

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.950 
sounds so as you would imagine we just
take<00:02:13.380> that<00:02:13.560> these<00:02:13.860> outputs<00:02:14.400> here<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.960> we

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
take that these outputs here and we

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.390 
take that these outputs here and we
place<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.380> in<00:02:16.680> an<00:02:16.800> input<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:20.180> then<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.450> output

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
place it in an input and then the output

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:31.550 
place it in an input and then the output
goes<00:02:23.400> up<00:02:23.970> into<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.630> mixer<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.580> missed<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:30.560> okay

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
goes up into the mixer I missed it okay

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.860 
goes up into the mixer I missed it okay
so<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.190> output<00:02:32.370> goes<00:02:32.760> up<00:02:33.090> into<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.330> mixer<00:02:33.690> and

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
so the output goes up into the mixer and

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.080 
so the output goes up into the mixer and
then<00:02:34.470> flip<00:02:34.740> this<00:02:34.830> rack<00:02:35.070> around<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:35.790> now

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
then flip this rack around and so now

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.590 
then flip this rack around and so now
this<00:02:36.570> entire<00:02:37.250> this<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:39.240> we<00:02:39.330> saw<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.510> the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
this entire this is like we saw in the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.080 
this entire this is like we saw in the
graphic<00:02:39.960> before<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.800> when<00:02:41.400> it's<00:02:41.550> in<00:02:41.760> line

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
graphic before this is when it's in line

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.280 
graphic before this is when it's in line
this<00:02:42.300> pulverizer<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.590> line<00:02:43.890> with<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:45.290> the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
this pulverizer is in line with the the

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.250 
this pulverizer is in line with the the
loop<00:02:46.440> machine<00:02:46.770> right<00:02:46.950> here<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.190> drum<00:02:47.370> machine

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.160 

okay<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:52.320> that's<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.800> specific<00:02:53.490> kind<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.330> sound

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
okay so that's a specific kind of sound

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.800 
okay so that's a specific kind of sound
that<00:02:55.440> may<00:02:56.220> or<00:02:56.370> may<00:02:56.400> not<00:02:56.550> be<00:02:56.730> pleasing<00:02:57.240> for<00:02:57.450> you

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
that may or may not be pleasing for you

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.540 
that may or may not be pleasing for you
but<00:02:57.960> let's<00:02:58.080> imagine<00:02:58.350> for<00:02:58.530> this<00:02:58.980> example<00:02:59.370> we

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
but let's imagine for this example we

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.800 
but let's imagine for this example we
really<00:03:00.120> love<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.900> kind<00:03:01.080> of<00:03:01.230> grunge<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:02.810> that

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
really love the kind of grunge a that

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.250 
really love the kind of grunge a that
that<00:03:04.230> sound<00:03:05.270> is<00:03:06.270> around<00:03:06.480> yourself<00:03:06.900> in<00:03:07.050> fact

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
that sound is around yourself in fact

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:15.110 
that sound is around yourself in fact
let's<00:03:07.440> even<00:03:07.650> squash<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.220> even<00:03:08.490> some<00:03:08.760> more

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.699 

so<00:03:16.120> we<00:03:16.239> go<00:03:16.390> for<00:03:16.599> that<00:03:16.689> really<00:03:16.900> grungy<00:03:17.260> sound

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
so we go for that really grungy sound

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.240 
so we go for that really grungy sound
however<00:03:19.019> what<00:03:20.019> we<00:03:20.049> want<00:03:20.319> to<00:03:20.409> do<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:20.799> just<00:03:20.829> kind

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
however what we want to do is just kind

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.000 
however what we want to do is just kind
of<00:03:21.340> introduce<00:03:21.849> some<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:23.230> grungy<00:03:23.709> sound

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
of introduce some of that grungy sound

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.949 
of introduce some of that grungy sound
now<00:03:24.189> we<00:03:24.370> really<00:03:24.670> can't<00:03:24.760> do<00:03:25.120> that<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.480> way<00:03:25.659> it's

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
now we really can't do that the way it's

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.660 
now we really can't do that the way it's
set<00:03:26.230> up<00:03:26.260> right<00:03:26.590> now<00:03:26.829> but<00:03:27.069> if<00:03:27.159> we<00:03:27.310> flip<00:03:27.549> this

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
set up right now but if we flip this

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.839 
set up right now but if we flip this
back<00:03:27.730> around<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.769> handy<00:03:29.769> little<00:03:29.849> splitter

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
back around a handy little splitter

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.759 
back around a handy little splitter
right<00:03:31.150> here<00:03:31.450> will<00:03:31.720> better<00:03:31.959> make<00:03:32.409> this<00:03:32.560> happen

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
right here will better make this happen

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.429 
right here will better make this happen
right<00:03:33.239> so<00:03:34.239> we'll<00:03:34.420> just<00:03:34.569> take<00:03:34.689> the<00:03:34.840> output<00:03:35.019> of

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 
right so we'll just take the output of

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:40.039 
right so we'll just take the output of
the<00:03:35.530> drum<00:03:36.310> machine<00:03:36.640> place<00:03:37.299> it<00:03:37.480> over<00:03:37.629> here<00:03:38.079> and

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
the drum machine place it over here and

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.509 
the drum machine place it over here and
like<00:03:41.049> we've<00:03:41.230> seen<00:03:41.260> before<00:03:41.620> when<00:03:42.189> you<00:03:42.310> use<00:03:42.489> a

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
like we've seen before when you use a

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.449 
like we've seen before when you use a
splitter<00:03:42.879> like<00:03:43.329> this<00:03:43.599> it's<00:03:43.870> taking<00:03:44.650> this<00:03:44.829> main

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
splitter like this it's taking this main

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.940 
splitter like this it's taking this main
output<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:46.180> split<00:03:46.870> it<00:03:46.989> up<00:03:47.109> into<00:03:47.379> four

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
output and split it up into four

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.690 
output and split it up into four
different<00:03:48.370> stereo<00:03:48.940> feeds<00:03:49.359> so<00:03:49.930> let's<00:03:50.170> take

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
different stereo feeds so let's take

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.479 
different stereo feeds so let's take
this<00:03:51.900> over<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:53.109> the<00:03:53.409> input<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:53.950> that's<00:03:54.129> just

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
this over to the input so that's just

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.429 
this over to the input so that's just
like<00:03:54.700> if<00:03:54.909> the<00:03:55.090> splitter<00:03:55.389> wasn't<00:03:55.450> there<00:03:55.989> it's

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 
like if the splitter wasn't there it's

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.580 
like if the splitter wasn't there it's
going<00:03:56.769> into<00:03:57.250> here<00:03:57.609> and<00:03:57.730> then<00:03:57.970> through<00:03:58.590> into

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
going into here and then through into

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.710 
going into here and then through into
that<00:04:00.069> pulverizer<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:01.359> then<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.569> output

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
that pulverizer and then the output

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.629 
that pulverizer and then the output
pulverizers<00:04:02.560> go<00:04:02.680> out<00:04:02.799> here<00:04:03.069> but<00:04:03.280> what<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.430> want

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
pulverizers go out here but what I want

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.069 
pulverizers go out here but what I want
to<00:04:03.730> do<00:04:03.849> is<00:04:03.879> split<00:04:04.420> off<00:04:04.920> another<00:04:06.030> one<00:04:07.030> over<00:04:07.450> to

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
to do is split off another one over to

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.500 
to do is split off another one over to
input<00:04:08.739> number<00:04:09.250> two<00:04:09.459> so<00:04:09.730> now<00:04:09.760> what<00:04:10.299> we're<00:04:10.420> going

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
input number two so now what we're going

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.879 
input number two so now what we're going
to<00:04:10.599> have<00:04:10.629> is<00:04:11.639> the<00:04:12.840> grunge<00:04:13.840> pulverizer<00:04:14.530> that's

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
to have is the grunge pulverizer that's

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.830 
to have is the grunge pulverizer that's
that's<00:04:15.549> the<00:04:15.849> sound<00:04:16.120> of<00:04:16.329> it<00:04:16.389> coming<00:04:16.630> through

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
that's the sound of it coming through

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.020 
that's the sound of it coming through
the<00:04:16.930> pulverizer<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:17.680> then<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:17.979> dry<00:04:18.310> sound<00:04:18.639> so

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
the pulverizer and then the dry sound so

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.129 
the pulverizer and then the dry sound so
let's<00:04:19.269> see<00:04:19.539> if<00:04:19.630> these<00:04:19.810> are<00:04:19.959> all<00:04:20.079> working<00:04:20.289> so

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.100 

that's<00:04:26.139> just<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.949> grunge<00:04:27.220> sound<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:27.870> this<00:04:28.870> is

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
that's just the grunge sound and this is

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.210 
that's just the grunge sound and this is
the<00:04:29.320> clean<00:04:29.590> sound<00:04:31.800> so<00:04:32.800> you<00:04:32.860> can<00:04:33.010> see<00:04:33.190> how

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
the clean sound so you can see how

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.189 
the clean sound so you can see how
parallel<00:04:33.760> processing<00:04:34.419> works<00:04:34.690> out<00:04:34.900> really

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
parallel processing works out really

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.370 
parallel processing works out really
well<00:04:35.289> if<00:04:35.590> you<00:04:35.740> just<00:04:35.919> want<00:04:36.130> a<00:04:36.250> touch<00:04:36.639> of<00:04:37.030> that

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
well if you just want a touch of that

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:49.580 
well if you just want a touch of that
compression

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.290 

of<00:04:50.590> course<00:04:50.830> that<00:04:50.980> gives<00:04:51.220> you<00:04:51.400> time<00:04:51.760> right<00:04:52.150> up

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
of course that gives you time right up

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.300 
of course that gives you time right up
until<00:04:52.420> mixdown<00:04:53.050> to<00:04:53.680> make<00:04:53.890> that<00:04:54.010> decision

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
until mixdown to make that decision

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.330 
until mixdown to make that decision
about<00:04:54.610> how<00:04:55.090> much<00:04:55.390> of<00:04:55.660> that<00:04:55.720> really<00:04:56.500> grunged<00:04:57.130> up

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
about how much of that really grunged up

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.150 
about how much of that really grunged up
sound<00:04:58.030> you<00:04:58.330> want<00:04:58.570> if<00:04:58.810> this<00:04:59.320> was<00:04:59.500> placed<00:04:59.830> in

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
sound you want if this was placed in

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.490 
sound you want if this was placed in
line<00:05:00.670> then<00:05:01.540> you<00:05:01.750> really<00:05:02.050> don't<00:05:02.200> have<00:05:02.320> that

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
line then you really don't have that

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.350 
line then you really don't have that
kind<00:05:02.710> of<00:05:02.770> control<00:05:02.920> so<00:05:03.280> parallel<00:05:03.760> processing

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
kind of control so parallel processing

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.110 
kind of control so parallel processing
works<00:05:04.600> out<00:05:04.840> really<00:05:05.440> really<00:05:05.560> well

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
works out really really well

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.930 
works out really really well
particularly<00:05:07.120> for<00:05:07.210> drums<00:05:08.340> now<00:05:09.340> depending<00:05:09.520> on

the plugins you are using it may

the plugins you are using it may

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
actually be able to do this without any

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.950 
actually be able to do this without any
of<00:05:14.410> that<00:05:14.500> fancy<00:05:14.800> weighing<00:05:15.340> around<00:05:15.580> here<00:05:16.030> note

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
of that fancy weighing around here note

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.760 
of that fancy weighing around here note
on<00:05:17.190> this<00:05:18.190> particular<00:05:19.200> plugin<00:05:20.200> it's<00:05:20.500> made<00:05:20.650> by

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
on this particular plugin it's made by

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.910 
on this particular plugin it's made by
soft<00:05:21.070> tubes<00:05:21.480> great<00:05:22.480> compressor<00:05:23.410> fut

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
soft tubes great compressor fut

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.300 
soft tubes great compressor fut
compressor<00:05:24.310> and<00:05:24.900> this<00:05:25.900> has<00:05:26.140> parallel<00:05:26.770> inject

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
compressor and this has parallel inject

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.910 
compressor and this has parallel inject
and<00:05:27.520> what<00:05:27.790> that<00:05:27.820> means<00:05:28.390> is<00:05:28.660> it<00:05:28.810> within<00:05:29.170> the<00:05:29.680> box

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
and what that means is it within the box

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.610 
and what that means is it within the box
right<00:05:30.370> here<00:05:30.430> you<00:05:31.270> can<00:05:31.420> have<00:05:31.600> full<00:05:31.960> compression

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
right here you can have full compression

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.420 
right here you can have full compression
or<00:05:33.480> you<00:05:34.480> could<00:05:34.630> have<00:05:34.840> full<00:05:35.260> dry<00:05:35.620> or<00:05:35.890> anything

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
or you could have full dry or anything

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.030 
or you could have full dry or anything
in<00:05:36.640> between<00:05:36.840> so<00:05:37.840> that's<00:05:38.020> really<00:05:38.380> like<00:05:38.680> than

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
in between so that's really like than

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.920 
in between so that's really like than
what<00:05:39.580> we<00:05:39.700> did<00:05:39.850> before<00:05:40.000> we<00:05:40.570> were<00:05:40.690> mixing

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
what we did before we were mixing

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.620 
what we did before we were mixing
between<00:05:41.290> the<00:05:41.650> two<00:05:42.150> levels<00:05:43.150> right<00:05:43.330> here<00:05:43.540> you

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
between the two levels right here you

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.900 
between the two levels right here you
can<00:05:43.750> do<00:05:43.870> that<00:05:44.020> right<00:05:44.050> in<00:05:44.590> the<00:05:44.680> box<00:05:44.950> makes<00:05:45.730> a<00:05:45.880> lot

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
can do that right in the box makes a lot

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.290 
can do that right in the box makes a lot
easier<00:05:46.600> to<00:05:47.020> if<00:05:47.770> you<00:05:47.980> have<00:05:48.280> a<00:05:48.490> bunch<00:05:48.910> of<00:05:49.180> these

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
easier to if you have a bunch of these

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.290 
easier to if you have a bunch of these
instances<00:05:49.720> on<00:05:50.230> across<00:05:50.800> you<00:05:51.790> know<00:05:51.820> kick<00:05:52.120> drum

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
instances on across you know kick drum

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.900 
instances on across you know kick drum
snare<00:05:52.480> drum<00:05:52.870> vocals<00:05:53.860> bass<00:05:54.250> things<00:05:54.550> like<00:05:54.730> that

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
snare drum vocals bass things like that

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.700 
snare drum vocals bass things like that
it<00:05:55.150> just<00:05:55.180> works<00:05:55.630> out<00:05:55.810> really<00:05:56.350> really<00:05:56.470> well

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
it just works out really really well

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.480 
it just works out really really well
because<00:05:57.100> there's<00:05:57.700> no<00:05:57.880> extra<00:05:58.830> worrying<00:05:59.830> needed

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
because there's no extra worrying needed

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.740 
because there's no extra worrying needed
let's<00:06:00.730> have<00:06:00.880> a<00:06:00.910> listen<00:06:01.090> to<00:06:01.210> this<00:06:03.030> so<00:06:04.030> here<00:06:04.570> I

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
let's have a listen to this so here I

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.470 
let's have a listen to this so here I
mean<00:06:05.080> you<00:06:05.410> really<00:06:05.770> know<00:06:06.070> a<00:06:06.100> lot<00:06:06.250> of<00:06:06.430> these<00:06:06.669> same

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
mean you really know a lot of these same

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.780 
mean you really know a lot of these same
things<00:06:07.870> that<00:06:08.020> you've<00:06:08.950> seen<00:06:09.190> before<00:06:09.400> you<00:06:09.669> can

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
things that you've seen before you can

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.390 
things that you've seen before you can
see<00:06:09.910> the<00:06:10.000> gain<00:06:10.270> reduction<00:06:10.300> there<00:06:11.080> and<00:06:11.400> you

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
see the gain reduction there and you

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.860 
see the gain reduction there and you
notice<00:06:12.700> that<00:06:12.820> it<00:06:12.910> took<00:06:13.030> a<00:06:13.090> while<00:06:13.330> to<00:06:13.390> come<00:06:13.690> back

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
notice that it took a while to come back

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.510 
notice that it took a while to come back
there<00:06:14.050> that's<00:06:14.260> because<00:06:14.500> the<00:06:14.620> release<00:06:14.980> is<00:06:15.220> a

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
there that's because the release is a

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.370 
there that's because the release is a
little<00:06:15.880> slow<00:06:16.150> you<00:06:16.210> could<00:06:16.540> make<00:06:17.050> that<00:06:17.230> little

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
little slow you could make that little

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.990 
little slow you could make that little
faster<00:06:17.950> and<00:06:18.100> then<00:06:18.190> that<00:06:18.370> would<00:06:18.520> return<00:06:18.940> to

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
faster and then that would return to

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.360 
faster and then that would return to
where<00:06:19.330> it<00:06:19.419> was<00:06:19.600> you'll<00:06:20.470> notice<00:06:20.770> everything's

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
where it was you'll notice everything's

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.250 
where it was you'll notice everything's
very<00:06:22.090> very<00:06:22.390> similar<00:06:22.630> attack<00:06:22.990> and<00:06:23.140> release

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
very very similar attack and release

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.620 
very very similar attack and release
ratio<00:06:24.010> you've<00:06:24.220> seen<00:06:24.520> all<00:06:24.790> of<00:06:24.820> that<00:06:25.060> stuff<00:06:25.330> here

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
ratio you've seen all of that stuff here

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.500 
ratio you've seen all of that stuff here
hey<00:06:26.440> where's<00:06:26.740> the<00:06:26.880> where's<00:06:27.880> the<00:06:27.910> threshold

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
hey where's the where's the threshold

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.990 
hey where's the where's the threshold
well<00:06:28.900> this<00:06:29.290> your<00:06:30.130> fund<00:06:30.430> there<00:06:30.640> are<00:06:30.760> some

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
well this your fund there are some

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.140 
well this your fund there are some
compresses<00:06:31.419> out<00:06:31.720> there<00:06:32.050> that<00:06:32.860> will<00:06:33.370> treat

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
compresses out there that will treat

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.380 
compresses out there that will treat
threshold<00:06:34.840> in<00:06:35.020> a<00:06:35.110> in<00:06:35.470> a<00:06:35.590> different<00:06:36.010> way<00:06:36.390> this

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
threshold in a in a different way this

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.200 
threshold in a in a different way this
basically<00:06:37.810> has<00:06:38.080> a<00:06:38.290> fixed<00:06:38.800> threshold<00:06:39.040> and<00:06:39.490> you

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
basically has a fixed threshold and you

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.470 
basically has a fixed threshold and you
can<00:06:40.419> drive<00:06:41.050> your<00:06:41.830> input<00:06:42.400> into<00:06:42.970> that<00:06:43.000> threshold

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480 
can drive your input into that threshold

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.990 
can drive your input into that threshold
by<00:06:43.990> using<00:06:44.350> the<00:06:44.620> input<00:06:45.100> right<00:06:45.310> here<00:06:45.640> so<00:06:45.820> in<00:06:45.910> this

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
by using the input right here so in this

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.020 
by using the input right here so in this
example<00:06:46.590> if<00:06:47.590> I<00:06:47.740> was<00:06:47.860> to<00:06:47.980> bring<00:06:48.160> that<00:06:48.340> down<00:06:48.550> here

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.030 
example if I was to bring that down here

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.280 
example if I was to bring that down here
then<00:06:49.240> we<00:06:49.360> probably<00:06:49.570> won't<00:06:49.750> have<00:06:49.960> any<00:06:50.080> gain

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:50.290 
then we probably won't have any gain

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.630 
then we probably won't have any gain
reduction<00:06:52.170> now<00:06:53.170> we're<00:06:53.440> driving<00:06:53.710> it<00:06:54.040> in<00:06:54.220> okay

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:54.640 
reduction now we're driving it in okay

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.070 
reduction now we're driving it in okay
you<00:06:54.700> can<00:06:54.880> see<00:06:55.060> we're<00:06:55.180> passing<00:06:55.660> that<00:06:55.690> threshold

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
you can see we're passing that threshold

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.810 
you can see we're passing that threshold
because<00:06:56.440> we're<00:06:56.710> looking<00:06:56.950> at<00:06:57.070> that<00:06:57.280> at<00:06:57.640> the

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820 
because we're looking at that at the

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
because we're looking at that at the
gain<00:06:58.030> reduction<00:06:58.060> right<00:06:58.720> now<00:07:00.630> and<00:07:01.630> let's

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 
gain reduction right now and let's

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:08.430 
gain reduction right now and let's
imagine<00:07:02.260> we<00:07:02.500> just<00:07:02.620> gonna<00:07:02.710> max<00:07:03.070> that<00:07:03.340> out<00:07:07.440> I'm

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 
imagine we just gonna max that out I'm

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:17.970 
imagine we just gonna max that out I'm
going<00:07:08.680> to<00:07:08.740> mash<00:07:09.130> this<00:07:09.490> signal<00:07:14.550> and<00:07:16.830> like<00:07:17.830> you

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:17.980 
going to mash this signal and like you

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.640 
going to mash this signal and like you
said<00:07:18.220> like<00:07:18.490> so<00:07:18.880> like<00:07:19.210> I<00:07:19.360> said<00:07:19.420> before<00:07:19.650> with

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:20.650 
said like so like I said before with

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.390 
said like so like I said before with
this<00:07:20.800> parallel<00:07:21.250> inject<00:07:21.790> you<00:07:22.150> have<00:07:22.330> full

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 
this parallel inject you have full

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.010 
this parallel inject you have full
abilities<00:07:24.400> to<00:07:24.730> be<00:07:24.760> able<00:07:24.880> to<00:07:25.210> change<00:07:25.600> between

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:26.020 
abilities to be able to change between

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.750 
abilities to be able to change between
the<00:07:26.440> you<00:07:26.710> know<00:07:26.770> the<00:07:26.890> completely<00:07:27.250> compress

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:27.760 
the you know the completely compress

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.230 
the you know the completely compress
side<00:07:28.630> or<00:07:28.990> the<00:07:29.440> completely<00:07:29.950> dry<00:07:30.310> side<00:07:30.610> anywhere

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:31.240 
side or the completely dry side anywhere

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.660 
side or the completely dry side anywhere
in<00:07:31.420> between<00:07:31.600> a<00:07:32.110> lot<00:07:32.830> of<00:07:32.950> people<00:07:33.070> started

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:33.670 
in between a lot of people started

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.400 
in between a lot of people started
calling<00:07:33.790> this<00:07:33.970> new<00:07:34.240> york-style<00:07:34.600> compression

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:35.410 
calling this new york-style compression

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.050 
calling this new york-style compression
that<00:07:35.620> you<00:07:35.710> know<00:07:35.860> way<00:07:36.190> back<00:07:36.370> in<00:07:36.550> the<00:07:36.580> day<00:07:36.820> when

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:37.060 
that you know way back in the day when

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.660 
that you know way back in the day when
some<00:07:37.990> producers<00:07:38.560> started<00:07:38.740> messing<00:07:39.550> around

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:39.670 
some producers started messing around

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.300 
some producers started messing around
with<00:07:39.940> this<00:07:40.030> and<00:07:40.210> really<00:07:40.510> crushing<00:07:41.140> a<00:07:41.680> drum

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:42.310 
with this and really crushing a drum

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.030 
with this and really crushing a drum
signal<00:07:42.910> and<00:07:43.090> then<00:07:43.720> just<00:07:43.960> feeding<00:07:44.770> that<00:07:44.980> back

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:45.040 
signal and then just feeding that back

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.320 
signal and then just feeding that back
in<00:07:45.520> so<00:07:46.510> that<00:07:47.520> you<00:07:48.520> can<00:07:48.640> really<00:07:48.850> have<00:07:49.030> the<00:07:49.120> best

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.330 
in so that you can really have the best

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.390 
in so that you can really have the best
of<00:07:49.480> both<00:07:49.540> worlds<00:07:50.140> you<00:07:50.290> can<00:07:50.440> really<00:07:50.710> crush<00:07:51.130> a

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.400 
of both worlds you can really crush a

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.390 
of both worlds you can really crush a
signal<00:07:51.880> but<00:07:52.540> also<00:07:52.840> still<00:07:53.410> have<00:07:53.680> some<00:07:54.220> of<00:07:54.310> the

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.400 
signal but also still have some of the

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.590 
signal but also still have some of the
dynamics<00:07:54.580> of<00:07:55.000> the<00:07:55.090> original<00:07:55.450> performance

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:55.600 
dynamics of the original performance

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.360 
dynamics of the original performance
there<00:07:56.170> but<00:07:56.440> just<00:07:56.530> kind<00:07:56.830> of<00:07:56.860> mix<00:07:57.100> them<00:07:57.280> together

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:57.370 
there but just kind of mix them together

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.460 
there but just kind of mix them together
you<00:07:58.180> can<00:07:58.300> either<00:07:58.510> do<00:07:58.750> that<00:07:58.900> with<00:07:59.050> some<00:07:59.080> fancy

00:07:59.460 --> 00:07:59.470 
you can either do that with some fancy

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.280 
you can either do that with some fancy
routing<00:08:00.010> like<00:08:00.130> we<00:08:00.250> did<00:08:00.400> before<00:08:00.520> or<00:08:00.940> if<00:08:01.210> your<00:08:01.450> if

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:02.290 
routing like we did before or if your if

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.740 
routing like we did before or if your if
your<00:08:02.640> processes<00:08:03.640> allowed<00:08:04.060> to<00:08:04.210> do<00:08:04.360> it<00:08:04.480> in<00:08:04.630> the

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:04.750 
your processes allowed to do it in the

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.300 
your processes allowed to do it in the
box<00:08:04.990> you<00:08:05.470> can<00:08:05.620> do<00:08:05.770> it<00:08:05.830> with<00:08:05.950> a<00:08:06.010> handy<00:08:06.280> little

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.310 
box you can do it with a handy little

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.210 
box you can do it with a handy little
knob<00:08:06.730> like<00:08:06.910> this
