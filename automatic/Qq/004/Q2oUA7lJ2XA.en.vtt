flags<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.800> that's<00:01:57.070> what<00:01:57.280> attracted<00:01:57.759> me<00:01:57.820> is<00:01:57.970> a

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
flags and that's what attracted me is a

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.550 
flags and that's what attracted me is a
little<00:01:58.240> bit<00:01:58.330> of<00:01:58.420> pop<00:01:58.630> over<00:01:58.960> here<00:01:58.990> something

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
little bit of pop over here something

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.450 
little bit of pop over here something
very<00:01:59.740> crazy<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:02.530> more<00:02:02.740> I<00:02:02.770> look<00:02:03.040> at<00:02:03.220> him<00:02:03.340> I'm

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
very crazy the more I look at him I'm

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.690 
very crazy the more I look at him I'm
not<00:02:03.640> so<00:02:03.940> sure<00:02:05.790> they<00:02:06.790> remind<00:02:07.210> me<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.330> lot<00:02:07.540> of

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
not so sure they remind me a lot of

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:16.380 
not so sure they remind me a lot of
metals<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:10.479> are<00:02:10.540> received<00:02:10.989> in<00:02:11.230> war<00:02:15.239> being<00:02:16.239> in

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
metals that are received in war being in

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.280

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.790 

but<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.450> think<00:02:27.720> that's<00:02:27.900> what<00:02:28.080> I'm<00:02:28.200> settling<00:02:28.680> on

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
but I think that's what I'm settling on

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.740 
but I think that's what I'm settling on
most<00:02:29.099> of<00:02:29.310> all<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.520> just<00:02:29.879> have<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.239> keep<00:02:30.390> digging

most of all I just have to keep digging

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.059 
most of all I just have to keep digging
to<00:02:30.840> find<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.200> connection<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:34.290> multicolors

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
to find the connection the multicolors

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.360 
to find the connection the multicolors
the<00:02:35.280> pop<00:02:36.500> could<00:02:37.500> be<00:02:37.650> for<00:02:37.830> all<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.040> different

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
the pop could be for all the different

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.390 
the pop could be for all the different
countries<00:02:38.730> around<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.150> world<00:02:39.209> but<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:41.220> more
