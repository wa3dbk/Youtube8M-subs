make a lot of people will know you from
formula<00:00:02.610> 1<00:00:02.639> so<00:00:03.240> widely<00:00:03.870> come<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.589> formula<00:00:05.040> e<00:00:05.190> I

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.870 
formula 1 so widely come to formula e I

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.390 
formula 1 so widely come to formula e I
think<00:00:06.870> it's<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.049> very<00:00:07.200> interesting<00:00:07.980> serious

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
think it's a very interesting serious

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.259 
think it's a very interesting serious
it's<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.849> very<00:00:09.240> first<00:00:09.510> year<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:10.019> was

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
it's a very first year I was

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.240 
it's a very first year I was
electrically<00:00:12.269> HSN<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.530> concept<00:00:13.980> just

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
electrically HSN and the concept just

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.490 
electrically HSN and the concept just
think<00:00:14.549> like<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:15.000> potato<00:00:15.240> insulates<00:00:16.080> cars<00:00:16.350> at

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
think like a potato insulates cars at

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.200 
think like a potato insulates cars at
the<00:00:16.619> same<00:00:16.800> time<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.670> world<00:00:17.850> when<00:00:17.970> Janelle

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
the same time in the world when Janelle

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.700 
the same time in the world when Janelle
championship<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.840> didn't<00:00:19.080> want<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.320> stop<00:00:19.500> them

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
championship I didn't want to stop them

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.950 
championship I didn't want to stop them

enough to find the would see that nerve

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.049 
enough to find the would see that nerve
anything<00:00:31.949> yeah<00:00:32.340> it's<00:00:32.489> not<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> bit<00:00:32.880> about

when it comes to the other teams who are
the<00:01:01.079> people<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.440> you're<00:01:01.590> looking<00:01:01.890> at<00:01:02.280> which

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the people that you're looking at which

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.860 
the people that you're looking at which
teams<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.270> think<00:01:03.420> will<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> real

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
teams do you think will be the real

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.870 
teams do you think will be the real
challenges<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.830> well<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.729> watch

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
challenges to you well you watch

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.370 
challenges to you well you watch
everybody

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.319 

simulations<00:01:10.380> we've<00:01:10.560> done<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.039> far<00:01:11.329> both

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
simulations we've done so far both

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.639 
simulations we've done so far both
thumbs<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:14.600> why<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.990> difference<00:01:16.409> when<00:01:16.619> it

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
thumbs and why is the difference when it

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.130 
thumbs and why is the difference when it
comes<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.460> starting<00:01:18.210> Chris<00:01:18.600> car<00:01:18.899> how

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
comes to like starting Chris car how

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.779 
comes to like starting Chris car how
does<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.439> compare<00:01:19.590> because<00:01:19.979> when<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.640> got<00:01:20.759> a

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
does it compare because when you got a

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.520 
does it compare because when you got a
double<00:01:21.060> clutch<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.569> a<00:01:21.630> Formula<00:01:22.049> One<00:01:22.079> car<00:01:22.200> it's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
double clutch in a Formula One car it's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.279 
double clutch in a Formula One car it's
totally<00:01:23.009> different<00:01:23.159> mrs.<00:01:23.759> Matt<00:01:24.020> yes<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.170> is

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
totally different mrs. Matt yes it is

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:26.660 
totally different mrs. Matt yes it is
obviously<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.829> first<00:01:26.039> thing<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:26.520> noise

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
obviously the first thing is the noise

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.779 
obviously the first thing is the noise
which<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.179> can<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.539> see<00:01:27.750> now<00:01:27.899> we<00:01:27.959> can<00:01:28.319> speak<00:01:31.789> see

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
which we can I see now we can speak see

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.190 
which we can I see now we can speak see
exciting<00:01:33.060> house<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.659> everything<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.049> going

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
to you but in terms of the noises why we

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.050 
to you but in terms of the noises why we
get<00:01:37.049> used<00:01:37.319> to<00:01:37.469> it<00:01:37.560> very<00:01:37.709> quickly<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.789> biggest

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
get used to it very quickly the biggest

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.940 
get used to it very quickly the biggest
thing<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.420> how<00:01:39.719> to<00:01:39.780> use<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.349> energy<00:01:40.739> you<00:01:40.920> have

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
thing is how to use the energy you have

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.520 
thing is how to use the energy you have
available<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.030> different<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.200> some<00:01:43.349> other

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
available and different with some other

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.740 
available and different with some other
serious<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.189> are<00:01:44.220> able<00:01:44.429> to<00:01:44.610> recharge<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750
