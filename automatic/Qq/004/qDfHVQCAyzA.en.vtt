gauges<00:02:42.700> because<00:02:43.570> they're<00:02:44.140> digital

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
gauges because they're digital

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.220

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
and so the readout down here will

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.310 
and so the readout down here will
display<00:02:47.769> more<00:02:48.430> I'll<00:02:49.390> show<00:02:49.570> you<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.079> just

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
display more I'll show you that and just

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.850 

like<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.870> said<00:03:40.930> about<00:03:41.319> these<00:03:43.319> it's<00:03:44.319> new<00:03:44.590> it's

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
like I said about these it's new it's

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.180 
like I said about these it's new it's
digital<00:03:45.720> it's<00:03:46.770> electronic<00:03:47.770> throttle<00:03:48.010> control

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
digital it's electronic throttle control

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.800

on<00:03:48.760> this<00:03:49.380> electronic<00:03:50.380> injection<00:03:51.360> so<00:03:52.360> things

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
on this electronic injection so things

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.210 
on this electronic injection so things
are<00:03:52.900> gonna<00:03:52.990> look<00:03:53.110> quite<00:03:53.560> different<00:03:53.740> under<00:03:54.130> the

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
are gonna look quite different under the

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.559 
are gonna look quite different under the
hood<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:54.670> I'll<00:03:54.790> show<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.060> that<00:03:55.240> here<00:03:55.300> in<00:03:55.480> a

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569

hood and I'll show you that here in a
second<00:03:56.020> one<00:03:56.500> thing<00:03:56.770> that<00:03:56.950> we<00:03:57.040> do<00:03:57.220> have<00:03:57.430> down

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
second one thing that we do have down

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.240 
second one thing that we do have down
here<00:03:58.350> is<00:03:59.350> this<00:03:59.560> little<00:03:59.770> gem<00:04:00.840> you'll<00:04:01.840> see<00:04:02.250> this

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
here is this little gem you'll see this

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.800 
here is this little gem you'll see this
right<00:04:03.459> here<00:04:03.520> I<00:04:04.260> have<00:04:05.260> for<00:04:05.470> all<00:04:05.500> off<00:04:05.800> there<00:04:06.040> is

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
right here I have for all off there is

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.380 
right here I have for all off there is
onboard<00:04:07.810> diagnostics<00:04:08.739> so<00:04:09.430> now<00:04:09.700> we<00:04:09.760> have<00:04:10.270> the

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
onboard diagnostics so now we have the

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.690 
onboard diagnostics so now we have the
ability<00:04:10.450> with<00:04:10.780> Mahindra<00:04:11.260> tractors<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:12.459> get

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
under the computer and read and see if

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.920 
under the computer and read and see if
there's<00:04:15.070> any<00:04:15.220> error<00:04:15.459> codes<00:04:15.820> what<00:04:16.570> might<00:04:16.780> be

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
there's any error codes what might be

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.830 
there's any error codes what might be
producing<00:04:17.290> that<00:04:17.620> Erica<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:18.510> I'll<00:04:19.510> tell<00:04:19.750> you

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
producing that Erica and I'll tell you

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.800 
producing that Erica and I'll tell you
what<00:04:19.989> that's<00:04:20.140> that's<00:04:20.590> pretty<00:04:20.799> awesome<00:04:20.980> folks

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
what that's that's pretty awesome folks

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.850 
what that's that's pretty awesome folks
put<00:04:22.810> that<00:04:22.960> on<00:04:23.080> later<00:04:23.350> it's<00:04:23.500> kind<00:04:23.620> of<00:04:23.650> hard<00:04:23.830> to

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
put that on later it's kind of hard to

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.970 
put that on later it's kind of hard to
do<00:04:23.980> with<00:04:24.130> one<00:04:24.310> hand<00:04:24.340> here<00:04:24.990> don't<00:04:25.990> hold<00:04:26.770> this

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
do with one hand here don't hold this

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.450 
do with one hand here don't hold this
real<00:04:27.730> guard<00:04:28.060> down<00:04:28.620> I'm<00:04:29.620> gonna<00:04:29.800> pop<00:04:29.950> this<00:04:30.160> right

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
real guard down I'm gonna pop this right

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.990 
real guard down I'm gonna pop this right
here<00:04:31.140> and<00:04:32.140> show<00:04:32.590> you<00:04:32.650> really<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.760> big

the<00:04:42.580> exhaust<00:04:43.060> you<00:04:43.450> will<00:04:43.660> find<00:04:44.640> something

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
the exhaust you will find something

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.450 
the exhaust you will find something
called<00:04:45.820> a<00:04:46.090> diesel<00:04:46.690> oxidation<00:04:47.340> catalyst

called a diesel oxidation catalyst

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.830 
called a diesel oxidation catalyst
what's<00:04:49.450> a<00:04:49.540> diesel<00:04:49.870> oxidation<00:04:50.070> catalyst<00:04:51.070> I

what's a diesel oxidation catalyst I

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.030 
what's a diesel oxidation catalyst I
can't<00:04:52.840> let<00:04:52.990> it<00:04:53.020> convert<00:04:53.320> it<00:04:53.440> for<00:04:53.530> a<00:04:53.590> diesel<00:04:53.770> or

four<00:05:01.320> so<00:05:02.320> I'm<00:05:02.440> just<00:05:02.650> learning<00:05:03.000> bear<00:05:04.000> with<00:05:04.270> me

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
four so I'm just learning bear with me

four so I'm just learning bear with me
maybe<00:05:04.870> we'll<00:05:05.080> have<00:05:05.200> a<00:05:05.229> new<00:05:05.440> video<00:05:05.620> soon

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
maybe we'll have a new video soon

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.690 
maybe we'll have a new video soon
that'll<00:05:06.370> explain<00:05:06.580> a<00:05:06.700> little<00:05:07.000> bit<00:05:07.240> more<00:05:08.700> here

our two three unit to the thirty-five
series<00:05:57.030> and<00:05:57.960> you'll<00:05:58.350> see<00:05:58.620> bolted<00:05:59.430> on<00:05:59.550> is<00:05:59.880> just

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
series and you'll see bolted on is just

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.820 
series and you'll see bolted on is just
a<00:06:00.570> muffler<00:06:01.970> right<00:06:02.970> there<00:06:03.270> it's<00:06:04.230> quite<00:06:04.500> a<00:06:04.590> large

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
a muffler right there it's quite a large

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.100 
a muffler right there it's quite a large
muffler<00:06:05.310> but<00:06:05.970> it's<00:06:06.150> boat<00:06:06.360> it<00:06:06.510> on<00:06:06.630> and<00:06:06.810> it<00:06:06.870> comes

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
muffler but it's boat it on and it comes

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.000 
muffler but it's boat it on and it comes
down<00:06:07.350> and<00:06:07.590> as<00:06:07.710> that<00:06:08.280> low<00:06:08.490> outlet<00:06:08.910> we<00:06:09.060> like<00:06:09.240> that

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
down and as that low outlet we like that

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.960 
down and as that low outlet we like that
Hitler<00:06:11.010> makes<00:06:11.220> it<00:06:11.370> where<00:06:11.520> you<00:06:11.580> got<00:06:11.730> a<00:06:11.760> little

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
Hitler makes it where you got a little

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.060 
Hitler makes it where you got a little
shield<00:06:12.150> here<00:06:12.480> blocks<00:06:12.930> from<00:06:13.200> that<00:06:13.410> extra<00:06:13.830> heat

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
shield here blocks from that extra heat

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.940 
shield here blocks from that extra heat
and<00:06:14.310> maybe<00:06:14.490> some<00:06:14.640> papers<00:06:15.000> to<00:06:15.210> but<00:06:16.170> that's<00:06:16.770> on

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
and maybe some papers to but that's on

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.970 
and maybe some papers to but that's on
that<00:06:17.130> side<00:06:17.360> and<00:06:18.360> over<00:06:18.480> here<00:06:18.630> on<00:06:18.990> the<00:06:19.170> operator

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
that side and over here on the operator

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.190 
that side and over here on the operator
side<00:06:20.420> you'll<00:06:21.420> notice<00:06:21.750> that<00:06:21.870> above<00:06:22.170> that

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200
