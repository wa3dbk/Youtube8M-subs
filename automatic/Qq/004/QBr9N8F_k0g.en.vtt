00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.670
 Welcome here to this new video 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.710
 and well, this time I bring you 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.020
 a revolution gameplay to talk about 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.510
 about filmed naruto the movie well 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.760
 is the movie that came out on the 6th of 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.850
 December in Japan already has a date 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.039
 exit for what has been going on 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.260
 I would say that we really but good 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.480
 rather it is the output in bluray and dvd 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.860
 how good this means that dependent 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.780
 of this date is the date on which 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.640
 we are going to be able to see it or we are going 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.070
 to be able to enjoy in good quality with 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.780
 a decent dubbing and not a change like 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.940
 those that are currently seen in what 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.220
 youtube and different pages ok then 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.140
 good the departure date for what is 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.710
 the bluray and the dvd is dated for 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.600
 those for what is July 22 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.550
 The truth is that it is the first time 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.290
 what is a film of Japan takes 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.260
 so long in arriving here we are 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.030
 talking about seven months little more than 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.950
 seven months for what is the output of 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.810
 what is this dvd 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.790
 normally it takes six months for 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.250
 what is the publication of what they are 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.530
 these let's say these versions do not 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.540
 so then we have a date 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.190
 of departure on July 22 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.710
 obviously good because it's the output of 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.890
 the dvds have to wait for good 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.810
 make the rif of what is the king or the dvd 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.190
 depending on the case so good what 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.990
 we have available for our 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.630
 enjoy with subtitles by some fan 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.369
 sub that good as many there are then to 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.929
 what is on the internet not then 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.090
 depended on this good date 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.009
 we will see the publication of some good 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.229
 subtitles not from a few phantoms again 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.170
 but about a few good ones the 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.330
 day 25 if not a little more to more 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.490
 take what is the 27 ok then 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.560
 we will be seeing a decent publication 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.470
 of doubts naruto of mobile with about 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.440
 pretty good subtitles on day 27 you 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.420
 I calculate July 27 what good 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.450
 Well, it's very slow, there will be no people 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.719
 let it be 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.759
 and the same day you will see the movie is 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.320
 linked to what are the acquaintances 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.140
 as facebook, well, it's people 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.700
 which subtitles from the Japanese thing 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.040
 that is not so simple due to the handling 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.750
 of the times and so on with regard to what 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.300
 which is Spanish because it's good 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.890
 come subtitles that become decent 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.400
 after the translation is done 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.290
 to the English language that is more and easier 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.260
 so let's say compare with Spanish 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.920
 in that in that sense then 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.390
 normally the subtitles in Spanish 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.640
 they come out of the English subtitles 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.560
 So, good people, this is the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.150
 News from today's diary what 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.680
 Well, I had a little while 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.120
 I left the days more or less but good 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.040
 because he barely gave me time to do what 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.780
 what is this video then good people 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.910
 so let me here the comments what 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.489
 they think about what this is 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.079
 this little date if you do not stress a 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.670
 little the fact that so much is missing 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.709
 time for the output of what is the 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.720
 movie in a quality well enough 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.069

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.690
