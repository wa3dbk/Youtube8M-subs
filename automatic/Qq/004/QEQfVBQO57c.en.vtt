00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.890
 then now 2012 cyr end december 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.660
 november december 2012 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.700
 Eiffage took possession of the lands 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.520
 for the construction of lines for 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.779
 also permanent earth deposits or 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.140
 provisional 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.390
 and there we have in a set of difficulties 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.000
 with with eiffage and with the 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.079
 construction lines since 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.559
 first difficulties we had 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.290
 this is the crushing of destruction 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.690
 wood and grinding the woods that have 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.590
 occurred this winter so with footprints 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.060
 which have not been respected with 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.620
 land degradation following the 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.900
 logging of wood by grinding wood 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.130
 in the difficult conditions we have 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.030
 had fences ripped off 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.740
 still not necessarily always been 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.720
 rebuilt so the first 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.250
 difficulties started there we dug up 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.900
 swims that were cut off we saw everything at 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.070
 the time of the drainages that are 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.020
 today engaging with 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.490
 silt today the discussions 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.049
 with eiffage are always a little 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.149
 difficult that is to say that we do well 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.619
 the findings we go back the training on 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.579
 has people on the ground who they 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.560
 understand that they see that they 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.150
 then observe from behind a remainder 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.770
 with the problem so the terrain does not 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.460
 are not refurbished and drainage does not 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.040
 are not returned 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.990
 this perfect where it takes a time that 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.570
 was not the time originally announced 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.049
 the fences are returned way me 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.970
 redone 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.729
 it was still necessary to follow the construction site 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.229
 very closely and then today for this 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.040
 who is the cause the construction of the 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.229
 line itself 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.340
 well, we still have to do 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.360
 something that is not normal is 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.590
 a follow-up of the construction site 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.869
 example is to see wood that 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.030
 arrives on ds embankments while 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.520
 normally this wood should have been crushed 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.500
 at best believe or evacuate there it is 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.760
 Found on hard brie embankment on 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.170
 sees the topsoil that normally 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.159
 should be put aside to order by 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.930
 moments she's put aside the work 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.820
 is well done sometimes because a 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.570
 new team is coming because because 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.220
 that it's not quite the same 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.720
 Construction segment was people 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.369
 respect more the specifications 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.450
 so this time it's a follow-up 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.460
 site every time it's a lot of 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.360
 difficulties a lot of discussions we have 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.860
 the impression of passing for 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.060
 allow me the expression is a little 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.379
 vulgar but for troublemakers then 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.560
 that despite everything we argue our 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.110
 law 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.000
 today the yard starts at 5:30 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.310
 which starts synchronism first 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.849
 hitter their materials to 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.159
 5:30 and ends at 10am some 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.130
 bulletins mine at 22h 22h30 so we have 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.280
 while 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.530
 more big big day a noise 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.210
 permanent who is hardly 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.300
 bearable over on enough times 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.300
 long
