placement let's have a look at this so

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.260 
placement let's have a look at this so
once<00:00:47.070> again<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.309> place<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.700> again<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.090> is

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
once again a place it again and this is

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.029 
once again a place it again and this is
this<00:00:48.510> tour<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.809> really<00:00:49.140> only<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.680> if<00:00:49.890> you

this time I can't see it so I just run

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.380 
this time I can't see it so I just run
straight<00:00:53.550> through<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:53.969> if<00:00:54.120> there's<00:00:54.270> nothing

that's<00:00:56.370> definitely<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.000> good

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
that's definitely a really good

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.150 
that's definitely a really good
placement<00:00:57.660> no<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.109> gives<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.289> such<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> bigger

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
placement no it gives you such a bigger

placement no it gives you such a bigger
blast<00:00:59.460> radius<00:00:59.730> because<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.149> was<00:01:00.239> right<00:01:00.420> at<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
blast radius because it was right at the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.660 
blast radius because it was right at the
door<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.410> know<00:01:01.530> what's<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.219> going<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.430> get<00:01:02.550> is

door you know what's it going to get is

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.399 
door you know what's it going to get is
going<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.879> get<00:01:03.000> like<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.480> doorway<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.199> maybe

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
going to get like the doorway and maybe

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.530 
going to get like the doorway and maybe
maybe<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.040> tiny<00:01:05.369> about<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.820> door<00:01:06.000> type<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.450> in

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
maybe a tiny about the door type it in

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.240 
maybe a tiny about the door type it in
the<00:01:06.659> door<00:01:06.840> with<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.860> get<00:01:07.950> every

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
the door with that you can get every

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.250 
the door with that you can get every
everyone<00:01:08.760> inside<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.450> door<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.780> know<00:01:09.900> it's

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
everyone inside the door you know it's

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.960 
everyone inside the door you know it's
got<00:01:10.409> massive<00:01:10.890> blast<00:01:11.070> radius<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.610> plane<00:01:11.790> was

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
got massive blast radius the plane was

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.780 
got massive blast radius the plane was
and<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.420> blob<00:01:12.570> instantly<00:01:13.110> but<00:01:13.260> obviously

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
and the blob instantly but obviously

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
to move down to bouncing Betties and you

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.890 
to move down to bouncing Betties and you
know<00:01:23.549> about<00:01:24.000> two<00:01:24.270> beads<00:01:24.420> are<00:01:24.540> telling<00:01:24.780> bit

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
know about two beads are telling bit

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.359 
know about two beads are telling bit
more<00:01:25.110> different<00:01:25.500> because<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.250> know

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
obviously you can just drop shot and you

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.510 
obviously you can just drop shot and you
know<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.560> get<00:01:28.710> better<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:29.400> drop

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
know if you get better you can just drop

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.980 
know if you get better you can just drop
shot<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.939> don't<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.270> tutorial<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.780> that

let's go ahead let's move straight on to
the<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.850> better<00:01:54.090> placement<00:01:54.590> alright<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.799> is

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860

the better placement its back behind the
chair<00:01:57.659> on<00:01:57.869> hijacked<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.590> because<00:01:59.280> it's
