xbox<00:01:14.100> 360<00:01:14.579> came<00:01:14.789> out<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.090> May<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.539> I<00:01:16.020> think

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
xbox 360 came out in May and I think

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.020 
xbox 360 came out in May and I think
that<00:01:16.409> would<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> right<00:01:17.189> time<00:01:17.249> to<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:17.999> it

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
that would be a right time to do it

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.219 
that would be a right time to do it
because<00:01:18.119> that's<00:01:18.420> when<00:01:18.539> all<00:01:18.569> the<00:01:18.689> games<00:01:18.990> start

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
because that's when all the games start

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.020 
because that's when all the games start
coming<00:01:19.439> out<00:01:19.499> but<00:01:19.679> don't<00:01:20.249> get<00:01:20.340> me<00:01:20.429> wrong<00:01:20.549> maybe

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
coming out but don't get me wrong maybe

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.399 
coming out but don't get me wrong maybe
they<00:01:21.179> want<00:01:21.329> to<00:01:21.359> get<00:01:21.479> ahead<00:01:21.719> of<00:01:21.780> time<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.200> they

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
they want to get ahead of time but they

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.770 
they want to get ahead of time but they
have<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.649> lot<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.100> them<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.640> think<00:01:23.909> PS<00:01:24.179> Vista<00:01:24.600> will

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
have a lot on them I think PS Vista will

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.539 
have a lot on them I think PS Vista will
