private road out of that and that's

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.470 
private road out of that and that's
pretty<00:00:47.430> amazing<00:00:47.640> once<00:00:47.970> you<00:00:48.030> put<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.239> into

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
pretty amazing once you put that into

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.030 
pretty amazing once you put that into
context<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.710> reason<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.920> were

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
context and the reason that were

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.509 
context and the reason that were
involved<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.430> trestles<00:00:50.790> as<00:00:50.879> we're<00:00:51.059> surfers<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
involved in trestles as we're surfers a

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.280 
involved in trestles as we're surfers a
lot<00:00:53.519> of<00:00:53.640> people<00:00:53.850> ask<00:00:54.030> Surfrider<00:00:54.480> why<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.140> got

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
lot of people ask Surfrider why we got

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.869 
lot of people ask Surfrider why we got
involved<00:00:55.589> with<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.040> safe<00:00:56.190> trestles<00:00:56.519> campaign

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
involved with the safe trestles campaign

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.490 
involved with the safe trestles campaign
and<00:00:57.089> of<00:00:57.210> course<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.600> has<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.050> with<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.290> surf

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and of course it has to do with the surf

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.229 
and of course it has to do with the surf
but<00:00:58.769> what<00:00:58.860> I<00:00:58.890> think<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.220> really<00:00:59.579> important<00:01:00.180> for

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
but what I think is really important for

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.850 
but what I think is really important for
people<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.540> know<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:01.050> what<00:01:01.290> this<00:01:01.440> body<00:01:01.680> of

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
people to know is what this body of

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.439 
people to know is what this body of
water<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.339> behind<00:01:02.699> me<00:01:02.909> and<00:01:03.089> that<00:01:03.360> it

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
water is behind me and that it

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.109 
water is behind me and that it
contributes<00:01:04.019> amazing<00:01:04.799> water<00:01:05.010> quality<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.970> not

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
contributes amazing water quality to not

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.300 
contributes amazing water quality to not
only<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.869> ocean<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.500> itself<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.189> this

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
only the ocean and itself but this

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.219 
only the ocean and itself but this
entire<00:01:08.640> virgin<00:01:09.240> watershed<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.869> we<00:01:10.080> have

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
entire virgin watershed that we have

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.960 
entire virgin watershed that we have
before<00:01:10.380> us<00:01:10.590> what<00:01:11.220> happens<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:11.939> have

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
before us what happens is we have

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.060 
before us what happens is we have
cobbles<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.810> sediment<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.500> start<00:01:13.860> at<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
cobbles and sediment that start at the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.070 
cobbles and sediment that start at the
top<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.640> watershed<00:01:15.030> when<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.689> pushes

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
top of this watershed when it pushes

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.289 
top of this watershed when it pushes
through<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.500> pushes<00:01:16.799> out<00:01:16.920> cobbles<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
through it pushes out cobbles and and

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.660 
through it pushes out cobbles and and
really<00:01:18.509> find<00:01:18.930> sediment<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.799> helped<00:01:20.220> create

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
really find sediment that helped create

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.850 
really find sediment that helped create
how<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.479> wave<00:01:21.750> breaks<00:01:22.020> our<00:01:22.350> trestles<00:01:22.740> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
how the wave breaks our trestles and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.219 
how the wave breaks our trestles and
that's<00:01:23.400> why<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.329> fundamentally

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
that's why it's so fundamentally

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.649 
that's why it's so fundamentally
important<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.310> stop<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> toll<00:01:26.909> road<00:01:26.939> 16

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
important that we stop a toll road 16

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.050 
important that we stop a toll road 16
miles<00:01:27.900> up<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.380> watershed<00:01:28.680> because<00:01:29.670> that's<00:01:29.909> how

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
miles up a watershed because that's how

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.090 
miles up a watershed because that's how
it's<00:01:30.210> going<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.420> impact<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:31.170> waves<00:01:31.680> down<00:01:31.950> at

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
it's going to impact the waves down at

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.830 
it's going to impact the waves down at
the<00:01:32.189> beach<00:01:32.400> Russell's<00:01:33.329> as<00:01:33.450> part<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.750> a
