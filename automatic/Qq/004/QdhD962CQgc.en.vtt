00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.520 
how would you like to get the exact date

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.440 
how would you like to get the exact date
of<00:00:06.790> your<00:00:07.660> Atmos<00:00:08.139> clock<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:09.849> can<00:00:09.999> look<00:00:10.179> at<00:00:10.299> my

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
of your Atmos clock you can look at my

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.789 
of your Atmos clock you can look at my
clock<00:00:10.780> right<00:00:11.019> here<00:00:11.079> and<00:00:12.209> it<00:00:13.209> is<00:00:13.239> an<00:00:13.959> older

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799 
clock right here and it is an older

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.970 
clock right here and it is an older
clock<00:00:15.099> not<00:00:15.940> too<00:00:16.180> old<00:00:16.470> made<00:00:17.470> in<00:00:17.680> about<00:00:18.570> 1961<00:00:19.980> I'm

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
clock not too old made in about 1961 I'm

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.190 
clock not too old made in about 1961 I'm
going<00:00:21.250> to<00:00:21.310> show<00:00:21.490> you<00:00:21.550> how<00:00:21.940> to<00:00:21.970> find<00:00:22.450> the<00:00:22.780> exact

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
going to show you how to find the exact

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.029 
going to show you how to find the exact
date<00:00:23.500> on<00:00:23.770> your<00:00:23.850> Atmos<00:00:24.850> clock<00:00:25.440> first<00:00:26.440> of<00:00:26.620> all<00:00:26.800> if

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
date on your Atmos clock first of all if

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.310 
date on your Atmos clock first of all if
you<00:00:27.520> look<00:00:27.550> at<00:00:27.820> my<00:00:27.970> clock<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.750> first<00:00:29.020> thing<00:00:29.200> you

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
you look at my clock the first thing you

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.630 
you look at my clock the first thing you
would<00:00:29.380> want<00:00:29.470> to<00:00:29.710> do<00:00:29.920> is<00:00:31.859> move<00:00:32.859> the<00:00:33.070> lever<00:00:33.309> and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
would want to do is move the lever and

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.209 
would want to do is move the lever and
there<00:00:33.999> is<00:00:34.149> a<00:00:34.179> safety<00:00:34.899> lever<00:00:35.469> on<00:00:35.739> the<00:00:35.769> bottom

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
there is a safety lever on the bottom

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.959 
there is a safety lever on the bottom
that<00:00:37.120> stops<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:38.499> pendulum<00:00:39.129> from<00:00:39.339> turning<00:00:39.789> and

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
that stops the pendulum from turning and

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.349 
that stops the pendulum from turning and
locks<00:00:40.780> it<00:00:40.989> in<00:00:41.109> place<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.760> now<00:00:42.940> that<00:00:42.999> the

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
locks it in place so now that the

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.689 
locks it in place so now that the
pendulum<00:00:43.719> is<00:00:43.870> locked<00:00:44.140> in<00:00:44.319> place<00:00:44.559> you<00:00:45.339> can<00:00:45.489> move

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
pendulum is locked in place you can move

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.930 
pendulum is locked in place you can move
the<00:00:45.879> clock<00:00:46.089> around<00:00:46.300> very<00:00:46.749> nicely<00:00:47.640> next<00:00:48.640> I<00:00:48.729> want

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
the clock around very nicely next I want

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.779 
the clock around very nicely next I want
you<00:00:48.999> to<00:00:49.179> notice<00:00:49.390> that<00:00:50.289> there<00:00:50.559> are<00:00:50.800> two<00:00:51.339> locking

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
you to notice that there are two locking

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.419 
you to notice that there are two locking
pins<00:00:52.059> on<00:00:52.359> this<00:00:52.539> model<00:00:52.839> that<00:00:53.530> hold<00:00:53.829> the<00:00:54.010> case<00:00:54.219> in

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
pins on this model that hold the case in

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.200 
pins on this model that hold the case in
place<00:00:54.670> we're<00:00:55.059> going<00:00:55.210> to<00:00:55.269> take<00:00:55.479> this<00:00:55.659> case<00:00:55.929> off

place we're going to take this case off

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.770 
place we're going to take this case off
on<00:00:58.210> newer<00:00:59.079> models<00:00:59.620> the<00:01:00.069> case<00:01:00.339> only<00:01:01.059> comes

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
on newer models the case only comes

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.710 
on newer models the case only comes
apart<00:01:02.379> with<00:01:02.710> a<00:01:02.739> front<00:01:03.100> glass<00:01:03.850> with<00:01:04.360> a<00:01:04.390> little

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
clasp on the front that you move down

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.050 
clasp on the front that you move down
and<00:01:07.510> take<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:07.840> front<00:01:07.990> glass<00:01:08.320> out<00:01:08.700> now<00:01:09.700> I<00:01:09.730> want

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
and take the front glass out now I want

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.600 
and take the front glass out now I want
you<00:01:10.180> to<00:01:10.270> also<00:01:10.450> look<00:01:10.870> very<00:01:11.110> carefully<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:12.400> the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
you to also look very carefully at the

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.340 
you to also look very carefully at the
leveling<00:01:13.120> jacks<00:01:13.330> and<00:01:14.370> the<00:01:15.370> ball<00:01:16.120> that's<00:01:16.930> I

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
leveling jacks and the ball that's I

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.470 
leveling jacks and the ball that's I
mean<00:01:18.010> the<00:01:18.280> knob<00:01:18.820> ball<00:01:19.030> but<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.950> vial<00:01:20.950> that

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
mean the knob ball but the vial that

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.720 
mean the knob ball but the vial that
helps<00:01:22.480> you<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:22.840> indicate<00:01:23.500> if<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.220> clock<00:01:24.460> is

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
helps you to indicate if the clock is

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.600 
helps you to indicate if the clock is
level<00:01:25.210> or<00:01:25.360> not<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.860> that's<00:01:27.010> a<00:01:27.190> nice<00:01:27.340> little

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
level or not so that's a nice little

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.780 
level or not so that's a nice little
feature<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:29.140> clock<00:01:29.440> actually<00:01:29.710> operates<00:01:30.430> with

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
feature the clock actually operates with

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.740 
feature the clock actually operates with
an<00:01:30.970> anabolic<00:01:31.650> type<00:01:32.650> of<00:01:32.980> chamber<00:01:33.610> and<00:01:34.450> we're

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
an anabolic type of chamber and we're

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.920 
an anabolic type of chamber and we're
going<00:01:34.900> to<00:01:34.930> take<00:01:35.140> this<00:01:35.350> chamber<00:01:35.800> off<00:01:36.660> it's<00:01:37.660> held

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
going to take this chamber off it's held

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.000 
going to take this chamber off it's held
on<00:01:38.170> by<00:01:38.350> two<00:01:38.380> screws<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:41.650> is<00:01:41.830> not

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
on by two screws and this is not

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.460 
on by two screws and this is not
something<00:01:42.310> that<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:42.850> may<00:01:43.030> want<00:01:43.300> to<00:01:43.390> do<00:01:43.630> but

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
something that you may want to do but

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.930 
something that you may want to do but
you<00:01:44.740> can<00:01:44.890> have<00:01:45.100> an<00:01:45.250> experienced<00:01:45.760> person<00:01:46.150> do<00:01:46.300> it

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
you can have an experienced person do it

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.800 
you can have an experienced person do it
get<00:01:48.940> away<00:01:49.260> lefty<00:01:51.150> lefty<00:01:52.150> loosey<00:01:52.570> righty

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
get away lefty lefty loosey righty

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.360 
get away lefty lefty loosey righty
tighty<00:01:53.410> is<00:01:53.950> how<00:01:54.850> they<00:01:55.030> say<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:57.040> you<00:01:57.100> take

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
tighty is how they say it so you take

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.210 
tighty is how they say it so you take
off<00:01:57.550> the<00:01:57.760> two<00:01:57.940> screws<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.630> now<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.620> chamber

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
off the two screws and now the chamber

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.250 
off the two screws and now the chamber
will<00:02:00.430> come<00:02:00.610> off<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:03.670> chamber<00:02:04.180> is<00:02:04.390> what

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
will come off this chamber is what

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.590 
will come off this chamber is what
really<00:02:05.470> wins<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.220> clock<00:02:07.140> there<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.380> sealed

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
really wins the clock there is a sealed

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.480 
really wins the clock there is a sealed
inert<00:02:10.600> gas<00:02:11.010> inside

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
inert gas inside

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:20.250 
inert gas inside
of<00:02:12.550> this<00:02:13.440> unit<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:16.980> what<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.130> does<00:02:18.340> is<00:02:19.260> it

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
of this unit and what it does is it

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.830 
of this unit and what it does is it
moves<00:02:20.680> in<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.670> out<00:02:21.790> when<00:02:22.420> there<00:02:22.660> is<00:02:22.810> a

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
moves in and out when there is a

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.470 
moves in and out when there is a
temperature<00:02:23.110> change<00:02:23.910> there's<00:02:24.910> kind<00:02:25.300> of<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.450> big

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
temperature change there's kind of a big

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.430 
temperature change there's kind of a big
spring<00:02:26.020> in<00:02:26.170> there<00:02:26.350> as<00:02:26.470> well<00:02:26.740> now<00:02:27.330> if<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:29.230> look

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
spring in there as well now if you look

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.740 
spring in there as well now if you look
at<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.830> back<00:02:30.010> of<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.310> clock<00:02:30.550> you'll<00:02:31.390> see<00:02:31.720> a

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
at the back of the clock you'll see a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.960 
at the back of the clock you'll see a
spring<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:33.300> also<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.570> chain<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:36.640> little

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
spring and also a chain that little

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.810 
spring and also a chain that little
chain<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.720> what<00:02:38.590> hooks<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.070> movement<00:02:39.640> on

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
chain is what hooks to the movement on

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.800 
chain is what hooks to the movement on
the<00:02:40.090> inside<00:02:40.950> when<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.130> cylinder<00:02:42.480> expands<00:02:43.480> and

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
the inside when the cylinder expands and

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.480 
the inside when the cylinder expands and
contracts<00:02:44.260> because<00:02:44.770> of<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.010> temperature

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
contracts because of the temperature

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.670 
contracts because of the temperature
change<00:02:46.380> then<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:48.520> the<00:02:49.450> spring<00:02:49.810> is<00:02:50.020> wound<00:02:50.320> and

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
change then the the spring is wound and

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.640 
change then the the spring is wound and
now<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.190> clock<00:02:51.520> operates<00:02:52.260> now<00:02:53.260> how<00:02:53.470> do<00:02:53.530> you

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
now the clock operates now how do you

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.960 
now the clock operates now how do you
know<00:02:53.710> what<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.520> date<00:02:54.730> is

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
know what the date is

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.280 
know what the date is
well<00:02:55.600> on<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.740> very<00:02:56.920> top<00:02:57.190> of<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:57.850> clock<00:02:58.290> there

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
well on the very top of the clock there

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.980 
well on the very top of the clock there
is<00:02:59.320> a<00:02:59.560> place<00:03:00.070> right<00:03:00.340> here<00:03:00.730> which<00:03:01.390> is<00:03:01.540> very<00:03:01.780> kind

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
is a place right here which is very kind

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.610 
is a place right here which is very kind
of<00:03:02.200> hard<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.560> see<00:03:02.860> in<00:03:03.190> this<00:03:03.670> video<00:03:04.380> but<00:03:05.380> that

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
of hard to see in this video but that

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.040 
of hard to see in this video but that
tells<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.220> there<00:03:06.880> is<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:07.030> serial<00:03:07.510> number<00:03:07.810> there

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
tells you there is a serial number there

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.770 
tells you there is a serial number there
the<00:03:08.260> serial<00:03:09.010> number<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.340> this<00:03:09.490> clock<00:03:09.820> is<00:03:10.120> one

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
the serial number of this clock is one

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.710 
the serial number of this clock is one
three<00:03:11.170> eight<00:03:11.410> nine<00:03:11.830> three<00:03:12.700> six<00:03:14.940> so<00:03:15.940> you<00:03:16.300> could

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
three eight nine three six so you could

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.060 
three eight nine three six so you could
go<00:03:16.900> online<00:03:17.110> make<00:03:18.100> a<00:03:18.130> comparison<00:03:18.850> by<00:03:19.690> charts<00:03:20.320> to

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
go online make a comparison by charts to

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.610 
go online make a comparison by charts to
see<00:03:21.100> when<00:03:21.610> this<00:03:21.910> particular<00:03:22.320> model<00:03:23.320> was<00:03:23.560> made

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
see when this particular model was made

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.610 
see when this particular model was made
however<00:03:24.570> these<00:03:25.570> charts<00:03:26.080> are<00:03:26.230> not<00:03:26.260> very

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
however these charts are not very

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.080 
however these charts are not very
accurate<00:03:26.890> as<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:28.270> the<00:03:28.900> dating<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:30.610> best<00:03:30.850> way

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
accurate as to the dating the best way

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.540 
accurate as to the dating the best way
to<00:03:31.120> find<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.600> exact<00:03:32.020> date<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:33.130> look<00:03:33.280> inside

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
to find the exact date is to look inside

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.440 
to find the exact date is to look inside
of<00:03:34.150> this<00:03:34.660> chamber<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:36.010> it's<00:03:36.610> maybe<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.270> little

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
of this chamber and it's maybe a little

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.610 
of this chamber and it's maybe a little
bit<00:03:37.630> difficult<00:03:37.840> for<00:03:38.200> you<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.590> see<00:03:38.830> it<00:03:40.470> but<00:03:41.470> I'm

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
bit difficult for you to see it but I'm

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.100 
bit difficult for you to see it but I'm
going<00:03:41.830> to<00:03:41.860> turn<00:03:42.100> this<00:03:42.280> around<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:43.600> best<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:44.050> can

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
going to turn this around the best I can

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.180 
going to turn this around the best I can
and<00:03:45.450> get<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.570> light<00:03:46.780> just<00:03:47.200> perfectly<00:03:47.800> right

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
and get the light just perfectly right

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.080 
and get the light just perfectly right
on<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:48.640> it<00:03:48.850> is<00:03:49.360> difficult<00:03:50.250> but<00:03:51.250> if<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:51.610> look<00:03:51.880> at

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
on it it is difficult but if you look at

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.180 
on it it is difficult but if you look at
it<00:03:52.210> just<00:03:52.540> carefully<00:03:53.350> you<00:03:53.560> can<00:03:53.740> see<00:03:53.950> that

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
it just carefully you can see that

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.930 
it just carefully you can see that
somebody<00:03:54.580> scribed<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.300> date<00:03:56.010> inside<00:03:57.010> on<00:03:57.430> the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
somebody scribed the date inside on the

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.080 
somebody scribed the date inside on the
back<00:03:58.180> panel<00:03:59.140> the<00:04:00.040> date<00:04:00.310> on<00:04:00.520> this<00:04:00.730> particular

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
back panel the date on this particular

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.760 
back panel the date on this particular
one<00:04:01.510> is<00:04:01.810> 10<00:04:03.540> 861<00:04:04.540> I<00:04:05.730> think<00:04:06.730> this<00:04:07.150> clock<00:04:07.590> or<00:04:08.590> at

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
one is 10 861 I think this clock or at

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.430 
one is 10 861 I think this clock or at
least<00:04:09.040> this<00:04:09.760> chamber<00:04:10.420> was<00:04:11.200> made<00:04:11.500> on<00:04:12.090> 10<00:04:13.440> 861

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
least this chamber was made on 10 861

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.970 
least this chamber was made on 10 861
when<00:04:15.160> it<00:04:15.280> was<00:04:15.400> finished<00:04:16.140> subsequently<00:04:17.140> it<00:04:17.500> was

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
when it was finished subsequently it was

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.380 
when it was finished subsequently it was
put<00:04:18.280> on<00:04:18.459> my<00:04:19.090> clock<00:04:19.530> so<00:04:20.530> I<00:04:20.560> say<00:04:21.070> my<00:04:21.820> clock<00:04:22.180> is

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
put on my clock so I say my clock is

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.980 
put on my clock so I say my clock is
dated<00:04:22.780> to<00:04:22.960> 10<00:04:23.320> 8<00:04:24.870> 1960

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
dated to 10 8 1960

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.159 
dated to 10 8 1960
one<00:04:26.639> that's<00:04:27.639> how<00:04:27.970> easy<00:04:28.210> it<00:04:28.449> is<00:04:28.509> to<00:04:28.750> find<00:04:28.990> the

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
one that's how easy it is to find the

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.210 
one that's how easy it is to find the
exact<00:04:29.500> date<00:04:29.770> on<00:04:30.039> your<00:04:30.180> Atmos<00:04:31.180> clock<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:32.830> have

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
exact date on your Atmos clock you have

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.089 
exact date on your Atmos clock you have
exact<00:04:34.120> date<00:04:35.050> you<00:04:35.440> don't<00:04:35.620> have<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.919> guess<00:04:36.069> about

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
exact date you don't have to guess about

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.620 
exact date you don't have to guess about
it<00:04:36.610> so<00:04:37.800> this<00:04:38.800> is<00:04:38.860> a<00:04:39.009> very<00:04:39.220> very<00:04:39.490> simple<00:04:39.849> method

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
it so this is a very very simple method

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.249 
it so this is a very very simple method
of<00:04:40.900> getting<00:04:41.349> the<00:04:41.560> exact<00:04:42.069> date<00:04:42.310> I<00:04:43.050> hope<00:04:44.050> you

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
of getting the exact date I hope you

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.650 
of getting the exact date I hope you
enjoy<00:04:44.560> your<00:04:44.710> Atmos<00:04:45.130> like<00:04:45.759> I've<00:04:45.970> enjoyed<00:04:46.360> mine

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
enjoy your Atmos like I've enjoyed mine

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.650 
enjoy your Atmos like I've enjoyed mine
thank<00:04:47.440> you
