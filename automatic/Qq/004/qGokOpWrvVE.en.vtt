00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.380
 good morning good afternoon good night fans otras 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.279
 fire here the one who talks is the bringing council 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.080
 for you 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.990
 plus a tutorial this time there is a 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.000
 a little bit different tutorial about a 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.770
 theme that you have been asking for a long time 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.350
 time with the use I make of 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.080
 sharpen my aim as I do to 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.010
 improve my need because I speak 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.440
 that I am the tutor is a little bit different 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.330
 which is not quite a tutorial is very 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.610
 It's hard for you to just come and talk. 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.190
 best in his sights as well so those are 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.809
 just a few tips some 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.659
 you learn not only some tricks 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.870
 that will help you to improve how 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:56.210
 also some in a training strategy 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.250
 then we have to start with the first 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.019
 there is a theoretical part because people 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.510
 will have a theoretical part and a part 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.949
 practice the theoretical part is the number 1 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.010
 more important is the first thing that 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.180
 You will hear whenever you ask. 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.159
 this for the player a little more 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.659
 experienced in walking with a high aim 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.860
 when you see a player walking with the 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.380
 Look at the ground like I 'm doing. 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.240
 now you may already be since one thing is 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.250
 a novice player is a player 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.689
 inexperienced all the players 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.030
 experienced and walk the average 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.789
 I 'm high on the ship map just to 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.250
 show more often here in this line of 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:31.579
 is where you want to keep your 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.430
 Look then you always try to enter already 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.500
 with your aim positioned because you 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.420
 does this and this makes you need 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.399
 have only small adjustments in the 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.689
 to hit the head is already on the 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.369
 floor enters with the woman in any 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.649
 place you need to be in the sights 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.810
 making it far more difficult and 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.460
 greatly reducing its accuracy in 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.979
 The less you have to mess with 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.659
 mouse not only faster will you be 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.789
 as well as more precise 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.820
 The second tip when you are 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.499
 taking our theoretical part is calm I 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.689
 I see many players for example are 

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:05.450
 with the aim here and the opponent also 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.929
 here they start the meetings bring the 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.479
 look 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.940
 Look at the effect this has on our 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.370
 first shot came out at perfect pitch 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.940
 the second went up and the third one was there in the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.500
 high 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.600
 as soon as my girl arrived in 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.220
 head of a year my opponent mine 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.780
 record I had already entered're already 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.940
 sending the ball up 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.830
 do not forget more important in the hour 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.170
 to hit 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.540
 it 's not just to make that beautiful shot that 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.980
 Mythical shot is not you I'm the guy who 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.870
 destroy everybody 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.790
 the most important is the consistency you 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.140
 You gotta be the guy that 's right if 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.240
 This you have to take a little bit 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.350
 more to take a little longer 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.330
 take a step, no problem, the 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.390
 important is to hit 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.130
 then the psychologist's tip is the calm 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.350
 Take it easy when you shoot. 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.400
 do not begin to take ahead of time 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.350
 do not make that mistake the third tip I 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.840
 I often see a player when the 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.870
 first uses or it continues to 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.670
 da da da da da da da da da da da 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.510
 record starts to rise and stays out of 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.940
 control 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.060
 The best tip in this situation is what 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.680
 Shot while hiding when you 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.690
 hides you have all the time in the world 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.420
 to let your weapon cool or 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.940
 resets or resets when you return to 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.950
 its record is already below 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.010
 you can do another shot of the 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.780
 zero and the last tip here on our part 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.430
 is a very interesting thing. 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.520
 that I see that many did not realize 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.470
 when we are walking our sights have 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.380
 April trend smell scatter 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.820
 but the first shot you give when 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.280
 You 're in a sequence of shots. 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.150
 separated while you are walking is 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.670
 straight 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:44.620
 I'm going to test here for example let's take 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:50.200
 This box for me just looks at this. 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:53.410
 shots are very accurate look only the 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.019
 first shot is always in the middle of the island 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.720
 so this is an interesting tip here 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:02.019
 but how does this affect me? 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.700
 drop some bullets you're walking and 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.970
 also allows you to have better control 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.680
 Faith stress is a difficult team but you 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.269
 take it late you will understand that the 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.340
 Your first bullet will be straight you 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.650
 You need to stop walking when you go. 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.450
 drop second bullet is a very 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.650
 complicated for those who are starting to 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.049
 learn more after this mechanic 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.000
 fits this is automatic and makes a 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.900
 enormous difference in their potential for 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.850
 interchange 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.250
 now we'll come in a little bit of the 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.280
 Our practical part is the training part 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.950
 How do I train my aim the best at 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.039
 better at doing this in my 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.240
 opinion as the mechanics is simple and pure 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.620
 repetition 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.319
 and you take everything you are 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.449
 learning here if you force it 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:46.539
 compel to do so and enter into 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:49.449
 and forcing this kind of 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:51.699
 You will play several ship 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.740
 times per day you will play each one for 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.569
 yes several times a day and often 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.780
 You'll feel the urge to take it. 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:01.780
 the finger that will of maybe you catch 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.759
 someone from behind to climb on the sides 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.470
 That kind of thing you're training. 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.699
 You 're not trying to fred then. 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.280
 do not do it 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.900
 focus come in families obliges him to 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.870
 Catch those chips I'm talking about. 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.490
 come and go change your position have 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.130
 calm at the time of shooting always enters 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.210
 and that's what details are going to make 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.770
 huge difference 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.080
 so I 'll spend here now for you 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.349
 a little clip of how I do to 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.270
 train my good barking like me 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:31.990
 I told you earlier that part 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.210
 hence it is totally focused on repetition. 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.099
 pure mechanics, then the best way to 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.870
 to do is come and play, I'm 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.819
 showing here I quickly entered a 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.949
 A play room is showing 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:44.110
 as we always try to do 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:45.639
 walking with the high aim to try already predicts 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.889
 more or less where your opponents go 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:51.039
 to leave you already enter the most admired 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.509
 possible to notice the difference that I 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.550
 has high just as do the 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:56.469
 in the side aisle I already 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.810
 entered with my aim positioned 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:00.280
 before I take a look at what gives me a lot 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.860
 advantage when playing against 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.830
 these players is a bit more - less 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.620
 experienced and right there a little caught 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.840
 It was time for me to defeat the tab. 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.030
 I recommend simply over- face repetition 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.819
 get on the ship enter each one for you 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.860
 and to do this is to spend bullet is 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:19.990
 train you will make a mistake, look I'm 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.759
 wrong there and in time it goes 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.080
 start giving results in your workouts 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:24.759
 when you come in to play those 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.219
 that he or she with saw with his 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:29.620
 friends you will see the difference that is 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:30.909
 making and will have been worth it all 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.130
 effort you had 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:34.479
 I want to thank my friend fábio bank me 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.370
 helped in recording a video on the 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.139
 time to create a room and for today people 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.520
 keep on remembering 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:42.130
 I'll probably be putting it on tomorrow. 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.229
 a velog in the channel do not forget to 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.150
 enjoy and subscribe to the channel if you 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:48.130
 liked the video because there's more stuff 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.000
 cool getting there that personal hug 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.000
 went
