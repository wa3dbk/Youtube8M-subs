00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.099

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.640

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.140

 kind of clean line at the level of 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.200
 makeup 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.030
 I apply a base this one is the 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.610
 fume cupboard ticket in color and n 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.340
 then I like to take a lighthouse from 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.559

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.660
 you will put the name of the lighthouse in the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.390
 info bar and come to work my 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.980
 eyelid vintage with and I'm going to them 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.980
 shots and also to the outer corner 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.450
 then take another brush esteem 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.100
 afraid this one is clean with no 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.260
 produced on it and moaning fade 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.940
 edges I then removed this coach because 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.910
 that it's really not nice at all 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.640
 then I'll take a cream part of 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.170
 at chanel who rapper dazzled 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.430
 illusions of the number of researchers I 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.710
 do not compare me that I'm going to get involved 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.690
 for sure, my eyelid mobile and young 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.430
 involved from above with a flat brush a 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.960
 lighthouse at mac was on mission 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.010
 units I would still put us 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.010
 in the info bar 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.840
 for I come back again believes that 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.299
 the edges with the brush that we have 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.360
 used at the very beginning and I will even 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.310
 take a little brown matt makeup in 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.960
 maths still used in the hollow 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.170
 for good lets both 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.170
 colors 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.399
 I then use a lighthouse from 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.189
 mac who is goal he mark 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.319
 if I'm not wrong and I'm coming from 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.390
 to apply it in the outer corner and 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.250
 inner corner it was finished that I use 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.659
 very often in makeup and I 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.700
 find that wonderful sookie for a 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.069
 smoky eye and it still leaves a 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.519
 part of the light at the center of 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.440
 the eyelid 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.090
 so I like to work this flower as 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.239
 to score very close dark ago when 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.379
 even purple micro glitter and I 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:26.319
 then come to fade as 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:27.819
 usually the crying between her and 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.650
 that's where we'll start having fun 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.840
 so I come to take the home base 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.370
 sephora which alas glitter fawn that is 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.660
 special glitter that I'm going 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.069
 so get involved with the sound of the 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.379
 eyelid and then I take some 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.000
 mac with sequins I had there 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.349
 very very long time I would put you the 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.299
 reference in the info bar yet 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.349
 once and so I have a tap with 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.660
 my finger for that glitter 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.250
 adhere well i'll then still have a 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.440
 time is what we can add a small 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.540
 few hands and we will all result of past 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.519
 in the face because it's better to do 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.560
 the complexion before doing the eyelid 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.630
 lower you use a base of 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.700
 at laura mercier who is the wave 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.760
 vile crazy I think it's a base that 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.340
 he 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.290
 no everything is so I live everywhere on 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.829
 their use is then with a beauty 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.689
 blender I would have fallen from tonic of 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.400
 in whites absolutely not this country 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:15.049
 I will become apply the bottom of 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.540
 magical luminous complexion of that aurel 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.799
 I like a lot a lot 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.200
 that I do not use too much together 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.420
 because it's one in a very hue 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.980
 clear and I had a lot of trouble 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.150
 recover morning you free I can not 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.489
 complain about eating we did not look 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.329
 of a ghost as quickly as 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:35.180
 usually and I will come as well 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.620
 how to say erase the trek we did 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.569
 that they were clear at the outset which is 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.220
 a little blurry now so that 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.220
 it is well well well well being 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.760
 I'll let you then apply your 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.280
 corrector of our choice 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.360
 I use a gasoline I know 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.280
 not too much what I think for 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.849
 the moment so I will tell you a 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.620
 little more 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.239
 later I would put you recess years 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.190
 in the info bar and I'm going to 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.430
 rest we pay all that with madeleine 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.430
 time 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.060
 1 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.710
 I obviously come next powder and 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.650
 my concealer with my banana powder 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.720
 at anastasia beverly hills 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.610
 as usual I love it is for 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.500
 I do not get tired after the concealer 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.600
 I think it's great I sell 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.810
 then the feet of a game picks up 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.730
 then my by dull brown from the beginning and I 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.220
 will come to work on the eyelid 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.800
 lower forgiveness with which I'm going 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.420
 to make a very very hot effect but this 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.970
 that I love it and then I have a 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.280
 take the ball back from these fora 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.290

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.090
 glitter and I'm going to put that at the 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.210
 center of the lower eyelid for 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.620
 give a little effect I love 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.040
 I already had that old on a makeup 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.780

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.160

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.770
 then put mascara and I 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.830
 use the skinny bitch dahico and the 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:26.370

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.150
 for the inner corner 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.220
 I then went to the face again 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.470
 times jane eyre powder and face with 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.750

 at nars I love that I have in 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.340
 to dig well and to come then fermo 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.240
 contouring very very light because the 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.950
 games are very dark with the duo 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.360

 the info bar again for 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.790
 avoid that I'm wrong 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.960
 I then applied my blush so that 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.880
 it's a blush from make up for ever 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.510

 do not get tired I must tell him 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.680

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.930
 pity to leave it in a drawer and 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.270
 then I used a lipstick 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.640

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.570

 me since it's very pale of 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.570
 the picture is good for this look it was necessary 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:54.110
