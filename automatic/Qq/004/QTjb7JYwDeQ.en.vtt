00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
battlefield series so that was quite sad

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.359

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
to hear but at the same time I think

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:37.529

there<00:01:36.490> was<00:01:36.520> quite<00:01:36.819> a<00:01:36.880> lot<00:01:37.090> that<00:01:37.240> we<00:01:37.329> can<00:01:37.359> learn

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
there was quite a lot that we can learn

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.209 
there was quite a lot that we can learn
from<00:01:37.719> medal<00:01:38.170> of<00:01:38.200> honor<00:01:38.350> warfighter<00:01:38.409> that

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
could be implemented quite successfully

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.169 
could be implemented quite successfully

much<00:01:47.079> time<00:01:47.139> on<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.649> but<00:01:48.340> medal<00:01:48.609> of<00:01:48.639> honor

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
much time on this but medal of honor

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:50.609 
much time on this but medal of honor
warfighter<00:01:48.850> did<00:01:49.689> seem<00:01:49.929> to<00:01:50.079> implement<00:01:50.499> a

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
warfighter did seem to implement a

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.849 
warfighter did seem to implement a
system<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.280> weight<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.389> the<00:01:52.479> weapons<00:01:52.959> by<00:01:53.679> which

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
system of weight to the weapons by which

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:55.529 
system of weight to the weapons by which
I<00:01:54.009> mean<00:01:54.039> if<00:01:54.219> you<00:01:54.429> were<00:01:54.520> carrying<00:01:54.789> just<00:01:55.030> a<00:01:55.209> small

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
I mean if you were carrying just a small

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.539 
I mean if you were carrying just a small
SMG<00:01:56.139> you<00:01:56.380> could<00:01:56.590> run<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:56.950> little<00:01:57.130> bit<00:01:57.310> quicker

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
SMG you could run a little bit quicker

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.669 
SMG you could run a little bit quicker
than<00:01:57.759> if<00:01:57.819> you<00:01:57.999> were<00:01:58.090> carrying<00:01:58.329> a<00:01:58.539> large<00:01:58.780> LNG<00:01:59.499> or

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
than if you were carrying a large LNG or

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.069 
than if you were carrying a large LNG or
a<00:01:59.740> large<00:02:00.009> sniper<00:02:00.429> rifle<00:02:00.939> now<00:02:01.539> this<00:02:01.659> is<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.840> kind

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
a large sniper rifle now this is a kind

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.840 
a large sniper rifle now this is a kind
of<00:02:02.170> physics<00:02:02.920> that<00:02:03.009> doesn't<00:02:03.279> really<00:02:03.369> appear<00:02:03.700> in

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
of physics that doesn't really appear in

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.370 
of physics that doesn't really appear in
the<00:02:03.909> battlefield<00:02:04.179> series<00:02:04.569> it<00:02:04.929> does<00:02:04.959> seem<00:02:05.350> that

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
the battlefield series it does seem that

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.130 
the battlefield series it does seem that
with<00:02:05.679> a<00:02:05.709> lmg<00:02:06.429> you<00:02:06.999> can<00:02:07.149> run<00:02:07.299> just<00:02:07.509> as<00:02:07.600> fast<00:02:07.659> as

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
with a lmg you can run just as fast as

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.250 
with a lmg you can run just as fast as
with<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.500> m9<00:02:09.039> pistol<00:02:09.490> for<00:02:09.910> example<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:11.170> that

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
with a m9 pistol for example so is that

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.570 
with a m9 pistol for example so is that
the<00:02:11.410> kind<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:11.680> thing<00:02:11.860> you<00:02:11.890> might<00:02:12.190> want<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.459> see

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
the kind of thing you might want to see

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.130 
the kind of thing you might want to see
in<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.790> battlefield<00:02:13.090> game<00:02:13.450> but<00:02:13.810> if<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.050> were

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
in a battlefield game but if you were

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.680 
in a battlefield game but if you were
equipped<00:02:14.560> with<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.860> small<00:02:15.580> submachine<00:02:16.209> gun<00:02:16.390> you

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
equipped with a small submachine gun you

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.940 
equipped with a small submachine gun you
would<00:02:16.780> have<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.050> advantage<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.650> running<00:02:17.920> a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
would have the advantage of running a

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.410 
would have the advantage of running a
little<00:02:18.069> bit<00:02:18.280> quicker<00:02:18.520> than<00:02:18.849> somebody

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
little bit quicker than somebody

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.960 
little bit quicker than somebody
equipping<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:20.020> large<00:02:20.319> lmg<00:02:21.069> is<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.790> something

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
equipping a large lmg is that something

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.610 
equipping a large lmg is that something
you<00:02:22.120> might<00:02:22.209> want<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:22.420> see<00:02:22.569> in<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.720> game<00:02:22.930> or<00:02:23.470> do

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
you might want to see in the game or do

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.960 
you might want to see in the game or do
you<00:02:23.709> think<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.130> would<00:02:24.190> just<00:02:24.340> make<00:02:24.490> people<00:02:24.790> run

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
you think it would just make people run

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.280 
you think it would just make people run
around<00:02:25.090> with<00:02:25.360> their<00:02:25.480> pistol<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:25.990> their<00:02:26.080> knife

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
around with their pistol and their knife

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.750 
around with their pistol and their knife
in<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.560> hand<00:02:26.770> to<00:02:26.950> try<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:27.280> run<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.550> little

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
in the hand to try and run that little

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.180 
in the hand to try and run that little
bit<00:02:27.880> quicker<00:02:28.230> or<00:02:29.230> could<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:29.410> be<00:02:29.500> taken<00:02:29.920> just<00:02:30.130> a

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
bit quicker or could it be taken just a

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.680 
bit quicker or could it be taken just a
little<00:02:30.400> bit

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
little bit

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.510 
little bit
further<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.260> made<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.650> little<00:02:32.010> bit<00:02:32.130> cleverer

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
further and made a little bit cleverer

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.270 
further and made a little bit cleverer
as<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.480> were<00:02:33.570> carrying<00:02:33.840> an<00:02:33.960> LMG<00:02:34.620> just

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
as if you were carrying an LMG just

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.040 
as if you were carrying an LMG just
because<00:02:35.490> you<00:02:35.610> exchange<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.330> your<00:02:36.480> sidearm

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
because you exchange to your sidearm

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.600 
because you exchange to your sidearm
doesn't<00:02:37.560> mean<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.950> aren't<00:02:38.220> carrying

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
doesn't mean that you aren't carrying

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.730 
doesn't mean that you aren't carrying
the<00:02:38.850> larger<00:02:39.420> weapon<00:02:39.750> on<00:02:39.900> your<00:02:40.050> person<00:02:40.500> still

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
the larger weapon on your person still

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.310 
the larger weapon on your person still
so<00:02:41.370> by<00:02:41.580> taking<00:02:42.000> out<00:02:42.270> your<00:02:42.300> sidearm<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:43.020> still

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
so by taking out your sidearm you still

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.750 
so by taking out your sidearm you still
wouldn't<00:02:43.590> move<00:02:43.860> any<00:02:44.070> quicker<00:02:44.250> if<00:02:44.610> you're

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
wouldn't move any quicker if you're

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.390 
wouldn't move any quicker if you're
still<00:02:45.060> equipped<00:02:45.510> with<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.930> lmg<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:47.160> that

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
still equipped with the lmg is that

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.200 
still equipped with the lmg is that
something<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.760> want<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:47.940> see<00:02:48.090> in<00:02:48.150> a

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
something you want to see in a

something you want to see in a
battlefield<00:02:48.480> game<00:02:48.840> would<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.440> make<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
battlefield game would it make the

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.350 
battlefield game would it make the
classes<00:02:50.160> slightly<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.000> little<00:02:51.180> bit<00:02:51.270> more

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
classes slightly a little bit more

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.060 
classes slightly a little bit more
balanced<00:02:51.810> by<00:02:51.900> having<00:02:52.260> people<00:02:52.410> with<00:02:52.770> large

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
balanced by having people with large

the next battlefield game now the next

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.610 
the next battlefield game now the next
and<00:03:03.240> main<00:03:03.450> feature<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:04.140> I<00:03:04.200> want<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.440> talk

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
and main feature that I want to talk

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.560 
and main feature that I want to talk
about<00:03:04.650> was<00:03:05.130> actually<00:03:05.610> my<00:03:05.760> favorite<00:03:06.150> feature

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
about was actually my favorite feature

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.420 
about was actually my favorite feature
of<00:03:06.900> medal<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.260> honor<00:03:07.410> warfighter<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:08.220> it

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
of medal of honor warfighter and it

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.400 
of medal of honor warfighter and it
really<00:03:08.640> took<00:03:08.940> me<00:03:09.000> by<00:03:09.240> surprise<00:03:09.420> this<00:03:10.110> was<00:03:10.290> in

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
really took me by surprise this was in

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.920 
really took me by surprise this was in
the<00:03:10.500> game<00:03:10.680> in<00:03:10.950> such<00:03:11.280> levels<00:03:11.730> of<00:03:11.820> detail<00:03:12.240> and<00:03:12.510> I

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
the game in such levels of detail and I

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.090 
the game in such levels of detail and I

forward and improved and implemented in

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.030 
forward and improved and implemented in
battlefield<00:04:27.330> 4<00:04:27.440> maybe<00:04:28.440> things<00:04:28.710> like<00:04:28.950> the

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
battlefield 4 maybe things like the

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.590 
battlefield 4 maybe things like the
animation<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:29.790> we<00:04:29.880> saw<00:04:30.060> in<00:04:30.090> medal<00:04:30.419> of<00:04:30.450> honor

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
animation that we saw in medal of honor

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.420 
animation that we saw in medal of honor
warfighter<00:04:30.660> could<00:04:31.500> be<00:04:31.620> simplified<00:04:32.220> and

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
warfighter could be simplified and

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.760 
warfighter could be simplified and
reduced<00:04:32.820> sometimes<00:04:33.720> especially<00:04:34.050> in<00:04:34.530> match

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
reduced sometimes especially in match

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.409 
reduced sometimes especially in match
the<00:04:35.310> animation<00:04:35.820> could<00:04:36.000> be<00:04:36.060> a<00:04:36.090> little<00:04:36.210> bit

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
the animation could be a little bit

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.600 
the animation could be a little bit
glitchy<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:36.990> a<00:04:37.050> little<00:04:37.140> bit<00:04:37.350> slow<00:04:37.680> so<00:04:38.430> maybe

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
glitchy and a little bit slow so maybe

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.860 
glitchy and a little bit slow so maybe
this<00:04:38.760> kind<00:04:39.000> of<00:04:39.030> thing<00:04:39.210> could<00:04:39.330> actually<00:04:39.539> be

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
this kind of thing could actually be

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.750 
this kind of thing could actually be
simplified<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.500> make<00:04:40.830> it<00:04:40.979> work<00:04:41.130> better<00:04:41.340> with

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
simplified to make it work better with

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.119 
simplified to make it work better with
in<00:04:41.880> battlefield<00:04:42.360> 4<00:04:42.450> maybe<00:04:43.410> a<00:04:43.530> great

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:44.129 
in battlefield 4 maybe a great

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:45.769 
in battlefield 4 maybe a great
sample<00:04:44.399> of<00:04:44.520> this<00:04:44.669> to<00:04:44.879> take<00:04:45.059> inspiration<00:04:45.330> from

could be allowed to be customized in a

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:06.979 
could be allowed to be customized in a
future<00:05:05.550> battlefield<00:05:06.029> game<00:05:06.209> could<00:05:06.629> include

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:06.989 
future battlefield game could include

00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:09.259 
future battlefield game could include
things<00:05:07.529> such<00:05:07.649> as<00:05:07.769> the<00:05:08.219> materiality<00:05:08.699> of<00:05:08.879> the

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:09.269 
things such as the materiality of the

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:11.119 
things such as the materiality of the
lower<00:05:09.449> receiver<00:05:09.929> of<00:05:10.139> the<00:05:10.169> weapon<00:05:10.589> which<00:05:10.979> would

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:11.129 
lower receiver of the weapon which would

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:12.739 
lower receiver of the weapon which would
then<00:05:11.249> maybe<00:05:11.580> determine<00:05:12.059> the<00:05:12.179> speed<00:05:12.539> at<00:05:12.719> which

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:12.749 
then maybe determine the speed at which

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:14.600 
then maybe determine the speed at which
you<00:05:12.959> could<00:05:13.110> run<00:05:13.319> because<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:14.009> weight<00:05:14.219> of<00:05:14.429> your

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
you could run because the weight of your

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.850 
you could run because the weight of your
weapon<00:05:15.029> the<00:05:15.659> length<00:05:15.899> of<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.229> barrel<00:05:16.439> of<00:05:16.709> the

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
weapon the length of the barrel of the

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.709 
weapon the length of the barrel of the
weapon<00:05:16.889> which<00:05:17.429> would<00:05:17.580> then<00:05:17.699> determine<00:05:18.209> which

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:18.719 
weapon which would then determine which

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:20.419 
weapon which would then determine which
type<00:05:18.929> of<00:05:18.990> range<00:05:19.349> combats<00:05:19.860> you<00:05:20.009> want<00:05:20.159> to<00:05:20.219> be<00:05:20.309> in

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:20.429 
type of range combats you want to be in

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:22.249 
type of range combats you want to be in
close<00:05:20.759> range<00:05:20.879> short<00:05:21.360> range<00:05:21.569> and<00:05:22.019> that<00:05:22.169> would

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
close range short range and that would

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:23.570 
close range short range and that would
then<00:05:22.379> effect<00:05:22.740> if<00:05:22.979> the<00:05:23.069> bullet<00:05:23.309> was<00:05:23.369> going<00:05:23.519> to

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
then effect if the bullet was going to

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.999 
then effect if the bullet was going to
drop<00:05:23.729> off<00:05:23.939> longer<00:05:24.509> or<00:05:24.659> shorter<00:05:24.769> and<00:05:25.769> maybe

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
drop off longer or shorter and maybe

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:27.709 
drop off longer or shorter and maybe
with<00:05:26.399> certain<00:05:26.729> weapons<00:05:26.879> that<00:05:27.179> could<00:05:27.300> allow<00:05:27.539> it

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:27.719 
with certain weapons that could allow it

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:29.480 
with certain weapons that could allow it
even<00:05:28.019> the<00:05:28.139> caliber<00:05:28.679> of<00:05:28.830> the<00:05:28.919> weapon<00:05:29.009> you<00:05:29.399> are

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
even the caliber of the weapon you are

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.909 
even the caliber of the weapon you are
choosing<00:05:29.729> for<00:05:30.330> example<00:05:30.749> fire<00:05:31.199> five<00:05:31.439> six<00:05:31.740> or

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
choosing for example fire five six or

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.339 
choosing for example fire five six or
seven<00:05:32.309> six<00:05:32.519> two<00:05:32.729> rounds<00:05:33.179> and<00:05:33.300> with<00:05:33.749> those<00:05:33.929> the

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
seven six two rounds and with those the

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:35.899 
seven six two rounds and with those the
weapon<00:05:34.649> would<00:05:34.709> have<00:05:34.889> maybe<00:05:35.099> more<00:05:35.369> power<00:05:35.610> but

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
weapon would have maybe more power but

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.989 
weapon would have maybe more power but
less<00:05:36.119> range<00:05:36.509> or<00:05:36.779> less<00:05:37.709> power<00:05:37.949> and<00:05:38.249> more<00:05:38.669> range

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:38.999 
less range or less power and more range

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:40.399 
less range or less power and more range
for<00:05:39.240> example<00:05:39.659> so<00:05:39.779> these<00:05:39.899> are<00:05:40.079> the<00:05:40.139> kind<00:05:40.319> of

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
for example so these are the kind of

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:41.659 
for example so these are the kind of
features<00:05:40.709> that<00:05:40.860> I<00:05:40.919> think<00:05:40.979> could<00:05:41.550> be

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
features that I think could be

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.609 
features that I think could be
implemented<00:05:42.269> really<00:05:42.689> well<00:05:42.869> into<00:05:43.169> battlefield

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:43.619 
implemented really well into battlefield

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:46.309 
implemented really well into battlefield
4<00:05:43.889> and<00:05:44.249> really<00:05:44.550> allow<00:05:44.849> that<00:05:45.179> high<00:05:45.779> level<00:05:46.199> of

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 
4 and really allow that high level of

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:48.199 
4 and really allow that high level of
customization<00:05:46.739> with<00:05:47.279> the<00:05:47.369> weapons<00:05:47.729> and<00:05:47.969> tools

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:48.209 
customization with the weapons and tools

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:50.059 
customization with the weapons and tools
that<00:05:48.569> you<00:05:48.869> take<00:05:49.079> on<00:05:49.229> to<00:05:49.319> the<00:05:49.409> battlefield<00:05:49.919> and

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069 
that you take on to the battlefield and

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.609 
that you take on to the battlefield and
now<00:05:50.879> we<00:05:50.939> know<00:05:51.209> that<00:05:51.240> battlefield<00:05:51.749> 4<00:05:52.259> will

00:05:52.609 --> 00:05:52.619 
now we know that battlefield 4 will

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:54.319 
now we know that battlefield 4 will
feature<00:05:52.919> weapons<00:05:53.519> that<00:05:53.669> are<00:05:53.759> alive<00:05:53.969> to<00:05:54.209> have

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:54.329 
feature weapons that are alive to have

00:05:54.329 --> 00:05:56.389 
feature weapons that are alive to have
two<00:05:54.629> types<00:05:54.929> of<00:05:55.079> sight<00:05:55.349> on<00:05:55.589> the<00:05:55.740> weapon<00:05:55.860> at<00:05:56.159> once

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:56.399 
two types of sight on the weapon at once

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:58.850 
two types of sight on the weapon at once
in<00:05:56.699> the<00:05:57.240> gameplay<00:05:57.689> we<00:05:57.839> saw<00:05:58.050> the<00:05:58.110> US<00:05:58.469> soldier

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
in the gameplay we saw the US soldier

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.790 
in the gameplay we saw the US soldier
with<00:05:59.009> the<00:05:59.039> m16<00:05:59.789> with<00:05:59.969> the<00:06:00.179> 4.3<00:06:00.929> American<00:06:01.499> scope

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
with the m16 with the 4.3 American scope

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.919 
with the m16 with the 4.3 American scope
and<00:06:01.949> the<00:06:02.009> iron<00:06:02.759> sights<00:06:03.029> on<00:06:03.269> the<00:06:03.479> weapon<00:06:03.779> at

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:03.929 
and the iron sights on the weapon at

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:06.290 
and the iron sights on the weapon at
once<00:06:04.199> so<00:06:04.709> this<00:06:04.979> too<00:06:05.249> could<00:06:05.550> include<00:06:05.939> a<00:06:06.029> higher

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
once so this too could include a higher

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.239 
once so this too could include a higher
level<00:06:06.659> of<00:06:06.719> customization<00:06:07.169> allowing<00:06:08.039> players

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:08.249 
level of customization allowing players

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:10.309 
level of customization allowing players
to<00:06:08.429> pick<00:06:08.759> which<00:06:09.089> two<00:06:09.119> types<00:06:09.689> of<00:06:09.869> sight<00:06:10.139> they

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 
to pick which two types of sight they

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.019 
to pick which two types of sight they
can<00:06:10.439> have<00:06:10.589> on<00:06:10.679> the<00:06:10.769> weapon<00:06:11.069> maybe<00:06:11.729> you<00:06:11.909> can

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:12.029 
can have on the weapon maybe you can

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:14.119 
can have on the weapon maybe you can
have<00:06:12.179> two<00:06:12.389> types<00:06:12.659> of<00:06:12.779> optics<00:06:13.169> maybe<00:06:13.709> you<00:06:13.860> can't

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:14.129 
have two types of optics maybe you can't

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:15.769 
have two types of optics maybe you can't
maybe<00:06:14.399> you<00:06:14.550> can<00:06:14.669> pick<00:06:14.879> which<00:06:15.119> type<00:06:15.389> of<00:06:15.419> iron

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:15.779 
maybe you can pick which type of iron

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:18.109 
maybe you can pick which type of iron
sight<00:06:16.019> you<00:06:16.169> want<00:06:16.409> maybe<00:06:16.919> you<00:06:17.099> can't<00:06:17.399> so<00:06:17.699> these

00:06:18.109 --> 00:06:18.119 
sight you want maybe you can't so these
