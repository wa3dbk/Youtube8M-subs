00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:09.280
 that one to all the state tutorial for 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:10.980
 your 985 phones and now I wait like 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.160
 process 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.750
 what is this for in order to urge the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.610
 rum cooked and to be able to install 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.970
 some applications from the recovery 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.740
 as it is not a t9 keyboard in the case that 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.970
 have installed 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.970
 already provides more power 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.120
 the following 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.649
 you can download the files that 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.390
 you need are like five megabytes I'm going to 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.300
 leave the download link in the video 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.690
 It is a normal application and an image 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.360
 about the recovery 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:52.580
 this is version 6.0 point 2.7 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:58.760
 I think that nothing connects in your 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:01:01.760
 phone to the computer and I connect it 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.760
 d 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.129
 Y 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.610
 I hope you connect it 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.510
 ready 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.920
 activate data storage and 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.040
 right now they will see that it appears in the 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.040
 screen 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.869
 we hope they charge 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.920
 I do not know why this something closed the place 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.469
 list is 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.070
 and what we are going to do is open the 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:07.369
 americas card in the case of 4 gigas 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.940
 we open it and let's copy it in the 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:15.129
 root copy the sb that we must meet 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.129
 I already have them here 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.400
 Y 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.170
 they copy them and the next thing is going to be in the 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.940
 phone 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.370
 I must clarify to be able to do this 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.260
 there are several hotels 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.640
 in how on this phone is the 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.890
 tutorial on the facebook page 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.370
 so we go to the phone so they can see 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.370
 how was it 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.930
 well here we are on the phone what 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.140
 next after installing the application 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.140
 what happened to the memory 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.920
 44 tools 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:04.920
 if you can see it install install and 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.270
 we hope to settle 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.270
 and the wta ready 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.440
 and the stars turn 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:18.300
 after that 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.300
 wait for me to load the application 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.460
 and they give this button as they see 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.920
 because it's in Chinese they give this button 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.140
 on the left side here only what 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.150
 only to be born is sweden I recovered from 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.030
 that state 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:41.040
 and select the image recovery the 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.460
 Only selection and pleasure recovery the 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.200
 secular 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.670
 and what he is going to do that is him is the 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.900
 region the phone financed it because 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.750
 I have it 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.939
 and so they see if it works and then 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.939
 restart the phone in a mode 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.730
 and xd to pick up the board 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.540
 and disconnected from which I speak you see 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.330
 excuse the voice but I'm bad or the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.110
 throat 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.110
 I hear them like that 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.130
 there is the groove behring death are 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.450
 the volume keys 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.400
 write down 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.400
 the button of the cameras to accept 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.220
 how can you see 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.070
 and to use the normal button of the 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.070
 he came back 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.409
 6.023 when newly installed in the 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:51.889
 tour before installing all this 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:53.569
 I recommend making a backup and for 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.389
 Register your phone as factory 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:58.520
 so that the recovery works well and not 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.199
 have failures 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.320
 let's see what starts well so that 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.300
 can you see 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.870
 and it's not to say it's a drowned state 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.870
 like that 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.710
 something is being dug 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.530
 is 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:36.210
 everything that is said has already started me 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.470
 phone 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.470
 we hope that neither yes 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.260
 Y 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:07.250
 is ready for the signal 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:11.010
 of failures 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:14.430
 would be all the next tutorial is going to be 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:17.270
 you can install the keyboard t9 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.810
 alphanumeric like that says 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.310
 this for many that example in my case 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.169
 I like this type of keyboard 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:30.759
 alphanumeric 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:30.759
 and then they are exposing the qwerty keyboard 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.220
 there is 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.099
 the professionals are much better at 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.110
 the 9 and the strong is in that by 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:45.630
 defect the phone so what 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.510
 I recommend 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.880
 we will already teach you a way how 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.890
 put it in the next tutorial but they 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.250
 have liked to serve them and we go to the 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.250
 next
