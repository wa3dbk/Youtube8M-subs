okay<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.600> first<00:00:06.840> part<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.200> doing<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.830> to

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
okay the first part of doing this is to

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.450 
okay the first part of doing this is to
create<00:00:08.370> two<00:00:09.270> lines<00:00:09.540> very<00:00:10.440> simple<00:00:10.950> lines<00:00:11.130> to

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
create two lines very simple lines to

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.490 
create two lines very simple lines to
know<00:00:11.520> what's<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.820> bit<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.180> a<00:00:13.910> circle<00:00:15.139> we<00:00:16.139> put<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
know what's a bit of a circle we put the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500 
know what's a bit of a circle we put the
line<00:00:16.650> down<00:00:16.920> there<00:00:17.189> a<00:00:17.369> straight<00:00:18.090> line<00:00:18.330> down

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
line down there a straight line down

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.750 
line down there a straight line down
like<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:18.840> kind<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.500> an<00:00:19.590> angle<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.400> second

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
like that kind of an angle the second

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.790 
like that kind of an angle the second
line<00:00:20.880> goes<00:00:21.270> up<00:00:22.369> you<00:00:23.369> got<00:00:23.520> that<00:00:23.960> now<00:00:24.960> we<00:00:25.410> draw<00:00:25.619> a

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
line goes up you got that now we draw a

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.820 
line goes up you got that now we draw a
little<00:00:26.100> birdie<00:00:26.550> here<00:00:27.320> let<00:00:28.320> me<00:00:28.410> make<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> couple
