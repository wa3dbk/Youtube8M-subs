so I'm assuming that there's quite a lot

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.789 
so I'm assuming that there's quite a lot
of<00:01:14.820> interest<00:01:15.240> around<00:01:15.570> all<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> camos<00:01:16.500> that

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
of interest around all the camos that

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.410 
of interest around all the camos that

are going to be in modern warfare 3 but

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.210 
are going to be in modern warfare 3 but
I'll<00:01:18.540> come<00:01:18.810> back<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.320> one<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.920> minute

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
I'll come back to that one in a minute

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.580

enabled in call duty games so here we

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.649 
enabled in call duty games so here we
have<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.070> list<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> proficiencies<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.570> the

have a list of the proficiencies for the
assault<00:01:46.140> class<00:01:46.500> for<00:01:46.860> example<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.360> class

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
assault class for example in this class

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.539 
assault class for example in this class
the<00:01:48.960> score<00:01:49.290> L<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.500> being<00:01:49.890> used<00:01:50.070> which<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.430> an

the score L is being used which is an

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.210 
the score L is being used which is an
assault<00:01:50.820> rifle<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.290> six

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
assault rifle so we have six

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
might as well have one of them and we've

might as well have one of them and we've
got<00:02:00.600> kick<00:02:00.869> which<00:02:01.140> means<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.770> get<00:02:01.890> reduced

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219

useful we've got impact which is

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.499 
useful we've got impact which is

warfare<00:02:21.780> 2<00:02:22.290> but<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.680> was<00:02:22.830> in<00:02:23.040> there<00:02:23.310> we<00:02:23.640> also

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
warfare 2 but it was in there we also

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.820 
warfare 2 but it was in there we also
have<00:02:24.120> focus<00:02:24.750> which<00:02:24.930> means<00:02:25.140> when<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.440> get<00:02:25.590> hit

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
have focus which means when you get hit

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.220 
have focus which means when you get hit
by<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> bullet<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.000> don't<00:02:27.390> flinch<00:02:27.840> as<00:02:28.020> much

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
by a bullet and you don't flinch as much

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.860 
by a bullet and you don't flinch as much
as<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.500> do<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.370> were<00:02:29.820> keep<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.510> gone<00:02:30.660> more

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
as you do so you were keep you gone more

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.380 
as you do so you were keep you gone more
steady<00:02:31.200> when<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.590> get<00:02:31.770> hit<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.340> next<00:02:32.970> we<00:02:33.240> have

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
steady when you get hit and next we have

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.470 
steady when you get hit and next we have
breath<00:02:33.870> which<00:02:34.140> is<00:02:34.320> actually<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:35.150> specific<00:02:36.150> to

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
breath which is actually a specific to

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.770 
breath which is actually a specific to
this<00:02:36.950> assault<00:02:37.950> class<00:02:38.250> as<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:38.790> was<00:02:38.880> saying<00:02:39.120> this

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
this assault class as I was saying this

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.270 
this assault class as I was saying this
is<00:02:39.960> one<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.290> ones<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.590> changes

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
is one of the ones that changes

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.430 
is one of the ones that changes
depending<00:02:41.640> on<00:02:41.760> what<00:02:41.940> class<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.330> have<00:02:42.440> breath

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
depending on what class you have breath

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.200 
depending on what class you have breath
obviously<00:02:43.980> allows<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.670> hold<00:02:44.970> your<00:02:45.090> breath

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
obviously allows you to hold your breath

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.600 
obviously allows you to hold your breath
longer<00:02:45.330> whilst<00:02:45.870> aiming<00:02:46.110> down<00:02:46.380> sights<00:02:46.440> so<00:02:47.400> if

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
longer whilst aiming down sights so if

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.790 
longer whilst aiming down sights so if
you<00:02:47.700> changing<00:02:48.090> onto<00:02:48.390> an<00:02:48.480> SMG<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:49.350> option

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
you changing onto an SMG this option

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.880 
you changing onto an SMG this option
will<00:02:49.830> change<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:51.030> be<00:02:51.840> able<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.230> knife<00:02:52.470> quicker

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
will change to be able to knife quicker

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.560 
will change to be able to knife quicker
so<00:02:53.250> instead<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.580> holding<00:02:53.790> breath<00:02:54.060> longer<00:02:54.390> you

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
so instead of holding breath longer you

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.050 
so instead of holding breath longer you
can<00:02:54.690> knife<00:02:54.930> quicker<00:02:55.260> which<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.590> more<00:02:56.060> suited

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
can knife quicker which is more suited

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.450 
can knife quicker which is more suited
for<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.360> kind<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.690> class<00:02:57.990> where<00:02:58.290> SMGs<00:02:58.950> and

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
for that kind of class where SMGs and

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.700 
for that kind of class where SMGs and
the<00:02:59.700> LMG<00:03:00.270> class<00:03:00.570> allows<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.230> run<00:03:01.440> for

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
the LMG class allows you to run for

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.070 
the LMG class allows you to run for
longer<00:03:01.890> which<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.370> very<00:03:02.610> helpful<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.360> at<00:03:03.960> the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
longer which is very helpful and at the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.270 
longer which is very helpful and at the
minute<00:03:04.290> that's<00:03:04.440> all<00:03:04.590> we<00:03:04.770> know<00:03:04.890> about<00:03:04.920> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
minute that's all we know about the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.820 
minute that's all we know about the
different<00:03:05.640> classes<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.300> how<00:03:06.960> it<00:03:07.110> changes<00:03:07.590> for

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
different classes and how it changes for

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.430 
different classes and how it changes for
that<00:03:07.950> different<00:03:08.700> option<00:03:09.240> but<00:03:09.810> finally<00:03:10.230> down

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
that different option but finally down

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.620 
that different option but finally down
at<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.680> bottom<00:03:10.830> we<00:03:11.130> have<00:03:11.160> stability<00:03:11.610> here<00:03:12.210> and

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
at the bottom we have stability here and

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.170 
at the bottom we have stability here and
this<00:03:13.050> basically<00:03:13.290> means<00:03:13.560> when<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.220> zoom<00:03:14.940> in

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
this basically means when you zoom in

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.820 
this basically means when you zoom in
down<00:03:15.390> your<00:03:15.570> iron<00:03:15.750> sights<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.410> get<00:03:16.620> less

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
down your iron sights you get less

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.190 
down your iron sights you get less
weight<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.730> gun<00:03:17.910> because<00:03:18.660> they've

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
weight of the gun because they've

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.810 
weight of the gun because they've
actually<00:03:19.350> brought<00:03:19.709> that<00:03:19.890> back<00:03:20.160> from<00:03:20.550> because

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
actually brought that back from because

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.400 
actually brought that back from because
i<00:03:20.910> think<00:03:20.970> in<00:03:21.180> modern<00:03:21.420> warfare<00:03:21.570> 2<00:03:21.900> didn't<00:03:22.290> have

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
i think in modern warfare 2 didn't have

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.170 
i think in modern warfare 2 didn't have
sway<00:03:22.770> and<00:03:23.040> have<00:03:23.459> brought<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:23.820> back<00:03:23.970> from

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
sway and have brought it back from

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.080 
sway and have brought it back from
modern<00:03:24.480> warfare<00:03:24.660> 3<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.380> can<00:03:25.650> with

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
modern warfare 3 so you can with

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.630 
modern warfare 3 so you can with
stability<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.630> can<00:03:27.840> make<00:03:28.020> it<00:03:28.290> less<00:03:28.890> way<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:29.340> you

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
stability it can make it less way so you

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.400 
stability it can make it less way so you
get<00:03:29.790> more<00:03:29.970> of<00:03:30.090> an<00:03:30.209> accurate<00:03:30.630> first<00:03:31.200> time

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
get more of an accurate first time

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.530 
get more of an accurate first time
shocked<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.190> so<00:03:32.730> they<00:03:32.970> are<00:03:33.150> all<00:03:33.330> your

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
shocked and so they are all your

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.570 
shocked and so they are all your
proficiencies<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.500> get<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.740> choose<00:03:34.920> one<00:03:35.280> for

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
proficiencies you get to choose one for

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.490 
proficiencies you get to choose one for
each<00:03:35.790> class<00:03:36.209> which<00:03:36.810> enables<00:03:37.350> you<00:03:37.470> to

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
each class which enables you to

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.550 
each class which enables you to
customize<00:03:38.250> you've<00:03:38.430> gone<00:03:38.580> further<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.560> lets

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
customize you've gone further and lets

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.980 
customize you've gone further and lets
you<00:03:40.709> create<00:03:40.920> your<00:03:41.160> class<00:03:41.459> more<00:03:42.330> suited<00:03:42.810> to

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
you create your class more suited to

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.870 
you create your class more suited to
your<00:03:43.170> kind<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.740> playing<00:03:43.920> style<00:03:44.340> or<00:03:44.550> the<00:03:44.670> maps

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
your kind of playing style or the maps

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.550 
your kind of playing style or the maps
that<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.209> will<00:03:45.300> be<00:03:45.390> playing<00:03:45.630> on<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.470> is

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
that you will be playing on so that is

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.000 
that you will be playing on so that is
very<00:03:46.620> useful<00:03:47.310> looks<00:03:48.209> like<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.540> good<00:03:49.010> new

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
very useful looks like a good new

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.350 
very useful looks like a good new
feature<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.490> we've<00:03:50.700> put<00:03:50.880> into<00:03:51.030> modern

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
feature that we've put into modern

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.990 
feature that we've put into modern
warfare<00:03:51.540> 3<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.170> it<00:03:52.260> should<00:03:52.730> make<00:03:53.730> some

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
warfare 3 and it should make some

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.330 
warfare 3 and it should make some
interesting<00:03:54.810> gameplay<00:03:55.050> now<00:03:55.800> during<00:03:56.160> this

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
interesting gameplay now during this

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.070 
interesting gameplay now during this
trailer<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.940> does<00:03:57.090> briefly<00:03:57.570> show<00:03:57.870> the

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
trailer it does briefly show the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.130 
trailer it does briefly show the
camouflage<00:03:58.709> page<00:03:59.100> now<00:03:59.700> it's<00:04:00.000> unknown<00:04:00.900> whether

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
camouflage page now it's unknown whether

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.020 
camouflage page now it's unknown whether
this<00:04:01.440> is<00:04:01.500> actually<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:02.160> full<00:04:02.459> list<00:04:02.700> but<00:04:02.940> it

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
this is actually the full list but it

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.380 
this is actually the full list but it
looks<00:04:03.270> pretty<00:04:03.420> full<00:04:04.050> there<00:04:04.320> is<00:04:04.470> at<00:04:05.040> least<00:04:05.390> 11

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
looks pretty full there is at least 11

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.449 
looks pretty full there is at least 11
options<00:04:06.870> on<00:04:07.110> there<00:04:07.380> so<00:04:07.980> there<00:04:08.130> are<00:04:08.190> 11

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
options on there so there are 11

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.040 
options on there so there are 11
different<00:04:08.550> camp<00:04:08.940> largest<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:09.510> let's<00:04:09.660> just<00:04:09.870> go

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
different camp largest so let's just go

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.930 
different camp largest so let's just go
jump<00:04:10.320> right<00:04:10.530> in<00:04:10.770> there<00:04:11.040> we've<00:04:11.700> got<00:04:11.850> the

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
jump right in there we've got the

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.940 
jump right in there we've got the
classic<00:04:12.150> which<00:04:12.540> is<00:04:12.660> like<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.840> woodland<00:04:13.350> snow

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
classic which is like the woodland snow

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.590 
classic which is like the woodland snow
which<00:04:14.190> is<00:04:14.340> obviously<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.790> snow<00:04:15.090> version<00:04:15.480> of

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
which is obviously the snow version of

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.170 
which is obviously the snow version of
woodland<00:04:16.280> multicam<00:04:17.280> is<00:04:17.489> very<00:04:17.700> similar<00:04:18.000> to

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
woodland multicam is very similar to

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.690 
woodland multicam is very similar to
woodland<00:04:18.690> digital<00:04:19.290> urban<00:04:19.650> is<00:04:19.799> coming<00:04:20.549> back

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
woodland digital urban is coming back

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.020 
woodland digital urban is coming back
from<00:04:20.910> modern<00:04:21.239> warfare<00:04:21.419> 2<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:22.140> grey<00:04:22.470> one<00:04:23.030> hex

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.330 
from modern warfare 2 that grey one hex
we<00:04:24.540> don't<00:04:24.690> know<00:04:24.930> any<00:04:25.169> of<00:04:25.260> these<00:04:25.590> further<00:04:25.950> ones

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
we don't know any of these further ones

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.340 
we don't know any of these further ones
we<00:04:26.430> haven't<00:04:26.639> actually<00:04:26.790> seen<00:04:27.180> yet<00:04:27.540> so<00:04:27.960> hex

blue<00:04:34.740> red<00:04:35.130> red<00:04:35.360> autumn<00:04:36.360> is<00:04:36.570> like<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:37.800> fall<00:04:38.100> in

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
blue red red autumn is like the fall in

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.730 
blue red red autumn is like the fall in
modern<00:04:38.729> warfare<00:04:38.760> 2<00:04:39.389> and<00:04:39.630> they've<00:04:40.590> actually

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
modern warfare 2 and they've actually

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.790 
modern warfare 2 and they've actually
brought<00:04:41.130> back<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:42.150> gold<00:04:42.330> guns<00:04:42.690> from<00:04:43.500> black

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
brought back the gold guns from black

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.000 
brought back the gold guns from black
ops<00:04:44.040> and<00:04:44.479> cod4<00:04:45.479> so<00:04:46.290> that<00:04:46.830> should<00:04:46.979> be

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
ops and cod4 so that should be

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.250 
ops and cod4 so that should be
interesting<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.760> see<00:04:48.060> so<00:04:48.780> there<00:04:48.930> are<00:04:48.960> plenty

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
interesting to see so there are plenty

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.350 
interesting to see so there are plenty
of<00:04:49.440> newcomb<00:04:50.010> largest<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:50.790> work<00:04:50.970> your<00:04:51.240> way<00:04:51.330> up

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
of newcomb largest to work your way up

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.740 
of newcomb largest to work your way up
to<00:04:51.510> and<00:04:52.050> it<00:04:52.590> should<00:04:52.830> make<00:04:52.949> interesting<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:54.510> see

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
to and it should make interesting to see

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.189 
to and it should make interesting to see
how<00:04:55.500> long<00:04:55.770> it<00:04:55.979> takes<00:04:56.250> to<00:04:56.400> get<00:04:56.639> them<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:57.210> it

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
how long it takes to get them and it

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.379 
how long it takes to get them and it
just<00:04:58.740> makes<00:04:58.919> it<00:04:59.160> something<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.610> work<00:04:59.880> towards

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
just makes it something to work towards

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.330 
just makes it something to work towards
as<00:05:00.540> you're<00:05:00.720> on<00:05:00.810> you<00:05:00.990> gone<00:05:01.229> so<00:05:01.889> this<00:05:02.010> has

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
as you're on you gone so this has

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.980 
as you're on you gone so this has
revealed<00:05:02.760> a<00:05:03.000> lot<00:05:03.210> more<00:05:03.360> information<00:05:03.600> about

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
revealed a lot more information about

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.560 
revealed a lot more information about
creative<00:05:04.590> class<00:05:04.770> as<00:05:05.010> a<00:05:05.040> whole<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:06.150> cameras

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
creative class as a whole the cameras

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.110 
creative class as a whole the cameras
the<00:05:06.840> guns<00:05:07.080> and<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.550> proficiencies<00:05:08.550> that<00:05:08.850> have

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
the guns and the proficiencies that have

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.750 
the guns and the proficiencies that have
not<00:05:09.930> really<00:05:10.350> been<00:05:10.380> explained<00:05:11.310> that<00:05:11.520> well

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
not really been explained that well

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.420 
not really been explained that well
before<00:05:12.150> this<00:05:12.389> trailer<00:05:13.260> so<00:05:13.770> I<00:05:13.800> hope<00:05:14.160> this<00:05:14.280> has

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
before this trailer so I hope this has
