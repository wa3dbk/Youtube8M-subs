00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.769
 and more today we are going to make a 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.139
 video about the entire full line of 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.029
 accessories eagle warrior this video 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.460
 we had already done it with some of the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.859
 accessories that this brand has but has 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.960
 lately grown a lot your line 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.050
 of products and well let's show them 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.210
 all to start we have his three 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.800
 mice of the line gaming one of them 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.510
 you probably already know that it is the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.950
 gaming 13 we also have gaming 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.300
 g-16 and the gaming g-14 we are going to open them 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.740
 so that they can see a little more 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.080
 near 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.960
 very well here we can see the three 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.450
 mouse of equal warrior as we can see 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.610
 All three have a size very 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.800
 seemed like they often ask me 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.630
 which has better functions but the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.700
 functions are really the same in 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.950
 The three models also have the 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.550
 same number of buttons and all three 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.320
 pepe feature and selectable up 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.940
 2400 so they serve us without problem 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.960
 any of the three for our 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.150
 video game 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.350
 The first one that I am going to show you is the 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.350
 gaming health 13 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.409
 as you can see it has a texture a 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.430
 little soft on top here 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.110
 has the igor warrior logo 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.310
 they all have a lighting 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.100
 led 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:36.250
 of the 13 is well seems the most comfortable 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.250
 and the most ergonomic in terms of its shape 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.079
 on this side we have gaming g-14 that 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.659
 it seems to me one of the most attractive 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.320
 visually by the engraving he has of 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.320
 a skull 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.130
 and finally we have the g-16 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.460
 very good as we can see all have 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.310
 a pretty similar design 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.230
 and if you wish, you can combine it 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.000
 also with the mouse pad the eagle 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.680
 warrior that is precisely this that 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.680
 we have in the bottom 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.590
 very well let's continue with the 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.740
 eagle warriors headband is a headband 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.030
 with microphone designed for gamers and 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.560
 good usually comes in two colors 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.720
 this time I'm showing you the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.450
 red although it is also sold 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.490
 with the details in blue as 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.260
 we can see the packaging is pretty 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.690
 appealing to customers who often 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.490
 resell our products we are going to 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.220
 open it to show them like that 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.320
 very good detail here we can see the 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.650
 eagle warrior headband as we can see 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:23.230
 has a design designed for gaming 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.230
 has its flip-up microphone 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.130
 it is quite comfortable to use account with 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.320
 sponges in the ears both in the 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.430
 top of the head and its size 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.680
 it is adjustable 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.469
 It also has a practical control 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.260
 of volume in the cable I want me to 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:43.599
 they ask a lot is about the connection of 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.390
 this headband that is based on 2 jack 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.760
 of 3.5 millimeters as we can see here 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.340
 one of them is for the hearing aids and the 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.079
 another is for the microphone as they 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.859
 I commented this headband can also 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:59.469
 choose in blue and you just have to 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:01.859
 comment to send you what you 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:01.859
 like 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.769
 in the part of the keyboards we have 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.570
 three options one of them is the keyboard 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:21.329
 381 we are also going to have the kiel 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.120
 78 and although I would like to highlight is the 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.710
 axis 79 which is a keyboard and mouse kit 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.020
 it's important because some people 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.210
 they ask us if this keyboard can be 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.830
 combine with some other mouse but it's not 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.810
 possible since they come in the same 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.180
 packaging very well I will open them for 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.980
 show them very well here we have already 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.610
 the keyboards of eagle guardiola the 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.800
 first of them is the ghost warrior 381 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.530
 what is this but what I like about this 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.900
 keyboard is that it has a gamer design 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.060
 really can be denoted by the 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.910
 details on the top and on the 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.760
 bottom and above all they are 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.190
 highlighted the directional keys this 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.050
 it's as much on the arrows as on double 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.240
 usb which are the ones we use 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.080
 normally for 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.660
 good as main features 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.180
 would be your gamer design and in the part 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.020
 superior also has some 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.020
 multimedia keys 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.830
 the second one is the world keyboard 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:25.300
 warrior 78 which is the one that comes in the kit 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.590
 with the mouse 16 one of the main 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.810
 characteristics of this keyboard is that 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.300
 has backlighting as we can 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.450
 see has some details here in the 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:39.910
 laterals and the keys are 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.910
 also illuminated in red 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.780
 This keyboard also has 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.440
 multimedia features as we can see in 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.440
 the top 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:56.229
 finally we have the keyboard and guru 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.819
 warrior 678 many people ask me which one 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.430
 of the keyboards and the warriors is my 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:02.349
 favorite and it would undoubtedly be this time 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.569
 that has some pretty materials 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.580
 good typing is much smoother than 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.439
 in the other two models and has 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.770
 special functions such as for example 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:14.619
 we can activate and deactivate the light 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.210
 It has three levels of lighting and 

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:18.550
 something we can do is also 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.309
 change the color of the lighting as 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:25.289
 we can see we can have it in blue in 

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:25.289
 red and violet 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.380
 In addition, it has other 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.910
 functions such as resistance 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.160
 before spills 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.020
 and we're also going to have old 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.700
 ting and lock the windows key 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.400
 which is very important when 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.560
 we play our games 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.540
 to finish this video we have the 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.979
 eagle warrior fans these 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.889
 fans come in three colors 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:52.560
 we have blue green and red and they are 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:54.750
 of a size of 12 centimeters or 120 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.789
 millimeters these fans are 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.620
 compatible with both eagle cabinets 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:07:00.600
 warrior as with any other type of 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.000
 Cabinet that has space for this 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.490
 Fan size something I like 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.910
 of these fans is that they have 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:11.550
 a practical molex connection whereby 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.590
 we do not have to worry about knowing if 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:17.170
 we have room in our motherboard 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:20.170
 to connect this fan 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.170
 how 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.319
 very well, I hope you have them 

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:36.990
 liked the video if you liked it like 

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:39.300
