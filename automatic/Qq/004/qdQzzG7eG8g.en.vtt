You know most recipes start with an onion
so we need to know how to cut it properly.

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.719
I’m gonna show you two ways to dice an onion
and two ways to slice an onion.

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.740
First, we need to get to know the onion.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.670
This is the stem end of the onion and this
is the root end of the onion.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.900
We’d like to leave that intact as long as
possible because it’s holding everything

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.900
together.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.490
First, I’m gonna cut off just the very edge
of that root.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.670
Then, we’re going to make a flat surface
by slicing part of that stem end right off.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.760
Now we have a flat surface to work with.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.769
We’re gonna slice that onion in half and
that’s going to make it a lot easier to

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:40.769
peel.

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.719
You’re going to make a series of cuts into
the onion, but you’re going to leave the

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:45.760
root intact.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.300
So, with that root end away from the knife,
come down below the counter here, and make

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.760
a series of slices parallel to the cutting
board but not through the root.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.579
Leave that root intact so it can hold everything
together.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.559
About two or three slices is usually enough.

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.860
Then, take that root end and turn it away
from you.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.280
Make a series of vertical slices in the onion
but again, not through the root.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.610
Then, move that root end away the knife and
just slice down.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.299
That’s one way to dice an onion.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.810
Let me show you another way that eliminates
one of those steps.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.149
All we’re gonna do is slice the onion down,
but try to keep those slices together.

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.439
Now, turn that away from you.

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.600
And we’re going to fan those slices out.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.179
Now, just slice around the onion keeping the
heel of the knife where the center of the

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:46.820
onion is.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.939
Slicing in that fan shape will also give you
perfect little dice.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.869
So if you want long strips of onion, we do
something which is called sort of a French

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:55.869
slice.

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.380
Now you actually remove the core that holds
everything together, and then you’re going

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.950
to run your knife in an arch formation all
the way around the onion like that.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.970
So, start slicing and by the time you get
to the middle of the onion, your knife should

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.290
be perpendicular to the cutting board.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.520
Then, flip that onion down and start again.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.120
Nice long, thin slices of onion.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.840
If on the other hand you want more half moon
slices of onion, all you have to do is slice

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.730
down like this, and you’ll have half moon
slices.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.860
Thank you so much for watching!
