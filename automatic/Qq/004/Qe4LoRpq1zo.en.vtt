don't even know if they can I don't know
what<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.329> would<00:00:36.420> call<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:40.010> Wow<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.160> just<00:00:41.309> blew

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
what you would call that Wow I just blew

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.330 
what you would call that Wow I just blew
my<00:00:41.730> own<00:00:41.760> line<00:00:41.969> there<00:00:42.800> anyway<00:00:43.800> if<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.040> do<00:00:44.309> a

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
my own line there anyway if you do a

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.639 
my own line there anyway if you do a
little<00:00:44.489> spin<00:00:44.760> move<00:00:44.789> next<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.300> ghost<00:00:45.649> they

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
little spin move next to a ghost they

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.350 
little spin move next to a ghost they
will<00:00:46.980> become<00:00:47.219> transparent<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.879> they<00:00:48.180> won't

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
will become transparent and they won't

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.720 
will become transparent and they won't
hurt<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:49.280> they'll<00:00:50.280> come<00:00:50.430> back<00:00:50.579> pretty

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
hurt you but they'll come back pretty

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.069 
hurt you but they'll come back pretty
quickly<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.300> got<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.510> keep<00:00:51.600> moving<00:00:52.910> this

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
quickly so you got to keep moving this

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.389 
quickly so you got to keep moving this
this<00:00:55.079> level<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.739> me<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> great<00:00:56.309> example

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
this level is to me is a great example

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.490 
this level is to me is a great example
of<00:00:57.440> excellent<00:00:58.440> use<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:59.270> a<00:01:00.270> fixed<00:01:01.170> camera

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
of excellent use of a fixed camera

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.270 
of excellent use of a fixed camera
system<00:01:02.129> almost<00:01:03.199> like<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.470> would<00:01:04.860> say<00:01:05.010> even

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
system almost like I would say even

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.510 
system almost like I would say even
better<00:01:05.519> for<00:01:06.150> platforming<00:01:06.810> well<00:01:07.350> God<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.400> War

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
better for platforming well God of War

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.640 
better for platforming well God of War
isn't<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> platforming<00:01:09.750> game<00:01:10.400> but<00:01:12.650> I've

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
isn't really a platforming game but I've

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.560 
isn't really a platforming game but I've
always<00:01:13.950> loved<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> fixed<00:01:14.670> camera<00:01:14.909> system<00:01:15.390> in

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
always loved the fixed camera system in

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.160 
always loved the fixed camera system in
God<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:15.990> War<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:17.270> this<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.540> would<00:01:18.720> say<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.900> on

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
God of War and this I would say is on

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.810 
God of War and this I would say is on
par<00:01:19.500> or<00:01:20.369> even<00:01:20.759> better<00:01:20.909> than<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:23.400> performance

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
par or even better than the performance

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.609 
par or even better than the performance
that<00:01:23.909> God<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.180> War<00:01:24.299> made<00:01:24.509> or<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> god<00:01:25.590> of

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
war games in the way that you know right

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.070 
war games in the way that you know right
now

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
now

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.580 
now
when<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> camera<00:01:28.740> changes<00:01:29.400> angles<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.590> you

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
when the camera changes angles and you

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.679 
when the camera changes angles and you
still<00:01:31.920> know<00:01:32.250> instinctively<00:01:32.820> what<00:01:33.119> direction

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
still know instinctively what direction

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.660 
still know instinctively what direction
to<00:01:33.990> press<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.770> go<00:01:34.890> forward<00:01:35.369> even<00:01:35.490> though

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
to press to go forward even though

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.280 
to press to go forward even though
you're<00:01:36.150> looking<00:01:36.299> at<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> world<00:01:36.780> completely

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
you're looking at the world completely

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.950 
you're looking at the world completely
upside<00:01:37.710> down<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.390> it's<00:01:39.390> really<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.689> kind<00:01:39.869> of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
upside down and it's really just kind of

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.390 
upside down and it's really just kind of
screwing<00:01:40.259> with<00:01:40.409> your<00:01:40.560> head<00:01:40.619> or<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
screwing with your head or the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.569 
screwing with your head or the
developers<00:01:41.850> were<00:01:42.030> screwing<00:01:42.299> with<00:01:42.420> your<00:01:42.570> head

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
developers were screwing with your head

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.340 
developers were screwing with your head
and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.770 
and
it's<00:01:47.190> just<00:01:47.730> an<00:01:47.790> interesting<00:01:48.210> challenge<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.600> me

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
it's just an interesting challenge to me

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.330 
it's just an interesting challenge to me
anyway<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.680> you're<00:01:49.830> staying<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.130> moon

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
anyway so you're staying on this moon

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.440 
anyway so you're staying on this moon
you<00:01:50.400> got<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.580> get<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.760> five<00:01:50.940> pieces<00:01:51.270> of

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
you got to get the five pieces of

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.510 
you got to get the five pieces of
launched<00:01:51.840> star<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.260> create<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.280> moons

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
launched star to create it the moons

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.210 
launched star to create it the moons
kind<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.940> like<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> teeter-totter<00:01:55.050> if<00:01:55.440> you<00:01:55.560> are

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
kind of like a teeter-totter if you are

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.020 
kind of like a teeter-totter if you are
a<00:01:56.310> seesaw

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
a seesaw

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.950 
a seesaw
I<00:01:57.710> think<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:58.800> oh<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> same<00:01:59.130> thing<00:01:59.720> you<00:02:00.720> stand

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
I think it's oh the same thing you stand

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.510 
I think it's oh the same thing you stand
on<00:02:01.050> one<00:02:01.110> side<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.740> kind<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.890> dips<00:02:02.070> down<00:02:02.280> you

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
on one side and it kind of dips down you

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.820 
on one side and it kind of dips down you
can<00:02:02.670> use<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.119> other<00:02:03.300> side<00:02:03.690> of<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.840> moon<00:02:04.020> to

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
can use the other side of the moon to

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.260 
can use the other side of the moon to
jump<00:02:05.040> over<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> cow<00:02:07.369> anyway<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:09.030> go<00:02:09.209> to

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
jump over it like a cow anyway you go to

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.840 
jump over it like a cow anyway you go to
this<00:02:09.830> final<00:02:10.830> area<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.400> have<00:02:11.490> to<00:02:11.550> pick<00:02:11.670> up<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
this final area you have to pick up the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.300 
this final area you have to pick up the
five<00:02:12.060> silver<00:02:12.540> stars<00:02:12.810> with<00:02:13.620> all<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.950> ghosts

typical ghosts that you've seen a Mario
games<00:02:21.239> for<00:02:21.920> years<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.220> years<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.580> ones<00:02:23.760> that

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
games for years and years the ones that

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.520 
games for years and years the ones that
when<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.300> stare<00:02:24.540> right<00:02:24.570> at<00:02:24.720> them<00:02:24.989> they<00:02:25.170> stop

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
when you stare right at them they stop

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.140 
when you stare right at them they stop
moving<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:26.520> when<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.700> turn<00:02:26.850> your<00:02:26.940> back<00:02:27.000> to

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
moving and when you turn your back to

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.820 
moving and when you turn your back to
them<00:02:27.300> they<00:02:27.480> start<00:02:27.660> chasing<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.080> down<00:02:28.880> and

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
them they start chasing you down and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.160 
them they start chasing you down and
this<00:02:31.830> wall<00:02:32.280> will<00:02:32.640> move<00:02:33.209> up<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.600> down<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.840> couple

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
this wall will move up and down a couple

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.380 
this wall will move up and down a couple
times<00:02:34.290> or<00:02:34.920> it'll<00:02:35.459> continue<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.940> move<00:02:36.030> up<00:02:36.209> and

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
times or it'll continue to move up and

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.600 
times or it'll continue to move up and
down<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.500> trick<00:02:37.709> is<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.370> have<00:02:38.489> to

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
down and the trick is is you have to

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.449 
down and the trick is is you have to
jump<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.390> top<00:02:39.540> quickly<00:02:40.019> enough<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:41.250> pick

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
jump to the top quickly enough to pick

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.000 
jump to the top quickly enough to pick
up<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:42.239> five<00:02:42.750> silver<00:02:43.110> stars<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.620> are<00:02:43.739> on

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
up the five silver stars that are on

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.810 
up the five silver stars that are on
some<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.340> these<00:02:44.430> higher<00:02:44.670> platforms<00:02:45.269> I<00:02:49.700> did<00:02:50.700> not

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
some of these higher platforms I did not

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.990 
some of these higher platforms I did not
do<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.030> good<00:02:51.209> job<00:02:51.269> there<00:02:51.660> but<00:02:52.580> if<00:02:53.580> you're<00:02:53.790> quick

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
do a good job there but if you're quick

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.520 
do a good job there but if you're quick
you<00:02:54.209> can<00:02:54.390> get<00:02:54.600> all<00:02:54.900> three<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.230> them<00:02:55.440> on<00:02:55.500> one

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
you can get all three of them on one

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:29.230 
you can get all three of them on one
shot

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.300
