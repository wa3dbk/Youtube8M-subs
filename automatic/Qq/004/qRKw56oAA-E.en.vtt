00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
you have to play them differently now

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.370 
you have to play them differently now
you<00:00:23.430> take<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> shot<00:00:24.029> like<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.390> now<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.260> was

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
you take a shot like this now that was

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.019 
you take a shot like this now that was
the<00:00:25.410> opening<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:26.250> last<00:00:26.460> thing<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.820> I

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the opening the last thing that I

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.820 
the opening the last thing that I
demonstrated<00:00:27.630> was<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.990> opening<00:00:28.380> break<00:00:28.650> now

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
demonstrated was the opening break now

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.250 
demonstrated was the opening break now
after<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.220> get<00:00:29.369> into<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.960> actually<00:00:30.960> what<00:00:31.109> you

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
after you get into it actually what you

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.740 
after you get into it actually what you
do<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.560> run<00:00:31.710> 14<00:00:32.309> balls<00:00:32.610> off<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.000> table<00:00:33.570> leave

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
do is run 14 balls off the table leave

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.860 
do is run 14 balls off the table leave
one<00:00:33.960> out<00:00:34.110> then<00:00:34.800> they<00:00:35.010> react<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.700> ball<00:00:35.910> then

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
one out then they react the ball then

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.660 
one out then they react the ball then
you<00:00:36.899> try<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.260> make<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> one<00:00:38.010> that's<00:00:38.219> left<00:00:38.430> out

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
you try to make the one that's left out

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.569 
you try to make the one that's left out
and<00:00:38.969> continue<00:00:39.899> your<00:00:40.050> run<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.800> we'll<00:00:40.980> assume

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
and continue your run so we'll assume

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.970 
and continue your run so we'll assume
that<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.270> earned<00:00:42.600> 14<00:00:43.140> balls<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:43.829> is

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
that I have earned 14 balls and this is

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.000 
that I have earned 14 balls and this is
the<00:00:44.070> position<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.610> left<00:00:44.789> myself<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.570> now<00:00:46.410> this

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the position I left myself in now this

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.979 
the position I left myself in now this
is<00:00:47.070> what<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.250> call<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> break<00:00:47.700> shot<00:00:47.910> now<00:00:48.780> here

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
is what we call a break shot now here

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.610 
is what we call a break shot now here
I'm<00:00:49.079> going<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.289> play<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.739> shot<00:00:50.120> with<00:00:51.120> high

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
I'm going to play this shot with high

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.770 
I'm going to play this shot with high
right-hand<00:00:52.620> spin<00:00:53.100> or<00:00:53.340> English<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
right-hand spin or English and the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.049 
right-hand spin or English and the
purpose<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.739> try<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.160> drive<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.820> cue

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
purpose of it is to try to drive the cue

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.110 
purpose of it is to try to drive the cue
ball<00:00:57.360> through<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.289> cluster<00:00:58.800> ball<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.550> keep

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
ball through this cluster ball and keep

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.510 
ball through this cluster ball and keep
them<00:01:00.300> all<00:01:00.449> down<00:01:00.750> at<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.440> end<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.309> course

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
them all down at this end but of course

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.889 
them all down at this end but of course
I<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.789> make<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.660> pocket

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
I have to make this one in this pocket

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.260 
I have to make this one in this pocket
first<00:01:04.350> let's<00:01:04.619> see<00:01:04.769> if<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:08.270> now

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
first let's see if we can do it now

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.179 
first let's see if we can do it now
that's<00:01:09.479> better<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.229> see<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.500> also<00:01:10.799> kept<00:01:11.040> my

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
that's better you see it also kept my

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.700 
that's better you see it also kept my
cue<00:01:11.490> ball<00:01:11.729> down<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.750> position<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.560> I

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
cue ball down in this position so that I

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.399 
cue ball down in this position so that I
have<00:01:13.979> another<00:01:14.280> shot<00:01:14.610> now<00:01:15.540> here<00:01:15.840> I've<00:01:15.990> got<00:01:16.259> to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
have another shot now here I've got to

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.649 
have another shot now here I've got to
be<00:01:16.530> careful<00:01:16.799> because<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.000> balls<00:01:18.270> aren't

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
be careful because the balls aren't

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.870 
be careful because the balls aren't
scattered<00:01:18.990> too<00:01:19.380> well<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.340> it's<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:20.729> I'm

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
scattered too well so it's like I'm

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.340 
scattered too well so it's like I'm
going<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.330> play<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> combination<00:01:22.229> on

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
going to have to play a combination on

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.740 
going to have to play a combination on
that<00:01:22.530> ball<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.100> then<00:01:23.580> try<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> get<00:01:24.180> up<00:01:24.330> above

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
that ball and then try to get up above

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.770 
that ball and then try to get up above
the<00:01:25.200> balls<00:01:25.439> after<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.580> next<00:01:26.790> shot<00:01:27.090> let's<00:01:27.540> see

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
the balls after this next shot let's see

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:46.310 
the balls after this next shot let's see
what<00:01:27.960> happens

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.820 

all<00:01:46.890> right<00:01:47.250> now<00:01:47.550> I<00:01:47.580> have<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.000> try<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.240> figure<00:01:48.830> on

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
all right now I have to try to figure on

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.760 
all right now I have to try to figure on
scattering<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.610> balls<00:01:51.050> get<00:01:52.050> them<00:01:52.200> open<00:01:52.320> up<00:01:52.650> a

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
scattering the balls get them open up a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.310 
scattering the balls get them open up a
little<00:01:52.920> bit<00:01:53.160> more<00:01:53.370> so<00:01:53.730> I<00:01:53.760> could<00:01:54.140> clear<00:01:55.140> them

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
little bit more so I could clear them

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.300 
little bit more so I could clear them
off<00:01:55.440> the<00:01:55.650> table

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
off the table

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.550 
off the table
and<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:57.060> think<00:01:57.150> I<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.660> do<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.930> by<00:01:58.080> making<00:01:58.440> this

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
and I think I can do it by making this

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.010 
and I think I can do it by making this
ball<00:01:58.890> sticking<00:01:59.310> there<00:01:59.640> then<00:01:59.910> playing<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.450> red

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
ball sticking there then playing the red

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.710 
ball sticking there then playing the red
striped<00:02:01.380> ball<00:02:01.620> in<00:02:01.830> this<00:02:02.010> pocket<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.610> then

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
striped ball in this pocket and then

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:16.490 
striped ball in this pocket and then
scattering<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.840> ball

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.850 

that<00:02:17.160> worked<00:02:17.370> out<00:02:17.610> all<00:02:17.790> right<00:02:18.500> now<00:02:19.500> whatever

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
that worked out all right now whatever

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.580 
that worked out all right now whatever
you<00:02:20.070> want<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.310> do<00:02:21.380> clear<00:02:22.380> them<00:02:22.560> off<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.890> table

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:52.940 

you

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.550 

now<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:53.980> break<00:02:54.490> shot<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.720> following<00:02:56.110> fame

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
now I break shot to the following fame

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.560 
now I break shot to the following fame
should<00:02:57.100> be<00:02:57.310> either<00:02:57.550> one<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.820> these<00:02:58.030> two<00:02:58.300> balls

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
should be either one of these two balls

following frame see we did play around
those<00:03:49.569> two<00:03:49.870> balls<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.530> now<00:03:51.250> we<00:03:51.310> have<00:03:51.790> a

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
those two balls and now we have a

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.660 
those two balls and now we have a
similar<00:03:52.209> break<00:03:52.629> shot<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.650> last<00:03:53.890> frame<00:03:54.280> but

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
similar break shot to the last frame but

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.570 
similar break shot to the last frame but
not<00:03:54.849> quite<00:03:55.470> because<00:03:56.470> I<00:03:56.890> am<00:03:57.010> on<00:03:57.160> a<00:03:57.190> different

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
not quite because I am on a different

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.080 
not quite because I am on a different
angle<00:03:58.060> here<00:04:01.739> I'm<00:04:02.739> going<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.280> have<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.700> hit<00:04:03.879> this

angle here I'm going to have to hit this
shot<00:04:04.590> with<00:04:05.590> more<00:04:05.890> force<00:04:06.810> because<00:04:07.810> I'm<00:04:07.989> almost

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
shot with more force because I'm almost

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.990 
shot with more force because I'm almost
straight<00:04:08.709> with<00:04:08.950> it<00:04:09.099> so<00:04:09.250> in<00:04:09.370> other<00:04:09.489> words<00:04:09.760> I

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
straight with it so in other words I

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.570 
straight with it so in other words I
have<00:04:10.180> to<00:04:10.330> force<00:04:10.660> this<00:04:10.900> ball<00:04:11.230> into<00:04:11.920> that<00:04:12.129> pack

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
have to force this ball into that pack

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.170 
have to force this ball into that pack
to<00:04:12.880> create<00:04:13.299> more<00:04:13.630> of<00:04:13.810> more<00:04:14.680> force<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.790> I'm

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
to create more of more force and I'm

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.909 
to create more of more force and I'm
going<00:04:16.419> to<00:04:16.450> have<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:16.720> use<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:16.900> lot<00:04:17.169> more<00:04:17.200> spending

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
going to have to use a lot more spending

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.129 
going to have to use a lot more spending
what<00:04:18.070> I<00:04:18.100> used<00:04:18.370> on<00:04:18.549> that<00:04:18.700> last<00:04:18.970> shot<00:04:19.239> and<00:04:19.870> try<00:04:20.079> to

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
alright but I had to force that ball now

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:48.900 
alright but I had to force that ball now
it's<00:04:29.830> a<00:04:30.130> question<00:04:30.550> of<00:04:30.669> picking<00:04:31.450> law

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.060 

no<00:04:49.540> I<00:04:51.840> should<00:04:52.840> play<00:04:53.110> that<00:04:53.140> one<00:04:53.530> but<00:04:53.680> I<00:04:53.710> can't

see<00:04:56.200> if<00:04:56.260> we<00:04:56.440> can<00:04:56.620> do<00:04:56.800> it

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:26.309 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:28.789 

now<00:05:26.879> I'm<00:05:26.969> going<00:05:27.209> to<00:05:27.299> clear<00:05:27.629> this<00:05:27.659> fiber<00:05:28.199> out<00:05:28.469> of

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:28.799 
now I'm going to clear this fiber out of

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:30.229 
now I'm going to clear this fiber out of

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:32.459 
and get straight on this ball here so I

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:35.179 
and get straight on this ball here so I
can<00:05:32.729> put<00:05:32.759> it<00:05:32.999> in<00:05:33.089> this<00:05:33.179> pocket<00:05:33.509> and<00:05:34.499> then<00:05:34.739> clear

this 14 ball away into that pocket and I

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:41.779 
this 14 ball away into that pocket and I
might<00:05:39.359> possibly<00:05:39.569> use<00:05:40.079> this<00:05:40.289> 2<00:05:40.559> ball<00:05:40.829> for<00:05:41.759> a

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
might possibly use this 2 ball for a

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:44.359 
might possibly use this 2 ball for a
break<00:05:42.239> shot<00:05:42.539> for<00:05:43.019> the<00:05:43.109> following<00:05:43.439> frame<00:05:43.829> let's
