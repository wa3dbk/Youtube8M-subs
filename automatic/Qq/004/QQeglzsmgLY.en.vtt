00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
probably want to sit here for like 10

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.730 
probably want to sit here for like 10
minutes<00:01:40.460> holding<00:01:40.880> it<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:41.390> you<00:01:42.289> need<00:01:42.469> to<00:01:42.560> have<00:01:42.679> a

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
minutes holding it so you need to have a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.879 
minutes holding it so you need to have a
little<00:01:42.920> patience<00:01:44.170> so<00:01:45.170> after<00:01:45.319> about<00:01:45.499> two

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:45.889 
little patience so after about two

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:47.440 
little patience so after about two
minutes<00:01:46.069> of<00:01:46.219> holding<00:01:46.609> it<00:01:46.729> I<00:01:46.759> realized<00:01:47.090> there's

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
minutes of holding it I realized there's

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.840 
minutes of holding it I realized there's
no<00:01:47.719> way<00:01:47.869> i<00:01:47.899> could<00:01:48.079> hold<00:01:48.289> it<00:01:48.469> for<00:01:48.649> 10<00:01:48.859> so<00:01:49.609> what<00:01:49.819> I

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
no way i could hold it for 10 so what I

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.260 
no way i could hold it for 10 so what I
ended<00:01:49.939> up<00:01:50.270> doing<00:01:50.329> is<00:01:50.899> I<00:01:50.929> took<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.380> big<00:01:51.740> brush<00:01:52.270> and

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
ended up doing is I took a big brush and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.880 
ended up doing is I took a big brush and
I<00:01:53.990> just<00:01:54.229> painted

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
I just painted

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.370 
I just painted
it<00:01:54.950> on<00:01:55.100> there<00:01:55.460> it's<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:56.000> nice<00:01:56.150> wide<00:01:56.540> brush<00:01:56.900> and

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
it on there it's a nice wide brush and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.500 
it on there it's a nice wide brush and
I'm<00:01:58.070> painting<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.520> first<00:01:58.820> layer<00:01:59.060> on<00:01:59.300> there

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
I'm painting the first layer on there

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.670 
I'm painting the first layer on there
and<00:01:59.659> we'll<00:01:59.780> see<00:01:59.960> how<00:02:00.080> i<00:02:00.110> feel<00:02:00.200> about<00:02:00.409> the

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
and we'll see how i feel about the

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.649 
and we'll see how i feel about the
second<00:02:02.740> but<00:02:03.740> this<00:02:03.950> prevents<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:05.060> lot<00:02:05.300> of<00:02:05.479> that

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
second but this prevents a lot of that

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.620 
second but this prevents a lot of that
excess<00:02:06.140> paint<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.830> lot<00:02:06.979> of<00:02:07.010> the<00:02:07.220> dripping

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
excess paint and a lot of the dripping

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.820 
coat I can always do a second coat but
we'll<00:02:28.580> wait<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:28.790> see<00:02:29.260> when<00:02:30.260> we<00:02:30.350> get<00:02:30.470> that<00:02:30.620> far

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
first coat and I think it was plenty

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.120 
first coat and I think it was plenty
thick<00:02:35.959> enough<00:02:36.200> considering<00:02:36.769> we're<00:02:36.950> going<00:02:37.070> to

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130

be putting the pearl coat on next and

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.449 
be putting the pearl coat on next and
I've<00:02:40.220> done<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.519> same<00:02:40.730> ratio<00:02:41.300> of<00:02:42.100> three<00:02:43.100> parts

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
I've done the same ratio of three parts

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.509 
I've done the same ratio of three parts
pains<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:44.120> one's<00:02:44.390> heart<00:02:44.750> plays<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:46.130> then<00:02:46.400> I'm
