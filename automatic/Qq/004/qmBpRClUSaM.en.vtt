screen I sure do

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.599 
screen I sure do
there<00:02:42.569> we<00:02:42.659> go<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:45.480> first<00:02:46.379> impressions<00:02:47.099> the

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
there we go so first impressions the

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.240 
there we go so first impressions the
device<00:02:48.090> feels<00:02:48.510> very<00:02:48.959> responsive<00:02:49.680> very<00:02:49.889> fast

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
device feels very responsive very fast

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.539 
device feels very responsive very fast
and<00:02:50.849> certainly<00:02:51.359> benefits<00:02:51.810> from<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.310> 2<00:02:53.310> gigs

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
and certainly benefits from the 2 gigs

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.599 
and certainly benefits from the 2 gigs
of<00:02:53.670> ram<00:02:53.879> and<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.150> octa-core<00:02:54.510> processor<00:02:55.230> a

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
of ram and the octa-core processor a

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.699 
of ram and the octa-core processor a
