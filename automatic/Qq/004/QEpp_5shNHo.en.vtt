00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
grabbing the figure from underneath just

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.310 
grabbing the figure from underneath just
so<00:01:09.740> you<00:01:09.800> have<00:01:09.979> some<00:01:10.220> balance<00:01:10.939> you<00:01:11.869> can<00:01:12.110> go

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
so you have some balance you can go

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.670

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
can see as you rotate the figure

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.990 
can see as you rotate the figure
side-to-side<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.960> arms<00:01:21.350> will<00:01:21.729> stretch<00:01:22.729> out

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
side-to-side the arms will stretch out

transformation<00:02:24.290> in<00:02:24.500> nine<00:02:24.859> steps<00:02:25.280> well<00:02:26.239> that

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
transformation in nine steps well that

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.530 
transformation in nine steps well that
may<00:02:26.569> be<00:02:26.599> true<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.769> in<00:02:28.189> fact<00:02:28.370> I'm<00:02:28.489> gonna<00:02:28.670> bring

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
may be true and in fact I'm gonna bring

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.780 
may be true and in fact I'm gonna bring
it<00:02:29.689> in<00:02:29.810> right<00:02:30.079> now<00:02:32.469> but<00:02:33.469> the<00:02:34.040> transformation

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
it in right now but the transformation

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.089 
it in right now but the transformation
is<00:02:34.969> actually<00:02:35.689> a<00:02:35.989> bit<00:02:36.170> more<00:02:36.200> than<00:02:36.590> nine<00:02:36.709> steps

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
is actually a bit more than nine steps

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.940 
is actually a bit more than nine steps
these<00:02:37.790> instructions<00:02:38.540> which<00:02:38.989> I'm<00:02:39.200> bringing

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
these instructions which I'm bringing

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.800 
these instructions which I'm bringing
here<00:02:40.129> because<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.340> want<00:02:40.519> to<00:02:40.609> show<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.120> leaving

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
here because I want to show you leaving

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.679 
here because I want to show you leaving
out<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:41.959> few<00:02:42.260> things<00:02:42.939> before<00:02:43.939> we<00:02:43.969> continue<00:02:44.209> I<00:02:44.540> do

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
out a few things before we continue I do

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.119 
out a few things before we continue I do
want<00:02:45.019> to<00:02:45.049> mention<00:02:45.230> that<00:02:45.590> from<00:02:45.829> the<00:02:45.950> weights

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
want to mention that from the weights

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.979 
want to mention that from the weights
down<00:02:46.430> there<00:02:46.849> is<00:02:47.000> some<00:02:47.450> really<00:02:47.719> nice

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
down there is some really nice

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.610 
down there is some really nice
articulation<00:02:48.469> with<00:02:49.189> drift<00:02:49.659> nice<00:02:50.659> ball

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
articulation with drift nice ball

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.099 
articulation with drift nice ball
jointed<00:02:52.040> hips<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.639> you<00:02:53.209> get<00:02:53.359> as<00:02:53.480> good<00:02:53.510> saw

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
jointed hips and you get as good saw

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.890 
jointed hips and you get as good saw
with<00:02:54.379> almost<00:02:54.829> a<00:02:55.099> little<00:02:55.609> bit<00:02:55.939> past<00:02:56.209> nine<00:02:56.540> Leary

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
with almost a little bit past nine Leary

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.530 
with almost a little bit past nine Leary
bend<00:02:57.260> at<00:02:57.889> the<00:02:57.950> knees<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.639> due<00:02:59.299> to<00:02:59.329> the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
bend at the knees and due to the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.349 
bend at the knees and due to the
transformation<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.409> feet<00:03:00.620> can<00:03:00.919> swivel<00:03:01.359> so

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
transformation the feet can swivel so

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.699 
transformation the feet can swivel so
get<00:03:02.959> some<00:03:03.200> fun<00:03:03.409> posing<00:03:03.889> out<00:03:04.040> of<00:03:04.219> it<00:03:04.340> um<00:03:05.530> so<00:03:06.530> yeah

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
get some fun posing out of it um so yeah

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.429 
get some fun posing out of it um so yeah
you<00:03:07.400> know<00:03:07.430> let's<00:03:08.000> just<00:03:08.180> pause<00:03:08.419> here<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.169> we'll

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
you know let's just pause here and we'll

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:14.920 
you know let's just pause here and we'll
get<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.669> the<00:03:10.760> transformation<00:03:13.239> okay<00:03:14.269> just

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
get to the transformation okay just

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.530 
get to the transformation okay just
needed<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.290> clear<00:03:15.950> my<00:03:15.980> throw<00:03:16.430> it<00:03:16.519> a<00:03:16.609> little<00:03:16.639> but

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
needed to clear my throw it a little but

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.929 
needed to clear my throw it a little but
yeah<00:03:18.379> let's<00:03:18.739> get<00:03:18.950> into<00:03:19.159> the<00:03:19.250> transformation

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:19.939 
yeah let's get into the transformation

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.119 
yeah let's get into the transformation
so<00:03:20.689> we're<00:03:20.840> going<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.019> start<00:03:21.230> off<00:03:21.439> you

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
so we're going to start off you

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.439 
so we're going to start off you
basically<00:03:22.430> want<00:03:22.639> to<00:03:22.699> make<00:03:22.790> sure<00:03:22.819> the<00:03:23.060> legs<00:03:23.269> are

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:23.449 
basically want to make sure the legs are

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.379 
basically want to make sure the legs are
straight<00:03:23.720> it's<00:03:24.229> all<00:03:24.379> neutral<00:03:24.769> poses<00:03:25.280> step<00:03:26.090> one

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
straight it's all neutral poses step one

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.539 
straight it's all neutral poses step one
is<00:03:26.599> flipping<00:03:27.229> up<00:03:27.379> the<00:03:27.769> shoulder<00:03:28.099> pads<00:03:28.310> and

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
is flipping up the shoulder pads and

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.819 
is flipping up the shoulder pads and
this<00:03:29.120> is<00:03:29.299> where<00:03:29.540> there's<00:03:29.900> already<00:03:30.079> a<00:03:30.379> mistake

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
this is where there's already a mistake

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.979 
this is where there's already a mistake
with<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.129> instructions<00:03:31.699> because<00:03:32.389> they<00:03:32.690> show

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
with the instructions because they show

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.369 
with the instructions because they show
the<00:03:33.290> turquoise<00:03:33.979> bits<00:03:34.519> facing<00:03:35.510> outward<00:03:35.959> as<00:03:36.139> if

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
the turquoise bits facing outward as if

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.439 
the turquoise bits facing outward as if
you<00:03:36.530> rotate<00:03:37.159> them<00:03:37.370> up<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:37.729> then<00:03:38.269> they're

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:38.449 
you rotate them up and then they're

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.449 
you rotate them up and then they're
supposed<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.780> swivel<00:03:39.169> on<00:03:39.260> a<00:03:39.290> hinge<00:03:39.650> that<00:03:39.919> is

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
supposed to swivel on a hinge that is

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.580 
supposed to swivel on a hinge that is
actually<00:03:40.879> corrected<00:03:41.359> in<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.599> pictures<00:03:42.349> of

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
actually corrected in the pictures of

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.789 
actually corrected in the pictures of
the<00:03:42.680> other<00:03:42.829> instructions<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:45.260> next<00:03:45.590> step

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
the other instructions the next step

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.420 
the other instructions the next step
which<00:03:46.579> really<00:03:46.970> isn't<00:03:47.239> shown<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:48.079> you<00:03:49.040> need<00:03:49.280> to

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
which really isn't shown is you need to

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.960 
which really isn't shown is you need to
take<00:03:49.930> this<00:03:50.930> rear<00:03:51.349> section<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.189> then<00:03:52.579> flip<00:03:52.939> it

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
take this rear section and then flip it

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.050 
take this rear section and then flip it
up<00:03:53.239> into<00:03:53.530> place<00:03:54.530> this<00:03:55.009> will<00:03:55.220> be<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.459> rear<00:03:55.639> fin

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
up into place this will be the rear fin

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.140 
up into place this will be the rear fin
of<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:56.659> car<00:03:56.900> you<00:03:57.829> then<00:03:58.099> want<00:03:58.489> to<00:03:58.639> go<00:03:58.759> ahead<00:03:58.939> and

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
of the car you then want to go ahead and

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.259 
of the car you then want to go ahead and
extend<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.709> what<00:04:01.519> will<00:04:01.669> be<00:04:01.819> the<00:04:01.970> hood

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
extend the what will be the hood

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.550 
extend the what will be the hood
windshield<00:04:03.019> in<00:04:03.259> front<00:04:03.530> of<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.680> car<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:05.060> roof

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
windshield in front of the car and roof

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.789 
windshield in front of the car and roof
if<00:04:06.560> you<00:04:06.949> haven't<00:04:07.250> already<00:04:07.310> have<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.180> extended

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
if you haven't already have it extended

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.819 
if you haven't already have it extended
you<00:04:09.799> know<00:04:09.919> you<00:04:10.549> can<00:04:10.699> go<00:04:10.819> ahead<00:04:10.939> and<00:04:11.150> do<00:04:11.269> that

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
you know you can go ahead and do that

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.149 
you know you can go ahead and do that
the<00:04:12.829> next<00:04:13.009> step<00:04:13.400> is<00:04:14.229> flipping<00:04:15.229> the<00:04:15.349> feet<00:04:15.560> down

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:16.159 
the next step is flipping the feet down

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:21.249 
the next step is flipping the feet down
just<00:04:17.090> like<00:04:17.239> so<00:04:18.459> finally<00:04:19.459> now<00:04:20.269> this<00:04:20.870> is<00:04:21.019> where<00:04:21.229> I

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:21.259 
just like so finally now this is where I

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.879 
just like so finally now this is where I
have<00:04:21.769> a<00:04:21.829> little<00:04:22.039> bit<00:04:22.310> of<00:04:22.400> an<00:04:22.490> issue<00:04:23.889> they

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
have a little bit of an issue they

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.690 
have a little bit of an issue they
they'll<00:04:25.520> not<00:04:25.759> show<00:04:26.030> you<00:04:26.349> doing<00:04:27.349> one<00:04:27.680> leg<00:04:27.950> even

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
they'll not show you doing one leg even

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.940 
they'll not show you doing one leg even
though<00:04:28.789> you<00:04:28.849> have<00:04:29.150> to<00:04:29.330> do<00:04:29.479> this<00:04:29.659> with<00:04:29.870> both<00:04:30.200> so

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
though you have to do this with both so

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.110 
though you have to do this with both so
technically<00:04:31.460> that's

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
technically that's

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.850 
technically that's
actually<00:04:32.360> double<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.780> steps<00:04:33.169> but<00:04:33.680> you're

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
actually double the steps but you're

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.610 
actually double the steps but you're
unpacking<00:04:34.639> the<00:04:34.760> leg<00:04:35.000> from<00:04:35.870> its<00:04:36.020> side<00:04:36.290> here

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
unpacking the leg from its side here

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.640 
unpacking the leg from its side here
rotate<00:04:37.220> it<00:04:37.490> all<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.669> way<00:04:38.060> down<00:04:38.500> making<00:04:39.500> sure

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
rotate it all the way down making sure

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.680 
rotate it all the way down making sure
this<00:04:39.830> front<00:04:40.160> part<00:04:40.460> is<00:04:40.580> straight<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:41.060> then

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
this front part is straight and then

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.020 
this front part is straight and then
bending<00:04:42.650> had<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.830> hinge<00:04:43.190> you're<00:04:43.729> going<00:04:43.940> to

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
bending had a hinge you're going to

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.050 
bending had a hinge you're going to
bring<00:04:44.449> this<00:04:44.630> up<00:04:46.240> there's<00:04:47.240> a<00:04:47.979> slot<00:04:49.000> right<00:04:50.000> here

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
bring this up there's a slot right here

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.080 
bring this up there's a slot right here
and<00:04:50.630> the<00:04:50.830> inside<00:04:51.830> of<00:04:51.979> the<00:04:52.070> leg<00:04:52.250> that<00:04:52.490> will<00:04:52.790> tab

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
and the inside of the leg that will tab

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.290 
and the inside of the leg that will tab
into<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.990> back<00:04:54.229> and<00:04:54.610> that<00:04:55.610> will<00:04:55.669> secure<00:04:56.150> the

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
into the back and that will secure the

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.960 
into the back and that will secure the
leg<00:04:56.510> into<00:04:57.199> place<00:04:57.440> when<00:04:58.220> I<00:04:58.250> go<00:04:58.460> ahead

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
leg into place when I go ahead

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.110 
leg into place when I go ahead
oh<00:04:59.000> and<00:04:59.840> forgot<00:05:00.410> to<00:05:00.560> mention<00:05:00.710> right<00:05:01.699> there<00:05:01.970> is

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
oh and forgot to mention right there is

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.680 
oh and forgot to mention right there is

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
the mysterious metal pin which I didn't

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.350 
the mysterious metal pin which I didn't
believe<00:05:05.900> reviewer<00:05:06.650> Pia<00:05:07.060> discovered<00:05:08.060> has

believe reviewer Pia discovered has

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.629 
believe reviewer Pia discovered has
something<00:05:08.720> to<00:05:08.750> do<00:05:08.990> with<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:09.830> Transformers

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
something to do with the Transformers

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.090 
something to do with the Transformers
mobile<00:05:11.180> app<00:05:11.360> I've<00:05:11.840> also<00:05:12.169> been<00:05:12.500> told<00:05:12.710> that<00:05:12.889> it

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
mobile app I've also been told that it

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.240 
mobile app I've also been told that it
has<00:05:13.130> something<00:05:13.550> to<00:05:13.580> do<00:05:13.820> with<00:05:13.850> a<00:05:14.660> forthcoming

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.840 
has something to do with a forthcoming
Grimlock<00:05:16.250> figure<00:05:17.740> anyway<00:05:18.740> so<00:05:18.800> now<00:05:19.490> you<00:05:19.550> have

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
Grimlock figure anyway so now you have

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.930 
Grimlock figure anyway so now you have
these<00:05:20.000> secured<00:05:20.690> in<00:05:20.949> you<00:05:21.949> want<00:05:22.160> to<00:05:22.250> fold<00:05:22.729> these

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
these secured in you want to fold these

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.340 
these secured in you want to fold these
rear<00:05:23.780> panels<00:05:24.740> down<00:05:24.949> and<00:05:25.630> basically<00:05:26.630> interlock

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
rear panels down and basically interlock

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.930 
rear panels down and basically interlock
them<00:05:27.560> together<00:05:28.870> everything<00:05:29.870> is<00:05:29.900> closed<00:05:30.350> up

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
them together everything is closed up

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.240 
them together everything is closed up
next<00:05:31.940> it<00:05:32.120> shows<00:05:32.389> you<00:05:32.630> folding<00:05:33.440> the<00:05:33.560> hood<00:05:33.800> down

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
next it shows you folding the hood down

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.430 
next it shows you folding the hood down
it<00:05:34.699> really<00:05:34.940> doesn't<00:05:35.210> clearly<00:05:35.660> show<00:05:36.020> that<00:05:36.289> this

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
it really doesn't clearly show that this

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.620 
it really doesn't clearly show that this
is<00:05:36.620> on<00:05:36.770> a<00:05:36.800> double<00:05:37.220> hinge<00:05:37.460> and<00:05:37.729> needs<00:05:38.150> to<00:05:38.360> fold

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
is on a double hinge and needs to fold

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.260 
is on a double hinge and needs to fold
out<00:05:38.840> and<00:05:39.050> then<00:05:39.889> basically<00:05:40.430> you<00:05:40.820> just<00:05:40.849> go<00:05:41.030> ahead

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
out and then basically you just go ahead

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.320 
out and then basically you just go ahead
bring<00:05:42.260> that<00:05:42.440> down<00:05:42.710> and<00:05:43.010> it<00:05:43.729> will<00:05:43.820> snap<00:05:43.970> into

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
bring that down and it will snap into

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.420 
bring that down and it will snap into
place

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
place

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.370 
place
give<00:05:46.450> the<00:05:47.450> sides<00:05:47.720> of<00:05:47.900> the<00:05:47.990> car<00:05:48.169> a<00:05:48.200> little

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
give the sides of the car a little

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.150 
give the sides of the car a little
squeeze

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
squeeze

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.960 
squeeze
so<00:05:49.310> everything<00:05:49.729> pegs<00:05:50.030> in<00:05:50.240> properly<00:05:51.970> possibly

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
so everything pegs in properly possibly

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.909 
so everything pegs in properly possibly
I<00:05:53.000> am<00:05:53.240> missing<00:05:53.690> something<00:05:53.960> I'm<00:05:54.229> not<00:05:54.349> sure<00:05:54.410> and

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
I am missing something I'm not sure and

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.490 
I am missing something I'm not sure and
you<00:05:54.950> have<00:05:55.880> drift<00:05:56.180> in<00:05:56.330> his<00:05:56.479> sports<00:05:56.720> car<00:05:57.050> felt<00:05:57.320> a

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
you have drift in his sports car felt a

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.870 
you have drift in his sports car felt a
very<00:05:57.770> nice<00:05:58.099> Bugatti<00:05:58.610> and<00:06:00.039> it<00:06:01.039> works<00:06:01.280> and<00:06:01.789> we

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
very nice Bugatti and it works and we

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.020 
very nice Bugatti and it works and we
get<00:06:02.030> the<00:06:02.150> instructions<00:06:02.630> out<00:06:02.780> of<00:06:02.870> the<00:06:02.990> way<00:06:04.030> so

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
get the instructions out of the way so

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.089 
get the instructions out of the way so
that<00:06:05.360> was<00:06:05.840> technically<00:06:06.260> a<00:06:06.410> bit<00:06:06.620> more<00:06:06.889> than

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
that was technically a bit more than

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:10.450 
that was technically a bit more than
nine<00:06:08.000> steps<00:06:08.449> but<00:06:08.930> it<00:06:09.470> is<00:06:09.620> much<00:06:09.889> simpler<00:06:10.310> than

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
nine steps but it is much simpler than

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.580 
nine steps but it is much simpler than
the<00:06:10.789> average<00:06:11.120> to<00:06:11.300> luck<00:06:11.510> but<00:06:12.020> not<00:06:12.169> by<00:06:12.349> much

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
the average to luck but not by much

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.420 
the average to luck but not by much
which<00:06:12.979> i<00:06:13.130> think<00:06:13.190> is<00:06:13.490> great<00:06:13.870> so<00:06:14.870> yeah<00:06:15.310> one<00:06:16.310> of<00:06:16.340> my

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
which i think is great so yeah one of my

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.300 
which i think is great so yeah one of my
final<00:06:16.880> thoughts<00:06:17.120> in<00:06:17.300> this<00:06:17.389> figure<00:06:17.630> I<00:06:18.310> think

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
final thoughts in this figure I think

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.180 
final thoughts in this figure I think
out<00:06:20.000> of<00:06:20.599> the<00:06:20.720> power<00:06:20.930> battlers<00:06:21.560> release<00:06:21.889> thus

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
out of the power battlers release thus

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.890 
out of the power battlers release thus
far<00:06:22.550> hound<00:06:23.389> is<00:06:23.599> still<00:06:23.840> the<00:06:23.990> best<00:06:24.880> I<00:06:25.880> hate<00:06:26.750> to

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
far hound is still the best I hate to

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.960 
far hound is still the best I hate to
say<00:06:27.110> it<00:06:27.169> but<00:06:27.410> you<00:06:27.500> can<00:06:27.650> kind<00:06:27.919> of<00:06:28.039> skip<00:06:28.280> drift<00:06:28.699> I

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
say it but you can kind of skip drift I

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.920 
say it but you can kind of skip drift I
can<00:06:29.630> see<00:06:29.870> his<00:06:30.110> sword<00:06:30.440> slashing<00:06:31.010> gimmick

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
can see his sword slashing gimmick

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.560 
can see his sword slashing gimmick
basically<00:06:32.930> breaking<00:06:33.349> down<00:06:33.530> over<00:06:33.979> time<00:06:34.220> and<00:06:35.060> I

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:35.570 
basically breaking down over time and I

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.980 
basically breaking down over time and I
don't<00:06:35.690> feel<00:06:36.789> secure<00:06:37.789> in<00:06:38.030> recommending<00:06:38.810> it<00:06:38.900> is

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
don't feel secure in recommending it is

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.830 
don't feel secure in recommending it is
for<00:06:39.650> kids<00:06:39.860> because<00:06:40.250> they<00:06:40.550> you<00:06:41.210> know<00:06:41.330> of<00:06:41.599> the

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
for kids because they you know of the

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.340 
for kids because they you know of the
rough<00:06:42.050> play<00:06:42.789> now<00:06:43.789> with<00:06:44.030> that<00:06:44.120> said<00:06:44.510> I<00:06:44.840> think

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
rough play now with that said I think

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.310 
rough play now with that said I think
out<00:06:45.470> of<00:06:46.070> all<00:06:46.280> the<00:06:46.520> simplified<00:06:47.320> transformers

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.320 
out of all the simplified transformers

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.190 
out of all the simplified transformers
released<00:06:48.680> thus<00:06:49.160> far<00:06:49.490> I<00:06:49.820> think<00:06:50.450> the<00:06:50.900> power

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.200 
released thus far I think the power
