standard type that would take say liquid

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.500 
standard type that would take say liquid
fuel<00:03:38.770> and<00:03:38.800> make<00:03:39.100> it<00:03:39.220> into<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.459> vapor<00:03:39.700> it<00:03:39.910> kind<00:03:40.390> of

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
fuel and make it into a vapor it kind of

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.850 
fuel and make it into a vapor it kind of
comes<00:03:41.140> to<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.590> motor<00:03:41.890> is<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.220> vapor<00:03:42.640> already<00:03:43.150> so

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
comes to the motor is a vapor already so

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.600 
comes to the motor is a vapor already so
basically<00:03:44.860> you<00:03:44.980> just<00:03:45.010> hook<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.250> up<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.520> the

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
basically you just hook it up to the

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.930 
basically you just hook it up to the
intake<00:03:45.820> manifold<00:03:46.390> and<00:03:46.660> use<00:03:46.959> any<00:03:47.350> kind<00:03:47.620> of

wood-fired<00:04:27.080> car<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:27.590> know<00:04:27.740> it<00:04:28.280> does<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:28.460> lot

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
wood-fired car you know it does a lot

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.450 
wood-fired car you know it does a lot
better<00:04:28.820> downhill<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:29.830> bet<00:04:30.830> you<00:04:30.950> we<00:04:31.040> go<00:04:31.160> down<00:04:31.340> the

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
better downhill I bet you we go down the

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.790 
better downhill I bet you we go down the
hill<00:04:31.840> we<00:04:32.840> can<00:04:32.930> get<00:04:33.080> this<00:04:33.230> thing<00:04:33.410> right<00:04:33.560> up<00:04:33.680> to

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
hill we can get this thing right up to

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.340 
hill we can get this thing right up to
55<00:04:34.280> miles<00:04:34.580> an<00:04:34.730> hour<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.390> fuel<00:04:35.660> gauge<00:04:35.900> doesn't

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
55 miles an hour the fuel gauge doesn't

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.050 
55 miles an hour the fuel gauge doesn't
work<00:04:36.650> because<00:04:37.070> if<00:04:37.250> it<00:04:37.430> if<00:04:37.610> it<00:04:37.790> was<00:04:37.910> in<00:04:38.030> the

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
work because if it if it was in the

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.790 
work because if it if it was in the
woodchips<00:04:38.450> it's<00:04:38.690> a<00:04:38.900> we're<00:04:39.170> probably<00:04:39.500> pretty

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
woodchips it's a we're probably pretty

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.430 
woodchips it's a we're probably pretty
full<00:04:40.040> on<00:04:40.220> which<00:04:40.400> it<00:04:40.610> thick<00:04:40.850> and<00:04:41.350> all<00:04:42.350> the

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
full on which it thick and all the

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.860 
full on which it thick and all the
pressure<00:04:42.680> light<00:04:43.330> that's<00:04:44.330> usually<00:04:44.660> a<00:04:44.720> lot

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
pressure light that's usually a lot

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.720 
pressure light that's usually a lot
higher<00:04:45.110> so<00:04:45.350> that's<00:04:45.530> not<00:04:45.680> a<00:04:45.710> good<00:04:45.890> sign<00:04:46.130> there<00:04:46.400> I

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
higher so that's not a good sign there I

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.680 
higher so that's not a good sign there I
remember<00:04:47.690> reading<00:04:47.870> about<00:04:48.250> this<00:04:49.250> woodchip<00:04:49.880> car

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
remember reading about this woodchip car

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.510 
remember reading about this woodchip car
when<00:04:50.900> I<00:04:50.960> was<00:04:51.110> younger<00:04:51.380> out<00:04:52.130> of<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.310> mother

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
when I was younger out of the mother

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.240 
when I was younger out of the mother
earth<00:04:52.610> news<00:04:53.210> magazine<00:04:53.900> and<00:04:54.170> I<00:04:54.590> said<00:04:55.100> you<00:04:55.190> know

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
earth news magazine and I said you know

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.900 
earth news magazine and I said you know
someday<00:04:55.640> if<00:04:55.760> I<00:04:55.880> ever<00:04:56.000> moved<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:57.070> Nebraska<00:04:58.070> I

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
someday if I ever moved to Nebraska I

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.810 
someday if I ever moved to Nebraska I
think<00:04:59.480> that<00:04:59.600> might<00:04:59.780> have<00:04:59.870> been<00:04:59.930> it<00:05:00.080> folks<00:05:00.820> here

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
think that might have been it folks here

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.550 
think that might have been it folks here
we<00:05:01.940> are<00:05:01.970> we<00:05:02.660> logged<00:05:03.590> a<00:05:03.800> couple<00:05:04.190> 5-8<00:05:04.730> miles<00:05:05.560> she

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
we are we logged a couple 5-8 miles she

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.790 
we are we logged a couple 5-8 miles she
shut<00:05:07.280> down<00:05:07.990> could<00:05:08.990> be<00:05:09.110> something<00:05:09.410> simple

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
shut down could be something simple

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.890 
shut down could be something simple
it<00:05:10.340> might<00:05:10.490> be<00:05:10.640> something<00:05:11.000> major<00:05:11.150> I'm<00:05:11.450> guessing

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
it might be something major I'm guessing

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.470 
it might be something major I'm guessing
so<00:05:12.140> we're<00:05:12.530> gonna<00:05:12.620> check<00:05:12.860> that<00:05:13.040> out<00:05:13.250> next<00:05:13.480> chip

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
so we're gonna check that out next chip

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.930 
so we're gonna check that out next chip
gets<00:05:14.840> out<00:05:15.080> of<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.350> truck<00:05:15.380> and<00:05:15.800> turns<00:05:16.310> off<00:05:16.640> the

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
gets out of the truck and turns off the

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.600 
gets out of the truck and turns off the
flaming<00:05:17.480> fuel<00:05:17.780> tank<00:05:18.110> it<00:05:18.710> really<00:05:19.250> flames

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
flaming fuel tank it really flames

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
flaming fuel tank it really flames
doesn't<00:05:20.270> it

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
doesn't it

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.020 
doesn't it
then<00:05:21.320> he<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:21.770> Larry<00:05:21.980> tried<00:05:22.430> to<00:05:22.550> figure<00:05:22.880> out

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
then he and Larry tried to figure out

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.150 
then he and Larry tried to figure out
the<00:05:23.150> problem<00:05:23.420> with<00:05:23.660> the<00:05:23.780> engine<00:05:24.260> turns<00:05:24.920> out

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
the problem with the engine turns out

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.430 
the problem with the engine turns out
it's<00:05:25.370> just<00:05:25.430> a<00:05:25.760> clogged<00:05:26.060> filter<00:05:26.300> but<00:05:27.110> can<00:05:27.290> you

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
it's just a clogged filter but can you

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.650 
it's just a clogged filter but can you
blame<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:27.919> filter<00:05:28.310> and<00:05:28.760> within<00:05:28.940> 10<00:05:29.360> minutes

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
blame the filter and within 10 minutes

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.870 
blame the filter and within 10 minutes
they're<00:05:29.960> back<00:05:30.290> on<00:05:30.470> the<00:05:30.590> road<00:05:30.800> again<00:05:30.830> so<00:05:31.669> I<00:05:31.700> had

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
they're back on the road again so I had

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.900 
they're back on the road again so I had
this<00:05:32.000> idea<00:05:32.210> about<00:05:33.160> how<00:05:34.160> making<00:05:34.400> it<00:05:34.580> more<00:05:34.700> try

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
this idea about how making it more try

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.070 
this idea about how making it more try
to<00:05:34.970> make<00:05:35.150> it<00:05:35.240> more<00:05:35.300> efficient<00:05:35.720> cuz<00:05:35.900> I'm<00:05:35.990> gonna

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
to make it more efficient cuz I'm gonna

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.290 
to make it more efficient cuz I'm gonna
put<00:05:36.290> this<00:05:36.410> big<00:05:36.650> funnel<00:05:36.950> on<00:05:37.190> the<00:05:37.310> roof<00:05:37.490> and<00:05:38.060> as

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
put this big funnel on the roof and as

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.420 
put this big funnel on the roof and as
I'm<00:05:38.480> driving<00:05:38.720> it<00:05:39.020> funnels<00:05:39.410> the<00:05:39.530> bugs<00:05:39.740> in<00:05:39.980> and

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
I'm driving it funnels the bugs in and

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.070 
I'm driving it funnels the bugs in and
then<00:05:40.580> we<00:05:40.669> burn<00:05:40.850> them<00:05:41.000> in<00:05:41.090> the<00:05:41.180> back<00:05:41.330> you<00:05:41.930> get

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
then we burn them in the back you get

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.260 
then we burn them in the back you get
better<00:05:42.470> gas<00:05:42.830> mileage<00:05:42.890> or<00:05:43.550> woodchip<00:05:44.060> miles

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
better gas mileage or woodchip miles

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.780 
better gas mileage or woodchip miles
when<00:05:44.450> you<00:05:44.540> mix<00:05:44.690> the<00:05:44.810> bugs<00:05:45.050> with<00:05:45.260> but<00:05:45.760> but<00:05:46.760> I

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
when you mix the bugs with but but I

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.190 
when you mix the bugs with but but I
don't<00:05:47.030> know<00:05:47.090> how<00:05:47.210> Peter<00:05:47.480> would<00:05:47.660> look<00:05:47.810> at<00:05:47.990> that

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
don't know how Peter would look at that

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.900 
don't know how Peter would look at that
but<00:05:48.500> that's<00:05:49.070> what<00:05:49.220> I<00:05:49.250> was<00:05:49.370> thinking<00:05:49.700> we<00:05:49.790> could

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
but that's what I was thinking we could

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.400 
but that's what I was thinking we could
try<00:05:50.120> that<00:05:50.150> we're<00:05:50.510> gonna<00:05:50.600> try<00:05:50.900> that<00:05:51.080> next<00:05:51.260> time

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
try that we're gonna try that next time

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.670 
try that we're gonna try that next time

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
the big bug funnel on buggy nights will

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.680 
the big bug funnel on buggy nights will
just<00:05:54.950> get<00:05:55.220> some<00:05:55.430> better<00:05:55.640> power<00:05:55.940> I<00:05:56.120> think<00:05:56.270> that

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
just get some better power I think that

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.420 
just get some better power I think that
way<00:05:56.840> that's<00:05:57.800> right

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
way that's right

and<00:06:09.080> if<00:06:09.500> he<00:06:09.590> did<00:06:09.830> all<00:06:10.040> this<00:06:10.280> to<00:06:10.340> save<00:06:10.820> money<00:06:11.090> on

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
and if he did all this to save money on

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.520 
and if he did all this to save money on
gas<00:06:11.440> think<00:06:12.440> again<00:06:12.770> we<00:06:13.280> went<00:06:13.520> through<00:06:13.910> probably

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
gas think again we went through probably

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.750 
gas think again we went through probably
a<00:06:15.530> barrel<00:06:15.980> of<00:06:16.070> woodchips<00:06:16.300> so<00:06:17.980> or<00:06:18.980> 3/4<00:06:19.550> of<00:06:19.580> a

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
a barrel of woodchips so or 3/4 of a

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.460 
a barrel of woodchips so or 3/4 of a
barrel<00:06:20.030> I<00:06:20.120> would<00:06:20.300> say<00:06:20.510> this<00:06:20.840> is<00:06:20.930> about<00:06:21.200> right

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
barrel I would say this is about right

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.130 
barrel I would say this is about right
yeah<00:06:22.070> I<00:06:22.370> would<00:06:22.640> say<00:06:22.670> 60<00:06:23.150> 70<00:06:23.570> pounds<00:06:23.870> of<00:06:23.930> chips

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
yeah I would say 60 70 pounds of chips

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.670 
yeah I would say 60 70 pounds of chips
probably<00:06:24.970> so<00:06:25.970> you<00:06:26.690> get<00:06:26.810> about<00:06:26.960> a<00:06:27.020> mile<00:06:27.290> a<00:06:27.320> pound

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
probably so you get about a mile a pound

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.740 
probably so you get about a mile a pound
sort<00:06:28.100> of<00:06:28.190> maybe<00:06:28.370> more<00:06:28.790> or<00:06:28.850> less<00:06:29.000> plus<00:06:29.270> or<00:06:29.390> minus

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
sort of maybe more or less plus or minus

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.520 
sort of maybe more or less plus or minus
give<00:06:30.320> or<00:06:30.440> take

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
give or take

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.860 
give or take
carry<00:06:33.530> on<00:06:33.830> chip<00:06:34.190> Meister<00:06:34.700> may<00:06:35.210> the<00:06:35.390> would<00:06:35.600> be

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
carry on chip Meister may the would be

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.200 
carry on chip Meister may the would be
with<00:06:36.110> you
