00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
hey this is Daniel from Adorama I'm here

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.130 
hey this is Daniel from Adorama I'm here
in<00:00:08.790> my<00:00:08.880> studio<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.300> New<00:00:09.390> York<00:00:09.540> City<00:00:09.780> with<00:00:09.990> the

in my studio in New York City with the

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.050 
in my studio in New York City with the
Profoto<00:00:10.410> b1<00:00:10.710> so<00:00:11.460> today<00:00:11.640> we're<00:00:11.760> going<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:11.970> talk

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:12.060 
Profoto b1 so today we're going to talk

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.210 
Profoto b1 so today we're going to talk
a<00:00:12.090> little<00:00:12.180> bit<00:00:12.360> about<00:00:12.390> TTL<00:00:12.990> find<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.770> TTL<00:00:14.130> is

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.220 
a little bit about TTL find the TTL is

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.260 
a little bit about TTL find the TTL is
one<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.430> those<00:00:14.550> things<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.880> lot<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.090> people

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:15.270 
one of those things that a lot of people

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.939 
one of those things that a lot of people
use<00:00:15.510> but<00:00:15.690> maybe<00:00:15.840> don't<00:00:16.019> fully<00:00:16.350> understand<00:00:16.800> how

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
use but maybe don't fully understand how

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.109 
use but maybe don't fully understand how
to<00:00:17.070> operate<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.519> we're<00:00:17.640> gonna<00:00:17.730> talk<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.970> little

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
to operate so we're gonna talk a little

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.460 
to operate so we're gonna talk a little
bit<00:00:18.269> about<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.810> then<00:00:19.140> I'm<00:00:19.230> gonna<00:00:19.349> make

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
bit about that and then I'm gonna make

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.279 
bit about that and then I'm gonna make
some<00:00:19.619> photos<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.759> this<00:00:21.089> Pro<00:00:21.240> photo<00:00:21.449> uses<00:00:21.960> pro

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
some photos so this Pro photo uses pro

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.349 
some photos so this Pro photo uses pro
photos<00:00:22.589> own<00:00:22.740> TTL<00:00:23.189> system<00:00:23.579> with<00:00:23.789> an<00:00:23.909> air<00:00:24.060> remote

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
photos own TTL system with an air remote

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.849 
photos own TTL system with an air remote
and<00:00:24.720> then<00:00:24.810> if<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:24.990> see<00:00:25.140> here<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.679> got<00:00:25.829> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
and then if you see here it's got a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.919 
and then if you see here it's got a
value<00:00:26.009> in<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.369> back<00:00:26.489> eight<00:00:26.699> point<00:00:26.970> four<00:00:27.179> so

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:27.929 
value in the back eight point four so

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.359 
value in the back eight point four so
what<00:00:28.079> the<00:00:28.199> cameras<00:00:28.560> gonna<00:00:28.679> do<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.009> every<00:00:29.189> time

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
what the cameras gonna do is every time

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.309 
what the cameras gonna do is every time
I<00:00:29.519> make<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.759> photo<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:31.019> an<00:00:31.140> invisible

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:31.319 
I make a photo it's like an invisible

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.020 
I make a photo it's like an invisible
photo<00:00:31.710> assistants<00:00:32.130> gonna<00:00:32.279> run<00:00:32.460> out<00:00:32.579> there<00:00:32.759> may

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
photo assistants gonna run out there may

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.310 
photo assistants gonna run out there may
take<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> meter<00:00:33.480> reading<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.960> change<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
take a meter reading and change the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.390 
take a meter reading and change the
power<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.680> my<00:00:34.800> light<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.100> give<00:00:35.220> me<00:00:35.310> the

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
power of my light to give me the

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.040 
power of my light to give me the
appropriate<00:00:35.550> amount<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.240> I<00:00:36.330> just<00:00:36.510> randomly

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
appropriate amount so if I just randomly

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.660 
appropriate amount so if I just randomly
shoot<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> picture<00:00:37.590> over<00:00:37.890> here<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.490> see

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
shoot a picture over here you can see

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.130 
shoot a picture over here you can see
that<00:00:38.910> basically<00:00:39.210> if<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.570> change<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> power<00:00:40.050> of

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
that basically if I change the power of

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.980 
that basically if I change the power of
my<00:00:40.230> camera<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:42.060> make<00:00:42.210> photos<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.870> gonna

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
my camera and I make photos it's gonna

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.880 
my camera and I make photos it's gonna
use<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.230> different<00:00:43.410> amount<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.740> power

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
use a different amount of power

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.890 
use a different amount of power
depending<00:00:44.460> on<00:00:44.610> what<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.360> camera<00:00:45.630> things<00:00:45.810> I

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
depending on what the camera things I

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.960 
depending on what the camera things I
need<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> shot<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.310> that's<00:00:47.460> really<00:00:47.640> great

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
need for a shot so that's really great

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.090 
need for a shot so that's really great
and<00:00:48.240> speed<00:00:48.750> lights<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> same<00:00:49.350> thing<00:00:49.620> but

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
and speed lights do the same thing but

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.200 
and speed lights do the same thing but
what<00:00:50.220> makes<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.490> system<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.910> little<00:00:51.000> bit

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
what makes this system a little bit

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.280 
what makes this system a little bit
different<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.570> them<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.780> be<00:00:51.870> really<00:00:52.140> cool

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
different in them can be really cool

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.960 
different in them can be really cool
especially<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.220> professional<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.700> wants

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
especially for a professional that wants

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.490 
especially for a professional that wants
to<00:00:54.090> shoot<00:00:54.390> let's<00:00:54.720> say<00:00:54.840> lots<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.170> photos<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
to shoot let's say lots of photos and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.630 
to shoot let's say lots of photos and
then<00:00:55.590> go<00:00:55.710> through<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.010> do<00:00:56.100> mass<00:00:56.280> editing

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
then go through and do mass editing

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.550 
then go through and do mass editing
later<00:00:56.820> once<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:57.990> an<00:00:58.050> exposure<00:00:58.290> that<00:00:58.470> I'm

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
later once I have an exposure that I'm

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.330 
later once I have an exposure that I'm
happy<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.950> can<00:00:59.100> take<00:00:59.190> my<00:00:59.310> little

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
happy with I can take my little

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.100 
happy with I can take my little
controller<00:00:59.820> here<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:00.810> switch<00:01:01.020> you

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
controller here and I can switch you

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.579 
controller here and I can switch you
from<00:01:01.230> TTL<00:01:01.650> to<00:01:02.190> manual<00:01:02.630> once<00:01:03.630> I<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
from TTL to manual once I do this the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.350 
from TTL to manual once I do this the
light<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.860> now<00:01:05.009> on<00:01:05.189> manual<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.000> will<00:01:06.119> keep

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
light is now on manual and it will keep

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.330 
light is now on manual and it will keep
that<00:01:06.570> exposure<00:01:06.900> no<00:01:07.710> matter<00:01:07.890> where<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.250> my

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
that exposure no matter where it's on my

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.670 
that exposure no matter where it's on my
camera<00:01:08.630> that's<00:01:09.630> important<00:01:10.080> because<00:01:10.260> once<00:01:10.560> I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
camera that's important because once I

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.260 
camera that's important because once I
have<00:01:10.830> my<00:01:10.980> setting<00:01:11.400> my<00:01:11.760> settings<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> way<00:01:12.180> I

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
have my setting my settings the way I

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.180 
have my setting my settings the way I
want<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.630> all<00:01:13.200> my<00:01:13.380> photos<00:01:13.590> live<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> exact

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
want it all my photos live the exact

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.280 
want it all my photos live the exact
same<00:01:14.370> exposure<00:01:14.760> one<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.690> issues<00:01:15.870> with<00:01:16.020> TTL

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
same exposure one of the issues with TTL

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.170 
same exposure one of the issues with TTL
is<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:17.130> if<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.880> changing

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
is that if you have like a changing

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.340 
is that if you have like a changing
background<00:01:18.630> or<00:01:18.810> even<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:19.050> somebody<00:01:19.170> has

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
background or even if somebody has

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.350 
background or even if somebody has
really<00:01:19.560> dark<00:01:19.770> hair<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.070> light<00:01:20.250> skin<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:21.210> can

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
really dark hair and light skin you can

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.000 
really dark hair and light skin you can
end<00:01:21.510> up<00:01:21.570> with<00:01:21.630> different<00:01:21.870> exposures<00:01:22.350> slightly

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
end up with different exposures slightly

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.920 
end up with different exposures slightly
on<00:01:23.130> every<00:01:23.400> single<00:01:23.550> shot<00:01:23.729> because<00:01:24.090> again<00:01:24.720> it's

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
on every single shot because again it's

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.840 
on every single shot because again it's
metering<00:01:25.320> every<00:01:25.620> single<00:01:25.890> time<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.610> by<00:01:26.700> using

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
metering every single time so by using

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.310 
metering every single time so by using
this<00:01:27.090> kind<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.420> hybrid<00:01:27.630> mode<00:01:28.020> where<00:01:28.229> you're

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
this kind of hybrid mode where you're

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.930 
this kind of hybrid mode where you're
gonna<00:01:28.380> use<00:01:28.590> TTL<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.010> establish<00:01:29.520> your<00:01:29.610> exposure

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
gonna use TTL to establish your exposure

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.600 
gonna use TTL to establish your exposure
and<00:01:30.240> then<00:01:30.690> manual<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.680> lock<00:01:31.830> it<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.580> be

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
and then manual to lock it in can be

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.590 
and then manual to lock it in can be
really<00:01:32.909> great<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> professional

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
really great for a professional

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.940 
really great for a professional
especially<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:34.049> you're<00:01:34.140> working<00:01:34.440> you<00:01:34.860> know

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
especially if you're working you know

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.500 
especially if you're working you know
quickly<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.760> don't<00:01:35.909> have<00:01:35.970> time<00:01:36.210> or<00:01:36.420> an

quickly and you don't have time or an
assistant<00:01:36.810> let's<00:01:36.990> say<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.140> grab<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> light

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
assistant let's say to grab a light

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.620 
assistant let's say to grab a light
meter<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.430> let's<00:01:38.850> go<00:01:38.940> make<00:01:39.060> some<00:01:39.090> portraits<00:01:39.540> of

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
meter so let's go make some portraits of

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.240 
meter so let's go make some portraits of
Tiffany<00:01:39.930> over<00:01:40.049> here<00:01:40.140> by<00:01:40.260> the<00:01:40.320> window<00:01:40.440> so<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.190> I

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
Tiffany over here by the window so if I

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.390 
Tiffany over here by the window so if I
take<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.460> head<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.880> which<00:01:42.120> is<00:01:42.240> my<00:01:42.360> softbox<00:01:42.870> I<00:01:43.400> can

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
take a head a which is my softbox I can

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.370 
take a head a which is my softbox I can
turn<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.760> and<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:45.990> TTL

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
turn it on and you see I have it in TTL

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.800 
turn it on and you see I have it in TTL
so<00:01:47.159> my<00:01:47.310> camera<00:01:47.580> is<00:01:47.640> set<00:01:47.729> at<00:01:47.880> 250<00:01:48.330> of<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.450> second

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
so my camera is set at 250 of a second

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.380 
so my camera is set at 250 of a second
I'm<00:01:49.409> gonna<00:01:49.590> say<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:50.100> about<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.580> def<00:01:50.760> 5.6

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
I'm gonna say like about a def 5.6

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.399 
I'm gonna say like about a def 5.6
because<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.630> don't<00:01:51.750> want<00:01:51.900> to<00:01:51.990> be<00:01:52.049> too<00:01:52.200> bright

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
because I don't want to be too bright

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.100 
because I don't want to be too bright
outside<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.420> let's<00:01:54.420> go<00:01:54.540> make<00:01:54.659> some<00:01:54.780> photos<00:01:54.990> by

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
outside and let's go make some photos by

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.140 
outside and let's go make some photos by
the<00:01:55.170> window<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.530> see<00:01:55.619> what<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.770> get

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.310 

so<00:02:00.150> I<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.360> Tiffany<00:02:00.540> here<00:02:00.900> over<00:02:01.200> by<00:02:01.230> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
so I have Tiffany here over by the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.050 
so I have Tiffany here over by the
window<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.220> is<00:02:02.370> you<00:02:02.640> know<00:02:02.760> a<00:02:02.790> classic

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
window and this is you know a classic

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.150 
window and this is you know a classic
situation<00:02:04.050> where<00:02:04.380> TTL<00:02:04.800> is<00:02:04.890> going<00:02:05.010> to<00:02:05.070> be

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
situation where TTL is going to be

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.830 
situation where TTL is going to be
tricked<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:06.090> pretty<00:02:06.210> much<00:02:06.300> assure<00:02:06.540> you

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
tricked I can pretty much assure you

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.180 
tricked I can pretty much assure you
that<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.080> first<00:02:07.290> frame<00:02:07.560> out<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:07.920> camera

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
that the first frame out of this camera

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.859 
that the first frame out of this camera
is<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.490> be<00:02:08.550> too<00:02:08.730> dark<00:02:08.970> because<00:02:09.150> the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
is going to be too dark because the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.150 
is going to be too dark because the
metering<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.290> the<00:02:10.350> system<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.680> the<00:02:10.770> camera<00:02:11.070> is

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
metering in the system in the camera is

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.110 
metering in the system in the camera is
gonna<00:02:11.220> see<00:02:11.460> all<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.640> light<00:02:11.820> coming<00:02:11.850> from

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
gonna see all this light coming from

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.240 
gonna see all this light coming from
behind<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.960> it's<00:02:13.470> going<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.650> expose<00:02:13.890> for<00:02:13.950> that

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
behind and it's going to expose for that

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.040 
behind and it's going to expose for that
making<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.730> front<00:02:14.910> fill<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.540> little<00:02:15.660> bit<00:02:15.870> dark

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
making the front fill a little bit dark

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.600 
making the front fill a little bit dark
so<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.800> can<00:02:16.920> adjust<00:02:17.130> for<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.430> I'll<00:02:17.490> show

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
so we can adjust for that and I'll show

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.680 
so we can adjust for that and I'll show
you<00:02:17.670> how<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.820> do<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.090> but<00:02:18.210> let's<00:02:18.360> start<00:02:18.600> with

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
you how to do that but let's start with

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.820 
you how to do that but let's start with
making<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.170> photo<00:02:19.380> at<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.650> zero<00:02:19.950> setting<00:02:22.430> good

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
making a photo at the zero setting good

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.400 
making a photo at the zero setting good
nice<00:02:25.940> okay<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.360> I've<00:02:27.450> got<00:02:27.600> my<00:02:27.690> first<00:02:27.870> photo<00:02:28.140> and

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
nice okay so I've got my first photo and

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.830 
nice okay so I've got my first photo and
as<00:02:28.500> predicted<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.040> it's<00:02:29.280> dark<00:02:29.550> so<00:02:30.450> what<00:02:30.750> I'm

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
as predicted is it's dark so what I'm

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
as predicted is it's dark so what I'm
gonna<00:02:30.960> do<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.200> I'm<00:02:31.260> gonna<00:02:31.350> go<00:02:31.470> on<00:02:31.500> top<00:02:31.710> of<00:02:31.740> my

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
gonna do is I'm gonna go on top of my

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.810 
gonna do is I'm gonna go on top of my
controller<00:02:32.280> here<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:33.900> my<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.020> channel<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.280> I'm

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
controller here to my a channel and I'm

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.370 
controller here to my a channel and I'm
gonna<00:02:36.000> give<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.690> little<00:02:36.870> bit<00:02:37.020> more<00:02:37.110> power

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
gonna give it a little bit more power

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.020 
gonna give it a little bit more power
I'm<00:02:37.470> gonna<00:02:37.590> tell<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.920> overexposed<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:38.790> think

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
I'm gonna tell it to overexposed I think

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.910 
I'm gonna tell it to overexposed I think
by<00:02:39.180> about<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.420> stop<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.870> half<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.800> can

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
by about a stop and a half you can

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.290 
by about a stop and a half you can
either<00:02:41.100> do<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.310> intense<00:02:41.700> like<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.060> or<00:02:42.180> if<00:02:42.240> you

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
either do it intense like that or if you

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.210 
either do it intense like that or if you
hold<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.540> down<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:42.720> jumps<00:02:42.900> up<00:02:42.990> a<00:02:43.050> full-stop<00:02:43.410> so

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
hold it down it jumps up a full-stop so

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.380 
hold it down it jumps up a full-stop so
I'm<00:02:44.280> gonna<00:02:44.370> give<00:02:44.490> it<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.580> stop<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.940> half<00:02:45.030> and

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
I'm gonna give it a stop and a half and

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.840 
I'm gonna give it a stop and a half and
we're<00:02:45.540> good<00:02:45.740> so<00:02:46.740> again<00:02:46.950> because<00:02:47.100> I'm<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.430> TTL

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
we're good so again because I'm in TTL

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.310 
we're good so again because I'm in TTL
it's<00:02:48.000> still<00:02:48.210> metering<00:02:48.720> every<00:02:48.900> single<00:02:49.170> time

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
it's still metering every single time

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.480 
it's still metering every single time
but<00:02:49.500> now<00:02:49.620> it's<00:02:49.770> gonna<00:02:49.860> meet<00:02:50.070> her<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.400> then

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
but now it's gonna meet her and then

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.420 
but now it's gonna meet her and then
overexpose<00:02:51.150> by<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.390> stop<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.840> half<00:02:54.920> good<00:02:55.920> we

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
overexpose by a stop and a half good we

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.320 
overexpose by a stop and a half good we
go<00:02:56.550> nice<00:02:57.390> ah<00:02:57.860> much<00:02:58.860> better

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
go nice ah much better

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.820 
go nice ah much better
so<00:03:00.330> now<00:03:00.480> I've<00:03:00.630> got<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.810> properly<00:03:01.260> exposed<00:03:01.590> photo

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
so now I've got a properly exposed photo

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.199 
so now I've got a properly exposed photo
I<00:03:01.920> can<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:02.340> can<00:03:02.550> do<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.730> few<00:03:02.910> different<00:03:03.000> things

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
I can I can do a few different things

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.060 
I can I can do a few different things
here<00:03:03.540> if<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:03.750> want<00:03:03.990> more<00:03:04.320> or<00:03:04.560> less<00:03:04.740> depth<00:03:04.950> of

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
here if I want more or less depth of

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.620 
here if I want more or less depth of
field<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.400> can<00:03:05.459> change<00:03:05.700> my<00:03:05.850> aperture<00:03:06.120> and

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
field I can change my aperture and

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.750 
field I can change my aperture and
because<00:03:06.930> I'm<00:03:07.020> working<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.410> TTL<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:08.370> flash

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
because I'm working in TTL the flash

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.670 
because I'm working in TTL the flash
power<00:03:09.000> will<00:03:09.240> adjust<00:03:09.450> automatically<00:03:09.959> if<00:03:10.380> I

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
power will adjust automatically if I

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.020 
power will adjust automatically if I
want<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.010> just<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.430> background<00:03:11.670> brightness

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
want the just the background brightness

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.580 
want the just the background brightness
to<00:03:12.330> go<00:03:12.420> up<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.630> down<00:03:12.750> though<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.020> can<00:03:13.230> change<00:03:13.380> my

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
to go up and down though I can change my

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.650 
to go up and down though I can change my
shutter<00:03:13.770> speed<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.340> some<00:03:15.270> cameras<00:03:15.570> are

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
shutter speed and some cameras are

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.180 
shutter speed and some cameras are
capable<00:03:15.959> of<00:03:16.020> high-speed<00:03:16.320> sync<00:03:16.770> and<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.040> new

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
capable of high-speed sync and the new

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.440 
capable of high-speed sync and the new
upgrade<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.610> this<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.850> also<00:03:18.090> capable<00:03:18.270> of

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
upgrade to this is also capable of

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.150 
upgrade to this is also capable of
that's<00:03:18.600> like<00:03:18.660> go<00:03:18.930> above<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.620> maximum<00:03:19.739> sync

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
that's like go above the maximum sync

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.470 
that's like go above the maximum sync
speed<00:03:20.310> but<00:03:20.489> I<00:03:20.520> kinda<00:03:20.880> don't<00:03:20.970> want<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:21.270> guy<00:03:21.450> to

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
speed but I kinda don't want this guy to

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.510 
speed but I kinda don't want this guy to
be<00:03:21.690> too<00:03:22.380> dark<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.770> want<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:23.010> keep<00:03:23.100> this<00:03:23.250> light

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
be too dark I want to keep this light

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.620 
be too dark I want to keep this light
and<00:03:23.670> airy<00:03:23.820> so<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.060> think<00:03:24.120> I'm<00:03:24.300> actually<00:03:24.420> gonna

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
and airy so I think I'm actually gonna

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.630 
and airy so I think I'm actually gonna
reduce<00:03:24.930> my<00:03:24.989> shutter<00:03:25.290> speed<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.530> little<00:03:25.680> bit<00:03:25.920> to

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
reduce my shutter speed a little bit to

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.060 
reduce my shutter speed a little bit to
two<00:03:27.180> hundredth<00:03:27.420> of<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.540> second<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:27.980> see<00:03:28.980> what

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
two hundredth of a second and see what

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.699 
two hundredth of a second and see what
that<00:03:29.160> looks<00:03:29.280> like

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.979 

good<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:33.209> again<00:03:33.329> I<00:03:33.390> have<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.540> properly<00:03:33.810> exposed

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
good so again I have a properly exposed

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.449 
good so again I have a properly exposed
flash<00:03:34.409> picture<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:34.950> my<00:03:35.040> backgrounds<00:03:35.430> a

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
flash picture and my backgrounds a

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.000 
flash picture and my backgrounds a
little<00:03:35.609> bit<00:03:35.700> brighter<00:03:36.590> let's<00:03:37.590> just<00:03:37.769> see<00:03:37.829> if<00:03:37.859> it

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
little bit brighter let's just see if it

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.080 
little bit brighter let's just see if it
looks<00:03:38.159> a<00:03:38.219> little<00:03:38.310> bit<00:03:38.519> nicer<00:03:38.790> though<00:03:38.909> if<00:03:39.000> I

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
looks a little bit nicer though if I

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.440 
looks a little bit nicer though if I
drop<00:03:39.299> down<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.719> f/4<00:03:43.969> so<00:03:44.969> you<00:03:45.060> can<00:03:45.150> see<00:03:45.269> one

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
drop down to f/4 so you can see one

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.119 
drop down to f/4 so you can see one
advantage<00:03:45.689> of<00:03:45.840> this<00:03:45.900> Pro<00:03:46.079> photo<00:03:46.319> is<00:03:46.590> how<00:03:46.829> fast

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
advantage of this Pro photo is how fast

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:48.860 
advantage of this Pro photo is how fast
I<00:03:47.340> can<00:03:47.519> shoot<00:03:47.760> if<00:03:48.180> you're<00:03:48.329> working<00:03:48.480> with<00:03:48.569> speed

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
I can shoot if you're working with speed

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.690 
I can shoot if you're working with speed
lights<00:03:49.139> especially<00:03:49.680> battling<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.340> Sun<00:03:50.519> like

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
lights especially battling the Sun like

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.920 
lights especially battling the Sun like
this<00:03:50.849> you're<00:03:51.000> going<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.180> be<00:03:51.239> racking<00:03:51.629> out<00:03:51.750> at

especially<00:03:53.909> in<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.209> box<00:03:54.389> like<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:54.599> and<00:03:54.959> you're

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
especially in a box like this and you're

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.660 
especially in a box like this and you're
gonna<00:03:55.349> have<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.560> wait<00:03:55.709> five<00:03:55.889> six<00:03:56.159> seconds<00:03:56.459> or

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
gonna have to wait five six seconds or

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.640 
gonna have to wait five six seconds or
invest<00:03:57.120> in<00:03:57.329> like<00:03:57.780> quantum<00:03:58.230> battery<00:03:58.500> or

invest in like quantum battery or

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.720 
invest in like quantum battery or
something<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:59.010> be<00:03:59.069> able<00:03:59.129> to<00:03:59.219> shoot<00:03:59.310> faster

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
something to be able to shoot faster

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.890 
something to be able to shoot faster
that's<00:03:59.909> just<00:04:00.030> more<00:04:00.209> pieces<00:04:00.450> of<00:04:00.569> equipment<00:04:00.689> to

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
that's just more pieces of equipment to

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.710 
that's just more pieces of equipment to
deal<00:04:01.049> with<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:02.219> power<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.700> b1<00:04:03.030> is<00:04:03.209> 500

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
deal with the power of the b1 is 500

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.050 
deal with the power of the b1 is 500
watt<00:04:03.870> seconds<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:04.439> can<00:04:04.769> in<00:04:05.069> with<00:04:05.310> TTL<00:04:05.639> really

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
watt seconds I can in with TTL really

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.589 
watt seconds I can in with TTL really
nice<00:04:06.799> so<00:04:07.799> that's<00:04:07.950> how<00:04:08.040> you'd<00:04:08.189> use<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:09.060> b1<00:04:09.359> to

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
nice so that's how you'd use the b1 to

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.599 
nice so that's how you'd use the b1 to
balance<00:04:10.049> against<00:04:10.290> available<00:04:10.950> light<00:04:11.099> let's

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
balance against available light let's

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.099 
balance against available light let's
say<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:11.760> wanted<00:04:11.939> to<00:04:12.000> do<00:04:12.090> a<00:04:12.120> more<00:04:12.269> formal<00:04:12.329> type<00:04:12.959> of

say I wanted to do a more formal type of
portrait<00:04:13.620> shoot<00:04:13.739> where<00:04:13.919> I<00:04:13.950> want<00:04:14.189> to<00:04:14.250> bring<00:04:14.430> my

gonna have our main light here we're
gonna<00:04:47.669> set<00:04:47.940> up<00:04:47.970> this<00:04:48.240> strip<00:04:48.780> Bank<00:04:48.960> is<00:04:49.110> like

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
gonna set up this strip Bank is like

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.140 
gonna set up this strip Bank is like
kind<00:04:49.380> of<00:04:49.409> like<00:04:49.530> a<00:04:49.590> hair<00:04:49.800> light<00:04:50.010> on<00:04:50.490> our<00:04:50.909> side

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
kind of like a hair light on our side

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.370 
kind of like a hair light on our side
and<00:04:51.389> then<00:04:51.510> we're<00:04:51.630> gonna<00:04:51.720> put<00:04:52.050> a<00:04:52.080> little<00:04:52.260> circle

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
and then we're gonna put a little circle

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.600 
and then we're gonna put a little circle
of<00:04:52.590> light<00:04:52.650> with<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:52.919> grid<00:04:53.070> in<00:04:53.159> the<00:04:53.220> background

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
of light with the grid in the background

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.399 
of light with the grid in the background
so<00:04:54.210> again<00:04:54.360> everything<00:04:54.570> set<00:04:54.810> at<00:04:54.930> zero<00:04:55.139> let's

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
so again everything set at zero let's

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:57.710 
so again everything set at zero let's
see<00:04:55.530> what<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.770> camera<00:04:55.919> recommends<00:04:56.760> because<00:04:57.690> I

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
see what the camera recommends because I

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.909 
see what the camera recommends because I
have<00:04:57.900> so<00:04:58.050> much<00:04:58.139> available<00:04:58.680> light<00:04:58.800> in<00:04:58.860> the

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
have so much available light in the

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.499 
have so much available light in the
studio<00:04:59.190> I<00:04:59.220> want<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.550> compensate<00:05:00.210> for<00:05:00.389> I'm

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
studio I want to compensate for I'm

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:01.879 
studio I want to compensate for I'm
going<00:05:00.659> to<00:05:00.720> go<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:00.840> 250<00:05:01.139> again<00:05:01.500> on<00:05:01.620> my<00:05:01.680> shutter

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
going to go to 250 again on my shutter

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.680 
going to go to 250 again on my shutter
speed<00:05:01.979> that's<00:05:02.759> running<00:05:03.000> go<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.240> 50<00:05:03.479> I'm<00:05:03.570> gonna

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
speed that's running go to 50 I'm gonna

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.040 

good<00:05:10.910> great<00:05:11.910> so<00:05:12.210> what<00:05:12.360> we<00:05:12.450> have<00:05:12.600> here<00:05:12.630> is<00:05:13.020> a

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
good great so what we have here is a

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.170 
good great so what we have here is a
really<00:05:13.260> well<00:05:13.500> exposed<00:05:13.860> shot<00:05:14.100> on<00:05:14.250> her<00:05:14.460> but<00:05:15.060> my

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
really well exposed shot on her but my

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.700 
really well exposed shot on her but my
hair<00:05:15.390> light<00:05:15.600> is<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:15.960> same<00:05:16.110> exposure<00:05:16.410> as<00:05:16.560> my

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
hair light is the same exposure as my

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.440 
hair light is the same exposure as my
front<00:05:16.920> light<00:05:17.160> so<00:05:17.730> it<00:05:17.970> doesn't<00:05:18.240> look<00:05:18.300> like<00:05:18.420> a

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
front light so it doesn't look like a

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.270 
front light so it doesn't look like a
hair<00:05:18.630> light<00:05:18.780> it<00:05:18.900> just<00:05:18.930> looks<00:05:19.170> lit<00:05:19.560> like<00:05:19.950> flat

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
hair light it just looks lit like flat

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.040 
hair light it just looks lit like flat
and<00:05:20.580> then<00:05:20.940> my<00:05:21.030> background<00:05:21.420> is<00:05:21.510> actually<00:05:21.600> gray

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
and then my background is actually gray

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.600 
and then my background is actually gray
the<00:05:22.320> reason<00:05:22.590> for<00:05:22.710> that<00:05:22.800> is<00:05:23.040> a<00:05:23.070> meter<00:05:23.400> and<00:05:23.520> your

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
the reason for that is a meter and your

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.790 
the reason for that is a meter and your
camera<00:05:23.970> is<00:05:24.060> trying<00:05:24.240> to<00:05:24.390> produce<00:05:24.540> gray<00:05:24.930> when

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
camera is trying to produce gray when

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
camera is trying to produce gray when
it's<00:05:25.920> looking<00:05:26.160> at<00:05:26.280> things<00:05:26.460> because<00:05:26.640> it's<00:05:26.760> a

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
it's looking at things because it's a

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.370 
it's looking at things because it's a
reflective<00:05:27.270> style<00:05:27.480> meter<00:05:27.750> not<00:05:27.960> an<00:05:28.050> instant

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
reflective style meter not an instant

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.750 
reflective style meter not an instant
meters<00:05:28.620> which<00:05:28.830> means<00:05:29.040> that<00:05:29.250> I<00:05:29.280> have<00:05:29.430> to<00:05:29.460> do<00:05:29.610> two

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
meters which means that I have to do two

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.520 
meters which means that I have to do two
things<00:05:29.940> right<00:05:30.060> off<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.390> bat<00:05:30.540> I<00:05:30.780> have<00:05:31.260> to<00:05:31.350> turn

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
things right off the bat I have to turn

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.840 
things right off the bat I have to turn
up<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:31.710> power<00:05:31.860> of<00:05:31.980> my<00:05:32.070> softbox<00:05:32.490> to<00:05:32.610> get<00:05:32.700> more

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
up the power of my softbox to get more

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.040 
up the power of my softbox to get more
hair<00:05:33.030> light<00:05:33.210> and<00:05:33.390> turtle<00:05:33.570> my<00:05:33.630> background<00:05:33.990> in

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
hair light and turtle my background in

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.320 
hair light and turtle my background in
power<00:05:34.260> so<00:05:35.160> I'm<00:05:35.220> just<00:05:35.340> gonna<00:05:35.520> go<00:05:35.670> to<00:05:35.730> channel<00:05:36.120> C

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
power so I'm just gonna go to channel C

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.240 
power so I'm just gonna go to channel C
which<00:05:37.260> is<00:05:37.380> my<00:05:37.500> background<00:05:37.950> and<00:05:38.070> I'm<00:05:38.160> gonna

I<00:05:52.320> wanted<00:05:52.590> I<00:05:52.680> have<00:05:52.830> the<00:05:52.950> background<00:05:53.340> light

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
I wanted I have the background light

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.590 
I wanted I have the background light
exactly<00:05:53.850> how<00:05:53.940> I<00:05:53.970> like<00:05:54.150> it<00:05:54.210> which<00:05:54.360> is<00:05:54.480> like<00:05:54.510> a
