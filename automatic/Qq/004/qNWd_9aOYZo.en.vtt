tutorial here will I have so today I'm
going<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.580> teach<00:00:05.700> you<00:00:05.759> guys<00:00:05.910> that<00:00:06.120> make<00:00:06.240> a

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
going to teach you guys that make a

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.690 
going to teach you guys that make a
small<00:00:06.660> compact<00:00:07.259> piston<00:00:07.740> trap<00:00:07.980> would<00:00:08.550> work

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
small compact piston trap would work

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.640 
small compact piston trap would work
perfectly<00:00:09.120> for<00:00:09.360> multiplayer<00:00:09.809> for<00:00:10.469> those

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
perfectly for multiplayer for those

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.030 
perfectly for multiplayer for those
pesky<00:00:11.429> griefers<00:00:12.090> or<00:00:12.420> just<00:00:12.630> any<00:00:12.780> victim<00:00:13.500> that

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
pesky griefers or just any victim that

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.919 
pesky griefers or just any victim that
you<00:00:14.130> just<00:00:14.250> want<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.519> die<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.299> anyway<00:00:15.540> how<00:00:15.839> it

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
you just want to die so anyway how it

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.210 
you just want to die so anyway how it
works<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.260> you're<00:00:16.379> walking<00:00:16.500> along<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.039> can

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
works is you're walking along this can

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.439 
works is you're walking along this can
be<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.490> long<00:00:17.670> mine<00:00:18.660> shaft<00:00:18.960> or<00:00:19.080> something<00:00:20.449> but

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
be in a long mine shaft or something but

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.880 
be in a long mine shaft or something but
anyway<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:21.810> yeah<00:00:22.080> you're<00:00:22.199> walking<00:00:22.560> along<00:00:22.769> and

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
anyway so yeah you're walking along and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.019 
anyway so yeah you're walking along and
then<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.100> probably<00:00:23.400> won't<00:00:23.640> even<00:00:23.699> notice<00:00:23.789> that

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
then you probably won't even notice that

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.910 
then you probably won't even notice that
pressure<00:00:24.330> plate<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:24.720> when<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.960> get<00:00:25.140> one<00:00:25.680> by

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
pressure plate but when you get one by

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.710 
pressure plate but when you get one by
the<00:00:25.980> time<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.279> do<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.670> too<00:00:26.849> late<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.269> you

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
the time you do it's too late and you

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.359 
the time you do it's too late and you
fall<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.199> that's<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> thing<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:28.949> we're<00:00:29.220> now

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
fall and that's the thing that we're now

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.769 
fall and that's the thing that we're now
you're<00:00:29.490> probably<00:00:29.609> thinking<00:00:29.820> oh<00:00:30.240> well<00:00:30.269> there's

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
you're probably thinking oh well there's

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.209 
you're probably thinking oh well there's
lava<00:00:30.960> there<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.439> just<00:00:31.560> going<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.830> incinerate

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
lava there so just going to incinerate

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.060 
lava there so just going to incinerate
their<00:00:32.369> items<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.210> there's<00:00:33.360> no<00:00:33.480> point<00:00:33.690> no<00:00:34.559> I'll

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
their items so there's no point no I'll

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.920 
their items so there's no point no I'll
show<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:36.120> later<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.570> does<00:00:36.780> not

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
show you that later it does not

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.830 
show you that later it does not
incinerate<00:00:37.410> your<00:00:37.500> items<00:00:38.120> exactly<00:00:39.120> crazy<00:00:39.690> I

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.630 
incinerate your items exactly crazy I
know<00:00:39.899> come<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.010> anyway<00:00:41.070> all<00:00:41.399> you're<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.579> to

know come so anyway all you're going to

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.850 
know come so anyway all you're going to
need<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.910> three<00:00:42.210> repeaters<00:00:42.629> world<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.710> way<00:00:43.829> I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
need is three repeaters world the way I

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.400 
need is three repeaters world the way I
have<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.690> let's<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.840> go<00:00:45.899> back<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.289> show

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
have it let's just go back here to show

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.049 
have it let's just go back here to show
an<00:00:46.530> example<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.309> way<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.969> it

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
an example the way I have it is that it

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.639 
an example the way I have it is that it
pulls<00:00:48.239> back<00:00:48.420> three<00:00:48.840> blocks<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.500> have<00:00:49.590> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
pulls back three blocks you can have a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.200 
pulls back three blocks you can have a
pool<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.920> one<00:00:50.160> block<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.399> front<00:00:50.579> which<00:00:51.059> I

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
pool of one block in front which I

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.119 
pool of one block in front which I
figure<00:00:51.539> sometimes<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:52.860> kind<00:00:53.100> of

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
figure sometimes you can just kind of

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.340 
figure sometimes you can just kind of
sprint<00:00:53.430> past<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.570> never<00:00:54.690> do<00:00:54.930> two<00:00:55.079> blocks

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
sprint past that you never do two blocks

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.869 
sprint past that you never do two blocks
I<00:00:55.530> just<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> do<00:00:56.219> three<00:00:56.430> books<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.789> can

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
I just have it do three books you can

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.180 
I just have it do three books you can
have<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> do<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.449> up<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.690> 12<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.710> perfectly

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
have a do like up to 12 with perfectly

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.130 
have a do like up to 12 with perfectly
without<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.520> delay<00:00:59.789> after<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.809> though<00:01:00.960> you're

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
without a delay after that though you're

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.889 
without a delay after that though you're
going<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.730> add<00:01:02.730> some<00:01:03.180> repeaters<00:01:03.600> I

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
going to have to add some repeaters I

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.590 
going to have to add some repeaters I
think<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.799> thank<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.309> don't<00:01:05.489> know<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.760> don't<00:01:06.479> know

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
think I thank I don't know I don't know

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.810 
think I thank I don't know I don't know
the<00:01:06.720> exact<00:01:07.049> number<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:07.619> anyway<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:07.979> what

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the exact number but anyway so what

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.880 
the exact number but anyway so what
you're<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.060> want<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.770> is<00:01:10.770> you're

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
you're going to want to do is you're

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.350 
you're going to want to do is you're
going<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.070> want<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.790> I'm<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.000> doing

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
going to want to just I'm just doing

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.850 
going to want to just I'm just doing
three<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:12.869> let's<00:01:13.049> just<00:01:13.170> go<00:01:13.260> like<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.530> right

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
three so let's just go like this right

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.410 
three so let's just go like this right
and<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.000> we're<00:01:15.090> going<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.270> put<00:01:15.360> our

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and then so we're going to put our

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.950 
and then so we're going to put our
Pistons<00:01:15.840> here<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:17.360> then<00:01:18.360> now<00:01:18.600> let's<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:18.869> go

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
Pistons here and then now let's just go

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.870 
Pistons here and then now let's just go
down<00:01:19.080> another<00:01:19.259> layer<00:01:19.500> here<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.009> then<00:01:20.520> dig<00:01:20.759> out

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
down another layer here and then dig out

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.999 
down another layer here and then dig out
the<00:01:20.970> box<00:01:21.180> under<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.479> Pistons<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.770> power

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the box under the Pistons and then power

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.630 
the box under the Pistons and then power
it<00:01:23.130> with<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> redstone<00:01:23.610> torch<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:26.250> now<00:01:26.369> all<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
it with a redstone torch so now all the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.030 
it with a redstone torch so now all the
Pistons<00:01:26.970> are<00:01:27.090> powered<00:01:27.619> out<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.829> come<00:01:28.950> out

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
Pistons are powered out you come out

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.920 
Pistons are powered out you come out
here<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.340> pretty<00:01:29.579> much<00:01:29.670> how<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.880> works<00:01:30.119> these

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
here so pretty much how it works these

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.480 
here so pretty much how it works these
blocks<00:01:31.259> right<00:01:31.470> here<00:01:31.799> that's<00:01:32.220> where<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
blocks right here that's where the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.490 
blocks right here that's where the
restaurant<00:01:32.759> torch<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.150> attached<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.320> these

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
restaurant torch is attached to so these

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.050 
restaurant torch is attached to so these
blocks<00:01:34.920> pretty<00:01:35.310> much<00:01:35.460> are<00:01:35.610> powering<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
blocks pretty much are powering the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.530 
blocks pretty much are powering the
Pistons<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.110> if<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.259> disable<00:01:37.530> these<00:01:37.799> blocks

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
Pistons so if you disable these blocks

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.899 
Pistons so if you disable these blocks
right<00:01:39.540> these<00:01:39.780> ones<00:01:39.990> right<00:01:40.079> here<00:01:40.670> then<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.790> will

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
right these ones right here then it will

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.249 
right these ones right here then it will
disable<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.270> piston<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.930> need<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.140> dig

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
disable the piston so you need to dig

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.499 
disable the piston so you need to dig
out<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.740> beside<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.820> don't<00:01:44.970> need<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.240> go<00:01:45.360> this

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
out to beside you don't need to go this

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.149 
out to beside you don't need to go this
layer<00:01:45.750> right<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:45.990> I'm<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.619> showing<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.979> for

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
layer right here I'm just showing it for

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.370 
layer right here I'm just showing it for
example<00:01:47.369> purposes<00:01:47.640> put<00:01:48.509> three<00:01:48.750> repeaters<00:01:49.140> you

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
example purposes put three repeaters you

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.399 
example purposes put three repeaters you
don't<00:01:49.530> need<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.829> take<00:01:49.979> them<00:01:50.220> doesn't<00:01:50.850> matter

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
don't need to take them doesn't matter

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.929 
don't need to take them doesn't matter
now<00:01:52.409> put<00:01:52.649> redstone<00:01:52.860> connecting<00:01:53.490> all<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.700> them

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
now put redstone connecting all of them

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.450 
now put redstone connecting all of them
so<00:01:54.570> now<00:01:54.720> pretty<00:01:55.439> much<00:01:55.530> when<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.860> power<00:01:56.040> this

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
so now pretty much when you power this

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.340 
so now pretty much when you power this
output<00:01:56.880> line<00:01:57.000> right<00:01:57.180> here<00:01:57.360> it'll<00:01:58.079> turn<00:01:58.200> off

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
output line right here it'll turn off

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.550 
output line right here it'll turn off
the<00:01:58.469> torches<00:01:58.829> pulling<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.490> Pistons<00:02:00.560> now

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
the torches pulling in the Pistons now

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.760 
the torches pulling in the Pistons now
all<00:02:01.920> we<00:02:02.040> need<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:03.350> have<00:02:04.350> grass<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.890> common<00:02:05.189> oyes

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
all we need I have grass the common oyes

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.410 
all we need I have grass the common oyes
the<00:02:06.670> one<00:02:06.820> thing<00:02:07.000> though<00:02:07.180> when<00:02:07.329> you're

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
the one thing though when you're

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.940 
the one thing though when you're
bringing<00:02:07.539> this<00:02:07.750> red<00:02:07.929> tooth<00:02:08.080> online<00:02:08.379> across<00:02:08.679> is

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
bringing this red tooth online across is

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.589 
bringing this red tooth online across is
you<00:02:09.069> do<00:02:09.160> not<00:02:09.280> want<00:02:09.459> to<00:02:09.489> touch<00:02:09.640> this<00:02:09.849> block<00:02:10.119> or

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
you do not want to touch this block or

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.850 
you do not want to touch this block or
this<00:02:10.899> blog<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.290> don't<00:02:11.410> wanna<00:02:11.530> put<00:02:11.680> redstone

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
this blog you don't wanna put redstone

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.770 
this blog you don't wanna put redstone
and<00:02:12.069> neither<00:02:12.370> of<00:02:12.459> these<00:02:12.519> blocks<00:02:12.819> because<00:02:13.510> then

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and neither of these blocks because then

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.170 
and neither of these blocks because then
it'll<00:02:13.959> get<00:02:14.200> powered<00:02:15.160> by<00:02:15.310> either<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.970> block

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
it'll get powered by either that block

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.330 
it'll get powered by either that block
it's<00:02:16.450> kind<00:02:16.660> of<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.810> glitch<00:02:17.019> and<00:02:17.620> then<00:02:18.069> it<00:02:18.190> or

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
it's kind of a glitch and then it or

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.770 
it's kind of a glitch and then it or
it'll<00:02:18.459> get<00:02:18.610> powered<00:02:18.879> by<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.150> torch<00:02:19.420> just

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
it'll get powered by that torch just

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.559 
it'll get powered by that torch just
makes<00:02:20.170> sense<00:02:20.489> so<00:02:21.489> anyway<00:02:21.760> we're<00:02:22.390> going<00:02:22.510> to

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
makes sense so anyway we're going to

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.420 
makes sense so anyway we're going to
want<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.750> have<00:02:22.840> our<00:02:22.959> pressure<00:02:23.230> pad<00:02:23.560> block<00:02:24.720> here

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
want to have our pressure pad block here

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.970 
want to have our pressure pad block here
so<00:02:27.430> now<00:02:27.549> if<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:27.790> put<00:02:27.970> redstone<00:02:28.510> here<00:02:29.170> that

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
so now if you put redstone here that

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.970 
so now if you put redstone here that
pressure<00:02:30.160> pad<00:02:30.459> will<00:02:30.640> power<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:30.940> redstone<00:02:31.980> so

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
pressure pad will power the redstone so

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.170 
pressure pad will power the redstone so
now<00:02:33.069> let's<00:02:33.250> just<00:02:33.370> bring<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:33.580> back<00:02:33.700> down<00:02:33.879> here

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
now let's just bring it back down here

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.580 
now let's just bring it back down here
and<00:02:35.670> connect<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.730> with<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:36.879> red<00:02:37.090> stone<00:02:37.590> so

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
and connect it with the red stone so

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.020 
and connect it with the red stone so
that<00:02:38.620> now<00:02:38.799> the<00:02:38.860> pressure<00:02:39.130> pad<00:02:39.400> powers<00:02:39.849> this

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
that now the pressure pad powers this

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.380 
that now the pressure pad powers this
redstone<00:02:40.410> powering<00:02:41.410> its<00:02:41.530> redstone<00:02:41.890> repeaters

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
redstone powering its redstone repeaters

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.670 
redstone powering its redstone repeaters
turning<00:02:43.390> off<00:02:43.510> all<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.840> torches<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.349> turning

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
turning off all the torches and turning

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.900 
turning off all the torches and turning
off<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.799> Pistons<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:46.150> now<00:02:46.269> let's<00:02:46.540> go<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:46.750> stoke

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
off the Pistons so now let's go to stoke

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.539 
off the Pistons so now let's go to stoke
if<00:02:48.910> I<00:02:49.120> don't<00:02:49.180> be<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.690> fail<00:02:50.130> tonight<00:02:51.130> walk<00:02:51.370> up

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
if I don't be a fail tonight walk up

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.050 
if I don't be a fail tonight walk up
here<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:52.000> brings<00:02:52.510> back<00:02:52.599> all<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.019> Pistons

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
here and it brings back all the Pistons

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.800 
here and it brings back all the Pistons
go<00:02:55.060> there<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.420> brings<00:02:55.630> back<00:02:55.780> all<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.019> pizzas

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
go there and brings back all the pizzas

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:05.250 
go there and brings back all the pizzas
easy<00:03:02.579> so<00:03:03.579> yeah<00:03:03.730> so<00:03:04.569> now<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.840> can<00:03:05.019> just<00:03:05.170> put

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
easy so yeah so now you can just put

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.890 
easy so yeah so now you can just put
stone<00:03:05.560> here<00:03:06.120> now<00:03:07.120> if<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:07.299> guys<00:03:07.420> already<00:03:07.629> doing

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
stone here now if you guys already doing

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.319 
stone here now if you guys already doing
this<00:03:07.959> in<00:03:08.110> a<00:03:08.140> cave<00:03:08.319> then<00:03:08.650> that's<00:03:08.890> fine<00:03:08.980> but<00:03:09.370> I'm

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
this in a cave then that's fine but I'm

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.449 
this in a cave then that's fine but I'm
not<00:03:10.389> clearly<00:03:11.319> so<00:03:13.920> just<00:03:14.920> gonna<00:03:15.069> kind<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.370> do

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
not clearly so just gonna kind of do

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.349 
not clearly so just gonna kind of do
this<00:03:15.639> oh<00:03:17.430> it's<00:03:18.430> just<00:03:18.549> kind<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:18.760> simulate<00:03:19.329> a

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
this oh it's just kind of simulate a

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:26.580 
this oh it's just kind of simulate a
little<00:03:19.780> bit<00:03:19.900> of<00:03:19.989> a<00:03:20.019> cave<00:03:20.260> here<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:25.329> now<00:03:25.590> to

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
little bit of a cave here and so now to

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.020 
little bit of a cave here and so now to
cover<00:03:26.799> it<00:03:26.950> by<00:03:27.069> the<00:03:27.130> side<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.609> can<00:03:27.760> just<00:03:27.910> go

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
cover it by the side you can just go

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.000 
cover it by the side you can just go
down<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.870> basic<00:03:29.200> layer<00:03:29.380> here<00:03:29.590> so<00:03:29.769> if<00:03:29.889> it<00:03:29.980> is

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
down to the basic layer here so if it is

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.580 
down to the basic layer here so if it is
above<00:03:30.220> ground<00:03:30.579> it<00:03:30.910> you<00:03:31.840> can<00:03:31.989> cover<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.319> pretty

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
above ground it you can cover it pretty

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.879 
above ground it you can cover it pretty
nicely<00:03:32.769> but<00:03:33.670> if<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.239> is<00:03:34.269> but<00:03:34.599> and<00:03:34.810> then<00:03:35.319> you<00:03:35.709> can

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
nicely but if it is but and then you can

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.589 
nicely but if it is but and then you can
cover<00:03:36.040> it<00:03:36.160> pretty<00:03:36.489> almost<00:03:36.849> perfectly<00:03:37.329> except

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
cover it pretty almost perfectly except

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:38.849 
cover it pretty almost perfectly except
for<00:03:37.750> these<00:03:37.810> three<00:03:38.019> blocks<00:03:38.260> here<00:03:38.470> so<00:03:38.620> you<00:03:38.709> just

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
for these three blocks here so you just

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.650 
for these three blocks here so you just
have<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.130> hallway<00:03:39.430> pretty<00:03:39.670> much<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.060> then

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
have the hallway pretty much and then

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.140 
have the hallway pretty much and then
those<00:03:40.780> through<00:03:40.989> extra<00:03:41.260> box<00:03:41.670> this<00:03:42.670> all<00:03:42.910> can

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
those through extra box this all can

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.430 
those through extra box this all can
just<00:03:43.299> be<00:03:43.420> flattened<00:03:43.750> they<00:03:43.900> covered<00:03:44.170> like<00:03:44.260> that

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
just be flattened they covered like that

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.710 
just be flattened they covered like that
so<00:03:44.590> now<00:03:44.709> you<00:03:45.310> go<00:03:45.400> exist<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:45.970> so<00:03:46.180> now<00:03:46.209> right<00:03:46.599> at

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
so now you go exist and so now right at

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.020 
so now you go exist and so now right at
this<00:03:46.840> moment<00:03:47.220> let's<00:03:48.220> just<00:03:48.400> take<00:03:48.549> these<00:03:48.790> blocks

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
this moment let's just take these blocks

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.629 
this moment let's just take these blocks
here<00:03:49.650> right<00:03:50.650> at<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.829> moment<00:03:50.950> you<00:03:51.310> walk<00:03:51.459> into

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
here right at the moment you walk into

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:52.979 
here right at the moment you walk into
here<00:03:51.910> you<00:03:52.060> go<00:03:52.150> down<00:03:52.299> here<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.480> then<00:03:52.660> they<00:03:52.750> push

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
here you go down here and then they push

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.270 
here you go down here and then they push
you<00:03:53.169> into<00:03:53.319> this<00:03:53.470> wall<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:53.889> you<00:03:53.950> just<00:03:54.069> kind<00:03:54.250> of

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
you into this wall and you just kind of

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.159 
you into this wall and you just kind of
suffocate<00:03:54.790> you're<00:03:55.660> probably<00:03:55.870> going<00:03:56.049> to<00:03:56.109> want

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
suffocate you're probably going to want

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.690 
suffocate you're probably going to want
to<00:03:56.319> fill<00:03:56.470> in<00:03:56.590> those<00:03:56.680> blocks<00:03:57.040> to<00:03:57.400> maybe<00:03:57.549> that

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
to fill in those blocks to maybe that

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.339 
to fill in those blocks to maybe that
one<00:03:57.849> in<00:03:58.000> I<00:03:58.090> don't<00:03:58.269> know<00:03:58.329> doesn't<00:03:58.569> matter<00:03:58.720> so

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
one in I don't know doesn't matter so

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.390 
one in I don't know doesn't matter so
now<00:03:59.470> what<00:03:59.590> you<00:03:59.680> can<00:03:59.799> do<00:03:59.889> is<00:04:00.010> you<00:04:00.099> can<00:04:00.130> dig<00:04:00.370> down

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
now what you can do is you can dig down

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.370 
now what you can do is you can dig down
a<00:04:00.579> whole<00:04:00.790> bunch<00:04:01.030> let's<00:04:01.630> just<00:04:01.840> dig<00:04:01.989> down<00:04:02.079> a<00:04:02.139> bit

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
a whole bunch let's just dig down a bit

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.069 
a whole bunch let's just dig down a bit
you<00:04:03.060> can<00:04:04.060> dig<00:04:04.239> down<00:04:04.269> and<00:04:04.419> make<00:04:04.630> any<00:04:04.810> kind<00:04:04.959> of

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
you can dig down and make any kind of

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.449 
you can dig down and make any kind of
death<00:04:05.260> trap<00:04:05.500> down<00:04:05.680> here<00:04:05.829> you<00:04:05.919> want<00:04:06.099> i'm<00:04:06.340> going

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
death trap down here you want i'm going

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.970 
death trap down here you want i'm going
to<00:04:06.519> show<00:04:06.609> you<00:04:06.639> one<00:04:06.819> example<00:04:07.560> basic<00:04:08.560> death<00:04:08.709> trap

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
to show you one example basic death trap

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.470 
to show you one example basic death trap
doesn't<00:04:09.310> Park<00:04:09.459> 100<00:04:09.790> ton<00:04:09.910> of<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.060> time<00:04:10.209> but

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
doesn't Park 100 ton of the time but

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.479 
doesn't Park 100 ton of the time but
most<00:04:10.870> of<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.019> time<00:04:11.139> if<00:04:11.380> not<00:04:11.829> it<00:04:12.190> just<00:04:12.220> leaves

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
most of the time if not it just leaves

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.120 
most of the time if not it just leaves
people<00:04:12.760> really<00:04:12.970> annoyed<00:04:13.150> so<00:04:13.510> now<00:04:13.680> signs<00:04:14.680> are

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
people really annoyed so now signs are

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.099 
people really annoyed so now signs are
very<00:04:15.790> useful<00:04:15.970> with<00:04:16.299> blocking<00:04:16.540> water<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:16.989> lava

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
very useful with blocking water and lava

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.520 
very useful with blocking water and lava
sand<00:04:17.290> signs<00:04:17.739> count<00:04:18.130> as<00:04:18.340> a<00:04:18.370> block

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
sand signs count as a block

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.140 
sand signs count as a block
except<00:04:20.530> people<00:04:20.710> can't<00:04:21.070> like<00:04:21.340> get<00:04:21.640> caught<00:04:21.970> on

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
except people can't like get caught on

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.910 
except people can't like get caught on
them<00:04:22.360> you<00:04:22.840> can<00:04:22.930> also<00:04:23.080> use<00:04:23.170> ladders<00:04:23.470> for<00:04:23.770> this

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
them you can also use ladders for this

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.170 
them you can also use ladders for this
but<00:04:24.070> then<00:04:24.190> sometimes<00:04:24.400> do<00:04:24.670> people<00:04:24.910> get<00:04:25.000> caught

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
but then sometimes do people get caught

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.490 
but then sometimes do people get caught
on<00:04:25.240> the<00:04:25.360> ladders<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:25.900> their<00:04:25.990> items<00:04:26.290> will<00:04:26.380> get

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
on the ladders and their items will get

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.350 
on the ladders and their items will get
incinerated<00:04:26.740> well<00:04:27.610> look<00:04:27.730> if<00:04:27.850> I<00:04:27.910> plays<00:04:28.090> lava

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
incinerated well look if I plays lava

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.950 
incinerated well look if I plays lava
above<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.900> signs<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:31.270> lava<00:04:31.480> is<00:04:31.690> just<00:04:31.750> that

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
above the signs the lava is just that

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.930 
above the signs the lava is just that
one<00:04:32.140> block<00:04:32.410> so<00:04:32.650> people<00:04:32.890> it'll<00:04:33.460> they'll<00:04:33.760> think

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
one block so people it'll they'll think

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.610 
one block so people it'll they'll think
that<00:04:34.120> they're<00:04:34.240> falling<00:04:34.480> into<00:04:34.630> lava<00:04:34.840> fall

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
that they're falling into lava fall

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.200 
that they're falling into lava fall
right<00:04:35.890> through<00:04:35.920> the<00:04:36.220> lava<00:04:36.430> and<00:04:36.760> then<00:04:37.000> land

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
right through the lava and then land

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.150 
right through the lava and then land
down<00:04:37.420> here<00:04:37.690> and<00:04:38.260> now<00:04:38.410> we<00:04:38.470> can<00:04:38.650> dig<00:04:38.800> this<00:04:38.890> even

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
down here and now we can dig this even

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.780 
down here and now we can dig this even
bit<00:04:39.340> more<00:04:39.520> down<00:04:40.140> so<00:04:41.140> then<00:04:41.320> if<00:04:41.860> they<00:04:42.100> don't<00:04:42.640> die

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
bit more down so then if they don't die

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.640 
bit more down so then if they don't die
from<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:43.060> fall<00:04:43.270> damage<00:04:43.630> they<00:04:44.080> are<00:04:44.230> also<00:04:44.410> on

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
from the fall damage they are also on

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.830 
from the fall damage they are also on
fire<00:04:44.860> so<00:04:45.670> good<00:04:46.060> luck<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:46.390> them<00:04:46.510> and<00:04:46.690> then<00:04:46.780> you

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
fire so good luck to them and then you

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.000 
fire so good luck to them and then you
can<00:04:46.960> make<00:04:47.020> your<00:04:47.110> little<00:04:47.290> hallway<00:04:47.560> with<00:04:47.860> your

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
can make your little hallway with your

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.220 
can make your little hallway with your
whole<00:04:48.310> other<00:04:48.610> death<00:04:49.000> trap<00:04:49.300> or<00:04:49.480> item<00:04:49.810> collector

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
whole other death trap or item collector

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.960 
whole other death trap or item collector
or<00:04:50.350> something<00:04:50.680> here<00:04:50.890> leading<00:04:51.640> straight<00:04:51.910> to

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
or something here leading straight to

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.490 
or something here leading straight to
your<00:04:52.180> base<00:04:52.300> just<00:04:52.540> depositing<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.140> items<00:04:53.410> in

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
your base just depositing the items in

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.350 
your base just depositing the items in
your<00:04:53.560> face<00:04:54.570> so<00:04:55.570> yeah<00:04:55.990> anyway<00:04:56.790> that's<00:04:57.790> just<00:04:57.940> one

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
your face so yeah anyway that's just one
