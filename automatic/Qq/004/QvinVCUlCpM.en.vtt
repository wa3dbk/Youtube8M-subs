00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
this industry and now I think the time

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.649 
this industry and now I think the time
is<00:01:15.540> right<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:16.170> UM<00:01:16.549> to<00:01:17.549> take<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> risk<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.360> step

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
is right to UM to take the risk and step

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.660 
is right to UM to take the risk and step
out<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.990> my<00:01:19.200> own<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.650> create<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> line<00:01:20.520> of

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
out on my own and create a line of

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.300 
out on my own and create a line of
products<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.420> what<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> think<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.770> racer<00:01:23.159> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
products for what I think the racer and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.999 
products for what I think the racer and
the<00:01:23.400> consumer<00:01:23.939> will<00:01:24.090> want<00:01:24.360> today<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.830> this

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the consumer will want today and so this

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.520 
the consumer will want today and so this
is<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.340> expression<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.180> idea<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.350> that's

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
is the expression of that idea so that's

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.410 
is the expression of that idea so that's
got<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.130> be<00:01:29.220> neat<00:01:29.430> though<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.030> still<00:01:30.210> race
