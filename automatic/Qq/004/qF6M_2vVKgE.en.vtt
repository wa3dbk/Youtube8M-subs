00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hey here is the lars again 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.380
 usually I am at all aboard 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.540
 together they look on the way but today 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.000
 I consider the samsung for one to one 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.400
 galaxy s 6 plus and you can do that 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.630
 exactly what it is with this device on itself 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.860
 I have that in another gentleman 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.509
 detailed hands on video already 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.970
 The result is simply one 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.640
 great version of the samsung galaxy s 6 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.810
 However, Samsung has in the software 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.119
 then a few small things 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.369
 changed and in the camera I find that 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.320
 particularly noticeable the camera 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.820
 Both devices have 16 megapixels and one 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.230
 open end of f 19 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.840
 but if I have the camera now 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.550
 open then looks yes in the modes already 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.809
 times difference here are namely one 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.110
 Of course you also have more 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.000
 space 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.500
 otherwise is in the fundamental 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.420
 chamber surface so much not at all 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.410
 it's just different on the top left 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.170
 May I go to the 16 9 picture at the galaxy s 6 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.910
 plus in addition, otherwise sees first 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.340
 I'll go out the same but when I'm in the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.079
 mode einhe and the promoter both 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.100
 equipment then you actually see 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.109
 differences 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.449
 first is just darker that is 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.340
 because of course with very short light 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.470
 the sensor falls that could make 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.060
 For example, we're on something more 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.159
 I just wanted to shoot that much 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.320
 But light is usually too much 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.640
 in short what we can do is over here 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.840
 they actually feel the whole thing 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.580
 settle and then you can go there 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.350
 actually up to ten 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.840
 Seconds it goes there is the whole here 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.000
 totally overexposed calls are such 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.570
 Opportunities important if you are 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.610
 for example, a night's sleep and a 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.380
 city ​​photographs the traces of light 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.479
 make for example of highway or something 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.950
 or photograph waterfalls with it 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.329
 These are very cool effects 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.920
 In order to be possible one must be one 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.090
 know a bit about it but then you can 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.340
 you really nice things with it 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.840
 take pictures and what is important 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.159
 if I'm on iso clique it is now 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.759
 the photosensitivity imagine the 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.079
 times down to 100 places the countries 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.720
 or the shutter time again 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.310
 down to an eighth of a second like that and 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.329
 then you see it's still a bit 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.890
 and so you can see 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.360
 because I can do this very well 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.470
 Exhibit for comparison I have 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.210
 the iso and the knowledge about this 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.630
 Finally, adjust the slider 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.100
 at samsung galaxy s 6 as plus there can 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.570
 I actually over here 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.430
 these arrow keys are even more accurate 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.110
 stop and that we are 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.879
 actually synonymous photo effects 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.509
 possible if you know it 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.489
 Can you really great thing with 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.349
 but I say that directly to her 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.620
 should actually such a small tripod 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:20.319
 for the samsung galaxy s plus have because 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.900
 as a shutter speed over a well 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.900
 thirties maybe a twentieth 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.819
 that will be difficult with soko long 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.220
 closing times so just when they are in 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.349
 direction is second or if it is 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.569
 Never create direction for ten seconds 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.200
 as long as completely without vibration 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.400
 to hold 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.690
 that means the pictures will not be 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.840
 completely creates there are actually 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.489
 then tripods much more practical too 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.109
 another very interesting thing in the 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.609
 the camera finds the video 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.930
 stabilization well you have 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.709
 Actually here with the Samsung Galaxy 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.750
 s 6 finds samsung galaxy s 6 plus 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.379
 her the same point but samsung says 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.239
 that she is an improved vds so 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.700
 an improved video digital image 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.200
 stabilization that's the saying that is 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.090
 Of course, that's important too 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.280
 digital fashion is such a picture 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.780
 gets a little quieter when you do that 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.760
 then you will see the whole 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.450
 a lot of camera trips do not wobble 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.129
 so back and forth 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.019
 Of course, that's important 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.910
 Of course, in addition to the optical 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.620
 image stabilization you have anyway 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.750
 that means in the end yes in front of the camera 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.829
 so small movable lenses that can 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.930
 a little tremble and so far 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.239
 You have to compensate for that too 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.980
 Digital stabilize if the pictures 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.109
 and videos made that are very quiet 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.970
 and at the end of the day also very sharp what you 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.660
 here is on as is raw file 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.500
 to save 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.819
 what does that mean are so called raw data 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.620
 that means the pictures just become 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.480
 in raw data format just like the 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.639
 processor spits out the image processor 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.049
 saved and you can then inside 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.930
 works professionally photo applications for 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.519
 for example photoshop or there are quite 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.510
 You can apply many of them very much 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.430
 edit exactly 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.780
 otherwise the whole thing as jpeg 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.190
 saved that is already one 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.109
 bit more compressed so it does not work that way 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.389
 big of raw data are seller relative 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.250
 great that so ne cool way the 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.480
 it will be at samsung galaxy s edge 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.139
 but also sometime by a 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.359
 update 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.760
 but I also find the sfc plus whole 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.680
 cool possibility the one there has that is 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.690
 In any case so first what you in the 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.280
 but you have mode in this one 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.349
 surface to discover something new 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.419
 who would like to search briefly as a search picture I 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.010
 Here's a quick look at the mode 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.760
 Here are a few new things video 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.139
 collage I do not find so exciting 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.699
 and otherwise you see a lot here 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.880
 similar things but one point is 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.410
 namely live broadcast what does that mean? 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.360
 and there is quite interesting there 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.130
 currently to separate if you are there 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.290
 little knowledge of apps periscope 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.030
 Merck has apps that can handle those 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.710
 you live any video content 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.350
 stream and then quickly that all 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.479
 Send friends and samsung 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.520
 together with google here youtube right now 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.000
 live broadcast with the camera app 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.560
 built-in 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.330
 that means if I'm on it now 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.680
 Now for the first time a car needs it 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.050
 again everything looks then I go 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.400
 now on live broadcast then will be one 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.150
 videostream I have to go before 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.979
 agree 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.660
 yes it it's here so a 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:01.000
 I made this video here 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.950
 confirm briefly and then you see here 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.450
 I have a live broadcast here 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.340
 I can actually start right away or 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.930
 I now press on it then I could 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.880
 invite now and then it is 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.490
 process will start in the top right corner 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.960
 The corner is powered by you tube and 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.810
 Now I'm running this video now 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.250
 live on the channel and i can do that 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.660
 now send to friends who can 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.340
 watch it and in the end I can 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.240
 just stop and then this will 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.380
 videos are stored on youtube and me 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.060
 can then send it again 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.680
 If I want to find so very cool 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.530
 number because it's live streaming 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.090
 really see integrated into the camera 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.610
 her here i can invite a people 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.650
 and that just be so easy to the people 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.150
 cool i'm maybe here somewhere 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.190
 on a cool event did not even want 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.289
 I can watch it live, then I can 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.910
 the stream and then directly on 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.110
 Save youtube for faster 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.370
 maybe later you can look again 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.990
 maybe a very good possibility 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.419
 and I think that there are apps too 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.400
 notes correctly or periscope competition 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.340
 announced by youtube that was 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.300
 So a closer look at the 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.419
 Settings in the camera of the samsung 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.700
 galaxy s 6 e-plus you see samsung has 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:04.389
 He actually has a few more features 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.490
 added 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:08.650
 you can in pro mode now synonymous 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.419
 manually adjust your ballast speed 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.130
 can live broadcast a very good one 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.599
 possibility you can do a video collage 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.800
 then you can ask about many 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:16.360
 different videos hang side by side 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.680
 and in different sections 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.510
 I do not find it that exciting, though 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.789
 there is something else to it 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.710
 come the camera app the samsung 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:25.300
 Of course, galaxy s edge will not work 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.680
 worse by that but here you have 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.280
 again a few small functions 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.710
 additionally 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.200
 I hope this detailed look 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.900
 the camera app of the samsung galaxy s 6 e 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.580
 plus you liked 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.259
 if you ask about it in the
