00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.680
 do not 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.570
 very good these white to see in the 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.020
 today's lobby we will be doing the 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.180
 pc gamer of 8 thousand mexican pesos 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.660
 continuing with the low and medium ranges 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.910
 this would already be a more average than low and 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.070
 well we ran pretty curita games 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.379
 let's see what that is like 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.600
 increasing the dollar in Mexico also 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.000
 it is quite expensive to the spare parts 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.830
 for pc all parts for pc 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.330
 they start to get more expensive here in Mexico 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.699
 if the dollar goes up 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.830
 so if you win in dollars then it 's 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.410
 even better for you because it's going to come out 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.940
 and it's even cheaper 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.940
 let's start 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.570
 to emails like the likud plains between 56 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.320
 and 60 fps up to 1080 the value of ohl in 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.870
 medium at 30 fps is 1080p 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.210
 the minecraft in default settings at 60 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.890
 fps in 1080p 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.750
 of graphics card will be showing the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.150
 its enclosure radius 150 x 2 gb gddr5 and 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.570
 it has pci express dvi ports and 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.810
 displayport and hdmi i say that the hdmi 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.369
 is pretty good they say they will put a 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.520
 update for that graphics card 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.850
 for the 4k I'm not very sure but they are 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.800
 two gigabytes of memory for graphics and 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.210
 the truth is going to go pretty well this 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.759
 graphics card now my second option 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.800
 of graphic card for my pc gamer well 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.850
 we spent the next of 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.670
 processor we will be using the mdf x 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.229
 6.316 cores to 3.8 and good jets this 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.340
 processor is pretty good because 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.119
 has 14 mb of cache and also that m3 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.710
 a port well better than the fm 2 no 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.229
 then this processor offers us 6 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.940
 cores 6 corts that good was my first 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.640
 processor option later had the 8 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.240
 thousand 320 x 8 cores that is a bit more 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.820
 cheap and it is 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.860
 a chulada have several nuclei the 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.450
 mother card is demonstrating the asus m 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.060
 5 to 7 8 l that has two usb 3.0 is that 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:23.000
 m3 obviously four suns for memories 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:25.550
 ddr3 6 for sata and 10 usb 2.0 good this 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.310
 mother card will be simple it will be cheap 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.160
 but it offers us what we want it to be 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.900
 we can connect our card 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.480
 video and the six-core processor 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.060
 without any problem besides connecting you 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.370
 several usb memories without it happening 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.110
 no type of bottleneck between 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.540
 the motherboard the processor and the 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.440
 video card so we went through the 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.840
 following 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.370
 of ram we have the kingston hyper 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.350
 ex was 1600 megahertz ddr3 this 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.710
 memory I have it but in a version of 8 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.200
 gigas is who put about 400 more 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.030
 that costs the 8 gigabytes 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.150
 I totally recommend this memory is 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.000
 excellent I have an 8 gigabyte already 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.790
 I plan to put another one of another 8 gigabytes 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.970
 so that they are already 16 but these 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.120
 kingston hyperx get hot and but 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.159
 has a very good sink 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.650
 the hard disk we are tracing the western 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.930
 digital 500 gb which is a medium CTERA 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.900
 sata2 that will not be the best technology 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.620
 but for the price we can not ask for more 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.750
 is 7200 revolutions per minute that 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.239
 it's going to go pretty fast it's not going to take 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.790
 in reading our files but yes 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.560
 I always recommend putting a disk 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.090
 solid nothing else for the system 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.790
 operative that I think is going to be one of 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.680
 my purchases and also the processor 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.459
 also buy a cooling 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.870
 good liquid 640 pesos for this record 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.519
 hard is pretty good so 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.950
 the source of power that they will be 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:02.030
 using will be the cross air building series 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.760
 cx 430 that I currently have 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.310
 works pretty well has the cables 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.440
 covered like fabric this and the 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.170
 electricity that provides us this is 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.049
 continuous there are no casualties or rises even 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.389
 it serves as a regulator in case of 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:21.019
 that there is a damper, nothing happens to your 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:23.270
 computer passes the power source 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.790
 scuffle but your compu keeps 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.729
 totally safe so I would 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.699
 Cabinet totally recommend going 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:35.150
 showing the cooler closer 280 usb 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:36.740
 3.0 these cabinets are recognized by 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.720
 Its good ventilation has several 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.270
 vent entries that is a 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.880
 lateral one frontal one rear and in 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.490
 some versions comes one from above 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.780
 this would have to check that when the 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.690
 buy if they come with the version that 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.990
 comes up good this has a usb 3.0 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.919
 in the front and a usb 2.0 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.690
 in addition to the 3.5 mm jacks 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.620
 so this would be our cabinet 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.860
 I hope 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.900
 liked the pc gamer I do not know if you have 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.270
 liked with that that increases the dollar 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.639
 it becomes even more difficult to make the pc 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.590
 gamers and I hope they subscribe if not 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.630
 subscribed to my channel leave your 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.000
 comment that I would change it in that it does not 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.550
 would change or if they liked the build well 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.340
 that they leave their like if it has 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.830
 liked or a dislike if you really do not 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.870
 he liked so that they can improve in 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.729
 this I say goodbye to his son the guava and 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.910
 see you until next time 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.910
 bye 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:35.089
 we love
