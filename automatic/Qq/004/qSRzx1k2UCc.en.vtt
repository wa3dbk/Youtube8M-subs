00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
experience of how Medal of Honor games

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
experience of how Medal of Honor games
tend<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.289> play

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800

so<00:00:47.430> first<00:00:47.640> up<00:00:47.760> what's<00:00:47.969> my<00:00:48.180> general<00:00:48.719> impression

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
so first up what's my general impression

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.819 
so first up what's my general impression
of<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.320> game

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
of the game

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.010 
of the game
many<00:00:50.489> people<00:00:50.789> are<00:00:50.969> describing<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.600> as<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> mix

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
many people are describing it as a mix

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.410 
many people are describing it as a mix
of<00:00:52.199> Call<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.500> Duty<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.100> Battlefield<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.940> think

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
of Call of Duty and Battlefield I think

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.510 
of Call of Duty and Battlefield I think
it<00:00:54.539> feels<00:00:54.809> very<00:00:55.020> much<00:00:55.320> like<00:00:55.379> homefront<00:00:56.399> which

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
it feels very much like homefront which

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.000 
it feels very much like homefront which
was<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> small<00:00:57.300> game<00:00:57.629> launched<00:00:58.260> last<00:00:58.440> year<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
was a small game launched last year and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.490 
was a small game launched last year and
I<00:00:59.850> enjoyed<00:01:00.149> playing<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.570> for<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.809> short<00:01:01.079> short

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
I enjoyed playing it for a short short

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.950 
I enjoyed playing it for a short short
while<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.460> did<00:01:02.850> quite<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.180> good<00:01:03.239> little<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
while and I did quite a good little a

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.200 
while and I did quite a good little a
little<00:01:04.199> fan<00:01:04.379> club<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:05.489> movement<00:01:05.909> weapon

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
little fan club the movement weapon

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.450 
little fan club the movement weapon
feeling<00:01:06.630> time<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.260> kill<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.770> even<00:01:07.950> dance<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
feeling time to kill and even dance the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.760 
feeling time to kill and even dance the
font<00:01:08.820> choice<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.659> on-screen<00:01:10.229> messages

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
font choice in the on-screen messages

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.010 
font choice in the on-screen messages
all<00:01:10.920> feel<00:01:11.220> almost<00:01:11.549> identical<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.479> homefront

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
all feel almost identical to homefront

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.050 
all feel almost identical to homefront
so<00:01:13.590> if<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.890> did<00:01:14.040> play<00:01:14.189> homefront<00:01:14.670> last<00:01:14.850> year

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
so if you did play homefront last year

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.399 
so if you did play homefront last year
or<00:01:15.360> was<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.689> year<00:01:15.780> before<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.110> can't<00:01:16.320> really

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
or was it the year before I can't really

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.960 
or was it the year before I can't really
remember<00:01:16.560> when<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.920> was<00:01:17.009> released<00:01:17.159> then

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
remember when it was released then

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.580 
remember when it was released then
that's<00:01:18.210> definitely<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.720> best<00:01:18.930> way<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.200> can

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
that's definitely the best way I can

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.649 
that's definitely the best way I can
describe<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.880> Medal<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.330> Honor<00:01:21.479> Warfighter

just<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.590> take<00:04:58.800> place<00:04:59.039> of<00:04:59.099> the<00:04:59.400> flop<00:04:59.639> which<00:04:59.880> was

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
just to take place of the flop which was

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.540 
just to take place of the flop which was
modern<00:05:00.449> warfare<00:05:00.630> 3<00:05:00.810> with<00:05:01.680> black<00:05:01.860> ops<00:05:02.009> 2<00:05:02.250> jus

modern warfare 3 with black ops 2 jus
it's<00:05:02.789> not<00:05:02.970> really<00:05:03.180> worth<00:05:03.360> buying<00:05:03.750> in<00:05:04.050> my

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
it's not really worth buying in my

depending if black ops 2 flops it might

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.159 
depending if black ops 2 flops it might
be<00:05:08.520> worth<00:05:08.669> picking<00:05:08.909> up<00:05:09.120> after<00:05:09.419> Christmas<00:05:09.930> I
