00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
done one for a while so this design was

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.150 
done one for a while so this design was
actually<00:00:24.150> done<00:00:24.509> on<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> pair<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.110> nike<00:00:25.500> high-top

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
actually done on a pair of nike high-top

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.220 
actually done on a pair of nike high-top
backboards<00:00:26.759> and<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.540> design<00:00:27.810> itself<00:00:27.930> is

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
backboards and the design itself is

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.499 
backboards and the design itself is
actually<00:00:28.320> from<00:00:28.860> point<00:00:29.220> book<00:00:29.430> called<00:00:29.880> turf

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
so the design itself took about thirty

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.060 
so the design itself took about thirty

probably heard of some of them so we

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.939 
probably heard of some of them so we
started<00:01:03.690> off<00:01:03.839> by<00:01:04.050> just<00:01:04.110> putting<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.620> rendering

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
started off by just putting a rendering

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.420 
started off by just putting a rendering
together<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.730> Photoshop<00:01:06.690> using<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
together in Photoshop using one of the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.380 
together in Photoshop using one of the
cover<00:01:09.240> arts<00:01:09.720> from<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.260> coin<00:01:10.950> book<00:01:11.130> itself<00:01:11.490> put

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
cover arts from the coin book itself put

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.420 
cover arts from the coin book itself put
that<00:01:12.540> together<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.140> then<00:01:13.320> actually<00:01:13.980> pencil

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
that together and then actually pencil

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.359 
that together and then actually pencil
down<00:01:14.580> onto<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.030> shoe<00:01:15.390> design<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.740> then<00:01:17.250> we

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
down onto the shoe design and then we

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:29.389 
down onto the shoe design and then we
just<00:01:17.520> went<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.790> working<00:01:18.210> tada

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.410 

so<00:01:30.399> these<00:01:30.549> are<00:01:30.609> actually<00:01:31.060> done<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.240> couple

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
so these are actually done a couple

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.569 
so these are actually done a couple
years<00:01:31.719> ago<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.350> when<00:01:32.859> they<00:01:33.039> we<00:01:33.369> actually

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
years ago and when they we actually

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.730 
years ago and when they we actually
