00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
were closed for Easter so that is why it

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.119 
were closed for Easter so that is why it
took<00:02:08.340> maybe<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.970> little<00:02:09.149> more<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:10.379> let's<00:02:10.950> say

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.300 
took maybe a little more like let's say
at<00:02:11.370> 10<00:02:11.610> days<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.360> would<00:02:12.540> have<00:02:12.660> taken

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
at 10 days but it would have taken

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.059 
at 10 days but it would have taken
less<00:02:13.760> than<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.260> my<00:02:15.410> nest<00:02:15.830> and

self<00:03:28.010> Nuttall<00:03:28.459> was<00:03:28.700> broken<00:03:29.269> she<00:03:29.720> sent<00:03:30.019> the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
self Nuttall was broken she sent the

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.370 
self Nuttall was broken she sent the
package<00:03:30.650> in<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.100> box<00:03:31.459> so<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.540> wasn't<00:03:32.959> set<00:03:33.170> in

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
package in the box so it wasn't set in

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.920 
package in the box so it wasn't set in
the<00:03:33.590> regular<00:03:34.130> envelope<00:03:34.730> or<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:35.269> so<00:03:35.510> everything

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
the regular envelope or so so everything

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.780 
the regular envelope or so so everything
came<00:03:36.470> really<00:03:37.160> nice<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:39.160> let<00:03:40.160> me<00:03:40.310> just<00:03:40.549> open

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
came really nice so let me just open

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.220 
came really nice so let me just open
this<00:03:41.440> one<00:03:42.440> here<00:03:42.920> I<00:03:43.130> didn't<00:03:43.579> take<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.329> stick<00:03:45.079> her

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
this one here I didn't take to stick her

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.509 
this one here I didn't take to stick her
out<00:03:45.440> so<00:03:46.040> this<00:03:46.310> is<00:03:46.370> how<00:03:46.819> it<00:03:47.389> it<00:03:47.900> does<00:03:48.200> look<00:03:48.590> at<00:03:49.280> me

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
out so this is how it it does look at me

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.319 
out so this is how it it does look at me
just<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:50.269> little<00:03:50.769> okay<00:03:51.769> and<00:03:52.280> you<00:03:52.579> have<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:53.060> 12

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
just a little okay and you have the 12

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.610 
just a little okay and you have the 12
sides<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:53.989> you<00:03:54.170> have<00:03:54.410> really<00:03:54.739> big<00:03:55.579> size<00:03:55.970> of

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
sides and you have really big size of

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.190 
sides and you have really big size of
thumbnails<00:03:57.760> because<00:03:58.760> these<00:03:59.299> are<00:03:59.630> for

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
thumbnails because these are for

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.379 
thumbnails because these are for
toenails<00:04:00.859> you<00:04:01.100> can<00:04:01.340> you<00:04:01.639> can<00:04:01.850> use<00:04:02.090> them<00:04:02.359> for

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
toenails you can you can use them for

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:07.449 
toenails you can you can use them for
toenails<00:04:03.139> and<00:04:03.319> if<00:04:04.040> we<00:04:04.370> look<00:04:04.569> closely<00:04:06.459> like

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
toenails and if we look closely like

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.930 
toenails and if we look closely like
this<00:04:07.760> is<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.209> one<00:04:08.420> but<00:04:09.019> from<00:04:09.380> China<00:04:10.010> I<00:04:10.280> ordered

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
this is the one but from China I ordered

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.039 
this is the one but from China I ordered
them<00:04:11.150> in<00:04:12.250> team<00:04:13.250> art<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:13.700> you<00:04:14.359> can<00:04:14.600> see<00:04:14.810> the

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
them in team art and you can see the

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.080 
them in team art and you can see the
difference<00:04:15.530> I'm<00:04:15.739> gonna<00:04:15.980> take<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.459> size<00:04:16.729> one

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
difference I'm gonna take the size one

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.009 
difference I'm gonna take the size one
that<00:04:17.900> is<00:04:18.079> the<00:04:18.289> bigger<00:04:18.850> thumb<00:04:19.850> size<00:04:20.150> on<00:04:20.510> that

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
that is the bigger thumb size on that

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.529 
that is the bigger thumb size on that
package<00:04:21.830> so<00:04:22.099> this<00:04:22.310> is<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.700> and<00:04:22.909> this<00:04:23.270> is<00:04:23.510> the

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
package so this is it and this is the

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.430 
package so this is it and this is the
big<00:04:24.020> one

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
big one

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.710 
big one
from<00:04:25.730> mineral<00:04:26.730> nails<00:04:28.760> so<00:04:29.760> you<00:04:29.820> can<00:04:30.120> really<00:04:30.480> see

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
from mineral nails so you can really see

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.200 
from mineral nails so you can really see
the<00:04:30.870> difference<00:04:31.260> and<00:04:31.410> for<00:04:31.860> me<00:04:32.070> I<00:04:32.280> did<00:04:32.700> start

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
the difference and for me I did start

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.820 
the difference and for me I did start
with<00:04:33.510> number<00:04:34.500> three<00:04:34.920> here<00:04:35.450> for<00:04:36.450> my<00:04:36.660> tums<00:04:36.990> so

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
with number three here for my tums so

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.290 
with number three here for my tums so
you<00:04:38.400> can<00:04:38.670> maybe<00:04:39.390> it<00:04:39.600> will<00:04:39.780> be<00:04:39.960> a<00:04:39.990> better

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
you can maybe it will be a better

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.850 
you can maybe it will be a better
compare<00:04:42.680> reservation

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
compare reservation

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.520 
compare reservation
you<00:04:44.430> this<00:04:44.880> is<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.210> teamwork<00:04:45.480> the<00:04:45.840> China<00:04:46.140> brand

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530

where where you put your design and it
works<00:06:26.520> really<00:06:27.060> good<00:06:27.630> instead<00:06:28.590> of<00:06:28.650> these<00:06:29.460> tips
