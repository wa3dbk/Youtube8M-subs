bearings<00:00:07.280> that<00:00:08.280> are<00:00:08.519> inside<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.480> long<00:00:09.780> car

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
bearings that are inside of a long car

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.289 
bearings that are inside of a long car
tires<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:11.179> wheel<00:00:12.179> barrow<00:00:12.420> tires<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:14.269> put<00:00:15.269> a

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
tires and wheel barrow tires I put a

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.439 
tires and wheel barrow tires I put a
video<00:00:15.480> out<00:00:15.660> earlier<00:00:16.170> earlier<00:00:16.710> on<00:00:17.449> these

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
video out earlier earlier on these

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.890 
video out earlier earlier on these
craftsman<00:00:19.439> bushings<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.210> how<00:00:21.210> they<00:00:21.359> fit<00:00:21.630> just

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
craftsman bushings and how they fit just

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.679 
craftsman bushings and how they fit just
about<00:00:22.260> perfect<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:22.920> these<00:00:23.070> hubs<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.330> will

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
about perfect in these hubs so I will

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.620 
about perfect in these hubs so I will
show<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:24.960> how<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.380> do<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:26.180> first<00:00:27.180> off<00:00:27.449> you'll

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
show you how to do it first off you'll

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.240 
show you how to do it first off you'll
need<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.960> get<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.260> old<00:00:28.349> bangs<00:00:28.590> out<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.220> I

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
need to get the old bangs out and I

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.849 
need to get the old bangs out and I
usually<00:00:29.640> just<00:00:29.760> use<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.970> screwdriver<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.929> a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
usually just use a screwdriver and a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.250 
usually just use a screwdriver and a
hammer<00:00:32.390> now<00:00:33.390> what<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.960> set<00:00:34.170> it

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
hammer now what you do is you set it

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.979 
hammer now what you do is you set it
over<00:00:34.410> top<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.620> something<00:00:34.980> like<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.160> vise<00:00:35.989> so

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
over top of something like a vise so

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.369 
over top of something like a vise so
that<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.440> hit<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.280> bottom<00:00:38.610> bearing<00:00:38.910> yeah

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
that you can hit the bottom bearing yeah

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.400 
that you can hit the bottom bearing yeah
so<00:00:40.379> if<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.860> send<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.190> over<00:00:41.370> top<00:00:42.110> you<00:00:43.110> should<00:00:43.290> be

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
so if I send it over top you should be

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.049 
so if I send it over top you should be
able<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:44.030> get<00:00:45.030> right<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:46.910> give<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
able to just get right on it give it a

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.240 
able to just get right on it give it a
few<00:00:48.210> wraps<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.780> pops<00:00:49.079> right<00:00:49.289> out<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.129> can

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
few wraps and pops right out as you can

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.319 
few wraps and pops right out as you can
see<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.989> so<00:00:52.340> get<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> other<00:00:53.579> one<00:00:53.699> help

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.180 

and<00:00:57.329> tada<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.710> see<00:00:58.859> if<00:00:58.949> there's<00:00:59.129> no

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
and tada as you can see if there's no

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.049 
and tada as you can see if there's no
more<00:00:59.250> bearings<00:00:59.699> here's<00:01:00.539> one<00:01:01.219> and<00:01:02.219> here's<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
more bearings here's one and here's the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.530 
more bearings here's one and here's the
other<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.610> these<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.909> tendency<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.299> wear

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
other so these have a tendency to wear

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.090 
other so these have a tendency to wear
out<00:01:06.720> they<00:01:07.140> aren't<00:01:07.290> very<00:01:07.409> good<00:01:07.799> they're

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
out they aren't very good they're

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.670 
out they aren't very good they're
cheaply<00:01:08.700> made

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
cheaply made

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.520 
cheaply made
there's<00:01:10.680> no<00:01:10.830> way<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> grease<00:01:11.280> them<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.530> water

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
there's no way to grease them and water

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.899 
there's no way to grease them and water
gets<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:13.860> when<00:01:14.070> they<00:01:14.159> rust<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.820> they

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
gets on when they rust out and they

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.679 
gets on when they rust out and they
start<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.659> slop<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.049> squeal<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:17.450> we<00:01:18.450> will<00:01:18.570> be

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
start to slop and squeal so we will be

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.630 
start to slop and squeal so we will be
replacing<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.470> these<00:01:19.950> craftsman

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
replacing it with these craftsman

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.590 
replacing it with these craftsman
bushings<00:01:21.030> muster<00:01:21.720> what<00:01:21.900> material<00:01:22.320> these<00:01:22.439> are

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
bushings muster what material these are

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.870 
bushings muster what material these are
but<00:01:24.600> these<00:01:25.200> are<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.439> lot<00:01:25.560> heavier<00:01:25.830> duty<00:01:26.340> than

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
but these are a lot heavier duty than

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.840 
but these are a lot heavier duty than
these<00:01:27.119> stupid<00:01:27.570> little<00:01:27.689> bushings<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.759> to<00:01:29.759> get

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
these stupid little bushings so to get

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.870 
these stupid little bushings so to get
these<00:01:30.060> end<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.720> pretty<00:01:30.900> easy<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.640> need<00:01:32.820> to

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
these end it's pretty easy and I need to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.810 
these end it's pretty easy and I need to
take<00:01:33.030> my<00:01:33.180> clothes<00:01:33.360> off<00:01:34.189> but<00:01:35.189> what<00:01:35.369> you'll<00:01:35.549> need

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
take my clothes off but what you'll need

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.890 
take my clothes off but what you'll need
is<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.900> grease<00:01:37.710> gun<00:01:37.740> or<00:01:38.430> some<00:01:38.759> oil<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.720> I'm<00:01:39.780> like

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
is a grease gun or some oil so I'm like

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.530 
is a grease gun or some oil so I'm like
that<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.320> use<00:01:40.439> grease<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.299> you<00:01:42.299> will<00:01:42.390> need

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
that I just use grease and you will need

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.330 
that I just use grease and you will need
to<00:01:42.600> squirt<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> little<00:01:43.649> bit<00:01:43.740> out<00:01:45.049> like<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.340> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
to squirt a little bit out like so and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.760 
to squirt a little bit out like so and
take<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.030> rub<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.360> right<00:01:49.259> around<00:01:49.439> where

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
take it and rub it right around where

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.319 
take it and rub it right around where
you're<00:01:49.860> gonna<00:01:49.950> punch<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.490> new<00:01:50.810> bushing<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:53.329> if

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
you're gonna punch the new bushing in if

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.010 
you're gonna punch the new bushing in if
you<00:01:54.420> have<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> cut

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
you have a cut

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.440 
you have a cut
don't<00:01:55.290> put<00:01:55.439> grease<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.770> your<00:01:55.890> finger<00:01:56.450> because

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
don't put grease on your finger because

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.130 
don't put grease on your finger because
it's<00:01:57.600> not<00:01:58.079> good<00:01:58.640> but<00:01:59.719> you<00:02:00.719> want<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.899> lube<00:02:01.110> that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
it's not good but you want to lube that

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.450 
it's not good but you want to lube that
up<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.549> cannot<00:02:02.840> get<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.829> bushing<00:02:05.369> in

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
up so that you cannot get the bushing in

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.580 
up so that you cannot get the bushing in
easier<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.899> take<00:02:07.079> your<00:02:07.110> bushing

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
easier so you take your bushing

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:16.619 
easier so you take your bushing
sit<00:02:08.979> on<00:02:09.190> there<00:02:09.869> take<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.019> hammer<00:02:11.200> again<00:02:15.629> and

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
sit on there take the hammer again and

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:21.290 
sit on there take the hammer again and
just<00:02:16.840> like<00:02:17.019> that<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.810> will<00:02:20.110> do<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.410> other

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
just like that so I will do the other

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:29.430
