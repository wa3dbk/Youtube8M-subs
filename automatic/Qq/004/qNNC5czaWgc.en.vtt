00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.770
 spread about what these series I think 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.660
 that you quite know I just rather 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.300
 just gonna show so not 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.700
 stretch this video with to infinity 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.770
 well, let's start with the trilogy laine 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.550
 taylor daughter of smoke and bones i read 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.219
 the first book unfortunately just for now 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.590
 and I just read at school time therefore 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.719
 there was generally no additional 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.330
 free temporarily remaining books 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.189
 so it is powerful so I have 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.549
 unread next series this is not 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.409
 it turns out also the trilogy about don diana 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.290
 winn jones i read only walking 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.210
 the castle and at that time I just donâ€™t know 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.810
 that there are two more fucks 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.570
 books and I probably got it wrong 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.159
 long and plan soon all 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.110
 did get acquainted with them because you yourself 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.630
 understand fairy tales can not be read quickly 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.799
 also i have it still very cool i 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:38.659
 healthy King Arthur book series 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:42.119
 Terence White's books look like this 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.659
 Of course, the epic design is very simple 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.850
 beautiful and huge books probably 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.009
 the volume of me principle and scares but 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.360
 I hope that with the advent of free 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.880
 time all the same I get to these 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.720
 stories also want to master the trilogy 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.500
 cassandra claire 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.950
 hellish mechanisms that mister were 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.820
 healthy not convenient to show here and here 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.950
 that's whatever 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.780

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.220
 look at this atom why are you 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.800

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.990
 read a series of cassandra 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.860
 Claire I will only show you 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.050
 first three 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.990
 in this series and is very much a lot of them do not 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.780
 heavy I have already read four books and 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.300
 after the search I plan to proceed to 5 and 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.980
 with his recent desire to plunge into 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.580
 modern in general 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.890
 I read our literature hours 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.200
 Natalia Scherba only the first book 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.870
 and I was told that with each subsequent 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.209
 book narration improves plot 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.150
 it becomes more interesting than heroes and not 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.489
 overall I probably decided to continue 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.020
 acquaintance persuaded me but will show 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.480

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.340
 bought the rest and still can 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.550
 say thank you foreign tug

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.459
 two books going to buy a third 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.519
 so that in general there were books on hand 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.040
 and did not have to wait for the cover by the way 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.350

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.739
 him to proceed 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.239
 dream dreams also cost me four books 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:27.280

 I save and save and save 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.970
 we are talking about comics 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.100
 I'll call right away the saga that I also want 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.260
 read but these three books I read I 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.480
 just waiting for the next one, that is, I 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.630
 I can not call the series completed because 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.680
 that there are no books in my series 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.720

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.769
 read this series because dreamed 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.010
 read a long time ago bought the first book 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.049
 also a long time but it did not go further 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.760
 General FIG knows what I do not know 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.520
 tour, I doubt that the book children's tule 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.889
 I still have some prejudices there 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.570
 I know the next series I started too 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.750
 slowly read more accurately read the first 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.360
 the book is the story of sally lockhart philip 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.960
 Pulman I read my God and my God 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.889
 the first book is a ruby in the dark 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.500
 small on with so big in general 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:47.070
 there are three books left 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.639
 state show time i am master show 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.520
 cover 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:53.250
 I also plan to finish the acquaintance with 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.160
 randy us rigs i read the first part 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.979
 in the house of strange children and bought a second 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.660
 the city is empty but put on the shelf is not 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.680
 I know as after the forgiveness of the first book 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.050
 I did not have this one 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.930
 an overwhelming desire to continue in general 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.090
 books so his population is my plans yet 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:14.400
 One series is already sensationalized namely 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:18.330
 Lunar Chronicles never take it no 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.940
 The first part is in my opinion Cinderella 2 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.490
 the red cap and the third which recently 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.560
 I left it rapunzel still hope to 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.580

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.770
 wonderful rating too lovely what 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.060
 then stops asking you not 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.270
 the secret is that I started reading harry potter 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.349
 and I read three books of Syria and me 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.780
 4 more left to read 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:44.370
 aftor I hope to do it but already looking 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.340
 all that I showed you somehow 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.740
 overwhelmed with doubts but it was about 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.930
 joanne roling will show one more three books 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.900

 it's our detectives not for when to them 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.669
 I hope that I will get on 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.800
 my sore spot did not read it 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.849
 stuck together rings I bought the first part and 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.950
 put it on the shelf so I purchased 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:10.380
 hitchhiker's book on the galaxy and also 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.860
 successful and put on the shelf to others 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.310
 draw on us books well done ira 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.120
 praise yourself 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:20.880
 but no less my desire to read 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:25.470
 here I am not weakened at all per gram 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:28.080
 overwhelmingly glad but why then its not 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.360
 I read and on this my few minutes 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.030
 shame kind of ended up with me 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.230
 it seemed that I pulled out all the series 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.510
 which I had at least 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:39.210
 there may be some 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.850
 books in the old apartment in the parent 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.620
 home 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:46.680
 it is quite likely that the series on 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.410
 really say more maybe you 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.450
 read something from the series that you 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.030
 advised god of motivate me 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.710
 read to take them or I'm afraid 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:59.390
 that they will stand by me on 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:01.770
 shelves and callus my eyes not 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:04.380
 make my conscience wicked 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:07.200
 small lump because how many already 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.390
