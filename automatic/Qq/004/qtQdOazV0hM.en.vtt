00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
the gauge does light up you've got to be

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.819 
the gauge does light up you've got to be
a<00:00:48.149> juicer<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.510> have<00:00:48.690> an<00:00:48.809> amp<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.170> gauge<00:00:49.440> tells

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
a juicer you have an amp is gauge tells

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.020 
a juicer you have an amp is gauge tells
you<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.960> power<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.500> battery<00:00:52.969> how<00:00:53.969> much

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
you the power of the battery how much

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.580 
you the power of the battery how much
power<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.480> being<00:00:54.510> used<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:55.050> goes<00:00:55.230> into<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
power is being used this goes into the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.680 
power is being used this goes into the
red<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.890> Eagle<00:00:56.129> quicker<00:00:56.430> then<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.300> got<00:00:57.480> this

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
red is Eagle quicker then you got this

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.569 
red is Eagle quicker then you got this
little<00:00:57.930> battery<00:00:58.590> power<00:00:58.949> gauge<00:00:59.280> here

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
little battery power gauge here

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.910 
little battery power gauge here
obviously<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.109> hits<00:01:01.260> low<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.559> should<00:01:01.680> be

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
obviously as it hits low you should be

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.320 
obviously as it hits low you should be
charging<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> bike<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:03.480> got<00:01:03.719> your<00:01:04.229> signal

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
charging the bike you got your signal

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.390 
charging the bike you got your signal
light<00:01:06.330> indicators<00:01:06.900> your<00:01:07.049> power<00:01:07.229> light

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
light indicators your power light

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
you got your high beam light rate right

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.080 
you got your high beam light rate right
there

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
there

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.249
