00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:13.230

 that our games across the board today 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.990
 here we are going to talk a new game that 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.939
 is being released for mobile 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.779
 first low will not be 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:29.010
 a game he brings to say so 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:33.390
 soul the peace and soul of the top go to us 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.320
 games and hours a chile 15 countries and is 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.630
 being developed by a company 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.500
 Brazilian and what's more 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.780
 amazing it will be the audio let's say 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.480
 so the soundtrack of the game will be 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.210
 developed by it for the same 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.550
 producer on the first of the first top 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.750
 gÃ­a the one that we used to 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.210
 play which is the milk bar he did it all 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.120
 a track remastered so for this 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.399
 new game and let's say like that 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.400
 say the same songs delivered 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.150
 some lines of these songs from 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.090
 botton some more current fragments right 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.390
 I'll let her go here in the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.310
 corner of the goal but some vegetables in 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.520
 some images of the game and I'm going 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.259
 pass a video where 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.299
 teaser of the game presentation 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.670
 guys, I'm asking you guys, what are you guys? 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.689
 comments below what you think of this 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.710
 idea at the beginning will be released just to 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:37.200
 initially for mobile, not for 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:42.840
 smartphones and related devices 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:46.979
 the tablet is and then are already thinking of 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.880
 do something for consoles right? 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.399
 do not have a date a date lets say base 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.680
 for the release but is a game that 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.430
 probably going to bring a lot of fans 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.030
 hence that of players like that 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:07.140
 of the old neotop day the most 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.470
 here's why 3.060 ne 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.960

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.550
 part of the production of this wine 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.489
