hard
what<00:02:13.769> we<00:02:13.950> would<00:02:14.099> recommend<00:02:14.640> probably<00:02:14.879> and

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
what we would recommend probably and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.070 
what we would recommend probably and
we'll<00:02:15.959> try<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.230> we<00:02:17.010> we<00:02:17.519> wrote<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.120> person<00:02:18.959> that

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
we'll try it we we wrote the person that

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.960 
we'll try it we we wrote the person that
makes<00:02:19.260> these<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.739> said<00:02:20.280> put<00:02:20.459> together<00:02:20.640> some

makes these and said put together some

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.270 
makes these and said put together some
samples<00:02:21.390> let<00:02:21.629> us<00:02:21.750> look<00:02:21.930> at<00:02:22.140> them<00:02:22.260> if<00:02:22.799> we<00:02:23.040> feel

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
samples let us look at them if we feel

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.490 
samples let us look at them if we feel
it<00:02:23.430> works<00:02:23.610> okay<00:02:23.970> we'll<00:02:24.269> sell<00:02:24.480> them<00:02:24.599> but<00:02:25.290> if<00:02:25.379> I'm

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
it works okay we'll sell them but if I'm

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.110 
it works okay we'll sell them but if I'm
not<00:02:25.530> satisfied<00:02:26.310> with<00:02:26.549> what<00:02:26.760> they<00:02:26.879> look<00:02:27.090> like

when<00:02:27.480> they<00:02:27.599> come<00:02:27.780> if<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.049> think<00:02:28.290> it's<00:02:28.440> going<00:02:28.680> to

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
when they come if I think it's going to

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.589 
when they come if I think it's going to
be<00:02:28.890> big<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.400> clunky<00:02:29.610> on<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:30.030> dog<00:02:30.180> we<00:02:30.390> won't

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
be big and clunky on the dog we won't

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.470 
be big and clunky on the dog we won't
sell<00:02:30.810> them<00:02:30.930> but<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.739> good<00:02:32.069> solution<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.879> good

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
sell them but a good solution a good

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.710 
sell them but a good solution a good

leads that we sell that are made from
Mendota<00:02:40.159> accomplishes<00:02:41.159> the<00:02:41.310> same<00:02:41.340> thing<00:02:43.280> the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
Mendota accomplishes the same thing the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.180 
Mendota accomplishes the same thing the
ring<00:02:44.579> on<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.540> slip<00:02:45.870> lead<00:02:46.109> is<00:02:46.530> actually

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
ring on this slip lead is actually

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.509 
ring on this slip lead is actually
smaller<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:48.260> lighter<00:02:49.260> weight<00:02:49.560> than<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.340> ring

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
smaller and lighter weight than the ring

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.729 
smaller and lighter weight than the ring
and<00:02:50.700> our<00:02:50.790> dominant<00:02:51.209> dog<00:02:51.359> collars<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.379> I<00:02:52.410> think

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
and our dominant dog collars so I think

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.430 
and our dominant dog collars so I think
you<00:02:53.069> could<00:02:53.310> use<00:02:54.260> this<00:02:56.120> British<00:02:57.120> style<00:02:57.510> slip

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
you could use this British style slip

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.690 
you could use this British style slip
lead<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:58.980> think<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.310> would<00:02:59.400> be<00:02:59.489> very

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
lead and I think it would be very

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.059 
lead and I think it would be very
effective<00:02:59.989> you<00:03:00.989> asked<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.379> question<00:03:01.409> about<00:03:01.890> a

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
effective you asked a question about a

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.640 
effective you asked a question about a
prawn<00:03:02.340> collar<00:03:02.640> if<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.720> choose<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.200> go<00:03:04.349> with<00:03:04.379> a

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
prawn collar if you choose to go with a

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.619 
prawn collar if you choose to go with a
prawn<00:03:04.920> collar<00:03:05.220> we<00:03:05.700> would<00:03:05.819> point<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.209> these

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
prawn collar we would point you to these

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.559 
prawn collar we would point you to these
mini<00:03:06.930> micro<00:03:07.440> prongs<00:03:07.769> that<00:03:07.920> we<00:03:08.190> sell<00:03:08.569> they're

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
mini micro prongs that we sell they're

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.110 
mini micro prongs that we sell they're
very<00:03:09.959> very<00:03:10.230> very<00:03:10.500> small<00:03:10.859> the<00:03:11.609> thing<00:03:11.849> to<00:03:11.970> keep

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
very very very small the thing to keep

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.119 
very very very small the thing to keep
in<00:03:12.299> mind<00:03:12.359> about<00:03:12.720> prawn<00:03:13.140> collars<00:03:13.500> though<00:03:13.739> is

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
in mind about prawn collars though is

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.379 
in mind about prawn collars though is
that<00:03:14.690> with<00:03:15.690> some<00:03:16.349> dogs<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.159> dogs<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.209> have

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
that with some dogs and dogs that have

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.740 
that with some dogs and dogs that have
dominance<00:03:18.930> issues<00:03:19.349> a<00:03:20.359> correction<00:03:21.359> from<00:03:21.630> a

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
dominance issues a correction from a

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.470 
dominance issues a correction from a
prawn<00:03:22.019> collar<00:03:22.319> can<00:03:22.590> trigger<00:03:22.950> an<00:03:23.480> aggressive

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
prawn collar can trigger an aggressive

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.629 
prawn collar can trigger an aggressive
reaction<00:03:25.079> so<00:03:25.799> you<00:03:25.829> kind<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.190> have<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.459> work

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
reaction so you kind of have to work

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.809 
reaction so you kind of have to work
around<00:03:26.819> that<00:03:27.239> and<00:03:27.419> figure<00:03:27.720> out<00:03:27.780> if<00:03:28.489> I<00:03:29.489> put<00:03:29.700> this

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
around that and figure out if I put this

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.759 
around that and figure out if I put this
prawn<00:03:30.090> Carl<00:03:30.329> on<00:03:30.480> my<00:03:30.629> dog<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.079> I<00:03:31.169> and<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.560> give<00:03:31.739> it

prawn Carl on my dog and I and I give it

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.500 
prawn Carl on my dog and I and I give it
a<00:03:31.859> correction<00:03:32.250> is<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:33.000> going<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.359> get

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
a correction is it going to get

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.740 
a correction is it going to get
aggressive<00:03:33.780> towards<00:03:34.349> me<00:03:34.500> if<00:03:34.769> it<00:03:34.919> does<00:03:35.750> you're

aggressive towards me if it does you're

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.479 
aggressive towards me if it does you're
