you know how can fleet managers balance
the<00:02:45.640> drive<00:02:46.640> for<00:02:46.850> efficiency<00:02:46.940> but<00:02:47.690> still

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
the drive for efficiency but still

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.930 
the drive for efficiency but still
putting<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.500> truck<00:02:48.980> on<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.190> road<00:02:49.250> that<00:02:49.430> drivers

putting a truck on the road that drivers

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.320 
putting a truck on the road that drivers
are<00:02:50.270> rewarded<00:02:50.840> with<00:02:50.870> and

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
are rewarded with and

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.690 
are rewarded with and
you<00:02:52.780> know<00:02:52.900> aspire<00:02:53.350> to<00:02:53.590> drive<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:54.220> might<00:02:54.460> on

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
you know aspire to drive that might on

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.790 
you know aspire to drive that might on
the<00:02:54.970> on<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.480> fuel<00:02:55.750> efficiency<00:02:56.260> side<00:02:56.470> might

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
the on the fuel efficiency side might

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.580 
the on the fuel efficiency side might
lose<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.040> little<00:02:57.310> there<00:02:57.580> right<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:58.900> I<00:02:59.200> think

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
lose a little there right so I think

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.490 
lose a little there right so I think
that<00:03:00.130> certainly<00:03:01.000> this<00:03:01.330> this<00:03:01.810> model<00:03:02.020> is<00:03:02.320> not

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
that certainly this this model is not

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.750 
that certainly this this model is not

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
going to get as as good of as good fuel

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.030 
going to get as as good of as good fuel
economy<00:03:06.970> as<00:03:07.300> our<00:03:07.450> t6<00:03:07.840> 80<00:03:08.050> model<00:03:08.440> or<00:03:08.530> t6<00:03:08.860> 80

still<00:03:14.830> gets<00:03:15.130> so<00:03:15.700> that's<00:03:15.880> pretty<00:03:16.090> good<00:03:16.240> fuel

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480

still gets so that's pretty good fuel
economy<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:17.050> you<00:03:17.560> can<00:03:17.770> get<00:03:18.010> this<00:03:18.190> with<00:03:18.370> an<00:03:18.490> AMT
