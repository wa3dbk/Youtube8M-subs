 we will heat until it boils 250 grams 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:03.080

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.289
 already we have it here in formed 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.539
 We are also going to use 350 grams of 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:14.369
 pastry flour or wheat flour 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:18.830

 we are also going to need a bit of 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.250
 orange zest and we're going to put 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.070
 a teaspoon of extract of 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.230
 tint it even more that we do not have the 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.630
 orange extract or simply with the 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.940
 zest will be enough and we will 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.979
 use to make our waltz a 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.410
 mold I have here a lovely mold of 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.510
 Nor as we will use it 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.520
 we will put sprayer of dante so that no 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.340
 come out very easily that we stay 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.229
 everything well marked to finish it what 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.479
 we can cover with what we want a 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.810
 chocolate class a sugar glaze 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.090
 with a teaspoon of milk to our 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.610
 taste but today the recipe is going to be from a 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.380
 waltz so with these ingredients 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.630
 let's start cooking 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.940
 The first thing we are going to do is put the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.940
 water to boil until it breaks to boil 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.490
 we will have it on the fire and we will pour it 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.420
 next together with our cocoa in 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.540
 powder 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.920
 the water is already boiling, turn off the 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.650
 fire 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.840
 we pour it over the cocoa and mix 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.510
 until you have no group and you 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.250
 has mixed completely stayed a 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.250
 homogeneous cream let it cool 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.300
 mixing chocolate with water and 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.280
 we have it very well mixed and we're going 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.220
 to leave here resting until it 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.500
 cool and we'll use it because 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.590
 let's make our dough with the help 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.460
 of some electric rods we put the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.640
 Butter 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:04.680
 to the sugar and we will beat until it is with 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:08.380
 a creamy texture and as if it were 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.650
 We will beat it spongy for about 78 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.650
 minutes 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.500
 We are going to sift the dry ingredients 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:23.150
 we will put the flour 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.320
 the yeast the bicarbonate and the salt and the 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.320
 sieve we will do very well 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.530
 do not 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.670
 we already have the butter mixture and 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.430
 let's lightly beat the eggs and 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.620
 we will be putting them little by little without 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.569
 stop the machine without stopping to beat already 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.640
 a speed that is not the strongest 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.840
 that we are going to add 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.459
 an egg clash 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.240
 and so on until we have it right 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.640
 mixed 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.500
 once they are well mixed 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.970
 the good thing we're going to be adding the 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.750
 flour 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.240
 that we will put it in three times 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.570
 interspersed with a little serum of 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.570
 milk 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.090
 once we have integrated the flour and the 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.680
 milk floor we will incorporate the 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.080
 orange zest that I've put on 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.030
 a teaspoon of this size of 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.660
 Orange extension by centering 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.660
 orange too 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.300
 then and finally we're going to 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.710
 incorporate the chocolate that we already have 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.050
 tempered is not cold at all is 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.569
 literally warm 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.539
 we will mix we will beat until it is 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:45.500
 mixed perfectly and we'll have 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.500
 our mass ready 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.249
 we already have the well-mixed mass already 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:53.199
 we have put the extra mollado by 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:55.779
 all the holes and all the look 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:58.080
 quote from our mold we are going to pour the 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:58.080
 dough 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.210
 we already have all the mass inside the mold 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:07.080
 and we are going to give him a tap in case 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.759
 some bubble that rises to the surface 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.969
 We also have the preheated oven 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:16.509
 180 degrees and we're going to take it to bake 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:18.669
 for 50 to 60 minutes we will check 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:21.110
 always with the stick test before 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.300
 to get it out of the oven 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.720
 I just got it out of the oven 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.180
 had exactly 47 minutes we 're going to 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.730
 allow to cool inside the mold during 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.830
 10 minutes spent 10 minutes at 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.330
 we will put on the grate removed from the 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.320
 mold and let it cool down by 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.350
 full 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.440
 our taste or ganxet as we call it 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.990
 our cake we have it ready and 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.180
 cold let's decorate it each with what 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.160
 that we like we can make a glitter 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.550
 as had been said with icing sugar and 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.250
 a few teaspoons of milk or cream or 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.530
 whipped cream I've decided to put a 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.290
 little bright coverage had me 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.720
 over cooked to prepare a previous cake and 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.460
 since nothing is wasted here 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.600
 coverage you can find in my 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.370
 sacher cake that there you have it 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.420
 and we're going to put a little bit of 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.420
 chocolate above 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:22.720
 if we will not let it fall so that the 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.720
 just go sliding to your liking 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.540
 well, we already have it 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.979
 and we're going to put some little worms 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.590
 colorful candy colors by 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:37.580
 over to give a touch of color that 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.580
 It will be very nice 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:43.599
 we have our boom ready 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.729
 Delicious of course to accompany a 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:47.800
 snack to a phenomenal breakfast what 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:50.790
