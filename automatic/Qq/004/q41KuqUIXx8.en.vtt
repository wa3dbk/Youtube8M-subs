00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
players agree to a draw I think I made a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.150 
players agree to a draw I think I made a
couple<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.710> misjudgments<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.920> middle

game<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:52.190> my<00:00:53.190> position<00:00:53.699> was<00:00:53.879> worse<00:00:54.149> than<00:00:54.570> I

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
game that my position was worse than I

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.680 
game that my position was worse than I
probably<00:00:57.199> I<00:00:58.199> don't<00:00:59.160> know<00:00:59.430> made<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.359> even<00:01:00.510> worse

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
probably I don't know made it even worse

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.010 
probably I don't know made it even worse
but<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:02.840> underestimated<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.080> plan<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.799> b5

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
but I underestimated this plan with b5

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
obviously for black what is getting is

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.030 
obviously for black what is getting is
the<00:01:38.610> two<00:01:38.759> bishops<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.329> his<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.740> i<00:01:40.890> could

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.620 
Whitehead full compensation and I didn't
really<00:02:11.580> see<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.880> point<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.150> going<00:02:12.209> for<00:02:12.510> that

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
really see the point of going for that

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.760 
really see the point of going for that
but<00:02:14.480> well<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.510> might<00:02:15.900> have<00:02:16.050> been<00:02:16.080> mistaken<00:02:16.200> but

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
but well I might have been mistaken but

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.980 
but well I might have been mistaken but
I<00:02:16.830> simply<00:02:17.040> felt<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.580> white<00:02:18.360> had<00:02:18.510> enough<00:02:18.750> play

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
I simply felt that white had enough play

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.770 
I simply felt that white had enough play

working<00:02:26.459> on<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.700> book<00:02:26.940> about<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.360> match<00:02:27.510> I

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
working on a book about the match I

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.140 
working on a book about the match I
think<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.650> was<00:02:28.770> a<00:02:28.830> very<00:02:29.040> exciting<00:02:29.640> game<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.880> I

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
think it was a very exciting game and I

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.479 
think it was a very exciting game and I
was<00:02:30.660> very<00:02:30.780> afraid<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:32.010> manga<00:02:32.250> should

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
was very afraid that the manga should

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.640 
was very afraid that the manga should
lose<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:32.940> game<00:02:33.150> because<00:02:33.600> i<00:02:34.110> think<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.530> was

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
lose this game because i think it was

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.130 
lose this game because i think it was
under<00:02:34.950> such<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> pressure<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.180> he<00:02:36.630> got<00:02:36.780> into<00:02:37.050> an

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
under such a pressure and he got into an

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.520 
under such a pressure and he got into an
trouble<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.730> think<00:02:38.730> it's<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:39.810> match<00:02:40.110> thing

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
trouble I think it's a this match thing

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.920 
trouble I think it's a this match thing
is<00:02:40.739> very<00:02:41.010> new<00:02:41.280> for<00:02:41.459> him<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.870> he's<00:02:42.870> not

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
is very new for him and he's not

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.760 
is very new for him and he's not
confident<00:02:43.680> with<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:44.370> yet<00:02:44.640> i<00:02:44.820> believe<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:46.440> he

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
confident with that yet i believe so he

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.070 
confident with that yet i believe so he
needs<00:02:46.920> some<00:02:47.220> time<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.700> get<00:02:48.150> used<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.600> this<00:02:48.750> and

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
needs some time to get used to this and

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.910 
needs some time to get used to this and
