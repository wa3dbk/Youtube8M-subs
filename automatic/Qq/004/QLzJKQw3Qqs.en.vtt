also a better Siri and Syria also may be

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.780

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
well as coming to that but that's just a

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.450 
well as coming to that but that's just a
few<00:01:15.540> things<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.930> think<00:01:16.200> iOS<00:01:16.560> 6<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.310> be

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
few things I think iOS 6 is going to be

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.760 
few things I think iOS 6 is going to be
a<00:01:17.490> major<00:01:17.850> prob<00:01:18.509> viously<00:01:18.750> because<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.530> going

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
a major prob viously because it's going

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.640 
a major prob viously because it's going
up<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.130> whole<00:01:20.400> nother<00:01:20.610> number<00:01:21.000> about<00:01:21.180> just<00:01:21.390> a

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
up a whole nother number about just a

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.410 
up a whole nother number about just a
6.1<00:01:22.650> or<00:01:22.830> whatever<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.390> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
6.1 or whatever so it's going to be a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.700 
6.1 or whatever so it's going to be a
big<00:01:24.630> update<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.990> think<00:01:25.290> we're<00:01:25.380> gonna<00:01:25.470> see<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> lot

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
big update I think we're gonna see a lot

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.590 
big update I think we're gonna see a lot
of<00:01:25.920> cool<00:01:26.159> stuff<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.580> hopefully<00:01:27.479> they

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
of cool stuff with it hopefully they

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.569 
of cool stuff with it hopefully they
give<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> refresh<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.619> how<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.040> looks<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.520> how

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
give a refresh to how it looks and how

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.429 
give a refresh to how it looks and how
everything<00:01:30.060> works<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.229> give<00:01:31.350> us

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
everything works just to give us

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.929 
everything works just to give us
something<00:01:31.770> new<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.070> fresh<00:01:32.220> I'm<00:01:32.520> not<00:01:32.700> sure<00:01:32.850> if

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
something new and fresh I'm not sure if

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.340 
something new and fresh I'm not sure if
they're<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.360> though<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.540> think<00:01:33.869> either

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
they're going to though I think either

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.200 
they're going to though I think either
way<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.860> still<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.250> come<00:01:35.400> out<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.970> it's

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
way is still going to come out and it's

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
in like two years so it's due for an

in like two years so it's due for an

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.130 
with it I think they're gonna update it
so<00:02:37.520> expect<00:02:38.239> some<00:02:38.300> new<00:02:38.510> products<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:39.050> be

so expect some new products to be
announced<00:02:39.530> I<00:02:39.680> doubt<00:02:40.310> they'll<00:02:40.520> be<00:02:40.550> released

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090

that day and ready for you to pick up at
a<00:02:42.890> store<00:02:43.130> i'll<00:02:43.610> probably<00:02:43.820> just<00:02:44.030> announce<00:02:44.480> them

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720

a store i'll probably just announce them
with<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.900> future<00:02:45.260> release<00:02:45.500> date<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:45.860> probably

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
with a future release date and probably

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.330 
with a future release date and probably
give<00:02:46.280> us<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.610> time<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.870> wind<00:02:48.200> or<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.470> date<00:02:48.739> when

it's going to be available for us to
pick<00:02:51.530> up<00:02:51.700> but<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:52.790> think<00:02:53.030> for<00:02:53.209> certain<00:02:53.540> we<00:02:53.630> will

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
pick up but I think for certain we will

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.040 
pick up but I think for certain we will
see<00:02:54.050> a<00:02:54.290> thinner<00:02:54.769> macbook<00:02:55.550> pro<00:02:55.820> and<00:02:56.510> hopefully

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
see a thinner macbook pro and hopefully

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.690 
see a thinner macbook pro and hopefully
hopefully<00:02:57.590> we<00:02:58.010> will<00:02:58.160> see<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.459> retina

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
hopefully we will see the retina

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.300 
hopefully we will see the retina
