00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello everyone there are owners who 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.090
 for their comfort they wish theirs 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.950
 dog even if already an adult you learn to do i 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.690
 needs at home 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.059
 always in the same point for example 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.820
 on the sleeper rather than on the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.359
 newspaper or some sort of letter for 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.699
 dogs to make sure that maybe but 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.730
 it's too cold if they don't have it 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.980
 desire or when it rains they are not 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.250
 forced to take the dog out for the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.680
 usual ride or others want more 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.110
 the dog needs outside the house though 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.149
 always in the same place de monari un 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.910
 point chosen by the owner 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.600
 so maybe I pedal chooses a role 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.420
 just below the house and expects the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.620
 dog decides to make everyone's needs 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.050
 evenings instead of walking sniffing 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.149
 wasting time there is a lot 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.340
 important to know or that dogs 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.649
 communicate a lot through 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.559
 markings then leave signals 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.890
 olfactory and also cover the markings 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.290
 of other dogs sometimes do so for 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.290
 mark the territory and succeed at home 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.450
 to read a lot of information from 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.920
 other dog markings for example 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:23.520
 so who is it that if it is male female 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.520
 what is its reproductive state 6 in 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.320
 heat or less locations his health status 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.610
 age and lots of information 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.080
 this type therefore for the dog 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.480
 needs are not just a need 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.150
 physiological but with a communicative need 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.860
 which you see of the owner to have done 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.190
 you need your dog at a specific point 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.290
 chosen by him rather than at home not 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.810
 takes into account the real needs of the 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.550
 dog our dogs are big 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.070
 enough to choose us ourselves 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.930
 do their needs and especially dogs 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.630
 they must leave I will never get tired of 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.800
 say it if you don't want to go out because it does 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.320
 cold and raining 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.320
 take a cat by the next hello
