00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello my dear subscribing friends and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560
 youtubers as they are I hope that well 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.660
 good in this video I'm going to make a 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.969
 criticism and analysis to the new console 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.820
 eighth generation of nintendo I'm 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.980
 talking about the uib come small like 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.260
 Many will already know I will give my points of 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.000
 seen in positives and negatives the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.730
 wedo is the first desktop console 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.350
 of this eighth generation the wii have 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.689
 many varieties and options that 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.490
 offer us for example your new game 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.140
 so it's very innovative from its 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.210
 design and the uses that it has and we can 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.670
 give it depending on the game we use 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.800
 another thing that stands out from this new 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.710
 console is its extensive catalog of games 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.890
 which include new super mario bros 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.149
 or tekken tag tournament or sonic and sega 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.070
 all-stars racing 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.260
 'assassin's creed' 3 among other titles 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.420
 more another thing very appreciable for 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.610
 we are that we can increase the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.770
 memory capacity of the console 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.870
 graphical power of the console is another 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.000
 thing that stands out a lot in the games 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.340
 besides game manufacturers companies 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.710
 as sega and bank have claimed that it is 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.070
 a very powerful console in graphics more 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.670
 what 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.040
 by 360 and the playstation 3 plus another 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.840
 thing that struck me is that if 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.640
 someone interrupts you when you're 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.590
 playing how to change channel to 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.750
 TV you can continue playing in the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.670
 that invades the console and finally something 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.890
 that I should not worry about the price 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.020
 that apparently is very nice with the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.970
 pockets and with the electricity bill because 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.160
 does not require much electricity and the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.160
 price is about $ 300 the 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.380
 basic version and the luxury one in about 350 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.750
 dollars well now I have to say the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.700
 bad points of the console the bad 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.950
 of the console is the sales strategy 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.630
 who is using nintendo his strategy 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.520
 is to give the console at an affordable price 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.399
 so that the people of low resources 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.560
 can afford a wii but the bad is 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.570
 that when nintendo used this technique in 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.850
 the already known weed and its sales do not 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.520
 they were so satisfying before nintendo 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.990
 and the rival companies also highlights 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.300
 is that the console is competing 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.690
 against last generation consoles 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.789
 the xbox 360 and the playstation 3 I think 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.229
 that should compete with the consoles of 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.509
 eighth generation and not with the 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.550
 previous plus most games 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.740
 of wii are not going to be exclusive 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.410
 for her but they're also going to be 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.780
 released to the xbox360 consoles and 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.910
 playstation 3 and that's a very point 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.250
 weak of this console well I said 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.740
 the positive and negative points of this 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.140
 console and finally the time has come for 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.360
 give my opinion in my opinion this 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.760
 console is very good and very good work 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.710
 on the part of nintendo personally I 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.570
 I plan to buy the console because 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.870
 it seems very innovative its gameplay 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.060
 their games and also functions etc. 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.460
 this console so I found out in your 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.590
 first day of release in the USA the 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.900
 console was sold as hot bread and 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.030
 many people ran out of their houses 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.520
 to have in your hands the so greedy 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.500
 wii console I would also like to defend a 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.930
 point of the console that apparently 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.760
 many people are criticizing I am 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.980
 talking about his control that according to 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.860
 people are a plagiarism to the control of xbox 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.290
 but first let's think who invented the 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.480
 buttons the nintendo close with your 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.900
 control of the super nintendo who 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.790
 he invented and introduced the air buttons 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.980
 nintendo with your control of snes like 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.120
 can observe nintendo put all his 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.640
 innovations and create 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.739
 in your control that's all I have 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.690
 what to say with this video I say goodbye and 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.019
 until the next inhabitants of loquendo 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.019
 yes
