00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
will call you can control the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.789 
will call you can control the
trajectories<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.010> power<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.799> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
trajectories and the power the the the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.609 
trajectories and the power the the the
the<00:01:13.850> force<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.090> which<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.509> bird<00:01:15.810> will<00:01:16.140> be<00:01:16.350> or

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
the force in which the bird will be or

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.570 
the force in which the bird will be or
the<00:01:16.710> chicken<00:01:16.890> will<00:01:17.070> be<00:01:17.130> flowing<00:01:17.369> from<00:01:17.520> the

the chicken will be flowing from the
little<00:01:18.240> thing<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.290> this

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
little thing so if we just do this

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.999 
little thing so if we just do this
obviously<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:21.780> don't<00:01:21.869> work<00:01:22.080> let's<00:01:22.680> refresh

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
obviously they don't work let's refresh

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.700 
obviously they don't work let's refresh
never<00:01:23.820> go<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.060> here<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.450> see<00:01:24.570> oh<00:01:24.710> that's

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
never go up here we can see oh that's

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.010 
never go up here we can see oh that's
while<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> islands<00:01:26.340> are<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.759> see<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:27.420> so

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
is pretty self-explanatory you press it

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.000 
is pretty self-explanatory you press it
he<00:03:13.480> grows<00:03:13.660> bigger<00:03:13.870> he<00:03:14.350> can<00:03:14.500> hit<00:03:14.620> more<00:03:14.739> stuff

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
he grows bigger he can hit more stuff

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.920 
he grows bigger he can hit more stuff
the<00:03:15.610> speed<00:03:15.910> boost<00:03:16.120> one<00:03:16.330> is<00:03:16.540> actually<00:03:16.660> really

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
the speed boost one is actually really

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.090 
the speed boost one is actually really
going<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.200> be<00:03:17.260> really<00:03:17.440> hopeful<00:03:17.709> for<00:03:17.799> this<00:03:17.920> one

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
going to be really hopeful for this one

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.850 
going to be really hopeful for this one
so<00:03:18.700> haizhu<00:03:19.090> speed<00:03:19.420> boost<00:03:22.350> there<00:03:23.350> we<00:03:23.410> go<00:03:23.560> look

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
so haizhu speed boost there we go look

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:41.449 
so haizhu speed boost there we go look
at<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:28.620> go<00:03:29.910> there<00:03:30.910> we<00:03:31.060> go<00:03:31.090> there<00:03:33.120> we<00:03:34.120> go<00:03:34.209> again
