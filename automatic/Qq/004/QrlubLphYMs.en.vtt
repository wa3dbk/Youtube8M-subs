00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
they don't have the best base out there

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.310 
they don't have the best base out there
but<00:01:16.409> they<00:01:16.619> do<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:17.220> nice<00:01:17.700> nice<00:01:18.689> sound<00:01:19.049> clarity

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
but they do have nice nice sound clarity

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.820

studios<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.369> my<00:01:26.520> opinion<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.030> base<00:01:27.509> is

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
studios but in my opinion the base is

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.020 
studios but in my opinion the base is
lacking<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.560> way<00:01:28.710> too<00:01:28.770> much<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.520> can't<00:01:29.880> hear
