00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
so now we're going to show you how to

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.330 
so now we're going to show you how to
make<00:02:04.009> it<00:02:04.189> let's<00:02:04.549> get<00:02:04.700> started<00:02:05.950> okay<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.009> this

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
make it let's get started okay so this

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.310 
make it let's get started okay so this
is<00:02:07.520> one<00:02:07.700> of<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:07.909> simplest<00:02:08.360> recipes<00:02:08.930> to<00:02:09.140> make

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
is one of the simplest recipes to make

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.719 
is one of the simplest recipes to make
because<00:02:09.590> basically<00:02:10.220> what<00:02:10.399> you're<00:02:10.550> going<00:02:10.670> to

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
because basically what you're going to

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.460 
because basically what you're going to
do<00:02:10.940> is<00:02:11.180> you're<00:02:11.300> going<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.540> put<00:02:11.750> all<00:02:11.960> the

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
do is you're going to put all the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.100 
do is you're going to put all the
ingredients<00:02:12.620> that<00:02:13.130> we<00:02:13.250> just<00:02:13.490> listed<00:02:13.940> into<00:02:14.390> the

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
ingredients that we just listed into the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.290 
ingredients that we just listed into the
top<00:02:15.320> container<00:02:15.740> of<00:02:16.130> your<00:02:16.310> double<00:02:16.670> boiler<00:02:16.880> and

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
top container of your double boiler and

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.870 
top container of your double boiler and
we're<00:02:17.540> going<00:02:17.690> to

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
we're going to

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.430 
we're going to
melt<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.270> until<00:02:18.600> it<00:02:18.720> becomes<00:02:19.080> completely

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
melt this until it becomes completely

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.090 
melt this until it becomes completely
liquid<00:02:20.630> so<00:02:21.630> if<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.470> don't<00:02:22.680> have<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.890> double

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
liquid so if you don't have a double

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.160 
liquid so if you don't have a double
boiler<00:02:23.370> like<00:02:23.790> we<00:02:23.910> mentioned<00:02:24.120> earlier<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.810> can

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
boiler like we mentioned earlier you can

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.530 
boiler like we mentioned earlier you can
create<00:02:25.650> one<00:02:25.830> at<00:02:25.980> home<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.460> just<00:02:26.670> need<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.180> heat

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
create one at home you just need to heat

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.740 
create one at home you just need to heat
resistant<00:02:28.170> devices<00:02:28.710> or<00:02:28.980> two<00:02:29.250> pots<00:02:29.750> whatever

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.650 
resistant devices or two pots whatever
you<00:02:30.840> want<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.110> use<00:02:31.320> that's<00:02:32.130> safe<00:02:32.430> for<00:02:32.700> cooking

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
you want to use that's safe for cooking

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.810 
you want to use that's safe for cooking
take<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.290> bottom<00:02:34.650> container<00:02:35.100> fill<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.760> about

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
take the bottom container fill it about

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.730 
take the bottom container fill it about
halfway<00:02:36.180> up<00:02:36.390> with<00:02:36.660> water<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.230> then<00:02:37.560> place
