a more successful music industry than
the<00:02:36.180> United<00:02:36.600> States<00:02:36.780> did<00:02:37.110> forgive<00:02:37.709> me<00:02:37.950> if

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
the United States did forgive me if

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.560 
the United States did forgive me if
these<00:02:38.160> numbers<00:02:38.370> aren't<00:02:38.760> correct<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.270> couldn't

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
these numbers aren't correct I couldn't

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.600 
these numbers aren't correct I couldn't
find<00:02:39.780> up-to-date<00:02:40.080> statistics<00:02:40.560> but<00:02:41.430> i'm

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
find up-to-date statistics but i'm

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.979 
find up-to-date statistics but i'm
pretty<00:02:41.820> sure<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.120> what's<00:02:42.390> going<00:02:42.600> on<00:02:42.720> now<00:02:42.959> is

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
pretty sure that what's going on now is

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.170 
pretty sure that what's going on now is
probably<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.770> same<00:02:43.980> as<00:02:44.310> when<00:02:44.550> these<00:02:44.760> numbers

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
probably the same as when these numbers

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.830 
probably the same as when these numbers
were<00:02:45.360> coming<00:02:45.810> up<00:02:45.930> with<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.850> term<00:02:47.850> like<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.420> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
were coming up with a term like that the

ish<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:56.280> might<00:02:56.430> not<00:02:56.610> be<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.820> mathematician<00:02:57.060> but

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
ish you might not be a mathematician but

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.270 
ish you might not be a mathematician but
you<00:02:57.780> can<00:02:57.870> probably<00:02:58.080> figure<00:02:58.440> out<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:58.890> 30<00:02:59.100> is

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
you can probably figure out that 30 is

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.800 
you can probably figure out that 30 is
still<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.489> bigger<00:02:59.730> number<00:03:00.030> than<00:03:00.060> 20<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.720> you

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
still a bigger number than 20 so you

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.180 
still a bigger number than 20 so you
might<00:03:00.989> ask<00:03:01.140> Lindsey<00:03:01.590> why<00:03:01.739> are<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:01.920> saying

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
might ask Lindsey why are you saying

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.640 
might ask Lindsey why are you saying
that<00:03:02.280> Japan<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:02.910> more<00:03:03.300> successful<00:03:03.780> music

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
that Japan is more successful music

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.090 
industry I'll tell you first of all
consider<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.230> population<00:03:07.739> of<00:03:07.799> these<00:03:07.950> two

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
consider the population of these two

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.920 
consider the population of these two
countries<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.850> United<00:03:09.000> States<00:03:09.480> has<00:03:09.600> about

countries the United States has about

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.590
