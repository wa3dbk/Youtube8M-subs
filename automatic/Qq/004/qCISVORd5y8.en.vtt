what<00:00:10.000> we<00:00:11.000> definitely<00:00:11.389> hit<00:00:11.510> something<00:00:11.950> whoa<00:00:12.950> I

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
what we definitely hit something whoa I

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.170 
what we definitely hit something whoa I
went<00:00:14.240> under<00:00:14.629> Oh<00:00:14.959> God<00:00:15.860> no<00:00:16.160> one<00:00:16.369> went<00:00:16.580> just<00:00:16.730> went

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
went under Oh God no one went just went

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.040 
went under Oh God no one went just went
into<00:00:17.300> the<00:00:17.480> propeller<00:00:17.810> and<00:00:18.140> got<00:00:18.590> destroyed<00:00:20.050> God

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
into the propeller and got destroyed God

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.019 
into the propeller and got destroyed God
went<00:00:21.289> down<00:00:21.500> to<00:00:21.710> the<00:00:21.769> table<00:00:22.130> underneath<00:00:22.699> and

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
went down to the table underneath and

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.480 
went down to the table underneath and
then<00:00:23.119> up<00:00:26.380> it<00:00:27.380> doesn't<00:00:27.589> sound<00:00:27.890> good

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
then up it doesn't sound good

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.689 
then up it doesn't sound good
why<00:00:28.999> is<00:00:29.060> it<00:00:29.150> doing<00:00:29.419> that<00:00:29.949> it's<00:00:30.949> whirring<00:00:31.400> stuff

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
why is it doing that it's whirring stuff

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.670 
why is it doing that it's whirring stuff
so<00:00:32.270> yeah<00:00:32.390> this<00:00:32.509> is<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:32.689> result<00:00:33.110> of<00:00:33.320> what<00:00:33.590> was

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
so yeah this is the result of what was

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.470 
so yeah this is the result of what was
printed<00:00:34.040> the<00:00:34.130> other<00:00:34.250> day<00:00:34.430> it's<00:00:34.940> got<00:00:35.150> these

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
printed the other day it's got these

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.860 
printed the other day it's got these
wings<00:00:36.260> so<00:00:36.920> they'll<00:00:37.040> be<00:00:37.220> like<00:00:37.340> tilting<00:00:38.030> 10

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
wings so they'll be like tilting 10

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.330 
wings so they'll be like tilting 10
degrees<00:00:39.170> or<00:00:39.350> so<00:00:39.500> which<00:00:39.950> one<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:40.190> air<00:00:40.280> is

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
degrees or so which one the air is

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.770 
degrees or so which one the air is
coming<00:00:40.490> in<00:00:40.700> or<00:00:40.820> push<00:00:41.090> them<00:00:41.270> or<00:00:41.360> push<00:00:41.570> it<00:00:41.690> around

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
coming in or push them or push it around

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.290 
coming in or push them or push it around
and<00:00:42.310> therefore<00:00:43.310> adjusting<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:43.940> vertical

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
and therefore adjusting the vertical

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.260 
and therefore adjusting the vertical
position<00:00:44.830> so<00:00:45.830> whether<00:00:46.340> it's<00:00:46.550> up<00:00:46.700> or<00:00:46.850> down<00:00:47.060> and

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
position so whether it's up or down and

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.340 
position so whether it's up or down and
none<00:00:47.450> of<00:00:47.540> these<00:00:47.600> will<00:00:47.810> be<00:00:47.900> fixed<00:00:48.200> on<00:00:48.230> the

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
none of these will be fixed on the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.430 
none of these will be fixed on the
actual<00:00:48.620> design<00:00:49.270> these<00:00:50.270> will<00:00:50.510> retract<00:00:51.110> and

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
actual design these will retract and

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.440 
actual design these will retract and
come<00:00:51.590> in<00:00:51.740> like<00:00:52.010> this<00:00:52.190> at<00:00:52.880> the<00:00:52.970> moment<00:00:53.150> it's

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
come in like this at the moment it's

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.320 
come in like this at the moment it's
fully<00:00:53.600> down<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.140> full<00:00:54.830> drag<00:00:55.130> and<00:00:55.370> then<00:00:56.030> when

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
fully down and full drag and then when

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.780 
fully down and full drag and then when
it<00:00:56.450> were<00:00:56.540> tracks<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:56.990> comes<00:00:57.140> fully<00:00:57.380> in<00:00:57.790> it'll

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
it were tracks and comes fully in it'll

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.610 
it were tracks and comes fully in it'll
be<00:00:58.910> able<00:00:58.970> to<00:00:59.090> fall<00:00:59.300> as<00:00:59.450> fast<00:00:59.660> as<00:00:59.720> it<00:00:59.840> can<00:01:00.020> that's

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
be able to fall as fast as it can that's

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.230 
be able to fall as fast as it can that's
basically<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.070> ballast<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:01.670> heaviest<00:01:02.030> bit

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
basically the ballast the heaviest bit

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.940 
basically the ballast the heaviest bit
will<00:01:02.330> be<00:01:02.420> at<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:02.540> bottom<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:03.350> it<00:01:03.650> will<00:01:03.770> fall

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
will be at the bottom so it will fall

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.070 
will be at the bottom so it will fall
more<00:01:03.980> stable<00:01:04.549> we've<00:01:04.820> got<00:01:04.970> like<00:01:05.150> space<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.930> put

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
more stable we've got like space to put

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.630 
more stable we've got like space to put
in<00:01:06.170> like<00:01:06.350> nuts<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:06.710> bolts<00:01:06.979> as<00:01:07.070> a<00:01:07.100> house<00:01:07.280> where

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
in like nuts and bolts as a house where

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.849 
in like nuts and bolts as a house where
we<00:01:07.729> can<00:01:07.880> weight<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:08.210> down<00:01:08.360> to<00:01:09.200> adjust<00:01:09.590> the

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859 
we can weight it down to adjust the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:16.120 
we can weight it down to adjust the
center<00:01:10.249> of<00:01:10.549> mass<00:01:14.200> we've<00:01:15.200> got<00:01:15.439> a<00:01:15.649> one

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
center of mass we've got a one

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.310 
center of mass we've got a one
horsepower<00:01:16.460> motor<00:01:16.909> from<00:01:17.600> an<00:01:17.659> airplane<00:01:18.109> like

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
horsepower motor from an airplane like

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.810 
horsepower motor from an airplane like
remote-control<00:01:18.829> airplane<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.369> we<00:01:19.460> shipped

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
remote-control airplane that we shipped

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.520 
remote-control airplane that we shipped
over<00:01:20.060> from<00:01:20.210> America<00:01:20.329> from<00:01:20.719> David's<00:01:21.109> house<00:01:21.259> and

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
over from America from David's house and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.550 
over from America from David's house and
that<00:01:21.979> basically<00:01:22.490> drives<00:01:22.969> this<00:01:23.149> propeller

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
that basically drives this propeller

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.770 
that basically drives this propeller
produces<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.679> lift<00:01:24.859> the<00:01:25.490> acrylic<00:01:25.909> front<00:01:26.569> is

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
produces the lift the acrylic front is

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.359 
produces the lift the acrylic front is
so<00:01:26.929> that<00:01:27.049> we<00:01:27.109> can<00:01:27.140> see<00:01:27.380> in<00:01:27.499> obviously<00:01:27.829> at<00:01:28.189> this

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
so that we can see in obviously at this

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.809 
so that we can see in obviously at this
piece<00:01:28.609> here<00:01:28.850> is<00:01:29.060> called<00:01:29.539> a<00:01:29.630> manometer<00:01:29.929> and

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
piece here is called a manometer and

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.489 
piece here is called a manometer and
basically<00:01:31.819> the<00:01:32.090> flow<00:01:32.210> comes<00:01:32.600> up<00:01:32.810> into<00:01:33.170> the

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499 
basically the flow comes up into the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:36.279 
basically the flow comes up into the
tube<00:01:33.710> on<00:01:33.889> the<00:01:33.979> other<00:01:34.100> side<00:01:34.899> which<00:01:35.899> creates<00:01:36.200> a

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
tube on the other side which creates a

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.200 
tube on the other side which creates a
pressure<00:01:36.560> which<00:01:37.130> moves<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.670> fluid<00:01:37.789> that<00:01:38.149> you

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
pressure which moves the fluid that you

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.059 
pressure which moves the fluid that you
can't<00:01:38.450> really<00:01:38.659> see<00:01:38.869> we<00:01:39.020> need<00:01:39.109> to<00:01:39.229> dye<00:01:39.380> it<00:01:39.409> but

00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:40.069 
can't really see we need to dye it but

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:41.800 
can't really see we need to dye it but
their<00:01:40.219> difference<00:01:40.609> in<00:01:40.759> height<00:01:41.090> between<00:01:41.479> the

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
their difference in height between the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.260 
their difference in height between the
two<00:01:41.960> levels<00:01:42.350> of<00:01:42.499> water<00:01:42.799> is<00:01:43.219> an<00:01:43.700> indication<00:01:44.060> of

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
two levels of water is an indication of

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.370 
two levels of water is an indication of
pressure<00:01:44.569> and<00:01:44.749> then<00:01:44.869> from<00:01:44.990> that<00:01:45.109> we<00:01:45.200> can<00:01:45.350> work

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
pressure and then from that we can work

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.379 
pressure and then from that we can work
out<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.770> speed<00:01:46.009> of<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.249> air<00:01:46.399> inside<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.149> tube

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:47.389 
out the speed of the air inside the tube

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:49.989 
out the speed of the air inside the tube
this<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.499> controller<00:01:48.979> but<00:01:49.639> we<00:01:49.729> made<00:01:49.880> like

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:49.999 
this is the controller but we made like

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:52.209 
this is the controller but we made like
a<00:01:50.060> simple<00:01:50.420> program<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:51.560> control<00:01:51.889> it

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
a simple program to control it

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.279 
a simple program to control it
that's<00:01:52.520> a<00:01:52.759> potentiometer<00:01:53.389> and<00:01:54.079> that

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
that's a potentiometer and that

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.739 
that's a potentiometer and that
basically<00:01:54.649> allows<00:01:55.310> more<00:01:55.579> or<00:01:55.999> less<00:01:56.299> current<00:01:56.659> in

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:56.749 
basically allows more or less current in

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.059 
basically allows more or less current in
from<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:56.990> battery<00:01:57.319> into<00:01:57.439> them<00:01:57.649> into<00:01:57.889> the

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
from the battery into them into the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.459 
from the battery into them into the
motor<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:58.969> that<00:01:58.999> can<00:01:59.240> vary<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.569> speed<00:01:59.780> so<00:02:00.350> we

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
motor so that can vary the speed so we

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:01.359 
motor so that can vary the speed so we
made<00:02:00.619> this<00:02:00.740> this<00:02:00.859> morning<00:02:01.069> actually

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
made this this morning actually

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.019 
made this this morning actually
color-coded<00:02:02.299> the<00:02:03.049> danger<00:02:03.380> zone<00:02:03.850> we<00:02:04.850> basically

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:05.029 
color-coded the danger zone we basically

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:06.999 
color-coded the danger zone we basically
had<00:02:05.209> to<00:02:05.240> think<00:02:05.420> through<00:02:05.539> what<00:02:05.929> shake<00:02:06.889> would

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
had to think through what shake would

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.650 
had to think through what shake would
start<00:02:07.219> together<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.700> work<00:02:07.850> properly<00:02:08.090> with

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
start together and work properly with

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.350 
start together and work properly with
this<00:02:08.810> new<00:02:08.990> mesh<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.800> we<00:02:09.920> laser<00:02:10.130> cut<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:10.670> then

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
this new mesh that we laser cut and then

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.179 
this new mesh that we laser cut and then
last<00:02:11.600> night<00:02:11.720> put<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.230> together<00:02:12.319> glued<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:13.040> and

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:13.189 
last night put it together glued it and

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.610 
last night put it together glued it and
it<00:02:13.909> works<00:02:14.150> surprisingly<00:02:14.780> better<00:02:15.349> than<00:02:15.500> we

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
it works surprisingly better than we

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.059 
it works surprisingly better than we
thought

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
thought

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.550 
thought
basically<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:17.239> straightens<00:02:18.019> the<00:02:18.049> air<00:02:18.230> out<00:02:18.409> so

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
basically it straightens the air out so

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.730 
basically it straightens the air out so
then

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
then

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.490 
then
that's<00:02:19.100> traveling<00:02:19.550> around<00:02:19.940> or<00:02:20.900> hit<00:02:21.170> at<00:02:21.320> an

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
that's traveling around or hit at an

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.350 
that's traveling around or hit at an
angle<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.580> then<00:02:22.730> sort<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:22.940> deflect<00:02:23.240> upwards

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
angle and then sort of deflect upwards

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.240 
angle and then sort of deflect upwards
and<00:02:23.750> so<00:02:24.440> becomes<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.130> more<00:02:25.280> uniform<00:02:25.730> flow<00:02:27.250> we're

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
and so becomes a more uniform flow we're

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.800 
and so becomes a more uniform flow we're
hoping<00:02:28.490> for<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.790> be<00:02:29.270> stable<00:02:29.420> because

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
hoping for it to be stable because

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.740 
hoping for it to be stable because
before<00:02:30.170> it's<00:02:30.290> been<00:02:30.410> like<00:02:30.620> flying<00:02:31.100> all<00:02:31.340> around

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
before it's been like flying all around

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.880 
before it's been like flying all around
but<00:02:32.750> with<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:32.930> straightening<00:02:33.440> mesh<00:02:33.620> it

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
but with this straightening mesh it

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:44.539 
but with this straightening mesh it
should<00:02:34.040> be<00:02:34.160> okay

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.860 

that's<00:02:45.549> nearly<00:02:46.030> as<00:02:46.180> much<00:02:46.329> as<00:02:46.390> we<00:02:46.659> should

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
that's nearly as much as we should

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.399 
that's nearly as much as we should
expecting<00:02:47.829> it's<00:02:48.129> so<00:02:48.400> much<00:02:48.609> noisy<00:02:49.000> normally<00:02:49.409> we

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
expecting it's so much noisy normally we

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.309 
expecting it's so much noisy normally we
wake<00:02:50.680> up<00:02:50.829> housemates<00:02:51.340> with<00:02:51.549> it<00:02:52.109> no<00:02:53.109> I<00:02:53.140> think

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
wake up housemates with it no I think

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.899 
wake up housemates with it no I think
the<00:02:53.620> power<00:02:54.010> in<00:02:54.129> the<00:02:54.219> batch<00:02:54.340> is<00:02:54.370> not<00:02:54.700> going<00:02:54.849> to

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
the power in the batch is not going to

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.619 
the power in the batch is not going to
be<00:02:55.000> enough<00:02:55.200> it's<00:02:56.200> charged<00:02:56.680> yeah<00:02:57.629> Dave's

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
be enough it's charged yeah Dave's

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:08.220 
be enough it's charged yeah Dave's
optimistic<00:02:59.319> as<00:02:59.469> always

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:20.870 

that's<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:09.440> close<00:03:09.710> I'm<00:03:10.490> always<00:03:10.670> right

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.290 

we<00:03:21.880> can<00:03:22.030> do<00:03:22.120> that<00:03:22.240> again<00:03:22.330> quickly<00:03:24.090> start<00:03:25.090> it

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
we can do that again quickly start it

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:35.270 
we can do that again quickly start it
and<00:03:25.480> then<00:03:25.630> drop<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:25.960> in

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.410 

yeah<00:03:36.280> we'll<00:03:36.550> put<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.790> lip<00:03:36.910> on<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.360> will

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
yeah we'll put the lip on it it will

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.990 
yeah we'll put the lip on it it will
definitely<00:03:37.810> work<00:03:37.930> live<00:03:38.200> for<00:03:38.319> this<00:03:38.410> one

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
definitely work live for this one

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.210 
definitely work live for this one
our<00:03:40.000> actual<00:03:40.209> design<00:03:40.720> is<00:03:41.050> going<00:03:41.440> to<00:03:41.500> have<00:03:41.709> a<00:03:41.950> lip

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
our actual design is going to have a lip

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.020 
our actual design is going to have a lip
at<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.400> top<00:03:42.610> of<00:03:42.760> it

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
at the top of it

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.670 
at the top of it
simulating<00:03:43.600> that<00:03:43.630> kind<00:03:43.990> of<00:03:44.080> that<00:03:44.410> kind<00:03:44.560> of

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
simulating that kind of that kind of

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.160 
simulating that kind of that kind of
lift<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.370> that<00:03:45.459> all<00:03:45.750> basically<00:03:46.750> create<00:03:47.050> loads

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
lift and that all basically create loads

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.900 
lift and that all basically create loads
of<00:03:47.319> drag<00:03:47.500> at<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.680> top<00:03:47.860> so<00:03:48.580> it<00:03:48.640> will<00:03:48.730> sit

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
of drag at the top so it will sit

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.970 
of drag at the top so it will sit
stabili<00:03:49.360> and<00:03:49.630> it<00:03:49.990> also<00:03:50.110> help<00:03:50.470> it

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
stabili and it also help it

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.559 
stabili and it also help it
full<00:03:51.370> stable<00:03:51.670> if<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:51.850> stiff<00:03:52.239> it's<00:03:52.360> sort<00:03:52.540> of

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
full stable if it stiff it's sort of

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.300 
full stable if it stiff it's sort of
tumbling<00:03:52.750> out<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.140> plane<00:03:53.319> when<00:03:53.890> you'd<00:03:54.010> let<00:03:54.190> go

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
tumbling out the plane when you'd let go

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.330 
tumbling out the plane when you'd let go
of<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.520> or<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.180> full<00:03:55.540> stable<00:03:55.870> quicker<00:03:56.340> the

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
of it or a full stable quicker the

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.410 
of it or a full stable quicker the
reason<00:03:57.610> why<00:03:57.700> we<00:03:57.790> didn't<00:03:57.970> have<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.180> on<00:03:58.300> this

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
reason why we didn't have it on this

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.420 
reason why we didn't have it on this
before<00:03:58.810> it's<00:03:59.470> because<00:03:59.560> we<00:03:59.860> couldn't<00:04:00.069> wrap<00:04:00.280> it

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
before it's because we couldn't wrap it

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.740 
before it's because we couldn't wrap it
prototype<00:04:00.880> like<00:04:01.030> a<00:04:01.060> cap<00:04:01.270> on<00:04:01.390> it<00:04:01.450> we<00:04:01.600> wouldn't

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
prototype like a cap on it we wouldn't

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.320 
prototype like a cap on it we wouldn't
got<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:01.959> put<00:04:02.110> any<00:04:02.230> weights<00:04:02.410> in<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:04.000> seeing

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
got to put any weights in it and seeing

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.970 
got to put any weights in it and seeing
as<00:04:04.420> how<00:04:04.510> we're<00:04:04.660> having<00:04:04.900> like<00:04:05.260> battery

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
as how we're having like battery

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:21.020 
as how we're having like battery
problems<00:04:06.370> this<00:04:06.670> should<00:04:06.820> take<00:04:06.970> off<00:04:07.150> now

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.879 

it<00:04:21.630> could<00:04:21.840> be<00:04:21.959> this<00:04:22.049> because<00:04:22.410> it's<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.710> first

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
it could be this because it's the first

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.250 
it could be this because it's the first
time<00:04:23.070> we've<00:04:23.250> tried<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.580> mesh<00:04:24.020> finish<00:04:25.020> because

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
time we've tried to mesh finish because

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.030 
time we've tried to mesh finish because
there<00:04:25.889> is<00:04:25.980> a<00:04:26.010> camera<00:04:26.520> present<00:04:27.050> yeah<00:04:28.050> I<00:04:28.440> mean

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
there is a camera present yeah I mean

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.190 
there is a camera present yeah I mean
the<00:04:29.130> mesh<00:04:29.310> could<00:04:29.520> be<00:04:29.610> creating<00:04:30.030> more<00:04:30.060> drag<00:04:30.570> you

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
the mesh could be creating more drag you

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.140 
the mesh could be creating more drag you
want<00:04:31.320> to<00:04:31.470> drop<00:04:31.770> it<00:04:31.980> from<00:04:32.130> here<00:04:35.030> crashes<00:04:36.030> at

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
want to drop it from here crashes at

00:04:36.150 --> 00:05:25.780 
want to drop it from here crashes at
least<00:04:36.360> I'll<00:04:36.570> have<00:04:36.750> a<00:04:36.780> crash

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.740 

what<00:05:26.790> is<00:05:26.910> this

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.470 

Oh<00:05:30.130> No<00:05:31.160> you<00:05:31.640> guys<00:05:31.820> a<00:05:31.880> total<00:05:32.150> pros<00:05:32.650> yeah<00:05:33.650> I<00:05:34.480> just

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
Oh No you guys a total pros yeah I just

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.970 
Oh No you guys a total pros yeah I just
turned<00:05:35.690> off<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:35.900> power<00:05:36.050> and<00:05:36.470> it<00:05:36.560> kept<00:05:36.770> going

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
turned off the power and it kept going

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.500 
turned off the power and it kept going
for<00:05:37.310> a<00:05:37.340> little<00:05:37.490> bit<00:05:37.670> so<00:05:37.940> I<00:05:37.970> think<00:05:38.090> there's

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
for a little bit so I think there's

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.170 
for a little bit so I think there's
something<00:05:38.690> wrong<00:05:38.960> with<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:40.280> microprocessor

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
something wrong with the microprocessor

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.650 
something wrong with the microprocessor
the<00:05:41.660> rest<00:05:42.290> of<00:05:42.380> the<00:05:42.440> project<00:05:42.560> elusive<00:05:43.490> so<00:05:44.330> it's

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
the rest of the project elusive so it's

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.140 
the rest of the project elusive so it's
been<00:05:44.780> an<00:05:44.870> eventful<00:05:44.990> afternoon<00:05:46.030> where<00:05:47.030> ever

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
been an eventful afternoon where ever

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.090 
been an eventful afternoon where ever
really<00:05:47.450> proven<00:05:47.870> anything<00:05:48.050> donno<00:05:48.770> what<00:05:48.950> is<00:05:49.040> the

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
really proven anything donno what is the

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.770 
really proven anything donno what is the
next<00:05:49.220> step<00:05:49.460> well<00:05:50.090> I'm<00:05:50.240> gonna<00:05:50.450> get<00:05:50.600> a<00:05:50.660> new

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
next step well I'm gonna get a new

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.720 
next step well I'm gonna get a new
battery<00:05:50.990> I<00:05:51.170> think<00:05:51.410> so<00:05:52.130> say<00:05:52.280> we<00:05:52.400> couldn't<00:05:52.580> have

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 
battery I think so say we couldn't have

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.870 
battery I think so say we couldn't have
it<00:05:52.850> like<00:05:53.000> slow<00:05:53.690> motion<00:05:53.720> like<00:05:54.050> hovering<00:05:54.290> just

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
it like slow motion like hovering just

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.590 
it like slow motion like hovering just
it<00:05:55.880> would<00:05:56.090> have<00:05:56.180> looked<00:05:56.270> awesome<00:05:58.600> it's

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
it would have looked awesome it's

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.030 
it would have looked awesome it's
usually<00:05:59.780> really<00:06:00.170> loud<00:06:00.470> that<00:06:00.650> you<00:06:00.740> can't<00:06:00.950> hear

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
usually really loud that you can't hear

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.250 
usually really loud that you can't hear
at<00:06:01.430> all<00:06:01.580> we<00:06:02.300> were<00:06:02.390> up<00:06:02.480> till<00:06:02.630> 1:00<00:06:02.870> last<00:06:03.080> night

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
at all we were up till 1:00 last night

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.590 
at all we were up till 1:00 last night
like<00:06:03.710> playing<00:06:04.040> around<00:06:04.160> with<00:06:04.430> stuff<00:06:04.640> so<00:06:04.700> no

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 
like playing around with stuff so no

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.790 
like playing around with stuff so no
flatmates<00:06:05.990> have<00:06:06.080> only<00:06:06.200> just<00:06:06.350> gone<00:06:06.500> to<00:06:06.620> sleep

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
flatmates have only just gone to sleep

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.660 
flatmates have only just gone to sleep
so<00:06:07.010> I<00:06:07.040> wasn't<00:06:07.280> too<00:06:07.370> bad<00:06:08.050> okay<00:06:09.050> so<00:06:09.110> this<00:06:10.040> video

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:10.670 
so I wasn't too bad okay so this video

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.240 
so I wasn't too bad okay so this video
shows<00:06:11.540> the<00:06:11.690> airflow<00:06:12.080> before<00:06:12.620> and<00:06:12.800> after<00:06:13.130> we

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
shows the airflow before and after we

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.600 
shows the airflow before and after we
changed<00:06:13.820> the<00:06:13.910> mesh<00:06:14.090> so<00:06:14.950> this<00:06:15.950> bit<00:06:16.160> here<00:06:16.340> that

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
changed the mesh so this bit here that

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.990 
changed the mesh so this bit here that
was<00:06:17.360> our<00:06:17.480> original<00:06:17.570> design<00:06:18.140> and<00:06:18.580> as<00:06:19.580> you<00:06:19.880> can

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
was our original design and as you can

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.250 
was our original design and as you can
see<00:06:20.060> you<00:06:20.330> in<00:06:20.420> the<00:06:20.510> ball<00:06:20.660> start<00:06:20.930> moving<00:06:21.169> around

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
see you in the ball start moving around

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.610 
see you in the ball start moving around
basically<00:06:22.100> the<00:06:22.220> fan<00:06:22.460> creates<00:06:22.880> like<00:06:23.060> a<00:06:23.210> vortex

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
basically the fan creates like a vortex

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
basically the fan creates like a vortex
divorce<00:06:24.620> dust<00:06:24.860> being<00:06:25.070> around<00:06:25.280> and<00:06:25.460> this<00:06:25.550> is

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640 
divorce dust being around and this is

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.800 
divorce dust being around and this is
basically<00:06:25.910> what's<00:06:26.120> happening<00:06:26.360> to<00:06:26.450> our<00:06:26.540> model

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
basically what's happening to our model

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:27.610 
basically what's happening to our model
when<00:06:26.900> we<00:06:26.990> had<00:06:27.140> it<00:06:27.230> in<00:06:27.320> there

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
when we had it in there

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.960 
when we had it in there
it<00:06:27.740> was<00:06:27.860> fashioned<00:06:28.220> against<00:06:28.430> the<00:06:28.550> walls<00:06:28.730> and

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
it was fashioned against the walls and

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.260 
it was fashioned against the walls and
wasn't<00:06:29.240> giving<00:06:29.570> us<00:06:29.690> like<00:06:29.950> very<00:06:30.950> stable

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
wasn't giving us like very stable

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.780 
wasn't giving us like very stable
footage<00:06:32.270> and<00:06:32.480> then<00:06:33.370> we<00:06:34.370> put<00:06:34.580> in<00:06:34.700> a<00:06:34.820> new<00:06:35.030> one<00:06:35.290> so

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790 
footage and then we put in a new one so

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.980 
footage and then we put in a new one so
yeah<00:06:37.790> you'll<00:06:37.970> notice<00:06:38.240> that<00:06:38.480> they'd<00:06:38.690> still

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
yeah you'll notice that they'd still

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.210 
yeah you'll notice that they'd still
bobble<00:06:39.230> around<00:06:39.440> cuz<00:06:39.620> I<00:06:39.650> smack<00:06:39.890> into<00:06:40.040> each

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
bobble around cuz I smack into each

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.010 
bobble around cuz I smack into each
other<00:06:40.430> but<00:06:40.910> they're<00:06:41.390> not<00:06:41.510> spinning<00:06:41.840> anymore

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
other but they're not spinning anymore

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.930 
other but they're not spinning anymore
and<00:06:42.410> there's<00:06:42.770> that<00:06:43.040> one<00:06:43.220> there<00:06:43.400> floats<00:06:43.730> for

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
and there's that one there floats for

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:50.800 
and there's that one there floats for
like<00:06:44.120> ages<00:06:47.800> yeah<00:06:49.240> so<00:06:50.240> it<00:06:50.300> clearly<00:06:50.510> makes<00:06:50.720> a

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
like ages yeah so it clearly makes a

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:51.850 
like ages yeah so it clearly makes a
difference<00:06:51.140> except

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
difference except

00:06:51.860 --> 00:07:00.370 
difference except
yeah<00:06:52.430> we<00:06:52.550> can<00:06:52.700> see<00:06:53.030> that<00:06:53.180> today

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:00.380 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.230 

stadia<00:07:01.930> please<00:07:02.930> do<00:07:03.380> not<00:07:03.530> touch<00:07:04.010> anything<00:07:04.370> yeah

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 
stadia please do not touch anything yeah

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.230 
stadia please do not touch anything yeah
it's<00:07:06.050> it's<00:07:06.320> called<00:07:06.590> a<00:07:06.740> rapid<00:07:07.610> prototyping

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 
it's it's called a rapid prototyping

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.200 
it's it's called a rapid prototyping
workshop<00:07:08.690> I<00:07:09.050> guess<00:07:09.890> it's<00:07:10.070> because<00:07:10.220> all<00:07:10.790> these

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210 
workshop I guess it's because all these

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.440 
workshop I guess it's because all these
things<00:07:11.690> that<00:07:12.350> you<00:07:12.440> can<00:07:12.560> make<00:07:12.740> air<00:07:13.210> use<00:07:14.210> for

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:14.450 
things that you can make air use for

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.710 
things that you can make air use for
prototypes<00:07:15.080> for<00:07:15.350> models<00:07:16.030> usually<00:07:17.030> not<00:07:17.510> used

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:17.720 
prototypes for models usually not used

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.560 
prototypes for models usually not used
in<00:07:17.900> final<00:07:18.230> designs
