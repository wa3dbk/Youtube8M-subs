my<00:01:47.159> cloud<00:01:47.759> jump<00:01:48.630> up<00:01:48.840> beauty<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.670> he<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.240> going

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
my cloud jump up beauty so he is going

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510 
my cloud jump up beauty so he is going
to<00:01:51.659> be<00:01:51.750> expensive<00:01:52.140> think<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.159> going<00:01:53.340> to

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
to be expensive think that is going to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.190 
to be expensive think that is going to
be<00:01:53.579> one<00:01:53.820> thing<00:01:54.060> he's<00:01:54.210> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.600> really

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
be one thing he's going to be really

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.789 
be one thing he's going to be really
expensive<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:56.219> he<00:01:56.310> starts<00:01:56.759> off<00:01:56.939> at<00:01:57.619> 5200<00:01:58.619> hour

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
expensive so he starts off at 5200 hour

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.330 
expensive so he starts off at 5200 hour
which<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.969> really<00:02:00.509> good<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.439> i<00:02:01.619> could<00:02:02.159> just

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
which is really good so i could just

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.740
