00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:03.520
 if you are watching 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.520
 world a cattleman and equine 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.269
 Consumers are unaware that pork has been in 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:15.490
 relative terms 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.290
 it's cheaper than rs fish and lean cuts of chicken to find 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.310
 this topic you accompany us to otegi ni stamos hernÃ¡n jaramillo teachers of 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.470
 this institution falls quinas what is meant by pig farming 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.239
 as far as all the pig farming in science or art basically 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.270
 of pig farming 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.360
 that industry had a very strong growth in the last 15 years 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.449
 basically 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.749
 from the point of view of silk come to turn almost into a company in a 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:48.679
 Obviously, that company manages a profitability that is optimal and that 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:49.569
 obviously 

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:54.409
 this in the day to day trying to improve the quality of your product 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:55.070
 final 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.380
 Porcine farming is as such the science that covers all this business that the 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.339
 moment 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.179
 help to improve the quality 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.990
 of consumption as such of pork and that obviously without pulse 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.000
 percent is looking to boost 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.310
 in my life in the groin in the housewife a consumer 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.310
 the habit of this before qatar 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.429
 regarding the regional distribution of pig production 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.590
 There are four main regions that concentrate 81 percent of the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.270
 national pork production 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.190
 they are antioquia cundinamarca valle del cauca and the coffee axis which has 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.390
 been the evolution of pig farming 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.530
 the opposition has grown another of a fairly representative growth in 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.910
 the last 15 years 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.530
 since the pig that is consumed today is a pig 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.009
 totally different from what was consumed 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:50.780
 A) Yes 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.300
 those that we have been talking about for 15 years 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.140
 first for the quality in the production system the nut there is no trace of what 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.320
 that existed in the past p to this day are used completely food 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.690
 balanced, advanced management techniques are used that are at the 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.369
 from countries like the united states where brazil 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.840
 we also manage 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.659
 the concept of 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:17.199
 complete the cycle is to unite all the boys phases of the cycle of 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:20.749
 reproduction breeding the groom lift the fattening 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:25.539
 with the objective obviously of having a control or a total domain over that 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:26.930
 Production system 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.930
 peace 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.329
 as has been the acceptance of the consumption of pork and colombia that today 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.589
 Consumption of pork meat is exercised in Colombia 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:41.069
 but its benefits 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.019
 the consumption of pork in Colombia 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.209
 they have a per capita consumption of 800 people 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.609
 there are figures that say that they are six kilos per person per year 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.809
 but we can be talking 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:55.349
 Then the teachers arrived and a little more 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.889
 there is a figure that we want to suddenly know and it is basically a 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:04.280
 informal consumption is the pig that does not go through a slaughter plant 

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:05.209
 legal 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.209
 this moment we have not yet had it so valued 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.149
 there is a figure that would be called a lot of attention and is that it came from that 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:13.179
 national consumption 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:16.819
 but that department angle gives being the biggest consumers and others 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.400
 departments do not want to do 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.790
 the least consumers 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.540
 for the case of the country of Colombia, the largest consumer of pork meat in the 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.250
 antioquia department we can estimate that this consumption can reach all the 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.269
 October 2 a little more than kilos are with respect to national consumption 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:34.180
 we want to focus 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.420
 that antioquia is perhaps the biggest consumer but it is convenient is the biggest 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.240
 meat producer be we need in a moment to take off that kind of consumption in 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.520
 other departments 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.730
 which obviously can also derive 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.290
 part of its economic improvements from this business in terms of 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.450
 employment generated by the direct pork industry before indirectly 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.940
 through activities 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.049
 of transport of standing pigs and Canada 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.769
 sacrificial and dispossessed services 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.939
 and distribution of the final product 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.209
 a total of 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.209
 92 thousand positions in all colombia 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.419
 what kind of environmental policies exist to handle the issue the position 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.070
 tura 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.930
 must basically the pig industry in environmental terms needs 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.659
 per cent many reorganization plans 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:30.770
 including training is the theme called in day to day 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.259
 to train pig farmers in the environmental policies that 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.039
 They must drive on their farm 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.610
 given that regional autonomous corporations 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.030
 the vision obviously made control over water dumping and 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.450
 the management of solid and liquid waste 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.659
 what in a moment they handle this type of exploitations 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:54.849
 Even today, here we want to diversify the spectrum that 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:00.430
 manages as such on its issues of the livestock sector and wants to be located in a 

00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:04.580
 subject or copying then directly the pigs and strengthening 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.450
 in environmental management 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.580
 explaining basically what are the national policies that exist as 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.090
 the subsector was managed 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.010
 patricola and what are especially the needs that are raising in the 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.830
 every day the political scientist the entities that regulate the policies 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:21.879
 environmental 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.090
 basically 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.889
 what you want every 15 overdue for either different interest rates from 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.100
 people want curules in diploma courses 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.440
 strengthen the moment the handling 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.700
 of environmental policies giving it that added value 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.800
 since this puts a lot 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.800
 in question the true 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.370
 within the program that offers equines how the sanitary topic is approached 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.480
 by the way if you see you drop kilos I want to offer a program 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.520
 That this 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.400
 at the forefront of national policies 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.400
 Read about the subject of health policy 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.800
 reads even we think strengthen a lot 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.639
 the campaigns that the moment besides the national guidelines especially 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.819
 the problem in the eradication of classical swine fever 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:15.619
 in we want at a moment to still show what kind of impact the 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:20.440
 have the bufo cobos of this disease either on the farm or around it 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.390
 we also want to join a lot to the policies that the institute manages 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.760
 colombian agricultural with respect to the campaigns that should be given for that 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.960
 of course the median and for that possible the little one only 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.889
 strengthening 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:36.360
 the concept that it is a disease faced by the case of swine fever 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.779
 classical 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:41.789
 by the way destine much the commerce or pursues totally the commerce 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:43.249
 international 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:47.199
 and that obviously keep us registered as a country that has 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:50.919
 that limit your business civil suso 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.530
 percent basically is again portals of this disease yes no 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.590
 also strengthen the biosecurity component 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.860
 inside a pig farm we want to explain administratively in this 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.190
 type of courses administratively certified the impact that has 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.640
 the mounting of a god safety campaign within your plan to 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:13.840
 previously with an interest reads totally economical so that 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.000
 this program would be closed and rural those of directly the 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.949
 disease but 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:20.949
 sustaining the profitability of leaving the country 

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:28.710
 I am things more jaramillo salary that grow 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.270
 percent that the full-time teacher in high comparison 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.199
 equity studies of colombia 

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:35.639
 and I also participate
