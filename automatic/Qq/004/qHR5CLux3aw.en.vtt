 red filmed reptile smoke and they are usually 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.660
 each one of them good the first reptile 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.059
 it's called cats and it takes away two hearts 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.790
 let's start here the loose and as you see is 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.670
 Black is like a crocodile but it's black 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.640
 as you see very strange and the hearts were 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.130
 beige good the next is a chameleon 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.230
 so I think it's chameleon but good 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.750
 we turn out and very good here it does not look like this 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.570
 that we are here as this is the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.520
 little one with beige colors and we are 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.200
 looking is very small very difficult to 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.230
 see good the next we have 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.300

 a little baby turtle good the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.370
 next is the crossbar as you can see 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.050
 let's go and it's very big and I think this one 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.850
 It also takes away life, as you can see, two 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.559
 hearts too but good this is 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.780
 much faster so it's harder 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.379
 escape from it as you see it follows us without 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.000
 stop 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.829

 tiny as one and six is ​​the third 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.850

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.390
 I can look at a reptile that I have not released 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.610

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.619
 well, it expands and the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.390
 next reptile is called tortoise and that 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.119
