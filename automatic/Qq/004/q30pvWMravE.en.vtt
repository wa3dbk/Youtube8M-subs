prefer<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:10.140> go<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.830> custom<00:02:11.340> and

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
prefer is go to custom and

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.450 
prefer is go to custom and
and<00:02:13.190> go<00:02:13.430> click<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.120> bottom<00:02:14.570> -<00:02:14.750> as<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:16.790> can<00:02:16.880> see

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
and go click the bottom - as you can see

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.640 
and go click the bottom - as you can see
right<00:02:19.460> here<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:19.760> will<00:02:19.820> change<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:20.750> box<00:02:21.110> this

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
right here it will change this box this

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.470 
right here it will change this box this
looks<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:22.040> lot<00:02:22.250> better<00:02:22.400> now<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:23.300> only

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
looks a lot better now the only

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.810 
looks a lot better now the only
difference<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:23.990> it's<00:02:24.230> not<00:02:24.370> transparent<00:02:25.370> but

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
difference is it's not transparent but

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.760 
difference is it's not transparent but
you<00:02:26.720> know<00:02:26.810> you<00:02:26.900> can<00:02:27.110> deal<00:02:27.230> with<00:02:27.380> that<00:02:27.530> that's

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
you know you can deal with that that's

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.810 
you know you can deal with that that's
not<00:02:28.010> that<00:02:28.070> big<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.520> deal

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
not that big of a deal

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.840 
not that big of a deal
so<00:02:29.750> just<00:02:29.990> exit<00:02:30.260> out<00:02:30.320> of<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.500> then<00:02:30.850> apply

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850

that just click run cleaner I'm gonna

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.340 
that just click run cleaner I'm gonna
uncheck<00:05:17.450> that<00:05:17.510> because<00:05:17.780> it<00:05:17.990> does<00:05:18.140> take<00:05:18.320> a

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
uncheck that because it does take a

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.240 
uncheck that because it does take a
while<00:05:18.620> for<00:05:18.650> that<00:05:18.920> that<00:05:19.190> happened<00:05:19.510> and<00:05:21.250> once

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
while for that that happened and once

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.820 
while for that that happened and once
that's<00:05:22.370> done<00:05:23.080> it'll<00:05:24.080> show<00:05:24.260> you<00:05:24.350> how<00:05:24.440> much<00:05:24.590> gig

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
that's done it'll show you how much gig

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.580 
that's done it'll show you how much gig
gets<00:05:24.920> removed<00:05:25.220> it<00:05:25.760> didn't<00:05:26.210> not<00:05:26.540> gig<00:05:26.930> but

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
gets removed it didn't not gig but

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.710 
gets removed it didn't not gig but
megabytes<00:05:28.040> or<00:05:28.220> how<00:05:28.370> much<00:05:28.520> space<00:05:28.760> it's<00:05:29.060> cleaned

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
megabytes or how much space it's cleaned

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.900 
megabytes or how much space it's cleaned
for<00:05:30.560> me<00:05:30.710> it<00:05:30.770> was<00:05:30.860> really<00:05:31.220> small<00:05:31.490> because<00:05:31.880> I

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
for me it was really small because I

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.880 
for me it was really small because I
just<00:05:32.210> did<00:05:32.390> this<00:05:32.540> like<00:05:32.750> 5<00:05:32.990> seconds<00:05:33.380> ago<00:05:33.500> but<00:05:33.620> it

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
just did this like 5 seconds ago but it

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.550 
just did this like 5 seconds ago but it
shows<00:05:34.100> actually<00:05:34.610> how<00:05:34.790> much<00:05:35.000> space<00:05:35.930> can<00:05:36.230> add<00:05:36.350> up

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
shows actually how much space can add up

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.040 
shows actually how much space can add up
in<00:05:36.740> a<00:05:37.190> few<00:05:37.460> minutes<00:05:37.760> so<00:05:38.420> just<00:05:38.450> exit<00:05:38.960> out<00:05:39.020> of

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
in a few minutes so just exit out of

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.690 
in a few minutes so just exit out of
that<00:05:39.170> now<00:05:40.070> finally<00:05:40.610> if<00:05:40.790> you're<00:05:41.450> a<00:05:41.570> big<00:05:41.780> gamer

where<00:05:50.720> anything<00:05:50.810> about<00:05:51.080> that<00:05:51.290> I'm<00:05:51.470> going<00:05:51.620> to

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
where anything about that I'm going to

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:58.930 
where anything about that I'm going to
open<00:05:51.890> that<00:05:51.950> up<00:05:54.190> and<00:05:56.770> I'll<00:05:57.770> don't<00:05:58.730> worry<00:05:58.850> I'll

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
open that up and I'll don't worry I'll

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.390 
open that up and I'll don't worry I'll
put<00:05:59.060> a<00:05:59.120> link<00:05:59.330> as<00:05:59.510> I<00:05:59.960> said<00:06:00.140> before<00:06:00.260> so<00:06:00.980> basically

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
put a link as I said before so basically

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.630 
put a link as I said before so basically
what<00:06:01.610> this<00:06:01.790> does<00:06:01.850> is<00:06:02.420> this<00:06:03.040> speeds<00:06:04.040> up<00:06:04.250> or<00:06:04.460> like

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
what this does is this speeds up or like

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.790 
what this does is this speeds up or like
disables<00:06:05.180> all<00:06:05.420> unnecessary<00:06:05.810> programs<00:06:06.620> in<00:06:06.740> the

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
disables all unnecessary programs in the

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.290 
disables all unnecessary programs in the
background<00:06:07.250> while<00:06:07.700> you're<00:06:07.910> playing<00:06:08.090> the<00:06:08.210> game

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
background while you're playing the game

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.750 
background while you're playing the game
here<00:06:08.690> I'll<00:06:09.170> show<00:06:10.130> you<00:06:10.160> what<00:06:10.250> it<00:06:10.400> does<00:06:10.430> here

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
here I'll show you what it does here

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.400 
here I'll show you what it does here
start<00:06:11.300> the<00:06:11.420> boost<00:06:12.010> and<00:06:13.840> as<00:06:14.840> you<00:06:14.960> can<00:06:15.050> see<00:06:15.110> it's

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
start the boost and as you can see it's

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.540 
start the boost and as you can see it's
loading<00:06:15.620> and<00:06:16.840> it<00:06:17.840> says<00:06:18.230> performance<00:06:19.190> before

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
loading and it says performance before

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.210 
loading and it says performance before
and<00:06:19.880> then<00:06:20.000> performance<00:06:20.480> after<00:06:20.960> it's<00:06:21.830> 42

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
and then performance after it's 42

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.500 
and then performance after it's 42
percent<00:06:22.490> better<00:06:22.610> that's<00:06:22.820> pretty<00:06:23.090> good<00:06:23.300> I'd

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
percent better that's pretty good I'd

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.390 
percent better that's pretty good I'd
say<00:06:23.750> so<00:06:24.470> this<00:06:24.650> will<00:06:24.800> help<00:06:24.980> you<00:06:25.100> if<00:06:25.250> you're

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
say so this will help you if you're

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.900 
say so this will help you if you're
recording<00:06:25.670> fps<00:06:26.920> because<00:06:27.920> it<00:06:28.100> does<00:06:28.280> drop<00:06:28.550> a<00:06:28.610> lot

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
recording fps because it does drop a lot

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.310 
recording fps because it does drop a lot
when<00:06:29.090> you're<00:06:29.210> recording<00:06:29.450> I<00:06:29.780> usually<00:06:30.170> have

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
when you're recording I usually have

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.860 
when you're recording I usually have
mine<00:06:30.470> at<00:06:30.590> 60<00:06:31.040> and<00:06:31.310> it<00:06:32.000> can<00:06:32.090> go<00:06:32.210> down<00:06:32.420> the<00:06:32.540> 20

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
mine at 60 and it can go down the 20
