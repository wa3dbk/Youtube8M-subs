00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.080 
about where it was I'm using no cutting
board<00:02:20.890> here<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.190> actually<00:02:21.370> use<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.760> cutting

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
board here I actually use a cutting

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.140 
board here I actually use a cutting
board<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.540> do<00:02:22.690> this<00:02:23.280> but<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.730> can<00:02:24.760> use<00:02:24.940> a

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
board to do this but you can use a

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
board to do this but you can use a
serrated<00:02:25.750> knife<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:27.480> slide<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.690> back<00:02:29.140> and

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
serrated knife and slide it back and

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.410 
serrated knife and slide it back and
forth<00:02:29.470> very<00:02:30.010> gently<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.640> don't<00:02:30.820> have<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.090> bear

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
forth very gently you don't have to bear

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.090 
forth very gently you don't have to bear
down<00:02:31.690> much<00:02:31.960> at<00:02:32.170> all<00:02:32.320> or<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.500> crack<00:02:32.890> the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
down much at all or you crack the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.710 
down much at all or you crack the
crackers<00:02:34.230> but<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.410> can<00:02:35.710> use<00:02:35.980> that<00:02:36.720> quite

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
crackers but you can use that quite

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.950 
crackers but you can use that quite
effectively<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.500> cut<00:02:38.760> square<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.480> straight

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
effectively to cut square and straight

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.380 
effectively to cut square and straight
lines<00:02:41.230> in<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.860> crackers<00:02:42.430> now<00:02:43.030> you'll<00:02:43.210> notice

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
lines in the crackers now you'll notice

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.020 
lines in the crackers now you'll notice
that<00:02:43.510> we<00:02:43.780> cut<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.890> crackers<00:02:45.340> on<00:02:45.490> an<00:02:45.640> angle

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
that we cut the crackers on an angle

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.230 
that we cut the crackers on an angle
here<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:46.390> we<00:02:46.510> can<00:02:46.690> angle<00:02:46.990> our<00:02:47.140> roof<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:48.240> we're

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
here so we can angle our roof and we're

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.840 
here so we can angle our roof and we're
using<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.990> bag<00:02:50.770> to<00:02:51.550> apply<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.350> icing<00:02:53.350> glue

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
using the bag to apply the icing glue

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.460 
using the bag to apply the icing glue
which<00:02:54.850> is<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:55.330> same<00:02:55.600> mixture<00:02:56.080> that<00:02:56.230> we<00:02:56.380> were

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
which is that same mixture that we were

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.290 
which is that same mixture that we were
beating<00:02:56.860> up<00:02:56.980> before<00:02:57.400> in<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:58.770> bowl<00:02:59.770> and<00:03:00.300> we're

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
beating up before in the bowl and we're

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.870 
beating up before in the bowl and we're
going<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.450> apply<00:03:01.570> that<00:03:01.960> around<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.440> edges<00:03:02.620> of

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
going to apply that around the edges of

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.270 
going to apply that around the edges of
everything<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.090> then<00:03:04.290> lay<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.530> crackers<00:03:06.070> in

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
everything and then lay the crackers in

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.460 
everything and then lay the crackers in
place<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:08.290> glue<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.310> stiffer<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:11.140> you<00:03:11.260> can

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
place the glue the stiffer that you can

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.850 
place the glue the stiffer that you can
make<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.800> glue<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.250> better<00:03:12.600> otherwise

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
make the glue the better otherwise

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.590 
make the glue the better otherwise
things<00:03:14.860> on<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.040> vertical<00:03:15.340> surface<00:03:15.580> tend<00:03:16.480> to

things on a vertical surface tend to

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.530 
things on a vertical surface tend to
slide<00:03:16.900> off<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.550> candies<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.880> heavier<00:03:19.209> ones

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
slide off and candies the heavier ones

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.229 
slide off and candies the heavier ones
may<00:03:19.810> slide<00:03:20.080> off<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.560> roof<00:03:20.910> now<00:03:21.910> we're<00:03:22.120> just

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
may slide off the roof now we're just

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.660 
may slide off the roof now we're just
building<00:03:22.720> this<00:03:22.900> little<00:03:23.290> Gable<00:03:23.830> out<00:03:24.040> over<00:03:24.489> the

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
building this little Gable out over the

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.390 
building this little Gable out over the
the<00:03:25.300> front<00:03:25.630> door<00:03:26.020> and<00:03:26.260> then<00:03:26.830> we're<00:03:27.370> finished

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
the front door and then we're finished

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.430 
the front door and then we're finished
the<00:03:27.970> first<00:03:28.239> day<00:03:28.510> with<00:03:28.750> something<00:03:29.110> that<00:03:29.260> looks

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
the first day with something that looks

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.220 
the first day with something that looks
something<00:03:29.709> like<00:03:29.890> this<00:03:30.480> you<00:03:31.480> can<00:03:31.840> use<00:03:32.050> the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
something like this you can use the

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.680 
something like this you can use the
leftover<00:03:32.680> icing<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.820> make<00:03:33.850> icicles<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.950> it

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
leftover icing to make icicles and it

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.090 
leftover icing to make icicles and it
lasts<00:03:37.690> probably<00:03:38.260> overnight<00:03:38.770> in<00:03:38.980> the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
lasts probably overnight in the

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.280 
lasts probably overnight in the
refrigerator<00:03:39.760> just<00:03:39.880> fine<00:03:40.360> but<00:03:40.930> we're<00:03:41.110> making

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
refrigerator just fine but we're making

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.860 
refrigerator just fine but we're making
more<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.890> next<00:03:42.220> day<00:03:42.459> because<00:03:43.209> we're<00:03:43.660> using

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
more the next day because we're using

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.500 
more the next day because we're using
this<00:03:44.230> batch<00:03:44.739> now<00:03:45.630> to<00:03:46.630> apply<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:48.190> candies<00:03:48.790> here

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
this batch now to apply the candies here

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.380 
this batch now to apply the candies here
we're<00:03:49.690> separating<00:03:50.470> some<00:03:51.160> gumdrops

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
we're separating some gumdrops

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.630 
we're separating some gumdrops
they<00:03:53.230> come<00:03:53.500> as<00:03:53.709> red<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.130> green<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.519> we're

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
they come as red and green and we're

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.720 
they come as red and green and we're
going<00:03:54.760> to<00:03:54.790> put<00:03:55.060> about<00:03:55.320> 40<00:03:56.320> of<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.800> green<00:03:57.430> ones

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
going to put about 40 of the green ones

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.930 
going to put about 40 of the green ones
in<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:58.030> bowl<00:03:58.269> and<00:03:58.570> maybe<00:03:59.380> about<00:03:59.680> 10<00:04:00.040> of<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.730> red

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
in a bowl and maybe about 10 of the red

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.180 
in a bowl and maybe about 10 of the red
ones<00:04:01.260> then<00:04:02.260> we're<00:04:02.440> going<00:04:02.560> to<00:04:02.590> use<00:04:02.650> an<00:04:02.980> ice

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
ones then we're going to use an ice

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.490 
ones then we're going to use an ice
cream<00:04:03.250> cone<00:04:03.970> a<00:04:04.030> sugar<00:04:04.420> cone<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:05.050> one<00:04:05.230> that's

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
cream cone a sugar cone the one that's

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.900 
cream cone a sugar cone the one that's
actually<00:04:05.830> cone<00:04:06.519> shape<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:08.370> using<00:04:09.370> a<00:04:09.459> red<00:04:09.730> one

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
actually cone shape and using a red one

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.199 
actually cone shape and using a red one
on<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.180> top<00:04:10.450> we're<00:04:11.440> going<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.650> actually<00:04:12.209> cut

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
on the top we're going to actually cut

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.800 
on the top we're going to actually cut
all<00:04:13.510> of<00:04:13.540> these<00:04:15.870> gumdrops<00:04:16.870> in<00:04:17.560> half<00:04:18.810> lengthwise

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
all of these gumdrops in half lengthwise

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.890 
all of these gumdrops in half lengthwise
and<00:04:20.760> it<00:04:21.760> makes<00:04:22.120> applying<00:04:22.539> them<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.830> sides

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
and it makes applying them to the sides

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.270 
and it makes applying them to the sides
so<00:04:25.900> much<00:04:26.110> easier<00:04:26.560> to<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.830> size<00:04:27.070> of

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
so much easier to the size of

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.420 
so much easier to the size of
the<00:04:27.400> cone<00:04:27.700> and<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:29.350> weight<00:04:29.560> isn't<00:04:29.830> so<00:04:30.130> great

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
the cone and the weight isn't so great

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.150 
the cone and the weight isn't so great
either<00:04:30.639> you<00:04:31.120> start<00:04:31.420> from<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.810> top<00:04:32.080> and<00:04:32.470> work

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
either you start from the top and work

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.270 
either you start from the top and work
your<00:04:33.190> way<00:04:33.550> down<00:04:34.230> and<00:04:35.230> they<00:04:35.530> stick<00:04:35.860> in<00:04:36.010> place

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
your way down and they stick in place

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.129 
your way down and they stick in place
quite<00:04:37.120> well<00:04:37.389> and<00:04:38.070> after<00:04:39.070> we<00:04:39.660> apply<00:04:40.660> all<00:04:41.080> of

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
quite well and after we apply all of

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.810 
quite well and after we apply all of
these<00:04:41.620> with<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.639> red<00:04:43.630> gumdrops

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
these with the red gumdrops
