 National Water Commission 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.000
 and there was good morning there Tuesday 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.740
 Tuesday December 18 and the service 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.170
 reported national record inform you 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.820
 we have for this time a great system the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.680
 cold air system are what is the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.140
 southwest of today an American and that little 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.820
 little will advance towards the republic 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.919
 mexicana to you from you that this 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.320
 system but then it 's number 16 in 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.419
 cold front number 16 and that will advance 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.460
 towards the northwest of the republic 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.590
 Mexican is going to be associated with this great 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.720
 Low pressure and current channel 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.920
 of winds what is both the 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.899
 maximum meter currents like that of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.330
 jet and will cause us a large area 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.530
 of cloudiness a lot of instability and from 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.660
 then rainfall that even 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.460
 could give us some snow both in 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.740
 the murmur as the highs of the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.140
 state of sound while the front 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.510
 number 15 already begins to have a lot 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.820
 weakness is dissipating there in what 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.460
 which is the southern Gulf of Mexico and the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.900
 country dominated then one side its greatest 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.640
 part by high pressure systems 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.739
 systems that are giving this the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.600
 stability little humidity little 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.790
 precipitation very low temperatures by 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.530
