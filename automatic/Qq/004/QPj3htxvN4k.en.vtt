corset
she<00:00:16.049> has<00:00:16.260> scoliosis<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.100> thought<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.400> would

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
she has scoliosis so I thought I would

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.150 
she has scoliosis so I thought I would
actually<00:00:17.760> document<00:00:18.630> um<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.529> making<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.980> this

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
actually document um the making of this

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.279 
actually document um the making of this
corset<00:00:20.609> for<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.480> can<00:00:21.660> actually<00:00:21.840> see

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
corset for you so you can actually see

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.490 
corset for you so you can actually see
how<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.859> go<00:00:23.640> through<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.000> fittings<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.660> her<00:00:24.810> so

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
how I go through the fittings for her so

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.920 
how I go through the fittings for her so
you<00:00:26.189> can't<00:00:26.880> see<00:00:27.029> her<00:00:27.180> spine<00:00:27.510> through<00:00:27.840> this

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
you can't see her spine through this

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.070 
you can't see her spine through this
shirt<00:00:28.260> but<00:00:28.560> basically<00:00:28.920> um<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:30.269> starts<00:00:30.599> at<00:00:30.869> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
shirt but basically um it starts at the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.380 
shirt but basically um it starts at the
name<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> neck<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.920> comes<00:00:32.189> over<00:00:32.460> on<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
name of the neck it comes over on the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.440 
name of the neck it comes over on the
upper<00:00:33.719> back<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.590> right<00:00:34.770> side<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.460> then<00:00:35.940> on

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
upper back on the right side and then on

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.060 
upper back on the right side and then on
the<00:00:36.540> lower<00:00:36.750> back<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.260> comes<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.739> through<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
the lower back it comes in through the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.610 
the lower back it comes in through the
left<00:00:38.489> side<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.090> then<00:00:39.210> down<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.230> she<00:00:40.350> actually

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
left side and then down so she actually

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.760 
left side and then down so she actually
has<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> double<00:00:41.399> curve<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.270> what<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.140> means<00:00:43.469> is

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
has a double curve so what this means is

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.729 
has a double curve so what this means is
her<00:00:44.399> shoulders<00:00:45.300> aren't<00:00:45.480> even<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.140> her<00:00:46.500> hips

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
her shoulders aren't even and her hips

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.279 
her shoulders aren't even and her hips
aren't<00:00:46.950> even<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.460> also<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.840> amount<00:00:49.079> of

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
aren't even and also the amount of

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.560 
aren't even and also the amount of
restriction<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.039> each<00:00:50.280> side<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.610> her<00:00:50.820> waist<00:00:51.180> is

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
restriction on each side of her waist is

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.260 
restriction on each side of her waist is
different<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.559> need<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.010> take<00:00:53.270> separate

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
different so I need to take separate

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.939 
different so I need to take separate
measurements<00:00:54.570> for<00:00:54.870> her<00:00:54.989> left<00:00:55.199> side<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.739> her

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
measurements for her left side and her

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.860 
measurements for her left side and her
right<00:00:56.190> side<00:00:56.219> which<00:00:57.120> means<00:00:57.360> she's<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
right side which means she's going to

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.740 
right side which means she's going to
have<00:00:57.989> an<00:00:58.109> asymmetric<00:00:58.710> corset<00:00:59.219> but<00:00:59.940> when<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
have an asymmetric corset but when the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.720 
have an asymmetric corset but when the
corset<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.140> actually<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.829> her<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.250> will<00:01:02.399> make

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
corset is actually on her it will make

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.509 
corset is actually on her it will make
her<00:01:02.910> look<00:01:03.149> symmetric<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.010> first<00:01:05.220> thing<00:01:05.400> we

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
her look symmetric so the first thing we

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.390 
her look symmetric so the first thing we
need<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.670> do<00:01:05.909> like<00:01:06.900> any<00:01:07.140> other<00:01:07.380> corset<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:08.280> need

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
need to do like any other corset we need

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.399 
need to do like any other corset we need
to<00:01:08.520> find<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.939> waistline<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.960> I'm<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.229> going

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
to find the waistline so I'm just going

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.789 
to find the waistline so I'm just going
to<00:01:10.560> tie<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.770> string<00:01:11.040> around<00:01:11.490> her<00:01:11.670> waist<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
to tie this string around her waist and

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.990 
to tie this string around her waist and
I'm<00:01:13.799> going<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> ask<00:01:14.310> her<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:15.080> UM<00:01:16.610> bend<00:01:17.610> and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
I'm going to ask her to UM bend and

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.859 
I'm going to ask her to UM bend and
twist<00:01:18.409> back<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.619> forth<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.450> settles

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
twist back and forth so that it settles

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:32.569 
twist back and forth so that it settles
at<00:01:22.020> her<00:01:22.170> natural<00:01:22.560> waist

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.999 

the<00:01:33.420> next<00:01:33.689> thing<00:01:33.869> I'm<00:01:33.990> going<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.320> do<00:01:34.560> when<00:01:34.979> I

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the next thing I'm going to do when I

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.819 
the next thing I'm going to do when I
separate<00:01:35.759> our<00:01:36.210> torso<00:01:36.659> into<00:01:36.869> top<00:01:37.380> half<00:01:37.649> and

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
bottom half I'm also going to separate

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.639 
bottom half I'm also going to separate
into<00:01:40.380> left<00:01:41.310> half<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.820> right<00:01:42.090> half<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:43.020> what<00:01:43.619> I

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
into left half and right half so what I

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.100 
into left half and right half so what I
have<00:01:43.920> here<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.219> just<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.520> pan<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> string<00:01:45.840> but

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
have here is just a pan on a string but

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.200 
have here is just a pan on a string but
take<00:01:46.409> any<00:01:46.590> sort<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.920> plumb-bob<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.699 

hang<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.390> from<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.899> nape<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.289> neck<00:01:52.380> until

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
hang it from the nape of the neck until

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:55.340 
hang it from the nape of the neck until
it<00:01:53.009> goes<00:01:53.159> down<00:01:53.219> and<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.450> see<00:01:54.689> here<00:01:55.049> that

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
it goes down and you can see here that

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.160 
it goes down and you can see here that
even<00:01:55.950> at<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.340> nape<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.549> her<00:01:56.789> neck<00:01:56.819> it<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.659> not

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
even at the nape of her neck it is not

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.289 
even at the nape of her neck it is not
hanging<00:01:58.500> right<00:01:58.950> at<00:01:59.130> her<00:01:59.310> tailbone<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.060> just

hanging right at her tailbone so just

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.949 
hanging right at her tailbone so just
try<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.509> approximate<00:02:00.869> as<00:02:01.319> best<00:02:01.500> as<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:02.009> um

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
try to approximate as best as you can um

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.350 
try to approximate as best as you can um
where<00:02:03.959> the<00:02:04.170> center<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.829> their<00:02:05.549> body<00:02:05.789> is<00:02:05.939> and

where the center of their body is and
can<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.289> actually<00:02:07.470> hold<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.069> with<00:02:08.940> one<00:02:09.090> hand

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
can you actually hold this with one hand

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
and I'm just going to take some masking

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.170 
and I'm just going to take some masking
tape<00:02:12.269> and<00:02:13.760> separate<00:02:15.739> our<00:02:16.739> body<00:02:16.980> into<00:02:17.519> left<00:02:18.030> and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
tape and separate our body into left and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:27.160 
tape and separate our body into left and
right<00:02:18.360> half

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.949

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.729 

that's<00:02:32.829> good<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:34.230> we're<00:02:35.230> just<00:02:35.349> going<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.620> do

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
that's good and we're just going to do

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.369 
that's good and we're just going to do
the<00:02:35.829> same<00:02:36.040> thing<00:02:36.310> for<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.609> right<00:02:36.790> side<00:02:37.379> and

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
the same thing for the right side and

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:39.929 
the same thing for the right side and
just<00:02:38.590> can<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:38.980> hold<00:02:39.189> that<00:02:39.400> for<00:02:39.459> me<00:02:39.700> right

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
just can you hold that for me right

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:52.619 
just can you hold that for me right
there

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.809 

so<00:02:53.629> now<00:02:54.079> you<00:02:54.140> can<00:02:54.439> see<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:54.920> her<00:02:55.099> body<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.519> or

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
so now you can see that her body is or

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.360 
so now you can see that her body is or
her<00:02:56.000> torso<00:02:56.209> is<00:02:56.480> separated<00:02:56.900> into<00:02:56.989> four<00:02:57.370> above

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
her torso is separated into four above

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.459 
her torso is separated into four above
the<00:02:58.489> waist<00:02:58.670> below<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.209> way<00:02:59.299> waist<00:02:59.810> on<00:03:00.170> the

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:00.469 
the waist below the way waist on the

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:01.869 
the waist below the way waist on the
left<00:03:00.650> side<00:03:00.829> and<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.099> right<00:03:01.129> side<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:01.700> now<00:03:01.819> we

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
left side and the right side so now we

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.660 
left side and the right side so now we
can<00:03:02.060> start<00:03:02.150> taking<00:03:02.390> our<00:03:02.629> measurements<00:03:03.670> first

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
can start taking our measurements first

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.670 
can start taking our measurements first
I<00:03:05.060> measured<00:03:05.510> her<00:03:05.659> waist<00:03:05.900> at<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.319> point<00:03:06.560> of

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
I measured her waist at the point of

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.360 
I measured her waist at the point of
this<00:03:06.890> string

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
this string

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.910 
this string
I<00:03:07.400> took<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.329> total<00:03:08.689> circumference<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.530> I

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
I took the total circumference and I

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.949 
I took the total circumference and I
also<00:03:10.099> used<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.819> tape<00:03:11.060> guidelines<00:03:11.689> to

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
also used the tape guidelines to

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.990 
also used the tape guidelines to
separate<00:03:12.409> the<00:03:12.650> waist<00:03:12.889> measurement<00:03:13.129> into<00:03:13.609> left

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
separate the waist measurement into left

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.140 
separate the waist measurement into left
waist<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.750> right<00:03:15.230> waist

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.330 

next<00:03:20.150> is<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.420> underbust<00:03:20.870> measurement<00:03:21.500> just

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
next is the underbust measurement just

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.490 
next is the underbust measurement just
as<00:03:22.489> before<00:03:22.969> I<00:03:23.209> took<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.689> total<00:03:23.989> circumference

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
as before I took the total circumference

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:32.720 
as before I took the total circumference
and<00:03:24.969> separated<00:03:25.969> left<00:03:26.359> side<00:03:26.689> and<00:03:27.019> right<00:03:27.049> side

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.570 

I<00:03:32.790> also<00:03:33.750> have<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.530> take<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:35.010> length<00:03:35.250> from

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
I also have to take the length from

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.300 
I also have to take the length from
underbust<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.690> waste<00:03:36.900> on<00:03:37.200> both<00:03:37.530> sides<00:03:37.890> because

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
underbust to waste on both sides because

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.600 
underbust to waste on both sides because
they<00:03:38.790> are<00:03:38.940> different

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.720 

here<00:03:44.510> I'm<00:03:44.720> taking<00:03:45.050> the<00:03:45.470> height<00:03:45.710> of<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.310> center

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
here I'm taking the height of the center

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.060 
here I'm taking the height of the center
front<00:03:47.060> of<00:03:47.270> the<00:03:47.420> corset<00:03:47.870> from<00:03:48.290> top<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.560> waist

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
front of the corset from top to waist

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.400 
front of the corset from top to waist
where<00:03:49.790> she<00:03:49.970> wants<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.390> peak<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:50.840> be<00:03:51.020> in<00:03:51.260> the

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
where she wants the peak to be in the

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.760 
where she wants the peak to be in the
front<00:03:51.650> I<00:03:52.570> also<00:03:53.570> take<00:03:54.020> the<00:03:54.290> vertical

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
front I also take the vertical

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.220 
front I also take the vertical
measurement<00:03:55.280> from<00:03:55.640> top<00:03:56.060> to<00:03:56.360> waist<00:03:56.720> line<00:03:56.960> at

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
measurement from top to waist line at

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.800 
measurement from top to waist line at
the<00:03:57.440> back<00:03:57.650> she<00:03:58.490> wants<00:03:58.850> it<00:03:58.970> higher<00:03:59.240> than<00:03:59.630> her

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
the back she wants it higher than her

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.530 
the back she wants it higher than her
bra<00:04:00.020> band<00:04:00.350> so<00:04:00.710> it<00:04:00.860> won't<00:04:01.070> show<00:04:01.190> but<00:04:02.120> lower<00:04:02.360> than

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
bra band so it won't show but lower than

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.750 
bra band so it won't show but lower than
her<00:04:02.870> wing<00:04:03.080> bones<00:04:03.320> so<00:04:03.740> her<00:04:03.920> arm<00:04:04.130> movement<00:04:04.640> won't

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
her wing bones so her arm movement won't

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.790 
her wing bones so her arm movement won't
be<00:04:04.940> hindered

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.910 

I<00:04:09.120> asked<00:04:10.120> her<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.450> put<00:04:10.810> her<00:04:11.050> thumbs<00:04:11.380> where<00:04:11.770> her

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
I asked her to put her thumbs where her

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.430 
I asked her to put her thumbs where her
high<00:04:12.130> hips<00:04:12.430> start<00:04:12.880> and<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.810> keep<00:04:13.990> them<00:04:14.260> there

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
high hips start and to keep them there

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.740 
high hips start and to keep them there
the<00:04:14.650> whole<00:04:14.830> time<00:04:14.860> so<00:04:15.730> I<00:04:15.760> can<00:04:16.030> get<00:04:16.209> an<00:04:16.299> accurate

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
the whole time so I can get an accurate

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.770 
the whole time so I can get an accurate
measurement<00:04:17.110> just<00:04:17.470> like<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.610> other

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
measurement just like the other

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.060 
measurement just like the other
circumferential<00:04:19.780> measurements<00:04:20.350> I<00:04:20.470> took<00:04:20.799> note

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
circumferential measurements I took note

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.670 
circumferential measurements I took note
of<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.519> total<00:04:21.970> left<00:04:22.630> hip<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.020> right<00:04:23.440> hip

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
of the total left hip and right hip

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.910 
of the total left hip and right hip
measurements<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:26.020> can<00:04:26.050> see<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.530> difference

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
measurements you can see the difference

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.950 
measurements you can see the difference
in<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.190> angle<00:04:27.580> between<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:28.180> waistline<00:04:28.660> and

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
in the angle between the waistline and

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.150 
in the angle between the waistline and
the<00:04:29.110> hip<00:04:29.290> line

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.850 

the<00:04:34.790> vertical<00:04:35.270> distance<00:04:35.660> from<00:04:36.020> her<00:04:36.260> waist<00:04:36.440> to

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
the vertical distance from her waist to

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.980 
the vertical distance from her waist to
left<00:04:37.100> hip<00:04:37.340> is<00:04:37.550> three<00:04:37.910> inches<00:04:38.210> whereas<00:04:38.720> the

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
left hip is three inches whereas the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.500 
left hip is three inches whereas the
distance<00:04:39.200> from<00:04:39.740> waist<00:04:40.100> to<00:04:40.280> right<00:04:40.700> hip<00:04:40.970> is<00:04:41.150> four

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
distance from waist to right hip is four

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.870 
distance from waist to right hip is four
inches<00:04:41.840> this<00:04:42.650> is<00:04:42.710> why<00:04:43.040> and<00:04:43.400> off-the-rack

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
inches this is why and off-the-rack

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.090 
inches this is why and off-the-rack
corset<00:04:44.360> wouldn't<00:04:44.780> fit<00:04:44.960> her<00:04:45.140> and<00:04:45.350> why<00:04:45.890> it's

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
corset wouldn't fit her and why it's

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.310 
corset wouldn't fit her and why it's
important<00:04:46.610> to<00:04:46.640> separate<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.360> body<00:04:47.600> into<00:04:48.080> left

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
important to separate the body into left

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.660 
important to separate the body into left
and<00:04:48.530> right<00:04:48.830> halves<00:04:50.860> here<00:04:51.860> she's<00:04:52.220> showing<00:04:52.490> me

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670
