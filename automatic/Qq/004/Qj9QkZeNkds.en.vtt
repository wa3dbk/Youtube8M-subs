over a period of maybe three hours or so
the<00:00:36.120> Sun<00:00:36.500> produced<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:38.149> quite<00:00:39.149> spectacular

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
the Sun produced a quite spectacular

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.500 
the Sun produced a quite spectacular
prominence<00:00:41.100> eruption<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.940> had<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> solar

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
prominence eruption that had a solar

associated<00:00:45.600> with<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.590> I've<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:46.890> never

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
associated with it but I've just never

associated with it but I've just never
seen<00:00:47.870> material<00:00:48.870> released<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.950> before

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
seen material released like this before

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.060 
seen material released like this before
such<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> huge<00:00:51.570> amount<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.199> then<00:00:52.680> fall<00:00:53.039> back

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
such a huge amount and then fall back

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.569 
such a huge amount and then fall back
down<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.850> quite<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.329> spectacular<00:00:55.320> way<00:00:55.620> you

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
down and quite the spectacular way you

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.670 
down and quite the spectacular way you
can<00:00:56.789> see<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> wave<00:00:57.360> coming<00:00:57.960> there's<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> flash

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
can see a wave coming there's the flash

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.970 
can see a wave coming there's the flash
and<00:00:59.370> all<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.850> dark<00:01:00.649> relatively<00:01:01.649> cool

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and all of this dark relatively cool

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.070 
and all of this dark relatively cool
material<00:01:02.399> compared<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:04.369> current<00:01:05.369> Corona

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
falling back down on the Sun you see it

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.780 
falling back down on the Sun you see it
brightened<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:10.080> as<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.560> hits<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.610> solar

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
brightened up as it hits the solar

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.090 
brightened up as it hits the solar
surface<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.049> some<00:01:13.260> places<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.950> even

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
surface and in some places you can even

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.399 
surface and in some places you can even
see<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.970> appears<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.450> get<00:01:15.540> sucked<00:01:15.900> back<00:01:16.020> in

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
see it appears to get sucked back in

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.700 
see it appears to get sucked back in
because<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:16.950> magnetic<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.450> being

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
because it's magnetic and it's being

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.160 
because it's magnetic and it's being
attracted<00:01:19.710> into<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.850> areas<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.750> intense

regions<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.830> looks<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.189> somebody<00:01:26.549> just

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
regions it looks like somebody just

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.630 
regions it looks like somebody just
kicked<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.270> giant<00:01:27.750> clod<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.110> dirt<00:01:28.350> up<00:01:28.829> into<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
kicked a giant clod of dirt up into the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.240 
kicked a giant clod of dirt up into the
air<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.150> then<00:01:30.299> fell<00:01:30.570> back<00:01:30.810> down<00:01:30.860> if<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.040> move

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
air and then fell back down if you move

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.179 
air and then fell back down if you move
up<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.610> slightly<00:01:32.909> hotter<00:01:33.630> temperature<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.650> the

corona Rev around 700,000 degrees

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.039 
corona Rev around 700,000 degrees
the<00:01:40.350> material<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.210> darker<00:01:42.210> because<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.840> rep

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the material is darker because it's rep

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.950 
the material is darker because it's rep
is<00:01:43.229> much<00:01:43.439> cooler<00:01:43.970> but<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.270> still<00:01:45.540> see<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
is much cooler but you can still see the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.899 
is much cooler but you can still see the
wave<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.740> all<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.130> material<00:01:47.340> come

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
wave and all of this material come

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.359 
wave and all of this material come
falling<00:01:48.240> down<00:01:48.470> we<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.649> move<00:01:49.740> up<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.040> even

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
falling down we can move up to even

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.180 
falling down we can move up to even
hotter<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.329> higher<00:01:51.750> area<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
hotter and higher area in the

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.500 
hotter and higher area in the
and<00:01:54.190> then<00:01:54.400> again<00:01:54.940> you<00:01:55.690> see<00:01:55.930> this<00:01:56.710> wave<00:01:57.430> as<00:01:57.880> the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
and then again you see this wave as the

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.980 
and then again you see this wave as the
event<00:01:59.470> lifts<00:01:59.860> off<00:02:00.010> it's<00:02:00.850> even<00:02:01.180> easier<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:01.840> see

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
event lifts off it's even easier to see

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.350 
event lifts off it's even easier to see
here<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:03.010> material<00:02:03.460> is<00:02:03.550> even<00:02:03.820> darker<00:02:04.000> now

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
here the material is even darker now

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.620 
here the material is even darker now
because<00:02:04.930> it's<00:02:05.430> much<00:02:06.430> much<00:02:06.670> cooler<00:02:06.940> than<00:02:07.390> the

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
because it's much much cooler than the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.450 
because it's much much cooler than the
corona<00:02:07.960> at<00:02:08.170> this<00:02:08.320> point<00:02:08.590> which<00:02:08.800> is<00:02:08.920> about<00:02:09.160> two

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
corona at this point which is about two

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.120 
corona at this point which is about two
million<00:02:09.730> degrees<00:02:10.260> you<00:02:11.260> can<00:02:11.380> see<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.680> falling

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
million degrees you can see it falling

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.170 
million degrees you can see it falling
down<00:02:12.810> heating<00:02:13.810> up<00:02:13.930> as<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.230> hits<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.590> surface

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
down heating up as it hits the surface

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.820 
down heating up as it hits the surface
so<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.300> is<00:02:16.480> just<00:02:16.690> really<00:02:16.960> an<00:02:17.200> amazing

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
so this is just really an amazing

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.820 
so this is just really an amazing
amazing<00:02:18.130> event<00:02:18.730> it's<00:02:19.660> not<00:02:20.020> necessarily

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830
