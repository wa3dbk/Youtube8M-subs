00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
the 1.6 inch display at the front so

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.020 
the 1.6 inch display at the front so
that's<00:02:01.250> 220<00:02:02.509> 576<00:02:03.509> resolution<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:05.130> has<00:02:05.399> 5<00:02:05.759> by<00:02:05.969> 4

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
that's 220 576 resolution it has 5 by 4

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.070 
that's 220 576 resolution it has 5 by 4

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
aspect ratio and 176 pixels per inch

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.530 
aspect ratio and 176 pixels per inch
now<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.800> also<00:02:11.069> do<00:02:11.340> have<00:02:11.370> capacitive<00:02:12.270> touch

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
now you also do have capacitive touch

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.400 
now you also do have capacitive touch
buttons

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410

download to applications with the watch

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.300 
download to applications with the watch
and<00:02:57.630> that's<00:02:57.900> basically<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.830> it's<00:02:59.010> as

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
and that's basically it and it's as

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.970 
and that's basically it and it's as
simple<00:02:59.460> as<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.820> now<00:03:00.210> once<00:03:01.050> it's<00:03:01.470> been<00:03:01.740> paired

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
simple as that now once it's been paired

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.370 
simple as that now once it's been paired
to<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.430> phone<00:03:02.670> then<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.270> will<00:03:03.420> start<00:03:03.660> loading

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
to the phone then it will start loading

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.100 
to the phone then it will start loading
which<00:03:04.860> takes<00:03:05.250> around<00:03:05.400> 30<00:03:06.060> seconds<00:03:06.570> or<00:03:06.840> maybe

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
which takes around 30 seconds or maybe

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.680 
which takes around 30 seconds or maybe
slightly<00:03:07.320> more<00:03:07.920> than<00:03:08.550> 30<00:03:08.790> seconds<00:03:09.240> and<00:03:09.450> yeah

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
slightly more than 30 seconds and yeah

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.420 
slightly more than 30 seconds and yeah
that's<00:03:09.870> all<00:03:10.020> you<00:03:10.050> need<00:03:10.350> all<00:03:10.920> right<00:03:11.070> so<00:03:11.190> here<00:03:11.340> is

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
a quick look at the UI and it's very

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.410 
a quick look at the UI and it's very
straightforward<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.430> straight<00:03:15.000> away<00:03:15.240> when

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
straightforward and straight away when

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.750 
straightforward and straight away when
you<00:03:15.570> left<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.140> watch<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.920> will<00:03:17.100> bring<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:17.520> to

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
the app tray which is quite minimal as

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.620 
the app tray which is quite minimal as
this<00:03:20.010> kind<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.340> device<00:03:20.640> is<00:03:20.970> still<00:03:21.240> in<00:03:21.450> its

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
this kind of device is still in its

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.810 
this kind of device is still in its
developing<00:03:22.200> process<00:03:22.650> now<00:03:23.250> when<00:03:23.459> downloading

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
developing process now when downloading

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.030 
developing process now when downloading
applications<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.930> just<00:03:25.170> have<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.620> open<00:03:25.650> the

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
applications you just have to open the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.220 
applications you just have to open the
SmartWatch<00:03:26.520> 2<00:03:26.580> app<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.390> I<00:03:27.630> will<00:03:27.780> show<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.020> all

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
SmartWatch 2 app and I will show you all

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.050 
SmartWatch 2 app and I will show you all
the<00:03:28.260> available<00:03:28.500> apps<00:03:29.040> for<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.520> watch<00:03:29.670> now

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
the available apps for the watch now

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.540 
the available apps for the watch now
as<00:03:30.480> I<00:03:30.750> have<00:03:30.840> mentioned<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.709> applications<00:03:32.370> are

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
as I have mentioned the applications are

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.550 
as I have mentioned the applications are
still<00:03:32.700> quite<00:03:33.060> limited<00:03:33.570> but<00:03:33.840> I<00:03:34.050> guess

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
still quite limited but I guess

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.870 
still quite limited but I guess
throughout<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.130> time<00:03:35.370> we<00:03:35.610> will<00:03:35.700> definitely

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
throughout the time we will definitely

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.090 
throughout the time we will definitely
see<00:03:36.510> more<00:03:36.750> available<00:03:37.200> apps<00:03:37.470> for<00:03:37.740> the<00:03:37.860> watch

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
see more available apps for the watch

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.280 
see more available apps for the watch
but<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:39.090> guess<00:03:39.450> that's<00:03:39.570> what<00:03:39.690> we<00:03:39.990> can<00:03:40.080> show<00:03:40.260> to

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
but I guess that's what we can show to

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.170 
but I guess that's what we can show to
all<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.800> you<00:03:40.920> for<00:03:41.130> now<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.430> if<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:41.850> enjoyed

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
all of you for now and if you enjoyed
