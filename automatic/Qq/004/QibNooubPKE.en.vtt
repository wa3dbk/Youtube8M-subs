00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.840 

I've<00:00:01.050> just<00:00:01.230> been<00:00:01.380> greasing<00:00:02.040> the<00:00:02.220> bearings<00:00:02.730> on

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
I've just been greasing the bearings on

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:03.830 
I've just been greasing the bearings on
the<00:00:02.879> muck<00:00:03.120> spur<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:03.480> that's<00:00:03.629> in<00:00:03.750> another

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
the muck spur and that's in another

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.349 
the muck spur and that's in another
video<00:00:04.290> of<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.529> on<00:00:04.680> what<00:00:04.859> YouTube<00:00:05.279> but<00:00:05.970> I'm

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
video of the on what YouTube but I'm

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:07.940 
video of the on what YouTube but I'm
also<00:00:06.569> looking<00:00:06.750> at<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.049> change<00:00:07.350> because<00:00:07.890> the

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
also looking at the change because the

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.049 
also looking at the change because the
one<00:00:08.099> thing<00:00:08.250> they<00:00:08.370> couple<00:00:08.760> of<00:00:08.820> things<00:00:08.940> did

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
one thing they couple of things did

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.129 
one thing they couple of things did
happen<00:00:09.150> with<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.540> change<00:00:09.750> they<00:00:09.900> are<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
happen with the change they are the

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.070 
happen with the change they are the
stretch<00:00:10.410> or<00:00:11.370> break<00:00:11.639> or<00:00:12.300> we<00:00:12.450> lose<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.780> old<00:00:12.870> one

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
stretch or break or we lose the old one

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.650 
stretch or break or we lose the old one
now<00:00:13.400> you<00:00:14.400> can<00:00:14.519> see<00:00:14.639> they're<00:00:14.849> spaced<00:00:15.150> along<00:00:15.330> the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
now you can see they're spaced along the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.269 
now you can see they're spaced along the
rotary<00:00:16.109> bar<00:00:16.320> quite<00:00:16.529> evenly<00:00:18.980> and<00:00:19.980> I've<00:00:20.100> got

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
rotary bar quite evenly and I've got

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.130 
rotary bar quite evenly and I've got
here<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> fact<00:00:20.820> fine<00:00:21.000> one<00:00:21.180> that's<00:00:21.359> missing<00:00:21.510> can

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
here a fact fine one that's missing can

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.160 
here a fact fine one that's missing can
you<00:00:22.260> see<00:00:22.500> there<00:00:22.939> there's<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.029> hole<00:00:24.330> where<00:00:25.140> a

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
you see there there's a hole where a

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.529 
you see there there's a hole where a
change<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.710> be<00:00:25.800> dangling<00:00:26.240> now<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.510> a

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
change to be dangling now this is a

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.000 
change to be dangling now this is a
particularly<00:00:27.840> pleasant<00:00:28.050> job<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.710> I've<00:00:28.800> got<00:00:28.920> to

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
particularly pleasant job so I've got to

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.070 
particularly pleasant job so I've got to
clean<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.369> bit<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.699> muck<00:00:29.849> off<00:00:30.029> here<00:00:30.359> then<00:00:31.019> I'm

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
clean this bit of muck off here then I'm

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.950 
clean this bit of muck off here then I'm
going<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.260> jump<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.009> there<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.660> put<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> new

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
going to jump in there and put a new

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.319 
going to jump in there and put a new
earth<00:00:34.200> chain<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.100> I've<00:00:35.190> got<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> step<00:00:36.180> that

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
earth chain on but I've got a step that

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.670 
earth chain on but I've got a step that
is<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:37.100> here's<00:00:39.140> replacement<00:00:40.140> chain<00:00:42.559> so<00:00:43.559> they

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
is and here's replacement chain so they

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.540 
is and here's replacement chain so they
just<00:00:43.890> bolt<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.690> mean<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> only<00:00:45.989> plus<00:00:46.200> side

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
just bolt on I mean the only plus side

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.069 
just bolt on I mean the only plus side
is<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.940> very<00:00:48.149> quick<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.660> because<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
is this is very quick to do because the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.650 
is this is very quick to do because the
bolt<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.559> sheared<00:00:50.039> off<00:00:50.300> what<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> problem

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
bolt is sheared off what the problem

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.180 
bolt is sheared off what the problem
happens<00:00:52.020> sometimes<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.379> lose<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> heads<00:00:52.980> and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
happens sometimes you lose the heads and

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.799 
happens sometimes you lose the heads and
the<00:00:53.460> chainstay<00:00:53.910> dangling<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.480> when<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.660> try

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the chainstay dangling and when you try

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.990 
the chainstay dangling and when you try
and<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.079> bolts<00:00:55.350> off<00:00:55.789> they<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:56.820> all

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and get the bolts off they are all

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.549 
and get the bolts off they are all
seized<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.780> I'm<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.410> that

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
seized on so I'm going to just do that

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:36.670 
seized on so I'm going to just do that
now

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.290 

so<00:01:37.680> support<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> lock<00:01:38.460> nut<00:01:38.490> case<00:01:38.880> comes<00:01:39.150> and

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
so support of a lock nut case comes and

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.520 
so support of a lock nut case comes and
down<00:01:41.000> that's<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.180> bit<00:01:42.330> too<00:01:42.540> long<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:43.050> changed

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
down that's a bit too long that changed

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.080 
down that's a bit too long that changed
one<00:01:43.830> that<00:01:43.980> I've<00:01:44.070> made<00:01:44.220> up<00:01:44.400> myself

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
one that I've made up myself

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.930 
one that I've made up myself
the<00:01:45.990> brush<00:01:46.200> against<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> side<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.370> the<00:01:47.640> much

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
the brush against the side of the much

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.900 
the brush against the side of the much
better<00:01:48.150> so<00:01:48.390> I'm<00:01:48.450> going<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.630> take<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> link<00:01:49.080> over

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.470 

that<00:01:53.910> one<00:01:54.030> less<00:01:54.240> link<00:01:56.000> these<00:01:57.000> chains<00:01:57.300> do

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
that one less link these chains do

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.520 
that one less link these chains do
stretch<00:01:58.040> when<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.160> do<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.580> after<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> while<00:02:00.600> so

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
stretch when you do it after a while so

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.000 
stretch when you do it after a while so
quite<00:02:01.890> often<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.520> have<00:02:02.910> to<00:02:02.940> take<00:02:03.120> a<00:02:03.150> link<00:02:03.390> anyway

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
quite often I have to take a link anyway

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.690 
quite often I have to take a link anyway
here<00:02:05.010> we<00:02:05.100> go<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.370> put<00:02:05.730> on<00:02:05.790> there

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.810 

ideally<00:02:11.700> probably<00:02:12.390> easy<00:02:12.540> with<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> socket<00:02:13.020> set

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
ideally probably easy with a socket set

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.100 
ideally probably easy with a socket set
got<00:02:14.820> it<00:02:14.910> handy<00:02:15.240> at<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.390> moment<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.959> just

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
got it handy at the moment so I just

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:29.800 
got it handy at the moment so I just
used<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.410> couple<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.740> spares

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.280 

the<00:02:30.170> problem<00:02:30.470> is<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:32.060> chain<00:02:32.330> that's<00:02:32.510> broken

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
the problem is the chain that's broken

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.430 
the problem is the chain that's broken
off<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:34.160> somewhere<00:02:34.490> in<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.700> field<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:36.170> thinks

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
off is somewhere in the field you thinks

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.560 
off is somewhere in the field you thinks
about<00:02:36.530> I'll<00:02:36.680> ever<00:02:36.800> find<00:02:37.100> out<00:02:37.250> again<00:02:37.570> because

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
about I'll ever find out again because

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:52.420 
about I'll ever find out again because
you<00:02:38.900> do<00:02:39.050> pick<00:02:39.260> them<00:02:39.410> up<00:02:40.660> here<00:02:41.660> we<00:02:41.750> go<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:52.340> you

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
you do pick them up here we go so you

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.590 
you do pick them up here we go so you
can<00:02:52.550> see<00:02:52.640> they're<00:02:52.790> over<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.000> place<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.330> chain

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
can see they're over the place to chain

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.250 
can see they're over the place to chain
and<00:02:54.190> if<00:02:55.190> I<00:02:55.310> stretch<00:02:55.550> it<00:02:55.700> out<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.060> side<00:02:56.330> you

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
and if I stretch it out to the side you

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.870 
and if I stretch it out to the side you
see<00:02:57.470> there's<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.620> definite<00:02:58.070> clearance<00:02:58.520> there

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
see there's a definite clearance there
