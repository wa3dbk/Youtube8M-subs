00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.180 
and off we go
and<00:02:16.120> it's<00:02:16.690> paired<00:02:16.930> I've<00:02:17.860> got<00:02:18.040> another

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
and it's paired I've got another

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.640 
and it's paired I've got another
Bluetooth<00:02:18.580> keyboard<00:02:19.030> as<00:02:19.090> well<00:02:19.440> so<00:02:20.440> that's

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
Bluetooth keyboard as well so that's

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.760 
Bluetooth keyboard as well so that's
that<00:02:20.860> so<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.250> can<00:02:21.489> now<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:22.690> could<00:02:23.200> do<00:02:23.349> some<00:02:23.560> type

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
that so I can now I could do some type

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.809 
that so I can now I could do some type
in<00:02:24.040> if<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:24.519> wished<00:02:26.280> it's<00:02:27.280> very<00:02:27.519> quick<00:02:27.760> and

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
in if I so wished it's very quick and

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.390 
in if I so wished it's very quick and
easy<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.180> pair<00:02:28.599> well<00:02:29.470> I've<00:02:29.709> just<00:02:29.950> done<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.250> now

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
easy to pair well I've just done it now

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.430 
easy to pair well I've just done it now
in<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.910> space<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.480> this<00:02:31.810> video

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
in the space of this video

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.839 
in the space of this video
so<00:02:33.160> obviously<00:02:33.459> it's<00:02:33.640> very<00:02:33.730> easy<00:02:35.519> let<00:02:36.519> me<00:02:36.550> just

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
so obviously it's very easy let me just

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:42.120 
so obviously it's very easy let me just
open<00:02:37.180> up<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.599> little<00:02:38.220> document<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:41.010> this<00:02:42.010> is

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
open up a little document so this is

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:49.110 
open up a little document so this is
using<00:02:42.310> my<00:02:42.549> nexus<00:02:42.910> 10<00:02:43.209> so<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:47.850> don't<00:02:48.850> even<00:02:48.940> see

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
using my nexus 10 so I don't even see

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.229 
using my nexus 10 so I don't even see
that<00:02:49.269> put<00:02:49.450> up<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.660> talked<00:02:49.870> about<00:02:50.140> an<00:02:51.239> assembly

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
that put up to talked about an assembly

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.030 
that put up to talked about an assembly
size<00:02:52.450> keyboard<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:53.019> it's<00:02:53.530> much<00:02:53.680> better<00:02:53.860> than

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
size keyboard is it's much better than

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.949 
size keyboard is it's much better than
many<00:02:54.220> of<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.519> other<00:02:54.880> small<00:02:55.269> keyboards<00:02:55.750> that<00:02:55.810> I

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
many of the other small keyboards that I

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.780 
many of the other small keyboards that I
could<00:02:56.200> do<00:02:56.290> I<00:02:56.319> find<00:02:56.769> it<00:02:56.890> much<00:02:57.160> easier<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.610> type

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
could do I find it much easier to type

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.660 
could do I find it much easier to type
on<00:02:58.080> in<00:02:59.080> fact<00:02:59.350> it's<00:02:59.530> almost<00:02:59.650> full<00:03:00.040> sized<00:03:00.310> but

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
on in fact it's almost full sized but

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.880 
on in fact it's almost full sized but
not<00:03:00.790> quite<00:03:01.110> but<00:03:02.110> it<00:03:02.200> will<00:03:02.260> feel<00:03:02.410> natural<00:03:02.620> for

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
not quite but it will feel natural for

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.699 
not quite but it will feel natural for
any<00:03:03.069> laptop<00:03:03.310> user<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.690> keys<00:03:04.959> in<00:03:05.319> general

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
any laptop user and the keys in general

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.880 
any laptop user and the keys in general
I<00:03:06.660> feel<00:03:07.660> quite<00:03:07.900> robust<00:03:08.319> they<00:03:08.500> have<00:03:08.650> quite<00:03:08.860> a

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
I feel quite robust they have quite a

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.539 
I feel quite robust they have quite a
nice<00:03:09.069> little<00:03:09.099> curvature<00:03:09.760> on<00:03:10.030> them<00:03:11.250> other<00:03:12.250> than

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
nice little curvature on them other than

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.069 
nice little curvature on them other than
that<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:12.760> don't<00:03:13.000> think<00:03:13.329> it<00:03:13.390> much<00:03:13.510> more<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.840> say

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
that I don't think it much more to say

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.349 
that I don't think it much more to say
