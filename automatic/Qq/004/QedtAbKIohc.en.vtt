00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.740
 they talk a lot in Ukraine 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.850
 I understood one lesson of Ukraine with our threat 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.490
 of independence 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.010
 there is and this is the fifth column in Kazakhstan 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.970
 there is this fifth column 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.730
 is our power exactly our power 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.520
 led by President Nazarbayev and with 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.180
 his cry is oh she pushes us under 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.640
 jarl 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.230
 Russian Empire from which we and 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.899
 freed and therefore above all 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.809
 talking about talking about 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.629
 it is necessary to change our 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.270
 situation we have to talk not only about 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.670
 external enemies who do not sleep with 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.800
 of all parties it is not only Russia 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.079
 whose interests are not only 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.199
 China who is not interested 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.979
 Only America Europe which also 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.390
 your interests on - must not forget about 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.170
 internal enemies 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.509
 it is the enemy internally that Nazarbayev with 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.240
 oh my cry oh i officially declare it and 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:22.890
 therefore, we must first declare 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:27.900
 Nazarbayev ki precisely we must declare 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.600
 we need a new president they time clicking 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.790
 many here if you perceive it 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.860
 only emotionally about Nazarbayev 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.070
 whale and principle and 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.060
 new president supposedly on the other hand we 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.500
 willing to cooperate even with the sultan for 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.390
 maintaining our independence and but we 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.790
 categorical say let Nazarbayev 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.540
 leaves the president let him stay 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.320
 nation leader and let him sit to death 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:02.330
 your photo of the century and when it is needed new 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.760
 young president so that when 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.520
 he will die when our president will not die 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.270
 so that Russia does not use on this 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.850
 situations and so as not to take our therefore 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.870
 Nazarbayev should leave not only because 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.330
 what he had n't done for so many years 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.640
 just for being with his death 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.640
 can do for Kazakhs and for 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.810
 Kazakhstan is much more harmful than when 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.870
 that's why life is better 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.210
 like a man, but during his lifetime Nazarbayev 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.210
 we pose for a new president
