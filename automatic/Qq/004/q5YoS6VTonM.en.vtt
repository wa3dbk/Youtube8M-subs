think<00:00:13.980> for<00:00:14.309> us<00:00:14.460> it's<00:00:14.759> important<00:00:15.240> always<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.630> be

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
think for us it's important always to be

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.740 
think for us it's important always to be
involved<00:00:16.109> with<00:00:16.440> things<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:17.359> impact<00:00:18.359> our

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
involved with things that impact our

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.099 
involved with things that impact our
generation<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.279> for<00:00:20.699> us<00:00:20.730> what<00:00:21.480> it's<00:00:21.960> been

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
generation and so for us what it's been

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.109 
generation and so for us what it's been
a<00:00:22.170> few<00:00:22.439> different<00:00:22.590> things<00:00:22.800> over<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.640> last<00:00:23.730> 10

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
a few different things over the last 10

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.519 
a few different things over the last 10
years<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.539> we've<00:00:24.660> aligned<00:00:24.900> ourselves<00:00:25.109> with

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
years that we've aligned ourselves with

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.929 
years that we've aligned ourselves with
but<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.710> think<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.010> one's<00:00:26.250> really<00:00:26.400> important

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
but I think this one's really important

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.700 
but I think this one's really important
so<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.359> think<00:00:27.480> for<00:00:27.660> us<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:28.050> becoming<00:00:28.560> more

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
so I think for us just becoming more

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.890 
so I think for us just becoming more
aware<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> first<00:00:29.699> step<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.779> know

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
aware of it is the first step you know

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.930 
aware of it is the first step you know
and<00:00:31.109> yeah<00:00:31.289> encouraging<00:00:32.130> our<00:00:32.219> fans<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.730> just

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
and yeah encouraging our fans to just

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.540 
and yeah encouraging our fans to just
become<00:00:33.239> more<00:00:33.870> aware<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.710> know<00:00:34.829> yeah<00:00:35.100> I

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
become more aware that you know yeah I

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.580 
become more aware that you know yeah I
think<00:00:35.730> that's<00:00:36.090> where<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.570> has<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.960> start<00:00:37.260> you

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
think that's where it has to start you

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.979 
think that's where it has to start you
know<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.920> that's<00:00:38.520> kind<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.879> where<00:00:39.090> we<00:00:39.690> have<00:00:39.960> to

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
know and that's kind of where we have to

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.900 
know and that's kind of where we have to
start<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.559> feel<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:40.890> one<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.579> things<00:00:41.790> that

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
start I feel like one of the things that

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.459 
start I feel like one of the things that
we<00:00:42.090> try<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.360> do<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.809> our<00:00:42.870> fans<00:00:43.110> more<00:00:43.320> than

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
we try to do for our fans more than

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.310 
we try to do for our fans more than
anything<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:44.329> lead<00:00:45.329> by<00:00:45.360> example<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:46.140> think

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
anything is lead by example I think

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.799 
anything is lead by example I think
that's<00:00:46.559> important<00:00:47.070> when<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.460> some<00:00:48.450> some

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
that's important when you have some some

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.000 
that's important when you have some some
people<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.079> our<00:00:49.110> fan<00:00:49.289> base<00:00:49.320> are<00:00:49.590> pretty<00:00:49.770> young

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
people in our fan base are pretty young

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.529 
people in our fan base are pretty young

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
and like if you're not doing it it's

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.819 
and like if you're not doing it it's
hard<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.809> preach<00:00:52.020> it

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.009

like to think that that's I'm doing a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.180 
like to think that that's I'm doing a
little<00:01:33.360> bit<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.900> good<00:01:34.080> thing<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.710> worked<00:01:34.979> my

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
little bit of a good thing I worked my

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.920
