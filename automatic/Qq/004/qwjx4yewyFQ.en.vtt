around<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.790> sock<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:28.330> then<00:01:29.260> go<00:01:29.560> ahead<00:01:29.650> and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
around the sock and then go ahead and

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.680 
around the sock and then go ahead and
bobby<00:01:30.040> pin<00:01:30.280> it<00:01:30.400> down<00:01:30.430> where<00:01:31.150> you<00:01:31.300> want<00:01:31.450> it<00:01:31.570> to

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
bobby pin it down where you want it to

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.720 
bobby pin it down where you want it to
fall<00:01:31.900> and<00:01:32.170> do<00:01:32.860> that<00:01:32.980> around<00:01:33.310> with<00:01:33.490> as<00:01:33.610> many

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
fall and do that around with as many

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.310 
fall and do that around with as many
braids<00:01:34.060> as<00:01:34.210> you<00:01:34.330> want<00:01:34.540> to<00:01:34.690> so<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:34.900> can<00:01:35.080> see<00:01:35.290> I

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
braids as you want to so you can see I

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.690 
braids as you want to so you can see I
started<00:01:35.830> in<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.040> center<00:01:36.370> and<00:01:36.580> I'm<00:01:36.670> going

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
started in the center and I'm going

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.810 
started in the center and I'm going
around<00:01:37.180> at<00:01:37.780> angles<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:38.740> kind<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:39.400> placing

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
around at angles and kind of placing

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.690 
around at angles and kind of placing
them<00:01:39.970> as<00:01:40.150> I<00:01:40.270> like<00:01:40.510> and<00:01:40.980> that's<00:01:41.980> basically<00:01:42.580> all

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
them as I like and that's basically all

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.910 
them as I like and that's basically all
that<00:01:42.970> goes<00:01:43.120> into<00:01:43.150> this<00:01:43.540> um<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:44.350> helps<00:01:44.530> if<00:01:44.800> you

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
that goes into this um it helps if you

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.440 
that goes into this um it helps if you
braid<00:01:45.130> it<00:01:45.280> really<00:01:45.640> really<00:01:45.880> tightly<00:01:46.180> because

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
braid it really really tightly because

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.670 
braid it really really tightly because
it<00:01:46.660> makes<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.960> braid<00:01:47.140> show<00:01:47.350> up<00:01:47.500> more

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
it makes the braid show up more

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.950 
it makes the braid show up more
especially<00:01:47.980> if<00:01:48.460> your<00:01:48.880> hair<00:01:48.910> is<00:01:49.180> a<00:01:49.210> bit<00:01:49.480> darker

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
especially if your hair is a bit darker

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.420 
especially if your hair is a bit darker
because<00:01:50.050> it<00:01:50.290> can<00:01:50.410> kind<00:01:50.620> of<00:01:50.740> get<00:01:50.890> lost<00:01:51.070> in<00:01:51.340> the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
because it can kind of get lost in the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.730 
because it can kind of get lost in the
style<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.880> little<00:01:52.060> bit<00:01:52.350> once<00:01:53.350> you've<00:01:53.500> got<00:01:53.620> all

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
style a little bit once you've got all

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.110 
style a little bit once you've got all
your<00:01:53.860> braids<00:01:54.130> then<00:01:54.370> you're<00:01:54.520> gonna<00:01:54.610> take<00:01:54.910> a

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
your braids then you're gonna take a

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.570 
your braids then you're gonna take a
small<00:01:55.540> band<00:01:55.810> and<00:01:56.140> pull<00:01:56.680> it<00:01:56.800> around<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.370> sock

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
small band and pull it around the sock

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.690 
small band and pull it around the sock
so<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.570> hair<00:01:59.380> forms<00:01:59.800> to<00:01:59.980> it<00:02:00.100> like<00:02:00.280> a<00:02:00.310> button

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
so the hair forms to it like a button

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.280 
so the hair forms to it like a button
and<00:02:00.850> then<00:02:01.300> you<00:02:01.330> can<00:02:01.510> go<00:02:01.600> ahead<00:02:01.660> and<00:02:01.750> take<00:02:02.020> all

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
and then you can go ahead and take all

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.960 
and then you can go ahead and take all
of<00:02:02.320> your<00:02:02.560> bobby<00:02:02.740> pins<00:02:02.980> out<00:02:03.190> because<00:02:03.520> they<00:02:03.760> have

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
of your bobby pins out because they have

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.160 
of your bobby pins out because they have
served<00:02:04.210> their<00:02:04.360> purpose<00:02:04.480> and<00:02:04.840> they<00:02:04.960> are<00:02:05.020> all

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
served their purpose and they are all

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.710 
served their purpose and they are all
done<00:02:05.350> so<00:02:06.250> then<00:02:06.430> we<00:02:06.760> just<00:02:06.790> have<00:02:07.030> this<00:02:07.300> extra

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
done so then we just have this extra

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.029 
done so then we just have this extra
hair<00:02:07.870> left<00:02:08.050> over<00:02:08.349> now<00:02:08.500> if<00:02:08.619> your<00:02:08.769> hair<00:02:08.920> is

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
hair left over now if your hair is

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.559 
hair left over now if your hair is
shorter<00:02:09.399> than<00:02:09.550> mine<00:02:09.759> you<00:02:10.030> can<00:02:10.209> just<00:02:10.360> kind<00:02:10.539> of

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
shorter than mine you can just kind of

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.850 
shorter than mine you can just kind of
wrap<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:10.810> around<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.230> base<00:02:11.379> of<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.650> bun<00:02:11.830> and

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
wrap it around the base of the bun and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.350 
wrap it around the base of the bun and
pin<00:02:12.250> it<00:02:12.400> into<00:02:12.519> place<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.819> it<00:02:13.090> will<00:02:13.209> hide

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
pin it into place and it will hide

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.059 
pin it into place and it will hide
nicely<00:02:13.810> but<00:02:14.230> if<00:02:14.349> you<00:02:14.470> have<00:02:14.620> long<00:02:14.830> hair<00:02:15.040> like

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
nicely but if you have long hair like

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.830 
nicely but if you have long hair like
mine<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.879> could<00:02:16.060> try<00:02:16.209> splitting<00:02:16.569> it<00:02:16.690> in<00:02:16.810> half

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
mine you could try splitting it in half

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.790 
mine you could try splitting it in half
and<00:02:17.290> braiding<00:02:17.800> one<00:02:18.010> side

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
and braiding one side

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.920 
and braiding one side
and<00:02:18.890> then<00:02:19.400> once<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.760> side<00:02:20.030> is<00:02:20.210> totally<00:02:20.420> rated

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
and then once that side is totally rated

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.440 
and then once that side is totally rated
you<00:02:21.050> can<00:02:21.200> wrap<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.410> around<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.860> base<00:02:22.300> which<00:02:23.300> is

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
you can wrap it around the base which is

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.670 
you can wrap it around the base which is
what<00:02:23.570> I<00:02:23.600> did<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:23.900> then<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.170> can<00:02:24.380> just<00:02:24.500> pin<00:02:24.650> it

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
what I did and then you can just pin it

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.990 
what I did and then you can just pin it
into<00:02:24.860> place<00:02:24.980> once<00:02:25.430> you've<00:02:25.580> wrapped<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.940> around

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
into place once you've wrapped it around

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.390 
into place once you've wrapped it around
and<00:02:26.540> that's<00:02:27.050> a<00:02:27.170> nice<00:02:27.320> easy<00:02:27.650> way<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.010> kind<00:02:28.280> of

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
and that's a nice easy way to kind of

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.830 
and that's a nice easy way to kind of
incorporate<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:29.090> rest<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.360> your<00:02:29.510> hair<00:02:29.690> into

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
incorporate the rest of your hair into

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.510 
incorporate the rest of your hair into
the<00:02:30.020> hairstyle<00:02:30.530> without<00:02:30.770> having<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.280> spend<00:02:31.460> a

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
the hairstyle without having to spend a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.000 
the hairstyle without having to spend a
lot<00:02:31.730> of<00:02:31.760> effort<00:02:32.030> I<00:02:32.480> did<00:02:32.990> try<00:02:33.200> wrapping<00:02:33.440> my<00:02:33.740> hair

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
lot of effort I did try wrapping my hair

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.740 
lot of effort I did try wrapping my hair
around<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.400> but<00:02:34.550> my<00:02:34.790> hair<00:02:35.030> just<00:02:35.270> it<00:02:35.480> looked

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
around it but my hair just it looked

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.480 
around it but my hair just it looked
really<00:02:36.110> funny<00:02:36.470> because<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.770> have<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.160> much<00:02:37.280> hair

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
really funny because I have so much hair

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.610 
really funny because I have so much hair
left<00:02:37.760> but<00:02:38.480> if<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.780> have<00:02:38.960> shorter<00:02:39.290> hair<00:02:39.320> I

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
left but if you have shorter hair I

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.080 
left but if you have shorter hair I
recommend<00:02:39.800> don't<00:02:40.370> worry<00:02:40.520> about<00:02:40.730> braiding

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
recommend don't worry about braiding

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.000 
recommend don't worry about braiding
just<00:02:41.270> kind<00:02:41.450> of<00:02:41.540> wrap<00:02:42.140> your<00:02:42.320> hair<00:02:42.500> around<00:02:42.530> and
