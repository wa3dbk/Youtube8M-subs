00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.379
 I work from the side of the fireplace but as soon as 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.900
 went over to this side and the brick here 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.730
 This series has already been laid on the solution with 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.289
 both on the one hand and on the other 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.600
 Immediately installed to this brick 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.060
 the floorboard is short but even they 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.400
 above it is not necessary fixed one board 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.830
 the second board is such a bar here 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.060
 that he did not move from that side not 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.210
 had to score 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.870
 the wall of the timber and to the country 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.660
 did not walk back and forth pressed the board 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.230
 Of course everything is temporary, I showed this 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.540
 the board 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.140
 how it happened and everything turned out well 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.590
 installed very smooth and well 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.469
 further laid here such half to 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.809
 this brick is next to the mortar and with 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.370
 the other side did the same 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.180
 I have now found that the size and in 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.730
 vertical 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.170
 size find here this census I 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.600
 stacked on this here's the iron not 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.580
 by chance and now this height is mine too 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.180
 accidentally get that's what I 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.520
 find this size now I will explain 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.869
 I need to do this, of course. 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.030
 surrounded such a pattern for these 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.320
 bricks so that they fit on here 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.000
 this is the iron for this I first take 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.540
 any paper i effort here 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.540
 found and 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:43.700
 for me to find this height here and how 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:48.800
 i found walked to this wall which u 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.070
 I was already done and the top of the brick I 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:57.890
 used to make this kind of brick this 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.720
 bright i always did here and this is the arch 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.360
 so here is moving that is me 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.030
 this brick has become like this 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.060
 wedge and this wedge I have constantly 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.330
 broke down so many bricks of time 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.430
 it took this thing now I'm this one 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.920
 brick lift to the top 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.880
 but I have left the hell else here 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.670
 this damn it will be the top of the brick and 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.030
 now I can calmly this brick 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.770
 cut that is, I have such viburnum already 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.550
 will not be here for such a client 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.760
 brick fight i mean i left this 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.680
 wedge on one side and the other side and 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.180
 principle is not even beautifully obtained 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.600
 now everything will be different I found 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:51.020
 the height of this brick suffered size 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:52.959
 this brick this way knowing that not 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:58.239
 seal the hour here will be that is to me 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.239
 this height should be right here 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:10.459
 I take this size transferred to this 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:13.659
 paper and do on the one hand here 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.920
 then semicircle bend 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.920
 I cut 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.920
 everything 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:28.340
 stand us downed boards 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:32.960
 I do all this with a pencil or 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:36.860
 jigsaw moved here and that I have here 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:39.590
 see when jigsaw sawed jigsaw here 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.410
 such moves and everything turns out somehow 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:48.130
 scored unevenly 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:51.920
 on top of a metal strip like this 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:54.170
 which I pull there I score I score 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.650
 and there and immediately appears here 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:02.420
 such slots where to install such here 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:04.520
 small wedges from the board and here 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.530
 see how further when a brick 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:11.630
 I'm laying a brick here, look, that is 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.510
 even it turns out that is, I do not look at 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.700
 this iron is iron just there 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.840
 the solution gets everything and so here at 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.650
 me coming 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:25.100
 as you have between these bricks 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:28.460
 be parallel friend parallel it 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.070
 It turns out that I do not look at here 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.560
 these look here see here a skull on it 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.900
 attention not pay attention pay on 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.260
 this corner of this brick 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.120
 but to get this here 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.790
 and here it is the royal song so 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.020
 It turned out parallel to this 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.270
 iron from this iron I do so 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.080
 that's the way 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:58.220
 installing brick 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:02.569
 let's see here I installed a brick here 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:05.810
 the brick is pressed strictly along the axis 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:09.289
 here and here it turns out like a gap 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:12.740
 and at the same time it turns out here and here 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:14.960
 pressed it turns out between bricks here 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.479
 there is a gap here that gap I bear 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.330
 pencil here that is this one here 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:25.759
 look no thread this one 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:29.690
 size and moved here as well as transferred 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:36.039
 what size do i get here 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:39.560
 brick make a line in that direction and 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:44.599
 simultaneously with the other 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:47.300
 sides i'm doing exactly the same wedge and with 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:54.319
 this side also carry two bricks cut 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:58.599
 and they two equally fit this 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:06:05.240
 iron they are 2 identical stacked and 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:07.960
 go and level if for example attach 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:12.590
 they will show the price level 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:14.860
 perfect that is they move together to 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.719
 this wedge 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.380
 that is, here is a wedge of this brick and 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:21.840
 it turns out the same 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:29.040
 but these wedges are different because 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:31.590
 what goes nick already turns out not 2 3 points 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.660
 but it is not clear how that is to attach to 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.240
 Him such here such here such that not 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.240
 it turns out here is such here even more 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.510
 out of the turn is done here generally narrow 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.490
 the place turns out this brick 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.940
 but it is imperative that the cube 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:51.810
 between bricks 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:59.120
 here the parallel was it necessarily 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:07:02.720
 you need that parallel so i did 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:06.230
 part of the arch 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.230
 of this fireplace 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.710
 here it looks like this 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.770
 looks like 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:22.680
 there holes did match here 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:22.680
 white then doing this 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:36.370
 we lay this brick immediately goes with me 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.160
 This is here this row moves by level 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:42.160
 in this direction, that is, moving right away 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:45.250
 that I have this arch is not loose 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:48.190
 back and forth and he fits all 

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.720
 bricks are stacked strictly here this 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.030
 wooden date and racks 

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:56.110
 wooden apply and so are you mine 

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:59.819
 way and I get in one 

00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:02.819
 the planes are all bright and brickwork 

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:02.819
 until
