00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
that you can find in the game is burst

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.069 
that you can find in the game is burst

so now you can shoot three bullets at

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.170 
so now you can shoot three bullets at
the<00:01:41.200> same<00:01:41.409> time<00:01:41.650> which<00:01:41.920> should<00:01:42.610> make<00:01:42.759> it<00:01:42.820> a<00:01:42.939> lot

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
the same time which should make it a lot

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.289 
the same time which should make it a lot
easier<00:01:43.920> then<00:01:44.920> we<00:01:45.100> have<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.430> third<00:01:45.700> upgrade

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
you should be able to shoot automatic so

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.480 
you should be able to shoot automatic so
right<00:01:49.900> now<00:01:50.049> as<00:01:50.200> you<00:01:50.290> can<00:01:50.409> see<00:01:50.650> at<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.340> end

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
right now as you can see at the end

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.030 
right now as you can see at the end
there<00:01:51.759> is<00:01:51.909> impact<00:01:52.780> so<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.290> cannot<00:01:53.710> shoot

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
there is impact so you cannot shoot

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.670 
there is impact so you cannot shoot
through<00:01:54.369> walls<00:01:54.399> but<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.329> fourth<00:01:55.600> upgrade<00:01:56.079> you

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
through walls but the fourth upgrade you

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.410 
through walls but the fourth upgrade you
will<00:01:56.799> be<00:01:56.979> able<00:01:57.189> to<00:01:57.490> shoot<00:01:57.670> through<00:01:57.729> walls<00:01:58.240> as

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
will be able to shoot through walls as

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.510 
will be able to shoot through walls as
you<00:01:58.540> can<00:01:58.689> see<00:01:58.840> there<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.140> no<00:01:59.380> impact<00:01:59.770> so<00:02:00.340> if

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
you can see there is no impact so if

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.340 
you can see there is no impact so if
there<00:02:00.729> would<00:02:00.880> be<00:02:00.909> enemies<00:02:01.360> behind<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:02.110> wall

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
there would be enemies behind the wall

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.609 
there would be enemies behind the wall
you<00:02:03.070> can<00:02:03.280> kill<00:02:03.460> them<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:03.939> the<00:02:04.869> fifth<00:02:05.140> upgrade
