00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.440
 well this session we are going to dedicate to 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.440
 certain muscles or muscle groups 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.510
 that women do not have to empower 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.050
 excessively we could talk about 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:36.080
 pectoral we could talk about arm says 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.520
 in general vicente and sad for example 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.260
 twin 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.290
 with the trapeze or trapeze zone 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.000
 Nor it has to work gives a 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.030
 impression of more masculinity 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.790
 and like the pectoral 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.760
 there are other beliefs of what 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.940
 or working it rises as the pectoral 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.020
 nothing is further from the truth because this 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.940
 what it does is flatten the muscle and 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.940
 the sleeve that is nothing more than 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.490
 of water and fat is disappearing what 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.310
 so much the better we do not understand what 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.579
 too much ducts 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.330
 the two exercises of each of these 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:23.280
 muscles three series 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.790
 without working with intensity 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.540
 we will start with pectoral 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.540
 it affects me 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.580
 three series of 15 repetitions 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.350
 controlling the movement 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.770
 and breathing 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.810
 prince we will rest 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.229
 and we will repeat it three times all 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.229
 process 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.800
 well we are in the second exercise 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.590
 for pectoral 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.590
 pÃ©rez on bench with dumbbells 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.280
 15 repetitions 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.400
 resting 30 seconds between sets 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.950
 and we do three series 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.580
 well back 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.300
 ah 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.130
 we have finished these three series with 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.290
 pectorals now let's do 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.630
 biceps the exercises of mÃ­chel there 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.990
 we go 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.990
 we are with the biceps 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:19.010
 let's surf dices 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.430
 with dumbbells we go alternating an arm 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.430
 and the other 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.980
 I said before we will only do the 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.980
 exercises for biceps too 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.760
 in addition three series 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.840
 with 20 repetitions 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.239
 the maximum weight according 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.770
 a certain after three series we 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.140
 we must do this exercise of 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.340
 wonders too good now we are 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:23.320
 in the second exercise for biceps 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.320
 it's the concentrated hull 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.330
 15 repetitions we change to the other arm 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.870
 think that the series are long so 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.360
 both the weight should not be excessive either 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.780
 and we will not make the whole series 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.780
 complete 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.000
 when we find endless 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.000
 repetitions we change to the other arm 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.770
 15 repetitions 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.600
 we change the other arm again 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.900
 so up to four times and each arm 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.330
 well today we finished the bice of 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.990
 pectoral just tell you that these 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.570
 exercises the soil include 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.310
 the routine of other days along with the 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.920
 back as 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.960
 with shoulder longer routines until being 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.320
 shorter I include it 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.860
 new trapeze work already 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.740
 is involved when we do 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.840
 shoulders therefore is not an area like 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.259
 I said at the beginning of the session 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.530
 today that we do not have to boost 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:56.530
 precisely 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.240
 and we also train them together 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.509
 with the leg 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.250
 so this is simply a 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.770
 training on a specific day but 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.910
 small things that you can include in 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.100
 the trainings 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.680
 and for the next deliveries we will leave 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.050
 to dominate the gluteus which is an area that 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.770
 you know we work practically every 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.340
 day or should we do it 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.340
 bye 

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:41.340
 louis 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.340
 here
