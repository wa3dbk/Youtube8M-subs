00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
see that it says I work for a large

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.039 
see that it says I work for a large
illiquid<00:01:26.220> company<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.240> two<00:01:27.509> Master

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
illiquid company and we have two Master

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.590 
illiquid company and we have two Master
chemists<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.650> say<00:01:28.979> there<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.340> no<00:01:29.729> way<00:01:30.240> to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
chemists that say there is no way to

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.039 
chemists that say there is no way to
speed<00:01:31.259> up<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.680> steeping<00:01:32.220> process<00:01:32.780> heat<00:01:33.780> will

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
speed up the steeping process heat will

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.380 
speed up the steeping process heat will
probably<00:01:34.740> end<00:01:34.950> up<00:01:35.250> shortening<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> lifespan

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
probably end up shortening the lifespan

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.840 
probably end up shortening the lifespan
of<00:01:36.540> your<00:01:36.750> juice<00:01:37.200> once<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.280> does<00:01:38.490> actually

leaving the cap off won't hurt or help

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.719 
leaving the cap off won't hurt or help
time<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:53.040> what<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.250> need<00:01:53.610> time<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.689> patience

time is what you need time and patience

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.859 
time is what you need time and patience
just<00:01:56.729> my<00:01:57.000> two<00:01:57.060> cents

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
just my two cents

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.899 
just my two cents
okay<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.570> there's<00:02:00.570> somebody<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.799> works<00:02:02.729> for

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
okay so there's somebody that works for

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.690 
okay so there's somebody that works for
a<00:02:03.090> juice<00:02:03.329> company<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.020> they<00:02:04.770> have<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.250> couple

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
a juice company and they have a couple

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.459 
a juice company and they have a couple
of<00:02:05.820> master<00:02:06.240> chemists<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.930> they're<00:02:07.200> saying

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
of master chemists and they're saying

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.990 
of master chemists and they're saying
that<00:02:07.740> none<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.039> stuff<00:02:08.160> even<00:02:08.580> makes<00:02:08.879> a

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
that none of that stuff even makes a

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.809

the<00:06:11.139> internet<00:06:11.800> all<00:06:12.280> of<00:06:12.490> those<00:06:12.610> things<00:06:12.970> you<00:06:13.150> can

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
the internet all of those things you can

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.180 
the internet all of those things you can
you<00:06:13.570> can<00:06:13.720> do<00:06:13.870> whatever<00:06:14.110> you<00:06:14.410> want<00:06:14.620> to<00:06:14.800> with

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
you can do whatever you want to with

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.090 
you can do whatever you want to with
your<00:06:15.400> juices<00:06:15.820> but<00:06:16.120> quite<00:06:16.900> honestly<00:06:17.139> all<00:06:18.039> of

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
your juices but quite honestly all of

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.090 
your juices but quite honestly all of
that<00:06:18.520> extra<00:06:18.940> work<00:06:19.389> doesn't<00:06:20.169> do<00:06:20.470> any<00:06:20.650> good<00:06:20.740> as

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
that extra work doesn't do any good as

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.260 
that extra work doesn't do any good as
far<00:06:21.370> as<00:06:21.490> I'm<00:06:21.639> concerned

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
far as I'm concerned

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.020 
far as I'm concerned
now<00:06:22.750> maybe<00:06:23.710> maybe<00:06:24.190> it<00:06:24.340> does<00:06:24.490> work<00:06:24.729> for<00:06:24.970> some

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
now maybe maybe it does work for some

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.659 
now maybe maybe it does work for some
other<00:06:25.330> people<00:06:25.539> but<00:06:25.900> I<00:06:26.169> personally<00:06:27.100> tried<00:06:27.400> some

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
other people but I personally tried some

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.600 
other people but I personally tried some
of<00:06:27.700> those<00:06:27.880> methods<00:06:28.419> and<00:06:29.130> it<00:06:30.130> didn't<00:06:30.460> make<00:06:30.550> any

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
of those methods and it didn't make any

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.750 
of those methods and it didn't make any
difference<00:06:30.850> I<00:06:31.479> make<00:06:32.080> my<00:06:32.260> juices<00:06:32.740> I<00:06:33.100> set<00:06:33.610> them

that sit off for a little while while
I'm<00:06:49.670> vaping<00:06:49.880> on<00:06:50.180> one<00:06:50.390> so<00:06:51.080> every<00:06:51.920> day<00:06:52.100> the<00:06:52.250> past

is you know saying they they steep but I

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.520 
is you know saying they they steep but I
found<00:06:56.630> quite<00:06:57.440> frankly<00:06:57.890> when<00:06:58.130> it<00:06:58.220> comes<00:06:58.430> to

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
found quite frankly when it comes to

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.170 
found quite frankly when it comes to
fruit<00:07:00.530> flavors<00:07:00.980> like<00:07:01.190> strawberries<00:07:01.880> and

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180 
fruit flavors like strawberries and

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.840 
fruit flavors like strawberries and
stuff<00:07:02.360> like<00:07:02.510> that<00:07:02.780> the<00:07:03.770> longer<00:07:04.130> it<00:07:04.250> steeps<00:07:04.580> it

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:04.850 
stuff like that the longer it steeps it

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.880 
stuff like that the longer it steeps it
doesn't<00:07:05.180> really<00:07:05.330> change<00:07:05.480> the<00:07:06.110> flavor<00:07:06.410> of<00:07:06.620> the

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:06.890 
doesn't really change the flavor of the

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.150 
doesn't really change the flavor of the
juice<00:07:07.300> what<00:07:08.300> it<00:07:08.420> really<00:07:08.600> works<00:07:09.020> on<00:07:09.260> is<00:07:09.590> stuff

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
juice what it really works on is stuff

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.020 
juice what it really works on is stuff
like<00:07:10.400> vanilla

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.030 
like vanilla

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.240 
like vanilla
you<00:07:11.780> know<00:07:11.900> the<00:07:12.050> heavier<00:07:12.470> more<00:07:12.920> intense

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.250 
you know the heavier more intense

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.570 
you know the heavier more intense
flavors<00:07:13.850> it<00:07:14.720> really<00:07:15.410> makes<00:07:15.980> a<00:07:16.100> difference<00:07:16.130> on

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.580 
flavors it really makes a difference on

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.990 
flavors it really makes a difference on
that<00:07:16.640> and<00:07:17.030> quite<00:07:17.330> frankly<00:07:17.690> i<00:07:18.460> like<00:07:19.460> french

within about two or three days something
like<00:07:30.470> this<00:07:30.800> right<00:07:31.010> here<00:07:31.250> is<00:07:31.400> extremely<00:07:32.150> strong

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 
like this right here is extremely strong

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.590 
like this right here is extremely strong
the<00:07:33.620> longer<00:07:34.040> that<00:07:34.640> you<00:07:34.820> leave<00:07:35.030> juice<00:07:35.360> sit

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:35.600 
the longer that you leave juice sit

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.810 
the longer that you leave juice sit
around<00:07:35.870> especially<00:07:36.800> when<00:07:37.220> it<00:07:37.310> comes<00:07:37.490> to<00:07:37.670> the

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:37.820 
around especially when it comes to the

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.800 
around especially when it comes to the
millet<00:07:38.150> it<00:07:38.870> gets<00:07:39.170> stronger<00:07:39.620> and<00:07:40.070> the<00:07:40.340> flavor

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:40.810 
millet it gets stronger and the flavor

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.620 
millet it gets stronger and the flavor
gets<00:07:41.810> more<00:07:42.110> intense<00:07:42.470> so<00:07:43.270> that's<00:07:44.270> just<00:07:44.510> a

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:44.630 
gets more intense so that's just a

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.910 
gets more intense so that's just a
little<00:07:44.780> FYI<00:07:45.530> so<00:07:46.510> there<00:07:47.510> you<00:07:47.600> have<00:07:47.690> it<00:07:47.960> i<00:07:48.170> mean

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:48.920 
little FYI so there you have it i mean

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.320 
little FYI so there you have it i mean
you<00:07:49.070> can<00:07:49.190> look<00:07:49.340> around<00:07:49.460> and<00:07:49.730> all<00:07:49.880> that<00:07:49.910> but

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:50.330 
you can look around and all that but

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.320 
you can look around and all that but
this<00:07:50.510> is<00:07:50.720> my<00:07:50.870> two<00:07:50.930> cents<00:07:51.440> on<00:07:51.740> on<00:07:52.330> steeping

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:53.330 
this is my two cents on on steeping

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.140 
this is my two cents on on steeping
ejuice<00:07:53.780> doing<00:07:54.410> all<00:07:54.500> the<00:07:54.650> extra<00:07:54.920> stuff<00:07:55.070> and<00:07:56.000> my

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.150 
ejuice doing all the extra stuff and my

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.810 
ejuice doing all the extra stuff and my
personal<00:07:56.660> opinion<00:07:57.080> is<00:07:57.320> a<00:07:57.380> waste<00:07:57.710> of<00:07:57.890> time<00:07:57.950> just

00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:58.820 
personal opinion is a waste of time just

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.630 
personal opinion is a waste of time just
mix<00:07:59.120> your<00:07:59.270> juice<00:07:59.570> shake<00:08:00.260> it<00:08:00.410> well<00:08:00.590> set<00:08:01.400> it<00:08:01.550> off
