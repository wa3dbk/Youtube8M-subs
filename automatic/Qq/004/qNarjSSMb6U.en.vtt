this<00:00:03.820> is<00:00:04.000> a<00:00:04.740> 1970<00:00:05.740> Martin<00:00:06.220> d41<00:00:07.060> that<00:00:07.990> norm<00:00:08.379> got

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:08.650 
this is a 1970 Martin d41 that norm got

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.720 
this is a 1970 Martin d41 that norm got
in<00:00:09.389> about<00:00:10.389> a<00:00:10.510> week<00:00:10.719> ago<00:00:10.869> and<00:00:11.530> I<00:00:12.309> had<00:00:12.459> to<00:00:12.549> make<00:00:12.670> a

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
in about a week ago and I had to make a

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.510 
in about a week ago and I had to make a
new<00:00:12.940> bridge<00:00:13.209> for<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:14.590> old<00:00:14.740> bridge<00:00:15.010> was<00:00:15.219> shaved

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
new bridge for the old bridge was shaved

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.779 
new bridge for the old bridge was shaved
down<00:00:16.740> because<00:00:17.740> if<00:00:18.160> you<00:00:18.250> can<00:00:18.430> see<00:00:18.609> there's

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
down because if you can see there's

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.519 
down because if you can see there's
barely<00:00:19.240> anything<00:00:19.570> left<00:00:19.720> on<00:00:20.080> it

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
barely anything left on it

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.679 
barely anything left on it
just<00:00:21.220> totally<00:00:21.519> just<00:00:21.669> ripped<00:00:21.970> up<00:00:22.179> and<00:00:22.480> I<00:00:22.570> have

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
just totally just ripped up and I have

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.109 
just totally just ripped up and I have
to<00:00:22.749> reset<00:00:23.080> back<00:00:23.349> so<00:00:23.679> therefore<00:00:24.070> when<00:00:24.279> I<00:00:24.310> reset

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
to reset back so therefore when I reset

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:25.890 
to reset back so therefore when I reset
the<00:00:25.210> Mackay<00:00:25.449> ofte

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
the Mackay ofte

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.409 
the Mackay ofte
but<00:00:26.859> a<00:00:26.890> bigger<00:00:27.160> bridge<00:00:27.429> and<00:00:27.579> I<00:00:27.669> said<00:00:27.880> saddle<00:00:28.329> is

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
but a bigger bridge and I said saddle is

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:29.189 
but a bigger bridge and I said saddle is
a<00:00:28.449> flop<00:00:28.779> over

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
a flop over

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.339 
a flop over
so<00:00:30.179> you're<00:00:31.179> just<00:00:31.419> starting<00:00:31.659> to<00:00:31.839> make<00:00:32.110> this

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
so you're just starting to make this

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.670 
so you're just starting to make this
right<00:00:32.590> here<00:00:32.829> which<00:00:33.400> is<00:00:33.640> I'm<00:00:34.150> not<00:00:34.300> done<00:00:34.510> with<00:00:34.660> it

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
right here which is I'm not done with it

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.770 
right here which is I'm not done with it
this<00:00:36.520> is<00:00:36.700> the<00:00:36.850> replacement<00:00:37.150> bridge<00:00:37.570> that<00:00:37.750> I

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
this is the replacement bridge that I

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.240 
this is the replacement bridge that I
made<00:00:37.990> for<00:00:38.290> said<00:00:39.160> replica<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:41.170> then<00:00:41.380> I'm<00:00:42.040> going

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
made for said replica and then I'm going

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.250 
made for said replica and then I'm going
to<00:00:42.370> reset<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:42.940> back<00:00:43.150> out<00:00:43.330> charlie<00:00:44.110> a<00:00:44.140> nice

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
to reset the back out charlie a nice

00:00:44.260 --> 00:01:14.490 
to reset the back out charlie a nice
guitar

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.010 

after<00:01:15.310> that<00:01:15.490> I<00:01:15.640> reset<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.390> knock<00:01:16.660> on<00:01:16.900> the

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
after that I reset the knock on the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.050 
after that I reset the knock on the
guitar<00:01:17.470> but<00:01:17.860> if<00:01:17.950> you<00:01:18.070> can<00:01:18.460> look<00:01:18.670> at<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:18.850> whole

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
guitar but if you can look at the whole

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.660 
guitar but if you can look at the whole
bridge<00:01:19.300> compared<00:01:20.230> to<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.560> new<00:01:20.710> one<00:01:20.740> it's

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
bridge compared to the new one it's

00:01:21.670 --> 00:02:08.690 
bridge compared to the new one it's
pretty<00:01:22.480> damn<00:01:22.780> close

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.520 

it<00:02:09.700> needs<00:02:09.879> a<00:02:10.030> neck<00:02:10.209> reset<00:02:10.720> because<00:02:10.989> there<00:02:11.410> was

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
it needs a neck reset because there was

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.520 
it needs a neck reset because there was
no<00:02:11.890> angle<00:02:12.489> on<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.760> whatsoever<00:02:13.120> from<00:02:14.050> the

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
no angle on it whatsoever from the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.220 
no angle on it whatsoever from the
bridge<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.069> made<00:02:15.310> because<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:17.019> bridge

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
bridge that I made because the bridge

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.460 
bridge that I made because the bridge
was<00:02:17.410> shaved<00:02:17.680> down<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.640> compensate<00:02:19.330> for<00:02:19.629> a<00:02:19.930> poor

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
was shaved down to compensate for a poor

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.339 
was shaved down to compensate for a poor
neck<00:02:21.069> angle<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:22.510> therefore<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:22.930> made<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.170> new

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
neck angle so therefore I made a new

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.710 
neck angle so therefore I made a new
bridge<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:24.040> was<00:02:24.160> higher<00:02:24.370> then<00:02:25.330> took<00:02:25.540> the

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
bridge that was higher then took the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.350 
bridge that was higher then took the
neck<00:02:25.870> off<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.260> guitar<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.849> cut<00:02:27.849> it<00:02:27.940> back<00:02:27.970> and

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
neck off the guitar and cut it back and

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.910 
neck off the guitar and cut it back and
reang<00:02:28.720> GLE<00:02:28.930> dit<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.069> right<00:02:30.340> angle<00:02:31.269> and

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
reang GLE dit to the right angle and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.370 
reang GLE dit to the right angle and
reset<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.040> in<00:02:33.160> there<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:34.080> it's<00:02:35.080> playing

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
reset it in there and it's playing

00:02:35.380 --> 00:03:00.910 
reset it in there and it's playing
pretty<00:02:35.620> good

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.980
