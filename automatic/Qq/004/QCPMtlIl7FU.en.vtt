00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.070 

the<00:00:14.620> number<00:00:15.620> 40<00:00:16.190> so<00:00:16.490> this<00:00:16.850> color<00:00:17.120> is<00:00:17.300> number<00:00:17.630> 14

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
the number 40 so this color is number 14

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.340 
the number 40 so this color is number 14
is<00:00:18.290> very<00:00:18.650> very<00:00:18.980> light<00:00:19.280> and<00:00:19.670> I<00:00:20.180> think<00:00:20.960> for<00:00:21.170> my

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
is very very light and I think for my

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.230 
is very very light and I think for my
complexion<00:00:21.680> is<00:00:22.100> a<00:00:22.220> little<00:00:22.490> bit<00:00:22.610> too<00:00:22.850> light

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
complexion is a little bit too light

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.910 
complexion is a little bit too light
I<00:00:23.270> could<00:00:23.540> put<00:00:23.750> like<00:00:23.870> a<00:00:23.930> lipstick<00:00:24.560> lip<00:00:24.890> gloss

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
I could put like a lipstick lip gloss

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.890 
I could put like a lipstick lip gloss
over<00:00:25.310> it<00:00:25.580> so<00:00:25.850> it<00:00:26.000> might<00:00:26.120> just<00:00:26.360> be<00:00:26.450> like<00:00:26.540> very

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
over it so it might just be like very

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.050 
over it so it might just be like very
light<00:00:27.350> color<00:00:27.680> and<00:00:27.890> this<00:00:28.430> is<00:00:28.550> how<00:00:28.640> I<00:00:28.670> probably

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
light color and this is how I probably

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.660 
light color and this is how I probably
would<00:00:29.270> have<00:00:29.300> worn<00:00:29.660> it<00:00:29.750> because<00:00:30.290> yeah<00:00:31.280> it's<00:00:31.520> a

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
would have worn it because yeah it's a

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.310 
would have worn it because yeah it's a
little<00:00:31.820> bit<00:00:31.970> too<00:00:32.300> light<00:00:32.480> to<00:00:32.689> wear<00:00:32.840> just<00:00:33.170> like

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
little bit too light to wear just like

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.930 
little bit too light to wear just like
that<00:00:33.500> because<00:00:33.740> it<00:00:34.010> washes<00:00:34.310> me<00:00:34.340> off<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:34.850> it

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
that because it washes me off and it

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.150 
that because it washes me off and it
literally<00:00:35.210> makes<00:00:35.450> me<00:00:35.660> look<00:00:36.230> like<00:00:36.290> I<00:00:36.440> have<00:00:36.740> no

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
literally makes me look like I have no

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.520 
literally makes me look like I have no
it's<00:00:37.430> number<00:00:37.940> 42<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:38.570> this<00:00:38.960> is<00:00:39.110> how<00:00:39.230> it<00:00:39.350> looks

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
it's number 42 and this is how it looks

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.140 
it's number 42 and this is how it looks
on<00:00:39.620> my<00:00:39.800> lips<00:00:40.040> and<00:00:40.310> I<00:00:40.370> feel<00:00:40.579> like<00:00:40.730> it's<00:00:40.940> really

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150

to go it's still is I will say it is

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.940 
to go it's still is I will say it is
like<00:00:48.710> very<00:00:48.739> natural<00:00:49.430> nude<00:00:49.700> and<00:00:50.690> I<00:00:50.840> do<00:00:50.900> like<00:00:51.680> it

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
like very natural nude and I do like it

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.060 
like very natural nude and I do like it
I<00:00:52.250> feel<00:00:53.149> I<00:00:53.329> might<00:00:53.570> get<00:00:53.750> quite<00:00:53.960> a<00:00:54.230> lot<00:00:54.620> of<00:00:54.800> wear

I feel I might get quite a lot of wear

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.800 
I feel I might get quite a lot of wear
out<00:00:55.100> of<00:00:55.220> it<00:00:55.520> but<00:00:55.790> I<00:00:55.850> think<00:00:56.120> someone<00:00:56.540> with<00:00:56.780> a

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
out of it but I think someone with a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.450 
out of it but I think someone with a
lighter<00:00:57.050> complexion<00:00:57.530> will<00:00:57.860> look<00:00:58.070> even<00:00:58.280> better

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
lighter complexion will look even better

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.540 
lighter complexion will look even better
than<00:00:58.880> I<00:00:59.000> do<00:00:59.059> so<00:00:59.270> if<00:00:59.899> you<00:01:00.170> are<00:01:00.320> like<00:01:00.590> light<00:01:01.220> or

very<00:01:01.940> very<00:01:02.090> pale<00:01:02.570> I<00:01:02.870> think<00:01:03.170> it<00:01:03.290> would<00:01:03.380> look

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
very very pale I think it would look

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.559

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
is a different collection but this is

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.449 
is a different collection but this is
the<00:01:17.600> closest<00:01:18.020> one<00:01:18.170> that<00:01:18.380> they<00:01:18.469> had<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:19.369> the
