00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.070
 hello guys and girls in this opportunity 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.029
 to find them a new video of you knew 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.250
 what 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.560
 Well, I'm going to comment 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.080
 lately my hair has been like 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.150
 falling too much and the truth is that you 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.250
 I put treatment treatments 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.500
 chemical treatments 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.110
 homemade, good, even changed 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.970
 shampoo I bought an anti fall I check 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.649
 maybe of them maybe it was the 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.290
 dryness of hair that is 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.120
 causing it to fall and good 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.480
 he is even blaming the 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.220
 shower I had because I said that as 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.890
 you know I changed my city and in 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.780
 the house where I lived before was like a 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.630
 more natural water because it was not 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.000
 who sells the factory of Anda or anything 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.430
 that but it was with cistern that is 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.829
 the one that the cistern subtracted the water 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.650
 natural from the earth then I will 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.650
 is blaming this and I 'm good 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.590
 I think it's the chlorine that brings 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.620
 in the shower here and webo then I 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.080
 I found a thousand excuses but good if 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.900
 It's falling down so I'm going to make a 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.330
 they cut me and I went to the classroom 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.490
 beauty and I made the cut even 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.540
 I think it's called the 180 degree cut 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.390
 and I tell you that to my surprise, 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.700
 my hair stopped falling and even if 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.530
 they had promised him and I said look at neither 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.930
 tail has hair the tail has 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.370
 hairs then you know you did not 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.320
 I wanted to share with you for 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.930
 those people who have hair 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.670
 long and they are falling too 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.229
 well even in my house there were hairs 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.520
 everywhere in the bathroom of the 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.200
 room everywhere then the 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.260
 truth is that I am this trick that 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.450
 I discovered if you already looked for is the 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.100
 most kindest way for your 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.070
 hair does not fall like for example 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.420
 changing the shampoos 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.910
 conditioners creams 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.149
 treatments and good is an endless 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.460
 things I suggest you give him a new 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.220
 cut your hair I cut myself 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.950
 180 degrees as I already mentioned and the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.780
 truth is that I like it more or less like 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.630
 I stay because I wanted the cut that 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.760
 I had capitis down this video les 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.980
 I will leave the information of your channel and 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.270
 I'm going to leave the video because I 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.310
 wanted to 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.960
 for my hair but then I would 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.860
 I said to the girls I will not take and 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.380
 Cordova 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.520
 and maybe I do not get the idea very well but 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.110
 The truth is that I liked it 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.780
 but it was not the fort that I wanted 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.810
 I wanted the cut exactly like me 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.190
 has gabi tips and is a cut of 180 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.220
 degrees when what I want them 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.170
 to mention also is that this is what 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.510
 last you have to do that 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.520
 is to cut your hair then if you 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.180
 you want to keep the length of your hair 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.680
 then look for posts that is for that 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.200
 to keep the arch but give it 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.440
 way then it's not going to cut too much 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.470
 or your hairdresser your stylist do not do not go to 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.960
 cut too much and then this will 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.060
 I say not from night to morning but 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.810
 that you have to go in a process 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.000
 this is like it's like the last option 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.160
 that you have for the detention of 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.170
 it was the hair is falling 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.310
 times maybe because the hair is in 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.960
 straight line cut or even they were 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.360
 talking to the girl who told me 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.910
 short and says that in many hairs that 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.640
 when the hair is too long 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.920
 and the thread can not do the body 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.110
 has come can not sustain it and has 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.610
 much logic because it is even when 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.470
 They told me how they cut me in 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.060
 several layers I felt up to my head 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.240
 lighter I did not feel it too much 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.460
 heavy but before you decide 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.770
 cut your hair if you do not have the long or 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.190
 They do not want to cut them as well 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.140
 I recommend that you look for ways 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.540
 conditioning shampoo treatments u 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.000
 other measures so that the hair does not 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.430
 they fall too much but if they already tried 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.590
 everything as I had done it 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.510
 So what they raised is that they 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.520
 make a haircut that you 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.380
 be comfortable with him I am very at 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.330
 I like my hair that maybe was not 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.459
 the cut that I wanted but if I'm at 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.410
 I like it because you do not serve much the length of 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.030
 my hair even up to my 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.400
 promised I say good the truth is that 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.690
 I like how you stayed I like stv 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.060
 well and for me it is important that you see me 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.100
 well then I recommend it I hope 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.960
 that you liked these you knew that and 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.230
 we will be seeing each other until the next 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.230
 video
