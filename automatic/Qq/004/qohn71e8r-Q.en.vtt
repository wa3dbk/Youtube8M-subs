 [Music] 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.459
 and we continue in Argentine chefs 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:14.669
 to finish this super noodle paella 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:16.740
 easy and very demanding look at the only thing 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:20.640
 what I did was boil all this started 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.680
 to evaporate all the broth is almost there 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.269
 throwing the last little bubble to say 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.010
 already almost have you as is 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.380
 and as the fidelito begin to put 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.390
 crispy is very good for 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.250
 accompany her we will crown her with a 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.629
 basil pesto parsley 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.980
 remember that combination because it goes very 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.860
 well I do not know if it's good or parsley or 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.519
 basil not both we put a good 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.510
 handful of parsley or a handful of 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:48.540
 basil let's put not much garlic 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.900
 little by little how much half a tooth 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.940
 guys look at nothing good because all the 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.739
 preparation has a little bit of something a 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.439
 little bit is a bit of lemon juice 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.570
 just tiqui tiqui how many were two 

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:02.970
 nothing teaspoons some 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.850
 paprika for these for this flavor that 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.470
 gives him the meatball that has the chorizo 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.210
 colorado that has paprika is doing well 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.130
 put some paprika also here 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.550
 to this position for who likes a 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.490
 I touched 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.490
 sing to pain of ground chili 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.400
 and now oil 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.780
 and what we have to do basically 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.340
 is to process a little bit to generate a 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.040
 pastita and if I'm going to put it over 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.840
 as a coronation 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.700
 if you want and you like more the aroma 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.070
 lemonade or you can put it I'm going to 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.520
 put a little bit of skin zest 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.530
 of lemon 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.260
 always remember only the part 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.900
 yellow the white part is very bitter 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.380
 then we have all this well and 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.380
 process 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.960
 it's a little bit more nothing is just a 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.490
 final touch to be able to serve the 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.790
 dish with a different touch 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.820
 a lot of taste pretty cheap flavor is 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.500
 quite economic 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.630
 about 20 hands plus or minus 8 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.189
 people where I bought cost me 18 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.970
 but some will cost a 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.970
 little bit more expensive group that is 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.400
 spectacular 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.350
 Martin 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.239
 we did this, notice that practically 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.420
 is ready is a little bit like to 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.830
 finish just barely enough to crown 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.140
 a little bit the plate to give it as more 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.299
 of flavor for a tasty touch is 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.950
 tasty the matter and nothing bad is left 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.630
 apart from sight the green and you go direct 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.500
 with this is the Spaniards look good 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.569
 because they were really going to get angry 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.610
 very much if you leave it kind of songs to I do not know 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.799
 how is barely a little bit of 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.599
 of steam is coming out but it ends 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.130
 evaporate that and it's ready in two 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.390
 minutes is more or less in total how much 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.630
 40 minutes and tubes 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.930
 - 23 between 30 and 40 minutes you have to 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.880
 reduce all of gentlemen I do not know what is 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.190
 doing now the bangs so the 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.990
 bangs so it does bring thousands and 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.610
 is making a carte blanche for 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.130
 crown these cannelloni 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.390
 and obviously like you all like 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.210
 You know, but some people do not go there 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.630
 karina 20 grams and 30 grams because 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.030
 I want to make a light white sauce 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.950
 cook this melt the butter the rn the 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.020
 flour and I'm adding the milk that 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.020
 they will add it to give it a flavor 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.850
 different from the white sauce plus 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.550
 go beating with whisk so you do not 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.610
 form lumps 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.760
 under this angel that will ensure that I will 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.290
 give a touch without this white sauce 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.720
 different then we finished adding 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.120
 milk remember how it is a sauce 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.910
 but it should be light, not left 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.010
 something dense too doughy maybe that 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.500
 It would be ideal if for some what you are 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.570
 for something like this we beat this right now 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.180
 boil in a minute because I was already 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.550
 quite hot the previous part a 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.520
 Once it boils , they will pour it over the 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.890
 spicy cannelloni as we have the plate 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.410
 for oven full of cannelloni and in 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.990
 all of you here occupy a different one 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.010
 and right now we are going to dump then 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.540
 our white sauce on the cannelloni 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.880
 different if you have tomato sauce and 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.830
 made or on fire in the ink or in what 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.600
 you can put him but if you do not have 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.550
 time or you do not have in your house and you have 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.460
 a few tomatoes then it 's cut in 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.380
 slices then let's put the sauce 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.200
 white 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.110
 the tomatoes that I'm going to grill here 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.150
 let's put some with a ladle 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.930
 matter what we're going to dump like that from the 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.850
 pot over 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.360
 I kept the white sauce so it is not 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:47.000
 too heavy there we have this already 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.370
 is taking good temperature boils 1 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.070
 minute thanks to the dih and let's put 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.430
 with a ladle without grabbing the school 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.590
 nothing else 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:01.300
 white sauce 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:03.260
 well fine not too thick 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.830
 these cannelloni 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:10.580
 now we unite well let's put it 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:13.490
 tomato slices on top of the slice 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.620
 of tomato very tasty for tomato 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.960
 because that is a phrase of martÃ­ that you 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.480
 lights and you know is from john the menso this 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.880
 summer that says the tomato video such as 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.620
 they manifest it the chicken think the 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.130
 tomato think so let's put a 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.130
 little salt 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:41.170
 and we have ready the lasagna we take them 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.380
 baked that they have it enough that they 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.420
 put brown tanger more tempting 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:52.030
 we get out and enjoy the question 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:53.860
 ask why now exactly with 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.890
 this same bread dough quilmes you put it 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:02.620
 well in one layer up stuffing another layer 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:06.090
 of pancakes another layer of filling and it 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:09.090
 can freeze the freezer or the 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.090
 freezer 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.970
 then we have the plate for when 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.970
 is case 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.230
 fritters 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:32.070
 as ximena says let's go to the sea is the 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.650
 end of the sheet to eat between 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.540
 all apart from that tortilla the doctor 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.670
 said that paella that is making juan 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.770
 that is delicious the dessert was commissioned 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:44.310
 juanito but let's make some donuts 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:46.230
 of polenta and chicken with what's left over 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.610
 it's good so do not cut it and now 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.610
 we continue with the Argentine chefs 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:07:00.259
