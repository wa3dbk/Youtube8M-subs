really good growing conditions the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.179 
really good growing conditions the
biggest<00:01:09.360> threat<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.570> geraniums<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.470> damp<00:01:10.770> so

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
biggest threat to geraniums is damp so

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.560

if you're able to keep them somewhere
warm<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.049> dry<00:01:13.140> then<00:01:13.799> do<00:01:13.979> go<00:01:14.159> ahead<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.490> give

warm and dry then do go ahead and give

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.780 
warm and dry then do go ahead and give
them<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.000> light<00:01:15.180> trim<00:01:15.770> use<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> sharp<00:01:17.250> knife<00:01:17.340> and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.120 
cut on the main stem just above a leaf
joint<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.360> your<00:01:21.990> plant<00:01:22.259> will<00:01:22.439> heal<00:01:22.680> over<00:01:23.040> at

joint and your plant will heal over at
this<00:01:23.280> point<00:01:23.600> this<00:01:24.600> will<00:01:24.810> encourage<00:01:25.110> lots<00:01:25.409> of

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
this point this will encourage lots of

this point this will encourage lots of

bushy grows will lower down ensure your

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.560 
bushy grows will lower down ensure your
geraniums<00:01:31.439> are<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.860> good<00:01:32.009> compost<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:32.970> they

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
geraniums are in good compost if they

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.090 
geraniums are in good compost if they
have<00:01:33.659> been<00:01:33.840> growing<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> same<00:01:34.590> compost

for a while the nutrition will have been

used up and the compost will have

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.910 
used up and the compost will have
naturally<00:01:39.630> compacted<00:01:40.290> from<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.590> lot<00:01:40.770> of

watering so it's always a good idea to
