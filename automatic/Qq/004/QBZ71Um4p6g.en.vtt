00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:06.000
 The one I heard right now is Arrows, a preamp booster from Earthquaker Devices. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.288
 With a simple discrete circuit 

00:02:09.377 --> 00:02:14.666
 Add tension and luster to the sound and squeeze turbid bass 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.466
 Give high-pitched glitter and put out the mids 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.733
 Make the bass tight 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.266
 It is also effective for the dark and tight humbucker neck position 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.822
 Furthermore, it works well with other distortion pedals. 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.977
 Ideal for adding gain to your favorite distortion pedal 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.777
 It is also suitable for correcting the high frequency part of fuzz and the crispness of the sound 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.111
 Simple operation with one knob 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.288
 You can easily boost and cut the gain by turning the knob 

00:02:41.777 --> 00:02:48.755
 It is a hand-made and true bypass switch adoption like the pedal of other earth quakers 

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:53.422
 First we saw how we can push tube amps and overdrives 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.488
 Let's turn the knob back a bit and see how it works with a single coil 

00:04:21.111 --> 00:04:25.244
 Next is Arrows in a setting that was thinly applied 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.066
 Let's try how to give a high-pitched tone and make a sound with crispness with a muff sound 

00:05:40.755 --> 00:05:43.688
 Arrows are like this 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.422
