00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
does is the energy that the tree is

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.279 
does is the energy that the tree is
bringing<00:00:47.430> up<00:00:47.640> from<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> earth<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.600> going<00:00:49.230> to

want to create a open bowl in the center

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.300 
want to create a open bowl in the center
so<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.119> light<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:06.750> shine<00:01:06.810> through<00:01:07.439> imagine

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
so the light can shine through imagine

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.250 
so the light can shine through imagine
this<00:01:08.430> tree<00:01:08.790> covered<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.450> leaves<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:10.080> see

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
this tree covered in leaves you can see

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.130 
this tree covered in leaves you can see
just<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.590> few<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> fine<00:01:11.820> long<00:01:12.240> leaves<00:01:12.750> that

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
just a few of the fine long leaves that

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.380 
just a few of the fine long leaves that
were<00:01:13.320> left<00:01:13.860> from<00:01:13.979> last<00:01:14.340> season<00:01:14.820> if<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.180> had

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
were left from last season if you had

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.050 
were left from last season if you had
fruit<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.930> here<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.560> would<00:01:16.979> not<00:01:17.220> ripen<00:01:17.850> as

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
fruit in here it would not ripen as

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.020 
fruit in here it would not ripen as
quickly<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.200> would<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.530> be

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
quickly because it would not be

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.580 
quickly because it would not be
benefiting<00:01:21.030> from<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.390> sunlight<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.290> I'm

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
benefiting from the sunlight so I'm

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.140 
benefiting from the sunlight so I'm
going<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.830> prune<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.310> tree<00:01:23.610> now<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:23.970> take

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
going to prune this tree now and take

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.179 
going to prune this tree now and take
out<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> lot<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.869> little<00:01:25.229> stuff<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.009> that

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
out a lot of this little stuff so that

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.280 
out a lot of this little stuff so that
we<00:01:26.280> put<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.729> tree<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.240> good<00:01:27.509> stead<00:01:27.810> for<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
we put this tree in good stead for the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:53.450 
we put this tree in good stead for the
spring<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.799> come

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.669 

all<00:01:54.460> right<00:01:54.789> so<00:01:55.090> what<00:01:55.240> do<00:01:55.329> you<00:01:55.420> think<00:01:55.689> see<00:01:56.259> the

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
all right so what do you think see the

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.620 
all right so what do you think see the
tree<00:01:56.920> looks<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.219> lot<00:01:57.399> cleaner<00:01:57.789> much<00:01:58.179> stronger

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
tree looks a lot cleaner much stronger

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.440 
tree looks a lot cleaner much stronger
if<00:01:58.990> we<00:01:59.049> put<00:01:59.829> it<00:01:59.920> in<00:02:00.039> good<00:02:00.340> stead<00:02:00.640> for<00:02:00.969> lots<00:02:01.299> of

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
if we put it in good stead for lots of

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.209 
if we put it in good stead for lots of
fruit<00:02:01.750> production<00:02:02.289> for<00:02:02.439> this<00:02:02.560> next<00:02:02.890> year<00:02:03.009> now

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
fruit production for this next year now

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.249 
fruit production for this next year now
the<00:02:03.280> last<00:02:03.520> thing<00:02:03.700> I<00:02:03.909> do<00:02:03.969> here<00:02:04.299> in<00:02:04.420> winter<00:02:04.719> is<00:02:04.899> I
