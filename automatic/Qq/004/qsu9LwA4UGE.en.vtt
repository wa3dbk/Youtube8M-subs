00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:12.519 
sets of supporters have got such a a

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.510 
sets of supporters have got such a a
reputation<00:00:13.519> for<00:00:13.549> being<00:00:13.730> noisy<00:00:14.150> and<00:00:14.809> being

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
reputation for being noisy and being

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.980 
reputation for being noisy and being
very<00:00:16.520> vocal<00:00:16.970> in<00:00:17.029> the<00:00:17.150> support<00:00:17.540> so<00:00:17.750> yeah<00:00:17.900> I

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
about being big and strong physical

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.140 
about being big and strong physical
teams<00:00:29.750> both<00:00:30.080> teams<00:00:30.609> but<00:00:31.609> they've<00:00:31.730> also<00:00:31.880> got

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
teams both teams but they've also got

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.090 
teams both teams but they've also got
some<00:00:32.330> wonderful<00:00:32.540> skillful<00:00:33.500> players<00:00:33.769> as<00:00:34.070> well

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
some wonderful skillful players as well

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.160 
some wonderful skillful players as well
and<00:00:34.460> I'm<00:00:34.699> hoping<00:00:35.239> that<00:00:35.300> it's<00:00:35.870> again<00:00:36.140> a

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
and I'm hoping that it's again a

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.090 
and I'm hoping that it's again a
football<00:00:36.710> where<00:00:37.010> footballs<00:00:37.969> the<00:00:38.149> winner<00:00:38.360> and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
football where footballs the winner and

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.380 
football where footballs the winner and
refereeing<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:40.489> match<00:00:40.640> officials<00:00:40.850> just

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
refereeing and the match officials just

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.069 
refereeing and the match officials just
stay<00:00:41.629> out<00:00:41.690> of<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:41.930> way

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.560 

I<00:00:45.170> think<00:00:45.859> it's<00:00:46.039> just<00:00:46.609> that<00:00:46.730> you<00:00:46.999> you<00:00:47.269> want<00:00:47.449> to

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
I think it's just that you you want to

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.209 
I think it's just that you you want to
start<00:00:47.870> well<00:00:48.109> it's<00:00:48.289> like<00:00:48.469> a<00:00:48.499> player<00:00:48.859> wants<00:00:49.159> to

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
start well it's like a player wants to

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.029 
start well it's like a player wants to
start<00:00:49.609> well<00:00:49.879> it's<00:00:50.120> like<00:00:50.329> you<00:00:51.199> hear<00:00:51.620> them<00:00:51.800> talk

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
start well it's like you hear them talk

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.380 
start well it's like you hear them talk
about<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.460> goalkeeper<00:00:53.030> getting<00:00:53.239> an<00:00:53.300> early

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
about the goalkeeper getting an early

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.060 
about the goalkeeper getting an early
took<00:00:53.809> to<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.050> ball<00:00:54.229> and<00:00:54.530> things<00:00:54.710> like<00:00:54.890> that

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
took to the ball and things like that

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.680 
took to the ball and things like that
that's<00:00:55.280> all<00:00:55.489> it<00:00:55.670> is<00:00:55.789> it's<00:00:56.000> just<00:00:56.059> getting<00:00:56.539> the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
that's all it is it's just getting the

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.240 
that's all it is it's just getting the
the<00:00:57.170> little<00:00:57.379> decision<00:00:57.920> drive

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.610 

not<00:01:01.700> so<00:01:01.850> much<00:01:01.940> dream<00:01:02.300> about<00:01:02.510> it<00:01:02.810> I<00:01:02.840> don't<00:01:03.080> I<00:01:03.410> do

not so much dream about it I don't I do

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.160 
not so much dream about it I don't I do

think about games as in preparing for
games<00:01:06.530> I<00:01:06.740> do<00:01:06.800> run<00:01:07.100> a<00:01:07.340> lot<00:01:07.610> of<00:01:07.700> things<00:01:07.880> through

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
games I do run a lot of things through

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.710

definitely<00:01:42.789> you<00:01:43.789> on<00:01:44.750> a<00:01:44.810> normal<00:01:45.289> game<00:01:45.500> you<00:01:45.649> know

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
definitely you on a normal game you know

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.469 
definitely you on a normal game you know
you'd<00:01:45.920> appointments<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.609> week<00:01:46.759> prior<00:01:47.060> to<00:01:47.090> it

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
you'd appointments the week prior to it

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.969 
you'd appointments the week prior to it
obviously<00:01:47.630> I've<00:01:47.990> got<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.170> bit<00:01:48.319> longer<00:01:48.560> on<00:01:48.829> this

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
obviously I've got a bit longer on this

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.919 
obviously I've got a bit longer on this
one<00:01:49.219> so<00:01:49.369> I<00:01:49.429> know<00:01:49.520> other<00:01:49.819> two<00:01:50.090> teams<00:01:50.450> I'll<00:01:50.750> watch

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
one so I know other two teams I'll watch

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.050 
one so I know other two teams I'll watch
the<00:01:51.170> teams<00:01:51.500> play<00:01:51.890> I<00:01:52.219> think<00:01:52.520> it's<00:01:52.640> important

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
the teams play I think it's important

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.520 
the teams play I think it's important
that<00:01:53.119> you<00:01:53.240> don't<00:01:53.390> prepare<00:01:53.780> for<00:01:53.840> games<00:01:54.229> and

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
that you don't prepare for games and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.690 
that you don't prepare for games and
that<00:01:55.039> we<00:01:55.159> don't<00:01:55.310> go<00:01:55.520> into<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:55.880> totally<00:01:56.689> blind

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
that we don't go into it totally blind

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.639 
that we don't go into it totally blind
it's<00:01:58.700> not<00:01:58.909> some<00:01:59.390> preconceived<00:02:00.049> ideas

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
it's not some preconceived ideas

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.979 
it's not some preconceived ideas
whatsoever<00:02:01.189> but<00:02:01.429> you<00:02:01.489> do<00:02:01.729> have<00:02:02.329> an<00:02:02.509> awareness

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989 
whatsoever but you do have an awareness

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:07.719 
whatsoever but you do have an awareness
of<00:02:03.110> what<00:02:03.349> what<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:04.009> expect

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.660
