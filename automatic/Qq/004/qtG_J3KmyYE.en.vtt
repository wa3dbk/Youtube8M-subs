because she's gonna have a stronger

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.040 
because she's gonna have a stronger
early<00:02:43.640> game<00:02:43.819> and<00:02:44.060> first<00:02:44.209> clear<00:02:44.510> which<00:02:44.780> is<00:02:44.900> one

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
early game and first clear which is one

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.870 
early game and first clear which is one
of<00:02:45.080> her<00:02:45.200> big<00:02:45.319> problems<00:02:45.650> right<00:02:45.770> now<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.670> she's

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
of her big problems right now and she's

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.920

also<00:02:47.030> gonna<00:02:47.150> have<00:02:47.240> better<00:02:47.450> scaling<00:02:47.810> in<00:02:47.870> the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
also gonna have better scaling in the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.780 
also gonna have better scaling in the
late<00:02:48.080> game<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:48.650> think<00:02:48.830> she'll<00:02:49.520> definitely

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790
