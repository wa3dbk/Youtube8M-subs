here and drop them now you've got that
little<00:02:36.130> river<00:02:36.400> angle<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:37.540> want<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:38.130> just<00:02:39.130> if

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
little river angle you want to just if

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.009 
little river angle you want to just if
you<00:02:39.580> just<00:02:39.610> keep<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.180> fingers<00:02:40.480> perfectly

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
you just keep the fingers perfectly

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.550 
you just keep the fingers perfectly
still<00:02:41.349> on<00:02:41.500> your<00:02:41.590> drag<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:43.569> cards<00:02:44.019> will<00:02:44.260> come

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
still on your drag the cards will come

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.630 
still on your drag the cards will come
out<00:02:44.800> okay<00:02:45.540> but<00:02:46.540> we<00:02:47.260> want<00:02:47.470> them<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.620> come<00:02:47.830> out<00:02:48.069> in

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
out okay but we want them to come out in

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.660 
out okay but we want them to come out in
little<00:02:48.940> bits<00:02:49.739> evenly<00:02:50.739> so<00:02:51.099> what<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.400> need<00:02:51.550> to

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
little bits evenly so what you need to

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.509 
little bits evenly so what you need to
do<00:02:51.849> is<00:02:51.910> is<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.959> if<00:02:53.410> you<00:02:53.860> were<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.160> hold<00:02:54.340> the

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
do is is it if you were to hold the

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.520 
do is is it if you were to hold the
cause<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.239> push<00:02:55.600> underneath<00:02:56.260> and

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
cause of this and push underneath and

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.240 
cause of this and push underneath and
apply<00:02:56.860> pressure<00:02:57.220> they<00:02:58.120> Bend<00:02:58.569> okay<00:02:59.319> we<00:02:59.980> want<00:03:00.160> to

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
apply pressure they Bend okay we want to

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.789 
apply pressure they Bend okay we want to
do<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.459> opposite<00:03:00.940> we<00:03:01.480> wanna<00:03:01.720> we<00:03:02.530> don't<00:03:02.590> want

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
do the opposite we wanna we don't want

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.470 
do the opposite we wanna we don't want
them<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:03.040> actually<00:03:03.130> bend<00:03:03.670> but<00:03:04.000> we<00:03:04.090> won't<00:03:04.269> apply

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
them to actually bend but we won't apply

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.590 
them to actually bend but we won't apply
that<00:03:04.720> pressure<00:03:05.080> on<00:03:05.290> either<00:03:05.590> side<00:03:06.280> okay<00:03:06.700> so

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
that pressure on either side okay so

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.309 
that pressure on either side okay so
I've<00:03:07.690> applied<00:03:07.900> pressure<00:03:08.230> here<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.980> here<00:03:09.489> and

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
I've applied pressure here and here and

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.559 
I've applied pressure here and here and
what<00:03:11.319> you<00:03:11.500> do<00:03:11.739> is<00:03:12.060> whilst<00:03:13.060> your<00:03:13.299> pilot

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
what you do is whilst your pilot

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.630 
what you do is whilst your pilot
pressure<00:03:13.780> even<00:03:14.650> with<00:03:14.799> this<00:03:14.980> index<00:03:15.370> when<00:03:15.519> you

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
pressure even with this index when you

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.640 
pressure even with this index when you
push<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.450> slide<00:03:17.230> all<00:03:18.150> right<00:03:19.150> push<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.230> slide

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
push and slide all right push and slide

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.530 
push and slide all right push and slide
away<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.840> what<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.680> do<00:03:23.830> is<00:03:23.880> some<00:03:24.880> people<00:03:25.269> tell

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
away and what you do is some people tell

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.460 
away and what you do is some people tell
you<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.750> write<00:03:26.200> slowly<00:03:26.769> raise<00:03:27.099> this<00:03:27.280> finger<00:03:27.760> up

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
you to write slowly raise this finger up

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.190 
you to write slowly raise this finger up
which<00:03:29.670> doesn't<00:03:30.670> work<00:03:30.880> for<00:03:31.209> me<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:32.019> I<00:03:32.170> think

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
which doesn't work for me and I think

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.910 
which doesn't work for me and I think
that's<00:03:32.620> absolute<00:03:33.130> crap<00:03:33.840> so<00:03:34.840> what<00:03:34.989> I<00:03:35.019> do<00:03:35.170> is<00:03:35.410> I

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
that's absolute crap so what I do is I

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.449 
that's absolute crap so what I do is I
just<00:03:36.340> push<00:03:37.109> looks<00:03:38.109> and<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.530> head<00:03:38.709> flat<00:03:39.069> slip

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
just push looks and the head flat slip

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.819 
just push looks and the head flat slip
flattens<00:03:40.000> there<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:40.510> slide<00:03:41.670> okay<00:03:43.650> lots<00:03:44.650> of

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
flattens there and slide okay lots of

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.640 
flattens there and slide okay lots of
pressure<00:03:45.100> does<00:03:45.489> does<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.030> trick<00:03:46.239> for<00:03:46.299> me<00:03:46.650> so

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
pressure does does the trick for me so

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.720 
pressure does does the trick for me so
your<00:03:47.829> Porsche<00:03:48.760> all<00:03:49.720> right<00:03:50.370> make<00:03:51.370> sure<00:03:51.400> that

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
your Porsche all right make sure that

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.059 
your Porsche all right make sure that
head<00:03:51.970> flattens<00:03:52.540> out<00:03:52.870> every<00:03:53.230> time<00:03:53.410> Porsche

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
head flattens out every time Porsche

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.910 
head flattens out every time Porsche
okay

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:08.860 

so<00:04:01.610> let's<00:04:02.240> take<00:04:02.450> it<00:04:02.630> back<00:04:02.780> up<00:04:07.630> so<00:04:08.630> you're<00:04:08.750> going

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
so let's take it back up so you're going

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.610 
so let's take it back up so you're going

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
to push and slide alright what else

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.890 
to push and slide alright what else
happens<00:04:16.370> that<00:04:16.730> I<00:04:16.760> notice<00:04:17.239> is<00:04:17.450> when<00:04:17.600> you<00:04:17.750> get
