00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
this video I'm going to show you how to

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.780 
this video I'm going to show you how to
connect<00:00:09.320> one<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.530> nonlinear<00:00:11.130> advanced

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
connect one of the nonlinear advanced

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.780 
connect one of the nonlinear advanced
panoramic<00:00:12.469> rotators<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.769> case<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.610> on

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
panoramic rotators in this case and on

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.500 
panoramic rotators in this case and on

this<00:00:18.660> case<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.170> nonlinear<00:00:20.010> three<00:00:21.289> the<00:00:22.289> Technic

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
this case a nonlinear three the Technic

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.929 
this case a nonlinear three the Technic
applies<00:00:22.920> whether<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.269> 98<00:00:25.019> for<00:00:25.230> 90<00:00:25.560> 16<00:00:26.039> but

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
applies whether it's a 98 for 90 16 but

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.179 
applies whether it's a 98 for 90 16 but
i'll<00:00:27.060> do<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> different<00:00:27.630> video<00:00:27.800> which<00:00:28.800> shows

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
i'll do a different video which shows

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.630 
i'll do a different video which shows
the<00:00:29.550> rd<00:00:29.939> 16<00:00:30.529> going<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> knowledge<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.369> fine

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
the rd 16 going to a knowledge of fine

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.229 
the rd 16 going to a knowledge of fine
but<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.660> techniques<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.230> both<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> same<00:00:35.239> so

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
but the techniques of both the same so

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.369 
but the techniques of both the same so
how<00:00:36.420> do<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:36.570> connect<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.500> guy<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:39.059> guy

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
how do we connect this guy to this guy

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.959 
how do we connect this guy to this guy
pretty<00:00:40.379> simple<00:00:40.559> don't<00:00:40.950> need<00:00:41.070> any<00:00:41.280> tools<00:00:41.489> apart

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
pretty simple don't need any tools apart

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.130 
pretty simple don't need any tools apart
from<00:00:42.149> one<00:00:42.300> thing<00:00:42.570> which<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.879> coin<00:00:45.140> and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
from one thing which is a coin and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.000 
from one thing which is a coin and
that's<00:00:46.770> about<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.039> really<00:00:47.510> when<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:49.010> receive

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
that's about it really when you receive

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.220 
that's about it really when you receive
one<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.579> these<00:00:50.730> advanced<00:00:51.510> run<00:00:51.660> Taylor<00:00:51.960> heads

you should go a couple bags of spare

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.119 
you should go a couple bags of spare
parts<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.640> depends<00:00:56.969> which<00:00:58.070> normal<00:00:59.070> in

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
parts and it depends which normal in

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.860 
parts and it depends which normal in
your<00:00:59.280> head<00:00:59.430> you're<00:00:59.640> getting<00:00:59.910> which<00:01:00.239> bangers

going to take off the yup around or

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.679 
going to take off the yup around or
ninja<00:01:21.060> 3<00:01:21.360> because<00:01:22.909> we<00:01:23.909> don't<00:01:24.090> need<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.450> on

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
ninja 3 because we don't need that on

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.350 
ninja 3 because we don't need that on
well<00:01:24.960> with<00:01:25.400> what<00:01:26.400> we're<00:01:26.549> doing<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.240> we

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
well with what we're doing this so we

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.569 
well with what we're doing this so we
can<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:27.920> get<00:01:28.920> rid<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:30.890> next<00:01:31.890> thing<00:01:32.189> is

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
can just get rid of that next thing is

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.480 
can just get rid of that next thing is
just<00:01:32.880> move<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.240> hand<00:01:33.450> away<00:01:34.100> next<00:01:35.100> thing<00:01:35.369> we

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
just move the hand away next thing we

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.510 
just move the hand away next thing we
need<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.970> take<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.020> guy<00:01:37.259> off<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.340> just

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
need to take this guy off this is just

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.389 
need to take this guy off this is just
hand<00:01:39.030> tight<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.409> unscrew<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:43.350> top<00:01:43.590> knob<00:01:43.950> put

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
hand tight just unscrew the top knob put

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.510 
hand tight just unscrew the top knob put
that<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.640> one<00:01:44.759> side<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:46.170> bottom<00:01:46.520> rotator

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
that to one side and the bottom rotator

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.620 
that to one side and the bottom rotator
comes<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:48.680> on<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.979> base<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.670> nonlinear

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
comes out on the base of the nonlinear

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.499 
comes out on the base of the nonlinear
three<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.380> one<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.970> brands<00:01:53.970> detent

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
three we have one of the brands detent

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.240 
three we have one of the brands detent
rings<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.200> whether<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.740> tool<00:01:55.950> comes

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
rings and this is whether the tool comes

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.200 
rings and this is whether the tool comes
in<00:01:56.369> handy<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.450> we<00:01:57.780> just<00:01:57.990> use<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> coin<00:01:58.469> just

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
in handy so we just use a coin just

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.899 
in handy so we just use a coin just
errata<00:02:00.310> d<00:02:01.310> 10<00:02:01.549> training<00:02:01.840> put<00:02:02.840> into<00:02:03.110> one<00:02:03.229> side

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
errata d 10 training put into one side

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.149 
errata d 10 training put into one side
and<00:02:04.909> in<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:05.780> bottom<00:02:06.080> of<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.350> nonlinear<00:02:06.830> three

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
and in the bottom of the nonlinear three

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.650 
and in the bottom of the nonlinear three
is<00:02:07.280> a<00:02:07.310> little<00:02:07.640> brass<00:02:07.880> spacer<00:02:10.300> plug<00:02:11.300> here<00:02:11.510> which

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
is a little brass spacer plug here which

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.420 
is a little brass spacer plug here which
we<00:02:11.840> need<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.340> again<00:02:13.340> remove<00:02:13.760> using<00:02:14.180> our<00:02:14.330> trusty

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
we need to again remove using our trusty

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:23.110 
we need to again remove using our trusty
coin<00:02:17.050> so<00:02:18.190> just<00:02:19.190> unscrew<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.120> guy<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.850> off<00:02:23.090> it

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
coin so just unscrew that guy and off it

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:32.320 
coin so just unscrew that guy and off it
goes<00:02:24.400> okay<00:02:25.400> so<00:02:25.819> no<00:02:26.720> matter<00:02:27.140> our<00:02:29.530> dat<00:02:30.530> 16<00:02:31.430> and

the<00:02:59.209> two<00:02:59.390> little<00:02:59.540> holes<00:02:59.810> on<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.650> top<00:03:00.680> of<00:03:00.860> the

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
the two little holes on the top of the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.539 
the two little holes on the top of the
unit<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:02.390> may<00:03:02.540> find<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:03.080> bit<00:03:03.829> stiff<00:03:04.130> if<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.400> do

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
unit you may find it bit stiff if you do

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.690 
unit you may find it bit stiff if you do
just<00:03:04.630> tap<00:03:05.630> it<00:03:05.660> in<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.950> that's<00:03:07.160> it's<00:03:07.400> on<00:03:07.549> there

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
just tap it in and that's it's on there

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.979 
just tap it in and that's it's on there
nicely<00:03:08.680> next<00:03:09.680> we<00:03:09.799> get<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.600> nonlinear<00:03:11.600> three

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
nicely next we get the nonlinear three

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.140 
nicely next we get the nonlinear three
you<00:03:12.709> don't<00:03:12.920> chance<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.400> two<00:03:13.579> little<00:03:13.880> white

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
you don't chance the two little white

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
you don't chance the two little white
plugs<00:03:15.459> on<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.640> lower<00:03:16.850> arm<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.450> they<00:03:17.600> sit<00:03:17.930> in

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
plugs on the lower arm and they sit in

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.840 
plugs on the lower arm and they sit in
the<00:03:18.620> little<00:03:18.829> holes<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.519> top<00:03:19.670> of<00:03:19.790> this

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
the little holes and the top of this

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.520 
the little holes and the top of this
little<00:03:20.090> plastic<00:03:20.269> spacer<00:03:20.750> like<00:03:21.620> that<00:03:22.900> I<00:03:23.900> think

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
little plastic spacer like that I think

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.560 
little plastic spacer like that I think
they're<00:03:24.799> on<00:03:24.920> any<00:03:25.250> way<00:03:25.790> around<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.269> really

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
they're on any way around it really

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.080 
they're on any way around it really
doesn't<00:03:26.780> matter<00:03:27.190> which<00:03:28.190> way<00:03:28.400> around<00:03:30.970> next<00:03:31.970> we

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
doesn't matter which way around next we

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.110 
doesn't matter which way around next we
take<00:03:32.299> the<00:03:32.600> center<00:03:33.560> bolt<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:34.100> open<00:03:34.850> them<00:03:35.000> in

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
take the center bolt and open them in

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.699 
take the center bolt and open them in
place<00:03:35.360> one<00:03:35.720> hand<00:03:35.750> we<00:03:36.200> just<00:03:36.410> hand<00:03:37.220> tighten<00:03:37.670> it

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
place one hand we just hand tighten it

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:46.750 
place one hand we just hand tighten it
in<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:40.160> then<00:03:40.489> we<00:03:41.060> get<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.269> arm<00:03:41.870> key<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:45.760> just

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
in and then we get the arm key and just

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:54.520 
in and then we get the arm key and just
tighten<00:03:47.000> them<00:03:47.209> up<00:03:51.130> there<00:03:52.130> we<00:03:52.370> go

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.170 

that's<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.680> pretty<00:03:55.890> much<00:03:56.040> done<00:03:56.370> all<00:03:56.879> we<00:03:57.030> need

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
that's a pretty much done all we need

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.250 
that's a pretty much done all we need
now<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.420> ending<00:03:58.050> and<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:59.459> bag<00:03:59.670> of<00:04:00.260> bitch

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
now is ending and the bag of bitch

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.449 
now is ending and the bag of bitch
you've<00:04:01.650> got<00:04:01.830> this<00:04:02.010> little<00:04:02.430> Knoll<00:04:03.180> ninja<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:04.500> top

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
you've got this little Knoll ninja a top

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.490 
you've got this little Knoll ninja a top
cap<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.030> that<00:04:06.209> just<00:04:06.450> screws<00:04:07.340> directly<00:04:08.340> on<00:04:08.430> top

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
cap and that just screws directly on top

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.350 
cap and that just screws directly on top
then<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.709> was<00:04:10.860> pretty<00:04:11.040> pretty<00:04:11.790> straightforward

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
then I was pretty pretty straightforward

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.020 
then I was pretty pretty straightforward
and<00:04:12.480> he<00:04:12.540> took<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:13.099> minute<00:04:14.099> or<00:04:14.250> so<00:04:14.370> to<00:04:14.400> do<00:04:14.640> it<00:04:14.790> and

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
and he took a minute or so to do it and

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.469 
and he took a minute or so to do it and
then<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:15.989> course<00:04:16.019> it's<00:04:16.350> just<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.590> matter<00:04:16.769> of

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
then of course it's just a matter of

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:32.950 
then of course it's just a matter of
connecting<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:21.000> upper<00:04:21.120> arm<00:04:21.389> back<00:04:21.660> on<00:04:26.240> and

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.730 

remove<00:04:33.960> this<00:04:34.200> space<00:04:34.650> right<00:04:34.889> away<00:04:35.160> bits<00:04:35.430> we<00:04:35.669> can

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
remove this space right away bits we can

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.670 
remove this space right away bits we can
connect<00:04:37.740> that<00:04:37.919> hung<00:04:38.130> up<00:04:38.870> right<00:04:39.870> by<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:40.500> way<00:04:40.620> to

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
connect that hung up right by the way to

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.050 
connect that hung up right by the way to
put<00:04:41.340> this<00:04:41.370> bottom<00:04:41.850> knob<00:04:42.030> on<00:04:42.210> first<00:04:42.690> and<00:04:42.990> then

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
put this bottom knob on first and then

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:52.120 
put this bottom knob on first and then
put<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:46.669> copper<00:04:47.669> ah<00:04:47.789> one<00:04:48.110> screw<00:04:49.110> on<00:04:49.229> in<00:04:49.410> place

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.550 

there<00:04:53.130> we<00:04:53.190> go<00:04:53.310> that's<00:04:53.699> it<00:04:53.910> we've<00:04:54.210> now<00:04:54.560> tighten

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
there we go that's it we've now tighten

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.180 
there we go that's it we've now tighten
up<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:55.710> bit<00:04:55.919> more<00:04:56.100> there<00:04:57.090> you<00:04:57.180> go<00:04:58.010> that's<00:04:59.010> it

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
up a bit more there you go that's it

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.700 
up a bit more there you go that's it
we've<00:04:59.370> modified<00:04:59.820> the<00:05:00.350> knowledge<00:05:01.350> of<00:05:01.470> three

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
we've modified the knowledge of three

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.740 
we've modified the knowledge of three

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.650 
and attached down on da and that you
really<00:05:06.900> go<00:05:07.160> so<00:05:08.160> that's<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.610> how<00:05:08.849> to<00:05:08.910> connect<00:05:09.330> an
