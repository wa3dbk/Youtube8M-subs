it's<00:02:31.510> all<00:02:31.780> digital<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:32.680> it's<00:02:32.920> designed<00:02:33.310> for

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
it's all digital so it's designed for

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.180 
it's all digital so it's designed for
today's<00:02:33.880> uses<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.630> we<00:02:35.290> made<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.620> reversible

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
today's uses and we made it reversible

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.900 
today's uses and we made it reversible
so<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.760> fits<00:02:37.030> either<00:02:37.240> way<00:02:38.040> we<00:02:39.040> also<00:02:39.220> move<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.880> a

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
so it fits either way we also move to a

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.780 
so it fits either way we also move to a
