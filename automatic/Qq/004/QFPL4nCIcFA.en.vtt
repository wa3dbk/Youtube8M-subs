00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
snow blower actually has room that I can

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.979 
snow blower actually has room that I can
actually<00:02:15.700> slap<00:02:16.030> on<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.269> big<00:02:16.450> outs<00:02:16.600> 15

actually slap on a big outs 15
horsepower<00:02:17.400> engine<00:02:18.400> well<00:02:18.610> I'm<00:02:18.790> in<00:02:18.910> 16<00:02:19.300> hours

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
horsepower engine well I'm in 16 hours

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.170 
horsepower engine well I'm in 16 hours
so<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.290> could<00:02:20.440> toss<00:02:20.590> on<00:02:20.769> a<00:02:20.800> big<00:02:21.040> 16<00:02:21.519> horse<00:02:21.790> engine

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
so I could toss on a big 16 horse engine

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.750 
so I could toss on a big 16 horse engine
on<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.660> snow<00:02:22.870> blower<00:02:23.080> so<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:24.310> look<00:02:24.580> in<00:02:24.700> a

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
on to that snow blower so you look in a

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.600 
on to that snow blower so you look in a
way<00:02:24.880> it's<00:02:25.030> made<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:27.040> know<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.280> guy<00:02:27.400> already

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
way it's made you know the guy already

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.949 
way it's made you know the guy already
has<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.970> extension<00:02:28.450> at<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.660> back<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.840> the

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
has the extension at the back of the

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.600 
has the extension at the back of the
motor<00:02:29.200> here<00:02:29.620> because<00:02:29.920> it's<00:02:30.130> not<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.519> original

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
motor here because it's not the original

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.350 
motor here because it's not the original
motor<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.959> I<00:02:31.989> could<00:02:32.230> actually<00:02:32.380> get<00:02:32.590> away<00:02:32.799> with

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
motor so I could actually get away with

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.820 
motor so I could actually get away with
cheap<00:02:34.360> wanting<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.870> big-ass<00:02:35.200> engine<00:02:35.530> like<00:02:35.680> this

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
cheap wanting a big-ass engine like this

cheap wanting a big-ass engine like this
on<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.360> know<00:02:37.720> go<00:02:37.930> from<00:02:38.170> an<00:02:38.500> old<00:02:38.709> five

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
on to it so you know go from an old five

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.310 
on to it so you know go from an old five

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.710 
to seven horsepower rate to 16
horsepower<00:02:41.560> yeah<00:02:42.519> I<00:02:42.580> think<00:02:42.790> she<00:02:42.910> would<00:02:43.000> fly<00:02:43.209> so

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
horsepower yeah I think she would fly so

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.900 
horsepower yeah I think she would fly so
when<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:43.930> got<00:02:44.049> actually<00:02:44.380> wanted<00:02:44.730> one<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:45.760> these

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
when I got actually wanted one of these

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.479 
when I got actually wanted one of these
with<00:02:46.209> a<00:02:46.260> electric<00:02:47.260> starter<00:02:47.620> generator<00:02:47.830> combo

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
with a electric starter generator combo

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.270 
with a electric starter generator combo
so<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.970> probably<00:02:49.810> can<00:02:50.019> make<00:02:50.110> something<00:02:50.320> work

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.100 

okay<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.790> got<00:02:54.970> it<00:02:55.120> off<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.420> truck<00:02:55.660> I'm

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
okay so I got it off the truck I'm

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.370 
okay so I got it off the truck I'm
starting<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.769> look<00:02:56.890> over<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:58.110> molder<00:02:59.110> most

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
starting to look over to molder most

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.990 
starting to look over to molder most
likely<00:02:59.739> has<00:02:59.920> a<00:02:59.950> stuck<00:03:00.250> valve<00:03:00.280> but<00:03:00.820> that's

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
likely has a stuck valve but that's

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.970 
likely has a stuck valve but that's
normal<00:03:01.420> from<00:03:01.600> sitting<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.530> probably<00:03:02.830> been

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
normal from sitting it probably been

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.800 
normal from sitting it probably been
sitting<00:03:03.130> 10<00:03:03.430> years<00:03:03.670> maybe<00:03:03.910> 20<00:03:04.300> years

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.850 

missing<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:07.870> gas<00:03:07.990> cap<00:03:08.230> but<00:03:08.380> I<00:03:08.440> think<00:03:08.590> I<00:03:08.680> fell

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
missing the gas cap but I think I fell

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.030 
missing the gas cap but I think I fell
off<00:03:08.890> in<00:03:09.160> transit<00:03:10.380> doesn't<00:03:11.380> seem<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.620> have<00:03:11.770> too

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
off in transit doesn't seem to have too

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.300 
off in transit doesn't seem to have too
much<00:03:12.070> for<00:03:12.400> rust<00:03:12.610> inside<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:13.120> looks<00:03:14.100> be<00:03:15.100> pretty

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
much for rust inside it looks be pretty

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.020 
much for rust inside it looks be pretty
good<00:03:16.740> so<00:03:17.740> yeah<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.310> know<00:03:18.490> I<00:03:18.580> could<00:03:18.820> get<00:03:18.940> that

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
good so yeah I know I could get that

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.560 
good so yeah I know I could get that
motor<00:03:19.270> running<00:03:19.720> but<00:03:20.520> it's<00:03:21.520> a<00:03:21.640> cast<00:03:21.850> iron<00:03:22.060> model

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
motor running but it's a cast iron model

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.980 
motor running but it's a cast iron model
14<00:03:23.220> which<00:03:24.220> only<00:03:24.520> put<00:03:24.880> out<00:03:25.030> five<00:03:25.660> horsepower

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
14 which only put out five horsepower

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.930 
14 which only put out five horsepower
actually<00:03:26.680> maybe<00:03:26.800> a<00:03:26.920> 6<00:03:27.190> or<00:03:27.310> 7<00:03:27.580> i'm<00:03:27.700> trying<00:03:27.880> to

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
actually maybe a 6 or 7 i'm trying to

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.780 
actually maybe a 6 or 7 i'm trying to
remember<00:03:28.000> but<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.540> was<00:03:28.630> between<00:03:28.840> six<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.380> seven

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
remember but it was between six to seven

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.430 
remember but it was between six to seven
five<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:31.000> seven<00:03:31.210> horsepower<00:03:31.480> i<00:03:31.870> guess<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:32.350> all

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
five to seven horsepower i guess it all

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.520 
five to seven horsepower i guess it all
depends<00:03:32.850> also<00:03:33.850> got<00:03:34.150> another<00:03:34.540> model<00:03:34.960> 14<00:03:35.350> but

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
depends also got another model 14 but

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.800 
depends also got another model 14 but
the<00:03:35.650> aluminum<00:03:36.100> version<00:03:36.910> up<00:03:37.360> on<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:37.660> truck

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
the aluminum version up on the truck

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.410 
the aluminum version up on the truck
there<00:03:38.110> but<00:03:39.040> this<00:03:39.610> is<00:03:39.820> what<00:03:39.970> I'm<00:03:40.090> thinking

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
there but this is what I'm thinking

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.530 
there but this is what I'm thinking
right<00:03:40.450> here<00:03:41.400> 16<00:03:42.400> horsepower<00:03:42.730> is<00:03:43.270> an

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
right here 16 horsepower is an

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.300 
right here 16 horsepower is an
industrial<00:03:43.780> commercial<00:03:44.440> Briggs<00:03:44.770> it's<00:03:45.100> from

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
industrial commercial Briggs it's from

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.430 
industrial commercial Briggs it's from
1981<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:46.330> it's<00:03:46.450> actually<00:03:46.720> not<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:46.840> old<00:03:47.200> I

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
1981 so it's actually not that old I

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.190 
1981 so it's actually not that old I
also<00:03:47.950> got<00:03:48.190> another<00:03:48.220> one<00:03:48.520> from<00:03:48.780> 1977<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:50.050> then

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
also got another one from 1977 and then

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.990 
also got another one from 1977 and then
another<00:03:50.440> one<00:03:50.650> I<00:03:50.710> can't<00:03:51.280> remember<00:03:51.550> but<00:03:51.910> the

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
another one I can't remember but the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.270 
another one I can't remember but the
other<00:03:52.120> one<00:03:52.300> is<00:03:52.540> just<00:03:52.990> for<00:03:53.050> part<00:03:53.410> so<00:03:53.710> I<00:03:53.890> got<00:03:54.130> to

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
other one is just for part so I got to

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.080 
other one is just for part so I got to
complete<00:03:54.670> ones<00:03:56.520> so<00:03:57.520> I'm<00:03:57.610> thinking<00:03:57.640> I<00:03:58.060> might

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
complete ones so I'm thinking I might

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.720 
complete ones so I'm thinking I might
even<00:03:58.540> try<00:03:59.200> to<00:03:59.290> shoehorn<00:03:59.530> this<00:03:59.950> engine<00:04:00.310> into

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
even try to shoehorn this engine into

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.430 
even try to shoehorn this engine into
there<00:04:00.880> now<00:04:01.540> if<00:04:01.630> you<00:04:01.720> look<00:04:01.840> at<00:04:01.990> these<00:04:02.230> two

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
there now if you look at these two

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
there now if you look at these two
engines<00:04:02.770> if<00:04:02.860> I<00:04:02.950> put<00:04:03.130> them<00:04:03.220> at<00:04:03.310> you

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
engines if I put them at you

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.950 
engines if I put them at you
side-by-side<00:04:03.640> this<00:04:04.270> one's<00:04:04.480> only<00:04:04.660> going<00:04:04.840> to<00:04:04.900> be

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
side-by-side this one's only going to be

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.390 
side-by-side this one's only going to be
about<00:04:04.990> noon<00:04:05.290> extra<00:04:05.560> maybe<00:04:05.890> inch<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:06.340> a<00:04:06.370> half

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
about noon extra maybe inch and a half

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.790 
about noon extra maybe inch and a half
two<00:04:06.700> inches<00:04:06.730> taller<00:04:07.290> so<00:04:08.290> it's<00:04:08.410> actually<00:04:08.710> not

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
two inches taller so it's actually not

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.010 
two inches taller so it's actually not
that<00:04:08.860> much<00:04:09.010> bigger<00:04:09.340> so<00:04:11.400> so<00:04:12.400> I'm<00:04:12.550> thinking<00:04:13.090> you

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
that much bigger so so I'm thinking you

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.100 
that much bigger so so I'm thinking you
know<00:04:14.140> that<00:04:15.100> snow<00:04:15.490> blower<00:04:15.810> with<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:16.840> big-ass

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.110 
know that snow blower with a big-ass

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.320 
know that snow blower with a big-ass
engine<00:04:17.680> yeah<00:04:18.040> papi<00:04:18.370> break<00:04:18.610> to<00:04:18.730> share<00:04:18.910> pins<00:04:19.180> if

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
engine yeah papi break to share pins if

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.840 
engine yeah papi break to share pins if
it<00:04:19.450> even<00:04:19.540> has<00:04:19.780> some<00:04:20.340> as<00:04:21.340> you<00:04:21.460> can<00:04:21.580> see<00:04:21.730> it's

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
it even has some as you can see it's

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.440 
it even has some as you can see it's
pretty<00:04:22.210> much<00:04:22.390> all<00:04:22.750> chain<00:04:23.080> drive<00:04:23.320> inside<00:04:23.680> there

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
pretty much all chain drive inside there

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.680 
pretty much all chain drive inside there
so<00:04:26.700> thinking<00:04:27.700> I<00:04:27.790> might<00:04:27.880> try<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.090> shoehorn<00:04:28.330> on

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
so thinking I might try to shoehorn on

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.140 
so thinking I might try to shoehorn on
that<00:04:29.440> engine<00:04:29.620> might<00:04:30.400> be<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.550> pretty<00:04:30.970> fun

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
that engine might be a pretty fun

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.240 
that engine might be a pretty fun
project<00:04:31.600> to<00:04:31.630> do<00:04:34.560> well<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.680> other<00:04:35.740> option<00:04:35.890> is

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
project to do well the other option is

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.040 
project to do well the other option is
thinking<00:04:36.610> is<00:04:36.700> with<00:04:36.880> this<00:04:37.060> engine<00:04:37.270> here<00:04:37.750> it

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
thinking is with this engine here it

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.120 
thinking is with this engine here it
makes<00:04:38.290> a<00:04:38.500> 16<00:04:39.370> horsepower<00:04:39.610> at<00:04:39.970> 3,600<00:04:40.480> RPM<00:04:41.130> but

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
makes a 16 horsepower at 3,600 RPM but

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.010 
makes a 16 horsepower at 3,600 RPM but
if<00:04:42.250> you<00:04:42.340> turn<00:04:42.550> it<00:04:42.580> right<00:04:42.910> down<00:04:43.120> and<00:04:43.540> set<00:04:43.780> it<00:04:43.900> so

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
if you turn it right down and set it so

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.490 
if you turn it right down and set it so
it<00:04:44.050> only<00:04:44.200> runs<00:04:44.440> thats<00:04:44.740> a<00:04:44.920> 1800<00:04:45.520> RPM<00:04:46.240> and<00:04:46.500> I

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
it only runs thats a 1800 RPM and I

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.080 
it only runs thats a 1800 RPM and I
could<00:04:47.620> probably<00:04:47.770> turn<00:04:48.010> a<00:04:48.070> 5000<00:04:48.730> coat<00:04:48.880> or<00:04:49.060> a

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
could probably turn a 5000 coat or a

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.440 
could probably turn a 5000 coat or a
fico<00:04:49.630> kilowatt<00:04:50.320> generator<00:04:50.650> with<00:04:51.370> it<00:04:51.520> so<00:04:51.790> 5000

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
fico kilowatt generator with it so 5000

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.200 
fico kilowatt generator with it so 5000
watt<00:04:52.570> generator<00:04:53.040> so<00:04:54.040> I'm<00:04:54.490> just<00:04:54.670> thinking<00:04:54.970> belt

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
watt generator so I'm just thinking belt

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.940 
watt generator so I'm just thinking belt
drive<00:04:55.450> it<00:04:55.600> to<00:04:55.720> a<00:04:55.750> generator<00:04:56.260> might<00:04:56.770> be<00:04:56.920> a

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
drive it to a generator might be a

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.100 
drive it to a generator might be a
pretty<00:04:57.340> neat<00:04:57.550> project<00:04:57.760> to<00:04:58.090> do<00:04:58.240> and<00:04:58.420> I'm<00:04:58.960> also

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
pretty neat project to do and I'm also

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.930 
pretty neat project to do and I'm also
thinking<00:04:59.380> being<00:04:59.740> a<00:04:59.800> 15<00:05:00.160> horse<00:05:00.370> engine<00:05:00.700> I<00:05:00.790> can

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
thinking being a 15 horse engine I can

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.060 
thinking being a 15 horse engine I can
belt<00:05:01.150> drive<00:05:01.720> it<00:05:01.870> to<00:05:01.990> a<00:05:02.020> generator<00:05:02.530> and<00:05:02.740> the

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
belt drive it to a generator and the

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.390 
belt drive it to a generator and the
small<00:05:03.310> air<00:05:03.790> compressor<00:05:03.820> at<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.510> same<00:05:04.690> time<00:05:04.900> so

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
small air compressor at the same time so

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.800 
small air compressor at the same time so
might<00:05:06.400> be<00:05:06.550> a<00:05:06.580> project<00:05:06.940> i<00:05:07.180> might<00:05:07.330> do<00:05:07.480> with<00:05:07.630> it

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
might be a project i might do with it

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.450 
might be a project i might do with it
because<00:05:08.050> i<00:05:08.260> do<00:05:08.320> have<00:05:08.470> two<00:05:08.800> of<00:05:08.890> these<00:05:08.980> one<00:05:09.250> has

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
because i do have two of these one has

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.700 
because i do have two of these one has
the<00:05:09.610> full<00:05:09.760> blow<00:05:10.180> in<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.390> garden<00:05:11.350> tractor

package<00:05:12.310> i<00:05:12.430> guess<00:05:12.580> you<00:05:12.700> could<00:05:12.820> say<00:05:12.940> with<00:05:13.090> the

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
package i guess you could say with the

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.510 
package i guess you could say with the
electric<00:05:13.900> start<00:05:14.200> and<00:05:14.500> generator<00:05:15.340> and

electric start and generator and

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.650 
electric start and generator and
everything<00:05:15.850> like<00:05:15.970> that<00:05:16.030> we're<00:05:16.390> just<00:05:16.570> one

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
everything like that we're just one

doesn't have any of that it's just a

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.879 
doesn't have any of that it's just a

kangol<00:05:20.159> kind<00:05:20.370> of<00:05:20.490> engine<00:05:22.189> so<00:05:23.189> I<00:05:23.520> got<00:05:23.849> to<00:05:23.939> decide

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
kangol kind of engine so I got to decide

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.659 
kangol kind of engine so I got to decide
either<00:05:24.419> put<00:05:24.719> this<00:05:24.870> on<00:05:25.139> there<00:05:25.889> or<00:05:26.099> I<00:05:26.249> do<00:05:26.430> even

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
either put this on there or I do even

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.129 
either put this on there or I do even
have<00:05:26.849> just<00:05:27.090> a<00:05:27.150> standard<00:05:27.449> new<00:05:27.569> or<00:05:27.689> five<00:05:27.870> horse

out<00:05:28.289> actually<00:05:28.620> moved<00:05:28.770> this<00:05:28.889> thing<00:05:29.039> is<00:05:29.159> still

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
out actually moved this thing is still

out actually moved this thing is still
pretty<00:05:29.460> good<00:05:29.669> so<00:05:30.509> that<00:05:30.689> would<00:05:30.779> be<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:30.870> easiest

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
pretty good so that would be the easiest

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.570 
pretty good so that would be the easiest
one<00:05:31.379> to<00:05:31.409> hook<00:05:31.590> up<00:05:31.800> i<00:05:31.949> got<00:05:32.099> to<00:05:32.219> briggs<00:05:32.400> and

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:43.499 
pretty close to what came stock on this

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:46.820 
pretty close to what came stock on this
in<00:05:44.090> 1973<00:05:45.090> or<00:05:45.599> something<00:05:45.930> like<00:05:46.020> that<00:05:46.080> can't

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
in 1973 or something like that can't

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.369 
in 1973 or something like that can't
remember<00:05:47.159> exactly<00:05:47.520> what<00:05:47.699> year<00:05:47.909> it's<00:05:48.029> from<00:05:48.379> of

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:49.379 
remember exactly what year it's from of

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:50.659 
remember exactly what year it's from of
course<00:05:49.650> that's<00:05:49.800> not<00:05:50.009> the<00:05:50.129> original<00:05:50.249> motor

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
course that's not the original motor

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.879 
course that's not the original motor
which<00:05:50.969> i<00:05:51.090> already<00:05:51.180> said<00:05:51.449> before<00:05:51.810> this<00:05:52.409> Morgan

hears<00:05:53.129> from<00:05:53.539> I'd<00:05:54.539> have<00:05:54.719> to<00:05:54.840> look<00:05:54.870> it<00:05:55.110> up<00:05:55.199> but

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 
hears from I'd have to look it up but

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:57.459 
hears from I'd have to look it up but
I'm<00:05:55.439> pretty<00:05:55.560> sure<00:05:55.680> it<00:05:55.800> on<00:05:55.889> motors<00:05:56.189> from<00:05:56.340> about

00:05:57.459 --> 00:05:57.469 
I'm pretty sure it on motors from about

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:01.010 
I'm pretty sure it on motors from about
1953<00:05:58.469> or<00:05:58.650> something<00:05:58.949> like<00:05:59.069> that<00:05:59.129> in<00:05:59.340> 1954<00:06:00.060> that

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
1953 or something like that in 1954 that

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.189 
1953 or something like that in 1954 that
was<00:06:01.139> from<00:06:01.229> 1981<00:06:01.919> and<00:06:02.129> that<00:06:02.430> other<00:06:02.580> one<00:06:02.669> there

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
the model 14 aluminum block is probably

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.659 
the model 14 aluminum block is probably
from<00:06:06.270> early<00:06:07.110> 6th<00:06:07.500> or<00:06:07.680> it<00:06:07.919> would<00:06:08.009> have<00:06:08.099> been<00:06:08.189> pre

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
from early 6th or it would have been pre

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.809 
from early 6th or it would have been pre
1958<00:06:09.509> because<00:06:09.810> it<00:06:09.930> still<00:06:10.080> has<00:06:10.199> two<00:06:10.349> older

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:10.819 
1958 because it still has two older

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:14.869 
1958 because it still has two older
serial<00:06:11.819> number<00:06:12.060> on<00:06:12.300> it<00:06:12.389> so<00:06:13.129> anyway<00:06:14.129> what<00:06:14.819> do

00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:14.879 
serial number on it so anyway what do

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:16.309 
serial number on it so anyway what do
you<00:06:14.939> guys<00:06:15.000> think<00:06:15.060> should<00:06:15.419> i<00:06:15.449> put<00:06:15.629> the<00:06:15.719> 16<00:06:16.080> horse

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 
you guys think should i put the 16 horse

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.800 
you guys think should i put the 16 horse
on<00:06:16.529> this<00:06:16.710> or<00:06:17.310> should<00:06:17.520> I<00:06:17.580> just<00:06:17.610> put<00:06:17.909> on<00:06:17.999> a<00:06:18.029> just
