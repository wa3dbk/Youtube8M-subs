00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
today's challenge I can't move I can

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.909 
today's challenge I can't move I can
only<00:00:05.910> pivot<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:06.509> aim<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:06.930> have<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.470> find<00:00:07.680> one

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
only pivot and aim and have to find one

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.740 
only pivot and aim and have to find one
spot<00:00:08.189> in<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.340> map<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.760> go<00:00:09.120> there<00:00:09.300> every<00:00:09.599> time

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
spot in the map and go there every time

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.749 
spot in the map and go there every time
I<00:00:10.050> think<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.800> good<00:00:11.040> way<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.280> start<00:00:11.580> off

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
I think this is a good way to start off

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.970 
I think this is a good way to start off
the<00:00:11.940> series<00:00:12.269> why<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:13.019> because<00:00:13.410> this

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
the series why is that because this

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.010 
the series why is that because this
sounds<00:00:14.490> like<00:00:14.639> it's<00:00:15.210> gonna<00:00:15.360> go<00:00:15.509> awful

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
sounds like it's gonna go awful

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.560 
sounds like it's gonna go awful
which<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.410> why<00:00:16.560> me<00:00:16.890> succeeding<00:00:17.460> will<00:00:18.060> be<00:00:18.210> even

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
which is why me succeeding will be even

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.510 
which is why me succeeding will be even
