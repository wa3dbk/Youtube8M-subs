00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.430
 Oh 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.450
 and well hi the friends dry the foot 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.400
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.590
 new video for a squat builder the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.849
 friends a team in 4 3 tomorrow it was 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.170
 long as I have been able to propose two 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.970
 squats and pulter it's really a 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.230
 team with whom I'm doing very well 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.120
 played a team that I appreciate 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.449
 a lot with a lot of very good 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.070
 players 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.360
 So here without further ado then 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.830
 start with the guardian so this is 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.050
 that they stink flange guys it's 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.180
 Italian have some who may already have to 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.500
 to know what type it is 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.879
 it's one of the teams that I use in 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.320
 my series retout d1 but it's really 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.370
 a team with which I come very 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.320
 well done that's why I'm going 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.210
 propose a squad builder and why 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.979
 not try there because frankly 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.449
 she is very very competitive 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.610
 so here you go see right now 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.870
 then the right defender so baggy 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.940
 will not swim but it's a guardian 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.799
 classic this is the one that gives the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.760
 collective defense this is why the 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.080
 master simply chuckles because 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.430
 that I find very very good on this fifa 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.580
 and costs 1000 credits simply 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.810
 that's right defender maicon alike very 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.979
 very good first time of time and 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.600
 opci cost around 1000 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.220
 between 2000 and 1000 and 2000 credit so 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.350
 really accessible is really very 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.670
 complete look at the stats in addition to there 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.840
 is physical he is sturdy and short 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.430
 pretty fast it's really very good there 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.810
 shows that you have to read go down when 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.140
 there must be no problem with that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.310
 then in central defender the first 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.470
 He is italian 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.300
 also he plays in the club that 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.640
 cheeky it's about kenny so that's it 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.590
 who is bathed 1800 credit for the card 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.880
 that he has it's free honestly so much 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.280
 to tell you the gases it's free 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.720
 because he is very very good he remains 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.010
 in defense he climbs a little bit but 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.760
 remains that a defense is the contribution 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.340
 high defense and but a 86 86 meter of 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.500
 87 physical defense and 76 speed 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.780
 the 3 the three stages combined not 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.070
 necessarily quite exceptional and for the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.870
 price that's it's really the ratio 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.430
 quality price is exceptional so 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.800
 really here I advise you this side 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.350
 right in defense and then there it comes 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.620
 of them a French player that's 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.810
 like mangala the beefy 1200 credit 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.269
 for his card it's free 85 of 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.039
 physical at 87 76 m speed these two 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.099
 groups of two beefy dudes that we 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.319
 central hinge is really 2 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.209
 mega it's fast enough to say that 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.220
 like that pretty bright and who are really 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.170
 very very good 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.460
 center hinge left defender 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.950
 it is also a French clichy 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.170
 to give the direct link with the link 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.420
 perfect with Eliaquim Mangala which 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.030
 like clichy here is 3000 very credit 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.320
 very very complete I pray them to have 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.190
 the collective so that mangala and the 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.970
 collective if not after you can 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.590
 take another player 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.240
 another french but then mangala 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.530
 will not have the collective since but 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.030
 that they play in the same club and they 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.350
 have threatened reality they have a link 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.410
 perfect for those who did not know it 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.460
 so that's very good defense I you 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.720
 invite to make this defense guys 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.000
 it 's solid it's beefy it's 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.530
 fast it's physical really there's no 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.030
 of problem with this defense was going 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.500
 really cheap as you saw 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.850
 with the prices of the players really I 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.320
 invite you to test this defense if 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.630
 you do not have to describe a lot of 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.130
 credit she will do very very very well the 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.680
 sphere midfield we start with 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.240
 a French man at this game says fuck 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.340
 hand you say I'm going to the chief game the tiff 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.320
 on this fifa guys 1900 credit and 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.330
 look at the stats it at 82.2 physics 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.940
 84 Speed ​​Defense 78 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.870
 he comes back in defense he did so much 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.800
 he's everywhere on the ground and in 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.240
 attack when you have to be in attack 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.990
 that in common defense founded when he 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.820
 must be in defense 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.260
 it's accurate in what's in the 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.300
 balloons that send to the attackers and 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.760
 it's really me you say exceptional 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.730
 this is the mainstay of our Paul team 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.870
 pogba central middle 21000 credit I 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.560
 believe it's one of the players I 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.300
 believe that this is one of the players the 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.950
 more expensive team the team sees to 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.030
 about 50 thousand credit if I say no 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.320
 of nonsense really it's really a 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.760
 very competitive team that I you 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.170
 invite to do guys can not 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.800
 here it is exceptional for the moment 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.350
 he's doing a new season 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.000
 exceptional as usual for you 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.500
 here we are more than we know what he 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.120
 worth and I hope he'll go away 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.820
 as I already mentioned in one of my 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.790
 videos so in third the central the 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.900
 guys we have a spanish this is about 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.220
 borja valero 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.660
 so even if we did not hurt who told me 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.820
 advised to put freddy guarin me 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.959
 I always chose Borja Valero 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.470
 just because I like them 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.090
 quite simply 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.040
 even though i know guarin is very very good 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.420
 valero he has very complete stats 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.280
 it's more of an offensive player there is 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.780
 not too many defensive features 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.799
 they bring really nice ball towards 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.080
 the attacked that's really what I 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.910
 search forgiveness this player there 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.739
 since low and matuidi are enough 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.500
 defensive and finally they go up to his 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.180
 descendants so that's it compensates 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.830
 the stadiums of bayrou is really here 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.390
 the very complete medium that I say 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.950
 frankly ipl cavallero's match it's 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.150
 really a trio that I like and so 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.430
 I really invite you to test this 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.169
 team there tone in any case there is 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.870
 there's no photo on it so we 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.040
 past 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.810
 a striker right it's cuadrado 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.150
 this is cuadrado that will be transferred or 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.710
 who was transferred to chelsea I say no 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.270
 of nonsense 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.890

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.870

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.380
 three assists that's what we 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.420
 asks a right winger have everything 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.800
 simply and technically it 's the 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.150
 nugget it's so much striking me 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.040
 please guys with a player 5 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.900
 stars if you can in left forward 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.020
 we also have antoine griezmann who 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.520
