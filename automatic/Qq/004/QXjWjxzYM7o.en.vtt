00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
I think that's I just let's figure out

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.070 
I think that's I just let's figure out
where<00:00:49.880> we're<00:00:50.000> going<00:00:50.180> real<00:00:50.420> quick<00:00:50.660> in<00:00:50.810> them<00:00:50.960> you

I go oh let's figure out the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.270 
I go oh let's figure out the
instead<00:00:56.960> of<00:00:57.080> vlogging<00:00:57.290> and<00:00:57.560> then<00:00:57.710> all<00:00:58.040> the
