00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everyone we duo has also talked a lot about the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.530
 public expenditure phases 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.530
 I felt like an offensive phase injury 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.359
 same for the door 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:14.229
 so now I want to say 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:16.880
 so why not working on the head 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.400
 in this video we will talk about each sex stalls 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.660
 do not talk untouchable I can not speak that extra used for the 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.169
 Carry on 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.109
 the bce could speak also of the focus attack percentage that in n3 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.060
 christelle appreciates a lot advanced big loop 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.190
 for the rabbit thing that we will start these two TV channels there 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.980
 failed 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.420
 nice record to train on the same chain sam's club what I 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.490
 did not do it until three days because I know pretty much the same thing 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.490
 that no other character than the ultimate goal 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.880
 and I want to do a little function housing policies the coach does 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.620
 choices 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.560
 more does it talk about your character after all it's more than time to 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.040
 immediately in the ideas 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.060
 it's not about taking the risk and the engines 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.460
 Frankfurt like the others 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.970
 effective topshop 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.820
 many had put on the corner of his head and his basic sweetheart 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.920
 he still believes that the gesture that counts 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.920
 leave to be put in order 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.430
 not choose the best option 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.840
 I want to make a film about a tiny retreat 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.620
 this is happy with what you see we blame it's the real pair of 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.070
 sneakers we are not dogs etc 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.520
 everyone here permanently 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.520
 right now it's a very small part 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.420
 the euro was slowing down what is happening 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.230
 the challenge 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.780
 his guardian 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.369
 then just after collecting the dispatch I go out my macbook pro 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.730
 the purity thing 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.900
 if we see that they can for example 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.610
 the tactical cell that will come out 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.200
 but it's the only thing right now 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.990
 shock 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.990
 things are fine 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.009
 here is the next time another time left the choice the saddlebags 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.640
 besides the difficulty I live with my friends 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.149
 it's the theme 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:14.029
 if you launch 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:18.059
 others chose things too soon it's a red card around the earth 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.580
 holy 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.439
 in this text 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.619
 his legacy 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:25.049
 for these three pilots so you really have to start the west of the show 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.059
 we wait for you in time the hospital to do it 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.049
 so that's all it's really a matter of timing you have to train 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.779
 his prayer 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:37.479
 passing the trail used as an anti-dollar these techniques and blue 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.839
 provence was the first time in Montreal and I think that at the level of 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:41.879
 their daily 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.400
 I invite you to believe them on the current tumult 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:49.949
 what is it like it's like it's not against a little girl 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:51.029
 comedians who run away 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.359
 on the other hand a possible 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.319
 is that when we say that when I work on four recruits pc is a 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.089
 little bit lower so that 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:03.989
 and mexico they must continue today affected 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.709
 - more difficulties 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.269
 we must also get up 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.969
 alas how did you conclude 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:12.259
 and makes you crack 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:16.009
 you have the traffic density charges meantime I did not want one 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:17.929
 can also say that diet 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:19.279
 Why 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:22.959
 eight stables of Mont Sainte-Anne while he works shopping 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.189
 and the president 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:27.539
 some dates it will hurt 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:28.859
 convenient 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.459
 except simon king crab loaded in the opposite camp could not be clearer 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:38.759
 as I calm down favorite dish 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:40.679
 dated 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.679
 by dint of the toy library even his fund that she is all aware that 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:46.109
 schalke 04 always a low position 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.649
 to change course from a low position because you also have to 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:52.689
 that we stopped we have the place of europe 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.869
 and history 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:58.709
 39 this advance 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.209
 why it's interesting because when you're in a low position 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.189
 any 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.150
 other title is the case of the fact that the purpose of this displacement always 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.419
 complicated 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.859
 and as brakes in a ticketing site 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.489
 you have one in fact it goes very fast 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.579
 which means 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.779
 as you are pc reach the maximum 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.749
 the stable of immediately 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:23.749
 the movement continues to the eighth head of a victim 

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:27.059
 is he forgetting that planned activity 

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:31.459
 n you say I'm very good smuggler the mclaren they were 33 me 

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:32.090
 suited 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.680
 otherwise it would not be too much to call the ultimate start 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.830
 in the emergency finally 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.830
 quarter but with a little more than m 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.340
 in the little scoundrels who never shop 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.050
 finally last thing that comparable out of the contract site 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.249
 what do you think of the title that does its job 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:54.529
 focus attack of France 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.549
 it's a cata 15:30 announcement that what you can do talk 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:04:59.779
 First line 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:01.680
 we have registered 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.789
 between two calls of different speeds 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.520
 for example every meter 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.009
 i will try to advance to an ant work following focus attack 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:13.319
 as he says what he wants 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:16.409
 source ap this frame to do too much 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.409
 mechanically by his father richert 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:23.550
 I confessed to celebrate advanced on 10 shots including 5 wins that tackle 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.200
 often can also try to play 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.279
 the poll 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:30.279
 yes especially possibility to jump by year 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.539
 shankar 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.599
 free entry advance with focus attack 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.050
 or because they make 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.749
 last thing to all chatham-kent more unpublished 

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:45.520
 used to specify the date because I make this exchange will be easy 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.520
 with the regions but that these were not perfect unknown 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.490
 I am not a specialist of double 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.080
 I think particularly talented angle detection it may seem 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.190
 provocative in mexico no matter how important it is there 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.869
 the important thing is that everyone believes that the Cree world 

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:04.779
 chatel the lawyer in songs 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:06.529
 that time 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:10.589
 what it takes is these people this is his focus attack before the media my 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:12.789
 media treatment that has a good opportunity 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:13.699
 not only 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:16.769
 the media attraction focus to your keyboards according to this document 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:21.539
 it's a classic combo with summed up this exotic farmhouse and then it's a 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.580
 not very calm all the time 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.119
 why coach-player 

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:27.279
 here is forced a lot to do 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:28.960
 There it is, thanks 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.029
 we enter the goal 

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:33.669
 3 sven bender 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:37.020
 I hope it happened to you 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.259
 range of offensive opportunities interviews for you were wrong these 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:41.039
 people came out 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:42.659
 Paris Defense 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:45.819
 so of course all of this shows that this ethnicity their sixth title 

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:50.599
 for proof his attitude particularly unhelpful air 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:51.379
 la France 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.719
 for example I do not know anymore the big dry transfer 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:56.719
 to fight against this scourge 

00:06:56.719 --> 00:07:00.439
 and I invite you to look at all the photos that the public has done before 

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:03.300
 the executive wants to continue to get by 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.379
 following this case
