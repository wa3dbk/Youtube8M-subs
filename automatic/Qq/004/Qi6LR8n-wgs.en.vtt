particular segment we're going to talk

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.840 
particular segment we're going to talk
about<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.059> ductless<00:00:15.719> split<00:00:16.289> system<00:00:16.980> there's<00:00:17.760> a

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
about a ductless split system there's a

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.310 
about a ductless split system there's a
couple<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.270> important<00:00:18.779> things<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.289> need

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
couple of important things that you need

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.290 
couple of important things that you need
to<00:00:19.560> know<00:00:19.710> about<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.279> ductless<00:00:20.640> split<00:00:20.760> system

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
to know about the ductless split system

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.480 
to know about the ductless split system
there<00:00:21.900> are<00:00:21.930> three<00:00:22.050> components<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:23.460> first

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
there are three components the first

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.150 
there are three components the first
component<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.510> an<00:00:24.689> evaporator<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.740> actually

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
component is an evaporator that actually

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.970 
component is an evaporator that actually
hangs<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.789> your<00:00:27.240> wine<00:00:27.599> cellar<00:00:27.990> wall<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.710> does

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
hangs on your wine cellar wall it does

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.370 
hangs on your wine cellar wall it does
not<00:00:29.189> go<00:00:29.519> through<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.880> wall<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.510> hangs<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.289> the

that you might have it's perhaps a

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.270 
that you might have it's perhaps a
little<00:00:59.699> bit<00:00:59.910> smaller<00:01:00.300> if<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.559> choose<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.100> have

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
little bit smaller if you choose to have

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.119 
little bit smaller if you choose to have
it<00:01:02.309> inside<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.899> want<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.199> probably<00:01:04.409> put<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:04.979> in

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
it inside you want to probably put it in

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.340 
it inside you want to probably put it in
a<00:01:05.220> storage<00:01:05.700> area<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> most<00:01:06.840> important

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
a storage area but the most important

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.170 
a storage area but the most important
thing<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.680> remember<00:01:08.040> about<00:01:08.400> putting<00:01:09.060> that

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
thing to remember about putting that

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.200 
thing to remember about putting that
condenser<00:01:09.930> indoor<00:01:10.619> condenser<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.850> storage

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
condenser indoor condenser in a storage

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.719 
condenser indoor condenser in a storage
area<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.470> space<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.310> vents

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
area is that the space that it vents

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.289 
area is that the space that it vents
into<00:01:15.000> needs<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.229> twice<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.159> size<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.729> your

into needs to be twice the size of your
cellar<00:01:18.630> inside<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:20.009> how<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.189> calculate<00:01:20.520> that

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
cellar inside so how to calculate that

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.630 
cellar inside so how to calculate that
you<00:01:21.330> calculate<00:01:22.049> your<00:01:22.320> feet<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.920> multiply<00:01:23.580> the

you calculate your feet you multiply the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.399 
you calculate your feet you multiply the
feet<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.270> length<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> width<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.350> your

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.969 
feet the length and the width of your
room<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.400> multiply<00:01:27.360> by<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.350> room<00:01:28.590> where

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
room and multiply by that the room where

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.609 
room and multiply by that the room where
your<00:01:29.130> condenser<00:01:29.729> will<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.119> if<00:01:30.420> that's<00:01:30.990> double

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
your condenser will be if that's double
