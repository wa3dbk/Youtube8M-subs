00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
responsive systems on sometimes you have

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.610 
responsive systems on sometimes you have
to<00:06:31.639> double<00:06:32.639> click<00:06:32.820> it<00:06:33.180> and<00:06:33.210> keep<00:06:33.840> clicking<00:06:34.470> it

which<00:06:34.970> um<00:06:36.800> I've<00:06:37.800> how<00:06:38.039> to<00:06:38.099> write<00:06:38.400> this<00:06:38.550> camera

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
which um I've how to write this camera

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.050 
which um I've how to write this camera
it<00:06:39.330> would<00:06:39.450> probably<00:06:39.720> be<00:06:39.990> a<00:06:40.020> rating<00:06:40.470> of

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060 
it would probably be a rating of

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:46.950 
it would probably be a rating of
five<00:06:41.389> which<00:06:41.900> is<00:06:42.080> very<00:06:42.350> low<00:06:42.620> out<00:06:43.190> of<00:06:43.370> 10<00:06:44.710> I

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
five which is very low out of 10 I

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.000 
five which is very low out of 10 I
thought<00:06:47.960> this<00:06:48.139> camera<00:06:48.530> was<00:06:48.680> going<00:06:48.830> to<00:06:48.889> be

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.010 
thought this camera was going to be

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.700 
thought this camera was going to be
really<00:06:49.340> good<00:06:49.370> camera<00:06:49.970> the<00:06:50.720> touch<00:06:50.960> screen<00:06:51.320> on

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
really good camera the touch screen on

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.379 
really good camera the touch screen on
it's<00:06:52.010> really<00:06:52.190> good<00:06:52.550> but<00:06:53.080> um<00:06:54.730> just<00:06:55.730> the<00:06:56.150> battery

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:56.389 
it's really good but um just the battery

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:00.670 
it's really good but um just the battery
and<00:06:57.080> the<00:06:57.710> battery<00:06:58.310> life<00:06:59.090> the<00:06:59.690> features<00:07:00.200> of<00:07:00.230> it

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 
and the battery life the features of it

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.909 
and the battery life the features of it
some<00:07:01.070> features<00:07:01.460> are<00:07:01.610> good<00:07:01.820> on<00:07:02.260> the<00:07:03.260> quality<00:07:03.710> is

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 
some features are good on the quality is

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:08.320 
some features are good on the quality is
very<00:07:04.040> good<00:07:04.370> but<00:07:04.820> on<00:07:05.230> the<00:07:06.230> actual<00:07:07.120> taking<00:07:08.120> the

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
very good but on the actual taking the

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.680 
very good but on the actual taking the
picture<00:07:08.780> on<00:07:09.050> the<00:07:09.470> the<00:07:10.220> flash<00:07:10.580> and<00:07:11.030> the<00:07:11.120> camera

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:11.690 
picture on the the flash and the camera

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.710 
picture on the the flash and the camera
it's<00:07:12.590> hard<00:07:12.889> to<00:07:12.980> coordinate<00:07:13.580> all<00:07:13.820> of<00:07:13.850> it<00:07:14.240> to<00:07:14.570> get

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 
it's hard to coordinate all of it to get

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.129 
it's hard to coordinate all of it to get
it<00:07:14.870> to<00:07:14.900> work<00:07:15.139> so<00:07:15.940> sometimes<00:07:16.940> the<00:07:17.600> second<00:07:17.960> a

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:18.139 
it to work so sometimes the second a

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:20.290 
it to work so sometimes the second a
good<00:07:18.500> picture<00:07:18.889> you<00:07:19.070> have<00:07:19.280> to<00:07:19.490> turn<00:07:19.760> the<00:07:20.030> flash

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.300
