00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
PC because at console events you can't

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.590 
PC because at console events you can't
connect<00:01:35.159> your<00:01:35.400> headset<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> console

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
because it has input for only one

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.999 
because it has input for only one
headset<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.509> wouldn't<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:39.990> fair<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
headset so it wouldn't be fair to the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.280 
headset so it wouldn't be fair to the
other<00:01:41.130> player<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.729> case<00:01:42.090> he<00:01:42.509> wants<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.049> do<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
can't say which one is better because

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.100 
can't say which one is better because
it's<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.770> matter<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.280> preference<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.390> personally

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
it's a matter of preference I personally

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.520 
it's a matter of preference I personally
use<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.829> hybrid<00:02:02.579> between<00:02:02.810> these<00:02:03.810> two<00:02:04.229> leagues

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
use a hybrid between these two leagues

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.190 
use a hybrid between these two leagues
and<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:05.219> attack<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:06.000> levendusky<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.899> at

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and in attack I have levendusky and at

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.820 
and in attack I have levendusky and at
all<00:02:07.459> do<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.489> use<00:02:08.670> semi<00:02:09.300> or<00:02:09.569> assisted<00:02:10.349> crossing

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
all do you use semi or assisted crossing

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.309 
all do you use semi or assisted crossing
I<00:02:10.979> used<00:02:11.520> semi<00:02:12.060> at<00:02:12.180> crossing<00:02:12.510> because<00:02:12.750> if<00:02:12.989> you

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
I used semi at crossing because if you

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.640 
I used semi at crossing because if you
would

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
would

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.440

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
this it's not every day that a player at

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.860 
this it's not every day that a player at
your<00:03:22.169> level<00:03:22.470> does<00:03:22.799> a<00:03:22.829> Q&amp;A<00:03:23.340> video<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.720> is

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870
