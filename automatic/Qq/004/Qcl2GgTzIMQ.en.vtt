unflavored<00:02:08.220> gelatin<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.910> will<00:02:09.060> help<00:02:09.239> with

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
unflavored gelatin this will help with

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.190 
unflavored gelatin this will help with
the<00:02:09.509> consistency<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.979> meatballs

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
the consistency of the meatballs

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.790 
the consistency of the meatballs

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
and you need six tablespoons of wheat

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:25.660 
and you need six tablespoons of wheat
germ<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:18.090> here<00:02:18.360> we<00:02:18.420> go<00:02:18.569> one<00:02:20.180> two<00:02:22.129> three<00:02:24.140> four

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
germ so here we go one two three four

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.630 
germ so here we go one two three four
five<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.209> six<00:02:27.709> we<00:02:28.709> also<00:02:28.920> need<00:02:29.280> two

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
five and six we also need two

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.380 
five and six we also need two
tablespoons<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.480> vegetable<00:02:31.410> oil<00:02:35.390> sometimes

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
tablespoons of vegetable oil sometimes

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.660 
tablespoons of vegetable oil sometimes
these<00:02:36.720> things<00:02:36.780> happen<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.380> kitchen<00:02:37.470> and

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.670 

you<00:02:44.670> also<00:02:44.910> need<00:02:45.269> two<00:02:45.750> tablespoons<00:02:46.260> of

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
you also need two tablespoons of

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.880 
you also need two tablespoons of
molasses<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.510> always<00:02:48.510> recommend<00:02:48.680> use<00:02:49.680> your

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
molasses I always recommend use your

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.860 
molasses I always recommend use your
same<00:02:50.099> spoon<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.760> you've<00:02:50.910> used<00:02:51.239> your<00:02:51.480> oil

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
same spoon that you've used your oil

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.949 
same spoon that you've used your oil
because<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.799> molasses<00:02:53.310> will<00:02:53.489> slide<00:02:54.150> off<00:02:54.480> a

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
because the molasses will slide off a

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.789 
because the molasses will slide off a
lot<00:02:55.470> easier<00:02:56.630> than<00:02:57.630> if<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.079> don't<00:02:58.319> do<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.590> that

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
lot easier than if you don't do it that

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.920 
lot easier than if you don't do it that
way<00:03:00.739> all<00:03:01.739> right<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:03.420> we've<00:03:03.569> got<00:03:03.599> our

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
way all right so we've got our

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.699 
way all right so we've got our
ingredients<00:03:04.110> in<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:06.150> lot<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.019> people<00:03:07.410> use

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
ingredients in and a lot of people use

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.830 
ingredients in and a lot of people use
latex<00:03:08.489> gloves<00:03:08.819> because<00:03:09.150> they<00:03:09.420> don't<00:03:09.569> like<00:03:09.690> the

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
latex gloves because they don't like the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.050 
latex gloves because they don't like the
idea<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.290> getting<00:03:10.500> meat<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:11.130> everything<00:03:11.970> on

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
idea of getting meat and everything on

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.000 
idea of getting meat and everything on
their<00:03:12.180> hands<00:03:12.540> but<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.930> just<00:03:13.200> dive<00:03:13.440> in<00:03:13.590> this<00:03:13.829> is

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
their hands but I just dive in this is

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.670 
their hands but I just dive in this is
how<00:03:14.099> I<00:03:14.130> do<00:03:14.280> meatballs<00:03:15.239> for<00:03:15.420> my<00:03:15.540> family<00:03:15.959> and

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
how I do meatballs for my family and

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.020 
how I do meatballs for my family and
this<00:03:16.769> is<00:03:16.920> how<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.069> do<00:03:17.160> meatballs<00:03:17.579> for<00:03:17.730> my<00:03:17.850> dogs

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
this is how I do meatballs for my dogs

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.870 
this is how I do meatballs for my dogs
or<00:03:18.769> set<00:03:19.769> involved<00:03:20.190> in<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.400> case

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
or set involved in this case

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.670 
or set involved in this case
so<00:03:21.810> satin<00:03:22.410> balls<00:03:22.590> are<00:03:22.889> fed<00:03:23.220> raw<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:25.200> idea<00:03:25.500> is

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
so satin balls are fed raw the idea is

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.789 
so satin balls are fed raw the idea is
to<00:03:25.859> get<00:03:25.980> as<00:03:26.130> many<00:03:26.569> nutrients<00:03:27.569> from<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.590> raw

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
to get as many nutrients from the raw

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.009 
to get as many nutrients from the raw
ingredients<00:03:29.579> as<00:03:29.730> possible

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
ingredients as possible

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.690 
ingredients as possible
a<00:03:31.049> lot<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.010> people<00:03:32.489> serve<00:03:32.730> these<00:03:33.060> frozen<00:03:33.510> and

a lot of people serve these frozen and

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.979 
a lot of people serve these frozen and

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
others serve it and serve them thought

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.250 
others serve it and serve them thought
either<00:03:37.440> way<00:03:37.560> is<00:03:37.680> fine<00:03:38.150> so<00:03:39.150> once<00:03:39.389> your<00:03:39.690> satin
