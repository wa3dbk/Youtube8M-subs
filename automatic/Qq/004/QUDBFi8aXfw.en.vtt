so three things that I think Wordsworth

poet<00:00:42.390> who<00:00:42.899> goes<00:00:43.140> out<00:00:43.379> into<00:00:43.559> nature<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.340> he

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
poet who goes out into nature and he

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.400 
poet who goes out into nature and he
sees<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> bunch<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.059> beautiful<00:00:45.360> daffodils<00:00:46.050> and

sees a bunch of beautiful daffodils and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.049 
sees a bunch of beautiful daffodils and
they<00:00:47.190> make<00:00:47.340> him<00:00:47.520> happy

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
they make him happy

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.750

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
free and then the third thing which I

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.120

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
so these are going to be my three main

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.880 
so these are going to be my three main
lines<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.500> argument<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.159> my<00:01:20.310> essay<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.890> I'm

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
lines of argument in my essay and I'm

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.039 
lines of argument in my essay and I'm
just<00:01:23.009> going<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.220> go<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.670> poem<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.270> read<00:01:24.930> it

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
just going to go to the poem and read it

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.410 
just going to go to the poem and read it
again<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.650> think<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.310> myself<00:01:26.430> well<00:01:26.970> what

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
again and think to myself well what

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.350 
again and think to myself well what
poetic<00:01:27.900> techniques<00:01:28.320> did<00:01:28.560> Wordsworth<00:01:29.070> use<00:01:29.430> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
poetic techniques did Wordsworth use to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.830 
poetic techniques did Wordsworth use to
make<00:01:30.509> me<00:01:30.689> think<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:32.659> nature<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.810> beautiful

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
make me think that nature is beautiful

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.890 
make me think that nature is beautiful
all<00:01:36.840> right<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:38.299> was<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.329> looking<00:01:39.570> at<00:01:39.840> a

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
all right so I was just looking at a

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.960 
all right so I was just looking at a
couple<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.259> lines<00:01:40.530> then<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.250> I've<00:01:41.670> decided

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
couple of lines then and I've decided

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.649 
couple of lines then and I've decided
that<00:01:42.150> he<00:01:42.450> uses<00:01:42.979> personification<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.520> he<00:01:45.420> makes

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that he uses personification so he makes

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.889 
that he uses personification so he makes
the<00:01:45.990> daffodils<00:01:46.829> seem<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.310> humans<00:01:47.899> because

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
the daffodils seem like humans because

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.270 
the daffodils seem like humans because
they're<00:01:49.049> dancing<00:01:49.439> around<00:01:51.979> so<00:01:52.979> I've<00:01:53.130> written

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
they're dancing around so I've written

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.100 
they're dancing around so I've written
personification<00:01:54.119> because<00:01:54.299> that's<00:01:54.479> my<00:01:54.659> poetic

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
personification because that's my poetic

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.200 
personification because that's my poetic
technique<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.890> then<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.130> put<00:01:56.399> my<00:01:56.430> example

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
technique and then I put my example

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.209 
technique and then I put my example
underneath<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> example<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.040> always

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
underneath it and the example is always

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.690 
underneath it and the example is always
a<00:01:59.340> quote<00:01:59.670> from<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.360> text<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.009> second<00:02:02.490> idea

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
a quote from the text so the second idea

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.330 
a quote from the text so the second idea
is<00:02:03.320> that<00:02:04.320> nature<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.310> free<00:02:06.350> so<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.770> think<00:02:07.890> that

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
is that nature is free so I think that

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.420 
is that nature is free so I think that
he<00:02:08.670> uses

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
he uses

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
he uses
hyperbole<00:02:11.430> which<00:02:11.880> is<00:02:12.030> an<00:02:12.150> exaggeration<00:02:14.450> and

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
hyperbole which is an exaggeration and

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.810 
hyperbole which is an exaggeration and
it's<00:02:15.870> evident<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.350> these<00:02:16.530> lines<00:02:16.830> here<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.550> the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
it's evident in these lines here in the

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.610 
it's evident in these lines here in the
poem<00:02:20.090> he<00:02:21.090> sort<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.330> exaggerated<00:02:21.990> how<00:02:22.350> many

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
poem he sort of exaggerated how many

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.090 
poem he sort of exaggerated how many
daffodils<00:02:23.340> there<00:02:23.640> are<00:02:27.710> okay<00:02:28.710> so<00:02:28.740> it's<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
daffodils there are okay so it's the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.200 
daffodils there are okay so it's the
same<00:02:29.190> process

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
same process

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.920 
same process
I<00:02:30.240> put<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.930> poetic<00:02:31.710> technique<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.250> he<00:02:32.310> uses

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
I put the poetic technique that he uses

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.450 
I put the poetic technique that he uses
hyperbole<00:02:33.960> and<00:02:34.140> then<00:02:34.530> under<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:34.800> I'm<00:02:35.130> going

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
hyperbole and then under that I'm going

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.690 
hyperbole and then under that I'm going
to<00:02:35.550> put<00:02:35.730> my<00:02:36.560> example<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:38.460> here<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:38.640> am

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
to put my example so here I am

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.110 
to put my example so here I am
supporting<00:02:39.240> my<00:02:39.330> ideas<00:02:39.750> with<00:02:40.580> evidence<00:02:41.580> from

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
supporting my ideas with evidence from

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.240 
supporting my ideas with evidence from
the<00:02:42.270> poem<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:44.130> final<00:02:44.520> idea<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
the poem the final idea is that the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.330 
the poem the final idea is that the
nature<00:02:47.940> makes<00:02:48.240> people<00:02:48.540> feel<00:02:48.690> happy<00:02:49.340> and

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
nature makes people feel happy and

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.890 
nature makes people feel happy and
that's<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:50.730> really<00:02:50.880> obvious<00:02:51.120> at<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.570> end<00:02:51.720> here

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
that's a really obvious at the end here

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.260 
that's a really obvious at the end here
when<00:02:52.140> he<00:02:52.230> says<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:53.700> then<00:02:53.970> my<00:02:54.120> heart<00:02:56.270> with

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
when he says and then my heart with

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.480 
when he says and then my heart with
pleasure<00:02:57.870> something<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.950> can't<00:02:59.160> see<00:02:59.220> at<00:02:59.400> the

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
pleasure something I can't see at the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.180 
pleasure something I can't see at the
screen<00:02:59.610> those<00:03:00.030> ball<00:03:02.270> okay<00:03:03.300> so<00:03:03.510> essentially

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
screen those ball okay so essentially

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.790 
screen those ball okay so essentially
he's<00:03:05.190> creating<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.240> metaphor<00:03:06.660> for<00:03:07.410> his<00:03:07.560> heart

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
he's creating a metaphor for his heart

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.340 
he's creating a metaphor for his heart
and<00:03:08.070> then<00:03:08.190> that's<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.640> quote<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:10.080> now<00:03:10.290> you

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
and then that's the quote and so now you

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.480 
and then that's the quote and so now you
can<00:03:10.680> see<00:03:10.920> we're<00:03:11.550> done<00:03:11.780> this<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:13.020> he's<00:03:13.740> three

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
can see we're done this is he's three

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.900 
can see we're done this is he's three
points<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.060> supporting<00:03:15.810> evidence
