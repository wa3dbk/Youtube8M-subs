a three by three sand or gravel hidden
sorry<00:00:56.190> sand<00:00:56.969> or<00:00:57.120> gravel<00:00:57.270> door<00:00:59.180> um<00:01:00.710> judging

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
sorry sand or gravel door um judging

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.310 
sorry sand or gravel door um judging
from<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.390> message<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.719> received<00:01:04.170> from

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
from the message that we received from

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.830 
from the message that we received from
the<00:01:04.739> user<00:01:04.979> who<00:01:05.250> requested<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.970> it's

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
the user who requested this it's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.460 
the user who requested this it's
probably<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.950> lot<00:01:08.430> smaller<00:01:08.820> than<00:01:09.299> what<00:01:10.290> he<00:01:10.439> was

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
probably a lot smaller than what he was

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.340 
probably a lot smaller than what he was
using<00:01:10.799> before<00:01:11.070> he<00:01:11.549> did<00:01:11.909> say<00:01:12.180> he<00:01:12.840> required

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
using before he did say he required

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.140 
using before he did say he required
eight<00:01:13.619> or<00:01:13.770> nine<00:01:13.950> blocks<00:01:14.369> between<00:01:14.760> each<00:01:15.360> door

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
eight or nine blocks between each door

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.850 
eight or nine blocks between each door
so<00:01:18.530> we<00:01:19.530> decided<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.220> make<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> compact<00:01:21.680> three<00:01:22.680> by

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
so we decided to make a compact three by

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.010 
so we decided to make a compact three by
three<00:01:23.900> sand<00:01:24.900> or<00:01:25.080> gravel<00:01:25.229> door<00:01:26.630> let's<00:01:27.630> get<00:01:27.900> on

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
three sand or gravel door let's get on

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.360 
three sand or gravel door let's get on
with<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.290> tutorial

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:38.060 

right<00:01:32.370> here<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:36.290> you're<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.620> start<00:01:37.920> off

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
right here so you're going to start off

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.230 
right here so you're going to start off
with<00:01:38.990> six<00:01:39.990> sticky<00:01:40.320> pistons<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.830> that<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.400> on

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
with six sticky pistons like that and on

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.240 
with six sticky pistons like that and on
top<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.510> that<00:01:42.770> do<00:01:43.770> three<00:01:44.190> regular<00:01:44.580> pistons<00:01:45.080> on

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
top of that do three regular pistons on

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.950 
top of that do three regular pistons on
this<00:01:47.250> side<00:01:47.460> or<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.150> other<00:01:48.180> side<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.690> doesn't

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
this side or the other side it doesn't

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.500 
this side or the other side it doesn't
really<00:01:49.050> matter<00:01:49.260> place<00:01:50.040> blocks<00:01:50.360> adjacent<00:01:51.360> to

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
really matter place blocks adjacent to

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.050 
really matter place blocks adjacent to
the<00:01:51.660> bottom<00:01:51.960> Pistons<00:01:52.290> here<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:53.369> redstone<00:01:53.760> on

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the bottom Pistons here with redstone on

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.450 
the bottom Pistons here with redstone on
top<00:01:54.300> and<00:01:55.790> then<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:56.910> top<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.330> redstone<00:01:58.460> do

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
top and then on top of this redstone do

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.630 
top and then on top of this redstone do
something<00:01:59.850> like<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.350> or<00:02:01.350> do<00:02:02.070> exactly<00:02:02.430> that

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
something like that or do exactly that

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.010 
something like that or do exactly that
otherwise<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.810> wouldn't<00:02:04.020> work<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.880> then<00:02:06.020> once

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
otherwise it wouldn't work and then once

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.300 
otherwise it wouldn't work and then once
more<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:10.110> until<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.619> have<00:02:10.739> something<00:02:10.770> like

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
more so until you have something like

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.030 
more so until you have something like
that<00:02:11.550> on<00:02:12.200> this<00:02:13.200> side<00:02:13.410> you're<00:02:13.590> going<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:13.800> start

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
that on this side you're going to start

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.720 
that on this side you're going to start
on<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.280> second<00:02:14.670> row<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:16.260> do<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.250> same<00:02:17.430> thing

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
on the second row and do the same thing

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.290 
on the second row and do the same thing
and<00:02:19.459> you're<00:02:20.459> going<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.670> have<00:02:20.820> something<00:02:21.150> that

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
and you're going to have something that

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.520 
and you're going to have something that
looks<00:02:21.330> like<00:02:21.570> that<00:02:22.430> now<00:02:23.750> let's<00:02:24.750> start<00:02:25.140> with<00:02:25.320> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
looks like that now let's start with the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.570 
looks like that now let's start with the
opening<00:02:25.920> circuit<00:02:26.570> so<00:02:27.570> you're<00:02:27.810> going<00:02:27.930> to

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
opening circuit so you're going to

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.550 
opening circuit so you're going to
extend<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.790> one<00:02:30.030> out<00:02:30.209> by<00:02:30.390> one<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.870> put<00:02:31.530> a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
extend this one out by one and put a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.370 
extend this one out by one and put a
repeater<00:02:31.890> into<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:33.840> repeater<00:02:34.290> is

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
repeater into it and this repeater is

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.960 
repeater into it and this repeater is
going<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.769> be<00:02:34.860> powered<00:02:35.160> by<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.489> block<00:02:35.730> here

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
going to be powered by this block here

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.270 
going to be powered by this block here
this<00:02:36.660> box<00:02:36.870> can<00:02:37.080> have<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.380> torch<00:02:37.590> on<00:02:37.769> top<00:02:38.010> and

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
this box can have a torch on top and

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.300 
this box can have a torch on top and
torch<00:02:39.269> on<00:02:39.450> top<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.980> top<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.160> this

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.820 
torch is going to have a block with a
redstone<00:02:44.239> now<00:02:45.239> this<00:02:45.720> torture<00:02:46.350> is<00:02:46.440> going<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.739> be

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
redstone now this torture is going to be

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.890 
redstone now this torture is going to be
powering<00:02:47.160> this<00:02:47.340> repeater<00:02:47.700> we're<00:02:48.660> just<00:02:48.720> going

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
powering this repeater we're just going

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.690 
powering this repeater we're just going
to<00:02:49.019> be<00:02:49.080> powering<00:02:49.410> this<00:02:49.680> block<00:02:49.980> which<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.580> going

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
to be powering this block which is going

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.570 
to be powering this block which is going
to<00:02:50.760> be<00:02:50.820> powering<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.269> redstone<00:02:51.630> here<00:02:51.959> and

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
to be powering this redstone here and

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.940 
to be powering this redstone here and
finally<00:02:54.110> this<00:02:55.110> redstone<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:55.620> going<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.890> be

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
finally this redstone is going to be

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.860 
finally this redstone is going to be
powering<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.370> repeater<00:02:56.700> on<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:57.180> which<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.720> going

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
powering a repeater on to which is going

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.800 
powering a repeater on to which is going
to<00:02:57.930> lead<00:02:58.200> over<00:02:58.500> like<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.390> this<00:03:00.390> should

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
to lead over like that and this should

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.580 
to lead over like that and this should
open<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.560> entire<00:03:01.890> door<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:04.079> should<00:03:04.260> extend

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
open the entire door so it should extend

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.910 
open the entire door so it should extend
all<00:03:04.799> these<00:03:04.980> pissants<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.670> push<00:03:06.060> up<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.920> sand

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
all these pissants to push up the sand

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.130 
all these pissants to push up the sand
or<00:03:08.070> gravel<00:03:08.780> whatever<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.959> may<00:03:10.110> be<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:11.209> now<00:03:12.209> we

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
or gravel whatever it may be and now we

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.479 
or gravel whatever it may be and now we
need<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.410> have<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.130> closing<00:03:14.519> circuit<00:03:16.489> because

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
need to have the closing circuit because

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.220 
need to have the closing circuit because
obviously<00:03:17.930> all<00:03:18.930> these<00:03:19.470> Pistons<00:03:19.860> aren't<00:03:20.190> back

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
obviously all these Pistons aren't back

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.009 
obviously all these Pistons aren't back
so<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:22.769> redstone<00:03:23.220> here<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:23.880> going<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.810> power

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
so this redstone here is going to power

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.880 
so this redstone here is going to power
a<00:03:25.380> repeater<00:03:25.950> here<00:03:27.170> this<00:03:28.170> repeater<00:03:28.560> is<00:03:28.650> going

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
a repeater here this repeater is going

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.190 
a repeater here this repeater is going
to<00:03:28.950> be<00:03:29.070> on<00:03:29.160> two<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.810> in<00:03:30.810> front<00:03:31.019> of<00:03:31.110> this

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
to be on two and in front of this

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.289 
to be on two and in front of this
repeater<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.739> block<00:03:33.500> down<00:03:34.500> below<00:03:34.860> here<00:03:35.299> this

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
repeater is a block down below here this

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.250

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
repeater is going to be part of this

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.580 
repeater is going to be part of this
block<00:03:37.530> powering<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.400> redstone<00:03:38.790> here<00:03:39.120> and

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
block powering this redstone here and

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.410 
block powering this redstone here and
this<00:03:40.590> redstone<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.160> going<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:41.580> be<00:03:41.700> powering<00:03:42.150> a

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
this redstone is going to be powering a

this redstone is going to be powering a
repeater<00:03:43.099> right<00:03:44.099> here

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
repeater right here

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.899 
repeater right here
also<00:03:46.590> on<00:03:46.739> Two<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:46.999> a<00:03:47.999> block<00:03:48.239> like<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:49.909> that's

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
also on Two and a block like that that's

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.420 
also on Two and a block like that that's
most<00:03:51.180> of<00:03:51.329> your<00:03:51.480> closing<00:03:51.870> done<00:03:52.049> now<00:03:52.859> for<00:03:53.249> the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
most of your closing done now for the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.250 
most of your closing done now for the
final<00:03:53.760> part<00:03:54.090> which<00:03:54.629> is<00:03:54.659> getting<00:03:54.989> these

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
final part which is getting these

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.069 
final part which is getting these
Pistons<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.159> go<00:03:56.609> one<00:03:56.849> more<00:03:56.999> time<00:03:57.319> to<00:03:58.319> get<00:03:59.129> these

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
Pistons to go one more time to get these

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.839 
Pistons to go one more time to get these
Pistons<00:04:01.079> here<00:04:01.319> and<00:04:01.530> we're<00:04:02.340> going<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.519> do<00:04:02.670> that

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
Pistons here and we're going to do that

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.240 
Pistons here and we're going to do that
like<00:04:03.000> this<00:04:03.439> unfortunately<00:04:04.439> makes<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.859> entire

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
like this unfortunately makes the entire

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.000 
like this unfortunately makes the entire
thing<00:04:05.280> bigger<00:04:05.879> by<00:04:06.150> a<00:04:06.180> block<00:04:06.709> we<00:04:07.709> couldn't

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
thing bigger by a block we couldn't

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.240 
thing bigger by a block we couldn't
really<00:04:08.099> think<00:04:08.219> of<00:04:08.609> a<00:04:08.730> way<00:04:08.909> to<00:04:09.950> make<00:04:10.950> it<00:04:10.980> any

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
really think of a way to make it any

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.099 
really think of a way to make it any
smaller<00:04:11.689> but<00:04:13.069> here<00:04:14.069> we<00:04:14.159> go<00:04:14.870> so<00:04:15.870> you're<00:04:16.019> going

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
smaller but here we go so you're going

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.469 
smaller but here we go so you're going
to<00:04:16.169> have<00:04:16.229> three<00:04:16.650> Peters<00:04:17.070> like<00:04:17.250> that<00:04:17.489> now<00:04:18.120> for

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
to have three Peters like that now for

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.379 
to have three Peters like that now for
sorry<00:04:18.840> I<00:04:19.079> can't<00:04:19.530> count<00:04:19.789> these<00:04:20.789> back<00:04:21.060> one's<00:04:21.090> are

so let's just build up to meet that and

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.520 
so let's just build up to meet that and
let's<00:04:59.250> fill<00:04:59.520> in<00:04:59.639> the<00:04:59.849> sand<00:05:02.750> so<00:05:03.750> it's<00:05:03.990> extended

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
let's fill in the sand so it's extended

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.360 
let's fill in the sand so it's extended
