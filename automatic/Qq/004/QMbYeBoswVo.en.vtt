00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:25.550 
flatter surface for you to work with and
just<00:02:05.880> repeat<00:02:06.300> the<00:02:06.540> same<00:02:06.750> movements

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.740

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
once you have a solid line just go ahead

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.410 
once you have a solid line just go ahead
and<00:02:28.020> repeat<00:02:28.380> for<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.650> other<00:02:28.740> side<00:02:29.190> now<00:02:30.150> for<00:02:30.209> a

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
and repeat for the other side now for a

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.930 
and repeat for the other side now for a
more<00:02:30.600> dramatic<00:02:30.750> look<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.590> simple<00:02:32.340> way<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.610> do

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
more dramatic look a simple way to do

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.390 
more dramatic look a simple way to do
this<00:02:33.120> would<00:02:33.360> be<00:02:33.510> using<00:02:33.959> your<00:02:34.110> same<00:02:34.350> brush<00:02:34.650> pick

this would be using your same brush pick
up<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.640> little<00:02:35.790> bit<00:02:36.030> more<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.420> product

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
up a little bit more of the product

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.550 
up a little bit more of the product
wiping<00:02:38.730> off<00:02:38.880> any<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.300> excess<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.110> all

wiping off any of the excess and all

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.650 
wiping off any of the excess and all
we're<00:02:40.709> gonna<00:02:40.830> do<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.340> add<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.580> thicker<00:02:42.120> line<00:02:42.390> to

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
we're gonna do is add a thicker line to

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.699 
we're gonna do is add a thicker line to
the<00:02:42.750> outer<00:02:42.930> third<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.800> our<00:02:43.980> eye<00:02:48.470> then<00:02:49.470> just

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
the outer third of our eye then just

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.920 
the outer third of our eye then just
using<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.160> same<00:02:50.340> motions<00:02:50.880> just<00:02:51.360> thicken<00:02:51.780> up

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
using the same motions just thicken up

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:02.449 
using the same motions just thicken up
that<00:02:52.230> outer<00:02:52.530> corner<00:03:00.530> now<00:03:01.530> another<00:03:01.860> fun<00:03:02.190> trick

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
that outer corner now another fun trick

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.000 
that outer corner now another fun trick
would<00:03:02.760> be<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.940> slightly<00:03:03.930> angle<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.620> corner

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
would be to slightly angle the corner

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.130 
would be to slightly angle the corner
