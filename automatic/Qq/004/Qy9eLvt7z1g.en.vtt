 Speak of the gentleman who speaks justmann. 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.560
 I was going to vote as a towel to dry 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.570
 with difficulty installing the game 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.210
 we are still in the middle of the second step to 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.910
 good first step 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.240
 if you do not like rock if you continue 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:25.650
 abicair the cost gospel with the singer of 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:29.000
 and you will download the game on 27 and 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.000
 the songs aside 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.880
 after you've downloaded the game that goes 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.300
 install the game after putting the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.930
 songs in the game folder that put this 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.930
 it's for you 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.350
 which will install a test phase 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.510
 speaking there 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:47.000
 are the songs in ten parts of monster 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.000
 Chipettes installed here 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.709
 done that you will extract the songs 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.479
 that you downloaded to the good game with 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:05.009
 part of the song here is to change one 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:10.470
 example for you 6 open will open the 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:13.739
 music to control and kayak to 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.349
 extract to be extracted from the part of the 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:24.829
 game is in documents 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:24.829
 test for fix data sounds 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:37.230
 I have here had to put more is 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:41.430
 done that will be part of the game now 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.889
 look for you play brother collect the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.380
 you can create a shortcut 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:55.180
 huh 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:59.209
 copy desktop desktop shortcut paste 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.819
 then you will open here has several 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:06.200
 game options 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:11.420
 gameplay in my case i use asjk 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:19.430
 fixed mark can not stand 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:30.100
 you always run the game open the 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:32.989
 fear opened 16 cases maybe will not 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:54.830
 again the date marked to play 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:59.090
 so look at the box you have options 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:06.140
 control over a pm cost the eyes and 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:12.859
 leaves a mark some just tends to 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:15.560
 back this step if you are starting 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:19.190
 You can play music on time for 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:22.970
 fail even moretaw advanced case you 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:30.700
 you can see one choose this option 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:33.260
 and then you choose your additional music 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.500
 maybe it's going to be a bit light because the 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.440
 open other things open program 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.050
 Weigh it a little, but you can have 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.300
 A notion of how the game is 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.870
 this version is challenged both xp and 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.870
 17 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:05:12.130
 now there is a fault that the worst 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:06:15.540
 the coin is good, that's it, people's expression 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.730

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.370
