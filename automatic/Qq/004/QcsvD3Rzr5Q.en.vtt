00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
the boats that go along and again it

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.680 
the boats that go along and again it
almost<00:02:46.880> looks<00:02:47.180> like<00:02:47.240> a<00:02:47.330> road<00:02:47.630> path<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:49.690> more

almost looks like a road path and more

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.320 
almost looks like a road path and more
bridges<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:53.860> in<00:02:54.860> places<00:02:55.310> where<00:02:55.520> people<00:02:55.820> have

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330

these huge places to store their boats
in<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.000> winter<00:02:59.300> and<00:03:00.080> sometimes<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.650> path

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
in the winter and sometimes the path

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.660 
in the winter and sometimes the path
crosses<00:03:01.340> over<00:03:02.650> tubes<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:04.040> sometimes<00:03:04.520> the

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
tassets half on and half off and there's

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.600 
tassets half on and half off and there's
a<00:03:08.900> view<00:03:09.170> looking<00:03:09.560> over<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:10.280> you<00:03:10.340> can<00:03:10.460> see

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.770 
that's not the Narrows but you can see
how<00:03:21.620> narrow<00:03:21.830> that<00:03:21.950> point<00:03:22.430> is<00:03:22.640> always<00:03:23.270> been

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
how narrow that point is always been

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.350 
how narrow that point is always been
there's<00:03:23.990> there's<00:03:24.410> a<00:03:24.500> thumb<00:03:25.160> at<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:26.120> Riviera

there's there's a thumb at the Riviera
and<00:03:26.690> this<00:03:26.870> was<00:03:27.080> a<00:03:27.110> very<00:03:27.500> very<00:03:27.710> cool<00:03:28.010> place

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
and this was a very very cool place

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.960 
and this was a very very cool place
again<00:03:30.440> it's<00:03:30.680> quite<00:03:31.010> an<00:03:31.160> experience<00:03:31.820> just

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
again it's quite an experience just

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.050 
again it's quite an experience just
walking<00:03:32.960> on<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.410> path<00:03:33.620> you've<00:03:34.550> got<00:03:34.820> to<00:03:34.970> get

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
walking on the path you've got to get

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.680 
walking on the path you've got to get
over<00:03:35.120> to<00:03:35.330> that<00:03:35.480> area<00:03:35.680> on<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:37.040> east<00:03:38.000> side<00:03:38.180> of

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
over to that area on the east side of

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.180 
over to that area on the east side of
Lake<00:03:39.080> Geneva<00:03:41.080> now<00:03:42.080> we're<00:03:42.230> getting<00:03:42.440> closer

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
Lake Geneva now we're getting closer

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.559 
Lake Geneva now we're getting closer
towards<00:03:43.730> big<00:03:43.940> choice

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.000 

which<00:03:48.170> is<00:03:48.439> Bigfoot<00:03:49.159> Beach<00:03:49.519> State<00:03:49.790> Park<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:51.890> of

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
which is Bigfoot Beach State Park and of

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.959 
which is Bigfoot Beach State Park and of
course<00:03:52.340> them<00:03:52.609> you<00:03:52.939> know<00:03:53.060> that<00:03:53.269> building<00:03:54.969> and

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:55.969 
course them you know that building and

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:59.679 
course them you know that building and
so<00:03:56.209> now<00:03:56.390> we<00:03:56.450> get<00:03:56.959> to<00:03:57.019> be<00:03:57.290> on<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:59.090> passive<00:03:59.540> road

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
so now we get to be on the passive road

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:01.720 
so now we get to be on the passive road
section<00:04:00.170> and<00:04:00.469> then<00:04:00.680> we're<00:04:00.890> back<00:04:00.980> on<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.579> other

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
section and then we're back on the other

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.179 
section and then we're back on the other
side<00:04:01.989> heading<00:04:02.989> out<00:04:03.260> of<00:04:03.319> Lake<00:04:04.220> Geneva<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:04.819> into
