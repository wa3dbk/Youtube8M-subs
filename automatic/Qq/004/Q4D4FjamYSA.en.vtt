 you know the value of time and appreciate 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.049
 the benefits that gives good

 steering wheel being sure of its reliability you 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.839
 don't know at what point fail 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.150
 in the working system of the car this 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.880
 the engine will never move again

 engine damage and oil leakage 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.370
 full-time protection is not always capable 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.700
 ensure his safety

 steel note that u 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.780
 steel protection should be no thickness 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.770
 less than two millimeters 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.449
 one and a half times hot rolled steel 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.439
 stronger than cold rolled steel 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.350
 analogue 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.549
 make sure the oaks have protection 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.590
 stiffeners 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.570
 if the thickness of the product is less than three 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.890
 millimeters this will increase 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.330
 structural strength aluminum protection 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.030
 provides higher strength 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.950
 better thermal conductivity such protection is not 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.320
 rust and serve your car

 many years laboratory tests 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.390
 confirm the strength of the best 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.140
 thermal conductivity when choosing protection for 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.780
 the car 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.740
 we can not forget about the safety of the defense

 slide off attachment points 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.080
 not obstructing the engine going down when 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.900
 frontal collision 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.330
 at first glance fasteners for all protections 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.110
 same but safer mounting 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.680
 which have a strength class of at least 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.560
 8,8 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.340
 note if the mount will be 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.770
 galvanized 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.730
 it will give them durability reliability and 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.460
 durability 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.860
 to any protection you gain 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.930
 instruction will be attached which 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.390
 should contain a detailed description 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.700
 installation scheme where places will be visible 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.580
 fixing a picture of your

 car before and after installing protection 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.230
 will be an additional advantage of protection

 matador passed tough tests in 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.980
 technical laboratory and on 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.840
 rough terrain motodor protection

 easy to install all mounts 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.360
