actually do good with it at the same

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.240 
actually do good with it at the same
time<00:00:27.689> or<00:00:28.109> as<00:00:28.230> it's<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.500> lot<00:00:28.619> more<00:00:28.800> difficult<00:00:29.220> to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
time or as it's a lot more difficult to

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.950 
time or as it's a lot more difficult to
could<00:00:29.609> do<00:00:29.910> good<00:00:30.090> with<00:00:30.210> them<00:00:30.330> Olympia<00:00:30.750> herd

duel<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.260> chest<00:00:31.529> ends<00:00:31.769> but<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.790> recommend<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.360> good

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
duel a chest ends but I recommend a good

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.950 
duel a chest ends but I recommend a good
class<00:00:33.899> setup<00:00:34.260> being<00:00:34.590> lightweight<00:00:35.719> steady<00:00:36.719> aim

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
class setup being lightweight steady aim

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.299 
class setup being lightweight steady aim
and<00:00:38.329> marathon<00:00:39.329> all<00:00:39.660> pro<00:00:40.020> would<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.590> best

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
and marathon all pro would be best

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.220 
and marathon all pro would be best
especially<00:00:42.090> steady<00:00:42.420> ampere<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
especially steady ampere that is the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.650 
especially steady ampere that is the
perk<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.590> recommend<00:00:43.980> most<00:00:44.129> because<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.510> can

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
perk I recommend most because you can

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.139 
perk I recommend most because you can
bring<00:00:45.809> your<00:00:45.960> gun<00:00:46.590> up<00:00:46.800> pretty<00:00:47.430> much<00:00:47.610> instantly

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
bring your gun up pretty much instantly

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.959 
bring your gun up pretty much instantly
in<00:00:48.899> about<00:00:49.170> half<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.379> time<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.789> can

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
in about half the time as you can

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.160 
in about half the time as you can
normally<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.809> go<00:00:51.930> from<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
normally so you can go from the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.610 
normally so you can go from the
sprinting<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> shooting<00:00:53.010> very<00:00:53.399> very<00:00:53.640> quickly

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
sprinting to shooting very very quickly

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.560 
sprinting to shooting very very quickly
it<00:00:55.620> pays<00:00:56.100> off<00:00:56.250> several<00:00:56.579> times<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:57.030> game<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
it pays off several times this game and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.810 
it pays off several times this game and
I<00:00:57.960> will<00:00:58.260> mention<00:00:58.649> those<00:00:58.920> circumstances<00:00:59.640> where

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
I will mention those circumstances where

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.939 
I will mention those circumstances where
it<00:00:59.879> does<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.930> that's<00:01:01.109> my<00:01:01.230> recommendation<00:01:01.469> for

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
it does so that's my recommendation for

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.830 
it does so that's my recommendation for
a<00:01:02.100> class<00:01:02.370> setup<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.239> maybe<00:01:03.359> even<00:01:03.629> switch

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
a class setup you can maybe even switch

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.479 
a class setup you can maybe even switch
light<00:01:04.110> weight<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> flak<00:01:04.710> jacket<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:05.309> you

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
light weight for a flak jacket if you

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.280 
light weight for a flak jacket if you
feel<00:01:06.360> like<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.600> want<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.810> capture<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.080> lot<00:01:07.200> of

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
feel like you want to capture a lot of

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.690 
feel like you want to capture a lot of
flags<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.799> feel<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.310> capture

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
flags but I feel like it can capture

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.060 
flags but I feel like it can capture
flags<00:01:09.180> find<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.479> light<00:01:09.720> weight<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> seem<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:11.040> to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
flags find a light weight I seem not to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.130 
flags find a light weight I seem not to
get<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.460> grenaded<00:01:11.880> too<00:01:12.030> often<00:01:12.360> especially<00:01:12.659> on

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
get to grenaded too often especially on

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.899 
get to grenaded too often especially on
a<00:01:13.170> summit<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:14.010> I'm<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> map<00:01:14.490> like<00:01:14.610> firing

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
a summit if I'm on a map like firing

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.179 
a summit if I'm on a map like firing
range<00:01:15.330> or<00:01:15.780> nuketown<00:01:16.530> grenades<00:01:16.860> they're<00:01:17.009> very

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
range or nuketown grenades they're very

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.969 
range or nuketown grenades they're very
prevalent<00:01:18.140> but<00:01:19.140> that's<00:01:19.320> we<00:01:19.409> recommend<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:19.890> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
prevalent but that's we recommend for a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.499 
prevalent but that's we recommend for a
class<00:01:20.220> at<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.909> definitely<00:01:21.270> go<00:01:21.330> with<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
class at up and I definitely go with the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.120 
class at up and I definitely go with the
silencer<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.259> spaz<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.830> because

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
silencer for the spaz just because

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.219 
silencer for the spaz just because
silencers<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.880> do<00:01:24.210> not<00:01:24.479> take<00:01:24.869> away<00:01:24.990> from<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
silencers I do not take away from the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.600 
silencers I do not take away from the
range<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.680> spaz<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.040> right<00:01:26.250> here<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.430> got

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
range of the spaz and right here I got

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.130 
range of the spaz and right here I got
all<00:01:26.729> confused<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.450> turn<00:01:27.630> fast<00:01:27.900> enough

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
all confused and can turn fast enough

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.600 
all confused and can turn fast enough
and<00:01:28.259> get<00:01:28.890> shot<00:01:29.100> them<00:01:29.220> back

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
and get shot them back

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.520 
and get shot them back
and<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.150> also<00:01:30.270> recommend<00:01:30.450> using<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:31.020> jammer<00:01:31.380> and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
and I also recommend using a jammer and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.160 
and I also recommend using a jammer and
low<00:01:31.860> killstreaks<00:01:32.600> low<00:01:33.600> killstreaks<00:01:34.049> will

low killstreaks low killstreaks will

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.440 
low killstreaks low killstreaks will
definitely<00:01:34.560> help<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.799> KD<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.210> about

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
definitely help the KD and this is about

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.170 
definitely help the KD and this is about
a<00:01:36.509> helping<00:01:37.229> Arkadia<00:01:37.619> with<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> shotgun<00:01:38.070> not<00:01:38.520> how

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
a helping Arkadia with a shotgun not how

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.260 
a helping Arkadia with a shotgun not how
you<00:01:39.240> get<00:01:39.450> aid<00:01:40.009> 9<00:01:41.009> kill<00:01:41.369> streak<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.820> then<00:01:42.119> how

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
you get aid 9 kill streak and then how

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.670 
you get aid 9 kill streak and then how
you<00:01:42.299> kill<00:01:42.720> people<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> chopper<00:01:43.470> gunner

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
you kill people with a chopper gunner

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.590 
you kill people with a chopper gunner
this<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.040> basically<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:44.520> gun<00:01:44.909> kills<00:01:45.210> and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
this is basically just gun kills and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.480 
this is basically just gun kills and

gunfights<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.960> is<00:02:21.080> another<00:02:21.620> big<00:02:22.190> thing<00:02:22.430> that

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
gunfights that is another big thing that

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.030 
gunfights that is another big thing that
I<00:02:22.670> recommend<00:02:22.880> not<00:02:23.270> doing<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.680> right<00:02:24.860> there<00:02:25.010> I

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
I recommend not doing and right there I

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.830 
I recommend not doing and right there I
jumped<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.520> guy<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:25.880> one<00:02:26.570> thing<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.780> do

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
jumped that guy and one thing I do

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.210 
jumped that guy and one thing I do
recommend<00:02:27.110> which<00:02:27.350> I'm<00:02:27.470> not<00:02:27.620> doing<00:02:27.890> this<00:02:28.010> game

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
recommend which I'm not doing this game

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.040 
recommend which I'm not doing this game
is<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.460> tread<00:02:28.910> Turner<00:02:29.120> sensitivity<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:29.870> little

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
is a tread Turner sensitivity a little

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.620 
is a tread Turner sensitivity a little
bit<00:02:30.170> up<00:02:30.520> when<00:02:31.520> you're<00:02:31.730> having<00:02:32.210> long<00:02:32.390> range

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
bit up when you're having long range

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.540 
bit up when you're having long range
gunfights<00:02:32.900> with<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.320> m16<00:02:33.860> Honore<00:02:34.280> it's

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
gunfights with the m16 Honore it's

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.590 
gunfights with the m16 Honore it's
probably<00:02:34.940> good<00:02:35.060> if<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:35.270> have<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.450> lower

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
probably good if you have a lower

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.390 
probably good if you have a lower
sensitivity<00:02:35.990> but<00:02:36.950> when<00:02:37.040> you're<00:02:37.160> using<00:02:37.280> a

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
sensitivity but when you're using a

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.370 
sensitivity but when you're using a
shotgun<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:38.150> higher<00:02:38.540> sensitivity<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:39.140> probably

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
shotgun a higher sensitivity is probably

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.140 
shotgun a higher sensitivity is probably
best<00:02:39.620> so<00:02:39.740> you<00:02:39.830> can<00:02:39.980> turn<00:02:40.430> around<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:41.030> then

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
best so you can turn around and then

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.190 
best so you can turn around and then
somebody<00:02:41.450> shooting<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.720> in<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.840> back<00:02:42.020> you

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
somebody shooting you in the back you

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.870 
somebody shooting you in the back you
can<00:02:42.320> instantly<00:02:42.830> turn<00:02:43.100> around<00:02:43.340> start<00:02:43.520> shooting

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
can instantly turn around start shooting

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.090 
can instantly turn around start shooting
them<00:02:43.970> back<00:02:44.440> that's<00:02:45.440> what<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:45.650> recommend<00:02:46.040> I

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
them back that's what I recommend I

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.980 
them back that's what I recommend I
haven't<00:02:46.400> started<00:02:46.610> doing<00:02:47.240> that<00:02:47.360> yet<00:02:47.660> but

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
haven't started doing that yet but

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.210 
haven't started doing that yet but
that's<00:02:48.140> just<00:02:48.290> something<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:48.800> popped<00:02:49.040> in<00:02:49.190> my

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
that's just something that popped in my

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.650 
that's just something that popped in my
head<00:02:49.340> like<00:02:49.700> hey<00:02:49.850> that<00:02:50.030> might<00:02:50.150> be<00:02:50.270> a<00:02:50.300> good<00:02:50.390> idea

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
head like hey that might be a good idea

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.960 
head like hey that might be a good idea
since<00:02:50.900> I've<00:02:51.260> died<00:02:52.130> twice<00:02:52.370> already<00:02:52.670> because<00:02:52.910> I

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
since I've died twice already because I

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.180 
since I've died twice already because I
can't<00:02:53.180> turn<00:02:53.300> fast<00:02:53.540> enough<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.740> right<00:02:55.010> here

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
can't turn fast enough and right here

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.770 
can't turn fast enough and right here

when he gets in range I pop out and

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.640 
when he gets in range I pop out and
shoot<00:03:00.350> him

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
shoot him

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.740

and<00:03:01.220> one<00:03:01.640> of<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.820> big<00:03:02.000> things<00:03:02.240> I<00:03:02.390> really

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
and one of the big things I really

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.020 
and one of the big things I really
recommend<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.350> do<00:03:03.650> not<00:03:03.800> worry<00:03:04.490> about<00:03:04.580> ammo

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
recommend is do not worry about ammo

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.240 
recommend is do not worry about ammo
conservation<00:03:05.360> oh<00:03:06.080> like<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.530> lot<00:03:06.740> of<00:03:06.770> times<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.190> do

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
conservation oh like a lot of times I do

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.610 
conservation oh like a lot of times I do
this<00:03:07.490> myself<00:03:07.640> I'm<00:03:08.120> like<00:03:08.150> oh<00:03:08.600> I<00:03:09.230> don't<00:03:09.410> want<00:03:09.500> to

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
this myself I'm like oh I don't want to

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.010 
this myself I'm like oh I don't want to
waste<00:03:09.770> too<00:03:09.920> many<00:03:10.070> shots<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.459> one<00:03:10.610> guy<00:03:10.930> but<00:03:11.930> it

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
waste too many shots of one guy but it

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.520 
waste too many shots of one guy but it
gets<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.350> point<00:03:12.530> where<00:03:14.020> wait<00:03:15.020> a<00:03:15.050> second<00:03:15.440> if

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
gets to the point where wait a second if

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.900 
gets to the point where wait a second if
you<00:03:15.590> don't<00:03:15.800> waste<00:03:15.980> this<00:03:16.190> many<00:03:16.370> shots<00:03:16.610> on<00:03:16.790> one

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
you don't waste this many shots on one

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.280 
you don't waste this many shots on one
guy<00:03:17.060> he's<00:03:17.330> gonna<00:03:17.510> end<00:03:17.630> up<00:03:17.720> killing<00:03:17.989> you<00:03:18.110> and

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
guy he's gonna end up killing you and

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.660 
guy he's gonna end up killing you and
how<00:03:18.470> there<00:03:18.739> goes<00:03:18.950> that<00:03:18.980> life<00:03:19.370> what's<00:03:19.580> the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
how there goes that life what's the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.210 
how there goes that life what's the
point<00:03:19.790> of<00:03:19.910> conserving<00:03:20.360> ammo<00:03:20.690> so<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:21.590> is<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:21.920> much

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
point of conserving ammo so it is a much

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.720 
point of conserving ammo so it is a much
much<00:03:22.640> much<00:03:22.880> much<00:03:23.150> better<00:03:23.750> idea<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.400> waste<00:03:25.400> all

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
much much much better idea to waste all

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.000 
much much much better idea to waste all
of<00:03:25.760> your<00:03:26.150> ammo<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:26.660> one<00:03:26.810> guy<00:03:26.989> than<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:27.530> have

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
of your ammo and one guy than to have

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.729 
of your ammo and one guy than to have
him<00:03:28.190> kill<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.870> that's<00:03:29.870> a<00:03:29.989> little<00:03:30.140> just<00:03:30.380> tip

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
him kill you that's a little just tip

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.020 
him kill you that's a little just tip
for<00:03:31.310> that<00:03:31.519> don't<00:03:32.480> it's<00:03:33.350> if<00:03:33.890> you<00:03:34.580> use<00:03:34.670> a<00:03:34.700> shotgun

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
for that don't it's if you use a shotgun

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.840 
for that don't it's if you use a shotgun
enough<00:03:35.390> you<00:03:35.600> can<00:03:35.750> definitely<00:03:36.459> kind<00:03:37.459> of<00:03:37.519> judge

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
enough you can definitely kind of judge

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.250 
enough you can definitely kind of judge
when<00:03:38.090> you're<00:03:38.209> gonna<00:03:38.300> get<00:03:38.450> a<00:03:38.510> one-hit<00:03:38.870> kill<00:03:39.080> or

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
when you're gonna get a one-hit kill or

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.490 
when you're gonna get a one-hit kill or
maybe<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.739> it<00:03:39.920> kill<00:03:40.600> but<00:03:41.600> I<00:03:41.690> recommend<00:03:41.959> just

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
maybe a to it kill but I recommend just

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.259 
maybe a to it kill but I recommend just
one<00:03:43.250> year<00:03:43.400> when<00:03:43.549> you're<00:03:43.670> beginning<00:03:43.790> just

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
one year when you're beginning just

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.870 
one year when you're beginning just
shoot<00:03:45.230> them<00:03:45.410> until<00:03:45.620> it<00:03:45.739> did<00:03:45.920> don't<00:03:46.519> shoot<00:03:46.730> them

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
shoot them until it did don't shoot them

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.610 
shoot them until it did don't shoot them
until<00:03:47.150> you<00:03:47.360> think<00:03:47.570> they're<00:03:47.750> gonna<00:03:47.900> die<00:03:48.140> once

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
until you think they're gonna die once

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.140 
until you think they're gonna die once
you<00:03:48.739> see<00:03:49.100> their<00:03:49.250> body<00:03:49.400> not<00:03:49.610> moving<00:03:49.970> anymore

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
you see their body not moving anymore

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.110 
you see their body not moving anymore
that's<00:03:50.840> a<00:03:50.959> good<00:03:51.080> time<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.260> stop<00:03:51.440> shooting<00:03:52.120> and

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
that's a good time to stop shooting and

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.520 
that's a good time to stop shooting and
I'm<00:03:53.239> also<00:03:53.420> using<00:03:53.510> dual<00:03:53.959> pythons<00:03:54.380> as

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
I'm also using dual pythons as

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.140 
I'm also using dual pythons as
secondaries<00:03:55.160> cuz<00:03:55.340> they're<00:03:55.489> very<00:03:55.670> helpful
