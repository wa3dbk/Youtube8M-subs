00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
you can change how you can change the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.189 
you can change how you can change the
look<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.130> by<00:00:17.310> going<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:18.199> terrain

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
look of it by going to terrain

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.980 
look of it by going to terrain
underneath<00:00:19.859> your<00:00:20.070> environment<00:00:20.580> tab<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.990> then

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
underneath your environment tab and then

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.660 
underneath your environment tab and then
going<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.350> detail<00:00:22.710> layers<00:00:22.890> view<00:00:23.279> distance

going to detail layers view distance
ratio<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.330> turning<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.350> up<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.519> will

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
ratio and turning it up and that will

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.980 
ratio and turning it up and that will
make<00:00:26.760> something<00:00:27.180> that'll<00:00:27.449> make<00:00:27.539> your<00:00:27.689> terrain

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
make something that'll make your terrain

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.959 
make something that'll make your terrain
look<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.590> lot<00:00:29.460> more<00:00:29.519> clear<00:00:30.029> at<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.449> distance<00:00:31.969> I'm

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
look a lot more clear at a distance I'm

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.790 
look a lot more clear at a distance I'm
just<00:00:33.210> gonna<00:00:33.329> leave<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.570> at<00:00:33.660> one<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.739> i

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
just gonna leave it at one for this so i

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.440 
just gonna leave it at one for this so i
can<00:00:34.829> get<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.370> torial<00:00:35.820> pretty<00:00:36.000> quick<00:00:36.210> and

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
can get this torial pretty quick and

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.860 
can get this torial pretty quick and
let's<00:00:39.450> see<00:00:40.760> let's<00:00:41.760> say<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.149> i<00:00:42.180> only<00:00:42.420> want<00:00:42.750> to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
let's see let's say that i only want to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.549 
let's see let's say that i only want to
put<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.920> texture<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:45.030> like<00:00:45.270> soil<00:00:46.020> texture

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
put this texture this like soil texture

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.290 
put this texture this like soil texture
on<00:00:46.829> steeper<00:00:47.700> cliffs<00:00:48.000> i<00:00:48.800> will<00:00:49.910> select<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.120> layer

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
on steeper cliffs i will select a layer

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.950 
on steeper cliffs i will select a layer
and<00:00:51.539> then<00:00:51.870> hit<00:00:52.879> type<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.360> slope<00:00:54.719> i

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and then hit type in like the slope i

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.250 
and then hit type in like the slope i
will<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.320> 50<00:00:56.539> or<00:00:57.539> 40<00:00:59.329> 0<00:01:00.329> being<00:01:00.629> it'll<00:01:00.989> go<00:01:01.230> on

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
will get 50 or 40 0 being it'll go on

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.920 
will get 50 or 40 0 being it'll go on
flat<00:01:01.620> terrain<00:01:01.850> 90<00:01:02.850> being<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.270> will<00:01:03.390> go<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
flat terrain 90 being it will go on to a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.539 
flat terrain 90 being it will go on to a
completely<00:01:04.320> vertical<00:01:05.780> piece<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.960> terrain<00:01:07.549> 40

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
completely vertical piece of terrain 40

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.250 
completely vertical piece of terrain 40
Isabelle<00:01:10.040> yeah<00:01:11.150> not<00:01:12.150> what<00:01:12.630> I'm<00:01:12.750> looking<00:01:12.780> for

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
Isabelle yeah not what I'm looking for

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.350 
Isabelle yeah not what I'm looking for
let's<00:01:13.409> go<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.740> about<00:01:13.860> 30<00:01:14.369> maybe<00:01:15.350> there<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.590> go

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
let's go for about 30 maybe there we go

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.520 
let's go for about 30 maybe there we go
still<00:01:18.360> looks<00:01:18.600> kind<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.900> crappy<00:01:21.020> but<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.350> can

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
still looks kind of crappy but this can

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.280 
still looks kind of crappy but this can
be<00:01:22.650> used<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.810> various<00:01:24.810> things<00:01:24.869> actually

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
be used for various things actually

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.090 
be used for various things actually
might<00:01:25.619> change<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.950> layer<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.829> see<00:01:28.829> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
might change the layer is that see and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.499 
might change the layer is that see and
that's<00:01:29.250> another<00:01:29.520> example<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.240> add

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
that's another example you can add

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.020 
that's another example you can add
layers<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.140> layer<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.500> layer<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.549> once

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
layers to layer and layer this one once

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.560 
layers to layer and layer this one once
again<00:01:33.150> doesn't<00:01:33.540> look<00:01:33.659> very<00:01:33.689> good<00:01:33.930> but

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.460 

it<00:01:37.570> works<00:01:38.970> altitude<00:01:39.970> means<00:01:40.450> that<00:01:41.229> it<00:01:41.380> will

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
it works altitude means that it will

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.310 
it works altitude means that it will
only<00:01:41.619> work<00:01:41.950> at<00:01:42.130> a<00:01:42.159> certain<00:01:42.369> altitude<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.840> let

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
only work at a certain altitude so let

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.469 
only work at a certain altitude so let
me<00:01:44.380> set<00:01:44.560> this<00:01:44.770> back<00:01:44.979> to<00:01:45.130> zero<00:01:45.400> let<00:01:46.180> me<00:01:46.270> go<00:01:46.420> to

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
me set this back to zero let me go to

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.950 
me set this back to zero let me go to
the<00:01:47.170> modify<00:01:47.710> tool<00:01:48.070> I'm<00:01:49.030> going<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.360> find<00:01:49.570> the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
the modify tool I'm going to find the

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.240 
the modify tool I'm going to find the
height<00:01:50.200> of<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:52.149> so<00:01:53.080> 96

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.859 

then<00:01:57.250> I<00:01:57.399> put<00:01:57.640> into<00:01:57.880> my<00:01:58.119> layers<00:01:59.220> name<00:02:00.220> 96<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.450> it

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
then I put into my layers name 96 and it

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.550 
then I put into my layers name 96 and it
will<00:02:02.079> paint<00:02:02.979> over<00:02:03.310> everything<00:02:03.850> at<00:02:04.780> or<00:02:05.229> above

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
will paint over everything at or above

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.660 
will paint over everything at or above
96<00:02:07.440> you<00:02:08.440> can<00:02:08.560> also<00:02:08.679> do<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.009> same<00:02:09.220> with<00:02:09.459> by

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
96 you can also do the same with by

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.699 
96 you can also do the same with by
lowering<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.239> and<00:02:11.430> changing<00:02:12.430> its<00:02:12.610> I<00:02:12.790> like<00:02:14.250> 98

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
lowering it and changing its I like 98

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.910 
lowering it and changing its I like 98
paint<00:02:17.709> over<00:02:17.890> this<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.720> that's<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:20.050> zero<00:02:20.260> paint

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
paint over this and that's a zero paint

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.300 
paint over this and that's a zero paint
over<00:02:21.250> it

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.360 

and<00:02:25.570> then<00:02:26.570> you<00:02:26.960> will<00:02:27.050> just<00:02:27.140> get<00:02:27.350> a<00:02:27.410> thin<00:02:27.980> stripe

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
and then you will just get a thin stripe

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.230 
and then you will just get a thin stripe
around<00:02:28.670> your<00:02:29.300> layers<00:02:29.650> around<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.920> hyped<00:02:34.240> ok

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
around your layers around that hyped ok

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.860 
around your layers around that hyped ok
let<00:02:35.540> me<00:02:35.570> get<00:02:35.750> into<00:02:36.020> how<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.260> name<00:02:36.980> your

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
let me get into how to name your

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.420 
let me get into how to name your
textures<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:39.440> don't<00:02:39.800> so<00:02:40.130> you<00:02:40.190> can<00:02:40.310> keep

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
textures so you don't so you can keep

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.540 
textures so you don't so you can keep
them<00:02:40.550> organized<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:42.530> go<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.830> your<00:02:43.070> textures

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
them organized you go to your textures

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.540 
them organized you go to your textures
and<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.760> terrain<00:02:43.970> tool<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:45.680> can<00:02:45.860> get<00:02:46.310> rid<00:02:46.460> of

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
and the terrain tool you can get rid of

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.580 
and the terrain tool you can get rid of
some<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.760> these<00:02:47.000> but<00:02:47.690> are<00:02:47.870> not<00:02:48.050> needed

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.550 

and<00:02:51.480> then<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.660> rename<00:02:52.989> them<00:02:53.110> just<00:02:53.290> double

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
and then to rename them just double

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.900 
and then to rename them just double
click<00:02:53.739> on<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.190> layer<00:02:56.129> drag<00:02:57.129> over<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.640> delete

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
click on the layer drag over it delete
