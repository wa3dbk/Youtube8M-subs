as<00:02:58.659> well<00:02:59.500> as<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.950> game<00:03:00.129> sound<00:03:00.430> effects<00:03:00.730> at

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
as well as the game sound effects at

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.119 
as well as the game sound effects at
least<00:03:01.329> it<00:03:01.480> did<00:03:01.659> in<00:03:01.930> titanfall<00:03:02.470> I've<00:03:02.739> tested

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
least it did in titanfall I've tested

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.180 
least it did in titanfall I've tested
this<00:03:03.220> in<00:03:03.400> titanfall<00:03:04.200> that's<00:03:05.200> all<00:03:05.349> I've<00:03:05.500> tested

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
this in titanfall that's all I've tested

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.550 
this in titanfall that's all I've tested
it<00:03:06.250> on<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.870> doesn't<00:03:08.140> record<00:03:08.409> like

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
it on and it doesn't record like

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.080 
it on and it doesn't record like
background<00:03:08.890> music<00:03:09.159> and<00:03:09.280> stuff<00:03:09.430> just<00:03:09.760> the

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
background music and stuff just the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.240 
background music and stuff just the
sound<00:03:11.019> effects<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:11.409> the<00:03:11.590> game<00:03:11.709> audio<00:03:11.950> needs<00:03:11.980> to

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
sound effects so the game audio needs to

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.330 
sound effects so the game audio needs to
be<00:03:12.370> up<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:12.579> little<00:03:12.819> bit<00:03:12.940> for<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:15.190> get<00:03:15.280> the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
be up a little bit for the to get the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.940 
be up a little bit for the to get the
full<00:03:15.640> experience<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:16.480> guess<00:03:16.659> of<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.380> recording

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
full experience I guess of the recording

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.420 
full experience I guess of the recording
but<00:03:18.579> that<00:03:19.569> will<00:03:20.139> work<00:03:20.169> that<00:03:20.680> way<00:03:20.859> or<00:03:21.099> you<00:03:21.130> can

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
but that will work that way or you can

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.229 
but that will work that way or you can
always<00:03:21.579> go<00:03:21.849> into<00:03:22.739> audacity<00:03:24.120> find<00:03:25.120> your

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
microphone here hit record and you can

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.909 
microphone here hit record and you can
start<00:03:29.079> recording<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:29.530> way<00:03:29.650> that<00:03:29.829> would

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:29.919 
start recording that way that would

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.050 
start recording that way that would
record<00:03:30.190> everything<00:03:30.430> that's<00:03:30.700> coming<00:03:30.970> through

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
you have available do that and that is

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.270 
you have available do that and that is
basically<00:04:04.090> it<00:04:04.599> hopefully<00:04:05.379> that<00:04:05.859> this<00:04:05.980> helps

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
basically it hopefully that this helps

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.860 
basically it hopefully that this helps
you<00:04:06.340> out<00:04:06.400> there<00:04:06.819> is<00:04:06.970> only<00:04:07.150> one<00:04:07.389> thing<00:04:07.599> that<00:04:07.660> in

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
you out there is only one thing that in

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.300 
you out there is only one thing that in
trunk<00:04:08.260> I<00:04:08.379> need<00:04:08.530> to<00:04:08.620> kind<00:04:08.829> of<00:04:08.889> tweak<00:04:09.040> around

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
trunk I need to kind of tweak around

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.970 
trunk I need to kind of tweak around
with<00:04:09.400> some<00:04:09.519> settings<00:04:09.819> but<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:10.480> does<00:04:10.720> record<00:04:11.139> my

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
with some settings but it does record my

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.729 
with some settings but it does record my
voice<00:04:12.250> very<00:04:12.940> loud<00:04:13.209> in<00:04:13.569> comparison<00:04:14.109> to<00:04:14.349> the

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
voice very loud in comparison to the

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.349 
voice very loud in comparison to the
rest<00:04:14.919> of<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:15.280> audio<00:04:15.579> that<00:04:15.879> comes<00:04:15.940> through

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
rest of the audio that comes through

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.969 
rest of the audio that comes through
there<00:04:16.570> so<00:04:16.900> hopefully<00:04:17.349> I<00:04:17.380> could<00:04:17.500> figure<00:04:17.799> out<00:04:17.889> a

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
there so hopefully I could figure out a

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.819 
there so hopefully I could figure out a
way<00:04:18.099> to<00:04:18.160> get<00:04:18.340> that<00:04:18.489> down<00:04:19.199> because<00:04:20.199> right<00:04:20.680> now<00:04:20.799> I

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
way to get that down because right now I

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.380 
way to get that down because right now I
just<00:04:21.039> have<00:04:21.579> to<00:04:21.669> talk<00:04:21.789> quieter<00:04:22.120> I<00:04:22.180> guess

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
just have to talk quieter I guess

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.510 
just have to talk quieter I guess
because<00:04:22.780> I'm<00:04:22.930> very<00:04:23.140> very<00:04:23.590> noisy<00:04:24.159> in

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
because I'm very very noisy in

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.860 
because I'm very very noisy in
comparison<00:04:25.000> to<00:04:25.090> everything<00:04:25.270> else

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
comparison to everything else

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.110 
comparison to everything else
so<00:04:26.080> hopefully<00:04:26.770> we<00:04:26.860> can<00:04:27.010> find<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.639> way<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.790> fix

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
so hopefully we can find a way to fix

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.210 
so hopefully we can find a way to fix
that<00:04:28.270> but<00:04:28.780> other<00:04:29.199> than<00:04:29.410> that<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:29.800> does<00:04:29.980> work

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
that but other than that it does work

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.000 
that but other than that it does work
you<00:04:30.460> do<00:04:30.669> get<00:04:30.880> game<00:04:31.230> chat<00:04:32.230> through<00:04:32.800> there

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
you do get game chat through there

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.860 
you do get game chat through there
without<00:04:33.580> needing<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.330> unplug<00:04:34.690> your

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
without needing to unplug your

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.360 
without needing to unplug your
microphone<00:04:35.260> you<00:04:35.440> can<00:04:35.620> record<00:04:35.860> your<00:04:36.070> friends

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
microphone you can record your friends

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.950 
microphone you can record your friends
you<00:04:36.490> can<00:04:36.639> record<00:04:36.850> yourself<00:04:37.240> everything<00:04:37.720> works

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
you can record yourself everything works

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.469 
you can record yourself everything works
so<00:04:38.919> yeah<00:04:39.400> I<00:04:39.669> hope<00:04:39.850> that<00:04:40.000> this<00:04:40.090> helped<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.449> out
