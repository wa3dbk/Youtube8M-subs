okay<00:00:02.159> I<00:00:02.190> just<00:00:02.429> got<00:00:02.580> a<00:00:02.610> new<00:00:02.790> gear<00:00:03.060> set<00:00:03.330> for<00:00:03.629> the

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
okay I just got a new gear set for the

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.930 
okay I just got a new gear set for the
back<00:00:03.899> of<00:00:03.929> my<00:00:04.290> swing<00:00:04.950> bicycle<00:00:05.609> this<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.879> a

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
back of my swing bicycle this is a

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.160 
back of my swing bicycle this is a
Samana<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.480> your<00:00:06.629> said<00:00:06.839> it<00:00:06.960> should<00:00:07.140> be

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
Samana of your said it should be

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.650 
Samana of your said it should be
smoother<00:00:07.620> shifting<00:00:08.099> reason<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.179> got<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.599> is

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
smoother shifting reason I got this is

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.200 
smoother shifting reason I got this is
because<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.769> sets<00:00:11.040> on<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.519> bike<00:00:11.700> currently

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
because the sets on the bike currently

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.650 
because the sets on the bike currently
is<00:00:12.450> really<00:00:13.049> really<00:00:13.950> noisy<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:15.330> wanted<00:00:15.599> to

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
is really really noisy and I wanted to

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.939 
is really really noisy and I wanted to
see<00:00:15.750> if<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.929> could<00:00:16.080> make<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.230> difference<00:00:16.440> let<00:00:16.830> me

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
see if I could make a difference let me

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.890 
see if I could make a difference let me
see<00:00:17.190> if<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.340> can<00:00:17.460> hear<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.060> thing<00:00:21.710> over<00:00:22.710> here

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.930 
wobbling on that I'm hoping to move your
set<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:36.360> cheap<00:00:36.989> domain<00:00:37.500> here<00:00:38.430> said<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.700> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
set this cheap domain here said that the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.600 
set this cheap domain here said that the
bike<00:00:39.120> came<00:00:39.360> with<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.750> course<00:00:40.250> it's<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.399> chief

bike came with of course it's a chief
department<00:00:42.149> store<00:00:42.360> bike<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:42.960> not<00:00:43.079> going

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
department store bike so it's not going

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.630 
department store bike so it's not going
to<00:00:43.290> come<00:00:43.440> with<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> best<00:00:43.829> components<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
to come with the best components but I

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.700 
to come with the best components but I
understood<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.440> got<00:00:46.559> this

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
understood that going in so I got this

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.139 
understood that going in so I got this
other<00:00:46.920> gear<00:00:47.190> set<00:00:47.430> I'm<00:00:47.550> going<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.730> put<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.000> on

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
other gear set I'm going to put that on

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.720 
other gear set I'm going to put that on
there<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.390> we'll<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:48.809> if<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.110> quieter<00:00:49.730> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
there and we'll see if it's quieter the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.010 
there and we'll see if it's quieter the
clicking<00:00:51.120> doesn't<00:00:51.449> bother<00:00:51.570> me<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.809> don't<00:00:51.989> have

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
to get here on the camera but when you

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.069 
to get here on the camera but when you
really<00:00:53.850> want<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.270> say<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.840> hear<00:00:55.050> a

really want to say it you can hear a
high-pitch<00:00:55.590> grinding<00:00:56.160> noise<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:58.680> I'm<00:00:58.800> going

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
high-pitch grinding noise so I'm going

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.260 
high-pitch grinding noise so I'm going
to<00:00:58.980> put<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.160> other<00:00:59.309> gear<00:00:59.609> set<00:00:59.820> on<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.180> we'll

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270

guy<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.770> apparently<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.430> don't<00:02:08.550> have<00:02:08.820> to

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
guy on and apparently you don't have to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.530 
guy on and apparently you don't have to
tighten<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.500> because<00:02:11.370> as<00:02:11.820> you<00:02:11.880> with<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.420> way

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
tighten it because as you with the way

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.630 
tighten it because as you with the way
it's<00:02:12.660> designed<00:02:12.810> with<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.710> threads<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.280> don't

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
it's designed with the threads I don't

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.100 
it's designed with the threads I don't
know<00:02:14.730> if<00:02:14.880> let's<00:02:15.060> see<00:02:15.300> if<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.510> can<00:02:15.630> see<00:02:15.810> it

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
know if let's see if you can see it

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.900 
know if let's see if you can see it
yeah<00:02:16.470> there's<00:02:16.680> threads<00:02:16.950> right<00:02:17.160> there<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.640> as

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
yeah there's threads right there and as

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.280 
yeah there's threads right there and as
you<00:02:18.120> pedal<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.510> actually<00:02:18.870> touches<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
you pedal it actually touches the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.770 
you pedal it actually touches the
freewheel<00:02:19.710> on<00:02:19.860> there<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:21.210> you<00:02:21.240> don't<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:21.570> to

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
freewheel on there so you don't have to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.770 
freewheel on there so you don't have to
you<00:02:21.930> don't<00:02:22.050> need<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> special<00:02:22.830> tool<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:24.480> put<00:02:24.690> it

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
you don't need a special tool to put it

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.090 
you don't need a special tool to put it
on<00:02:24.900> just<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.260> get<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.530> off<00:02:27.500> let's<00:02:28.500> put<00:02:28.709> this<00:02:28.860> guy

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.100 

and<00:02:32.100> then<00:02:32.220> we'll<00:02:32.340> be<00:02:32.520> careful<00:02:32.790> or<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.810> was

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
and then we'll be careful or I was

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.340 
and then we'll be careful or I was
careful<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.610> didn't<00:02:35.850> strip<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.330> threads<00:02:36.780> on

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
careful so I didn't strip the threads on

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.960 
careful so I didn't strip the threads on
there<00:02:37.530> but<00:02:37.830> looks<00:02:38.280> like<00:02:38.370> that's<00:02:38.640> all<00:02:38.790> there<00:02:38.940> is

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
there but looks like that's all there is

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.270 
there but looks like that's all there is
to<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:40.350> I'm<00:02:40.410> going<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.590> put<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.830> wheel<00:02:41.250> back

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
to it so I'm going to put the wheel back

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.790 
to it so I'm going to put the wheel back
on<00:02:41.700> there<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.180> I'll<00:02:42.870> give<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.170> spin<00:02:43.410> here

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
on there and I'll give it a spin here

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.330 
on there and I'll give it a spin here
and<00:02:43.980> we'll<00:02:44.640> see<00:02:44.790> if<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:44.940> sounds<00:02:45.090> better<00:02:46.340> okay

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
and we'll see if it sounds better okay

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.790 
and we'll see if it sounds better okay
and<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.520> course<00:02:48.200> self-explanatory<00:02:49.200> but<00:02:49.770> I

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
and of course self-explanatory but I

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.380 
and of course self-explanatory but I
want<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.160> put<00:02:50.430> this<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> video<00:02:50.880> anyway<00:02:51.330> you

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
want to put this in the video anyway you

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.350 
want to put this in the video anyway you
just<00:02:51.950> type<00:02:52.950> these<00:02:53.190> back<00:02:53.489> up<00:02:53.520> on<00:02:53.940> there<00:02:54.180> real

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
just type these back up on there real

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.290 
just type these back up on there real
good<00:02:54.390> that's<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.560> course<00:02:55.739> what<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.250> listen<00:02:57.180> to

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
good that's of course what you listen to

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
take the back rim off better I have a

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.470 
take the back rim off better I have a
friend<00:03:01.650> that's<00:03:01.800> an<00:03:02.010> avid<00:03:02.280> bicyclist<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.180> he's

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
friend that's an avid bicyclist and he's

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.560 
friend that's an avid bicyclist and he's
probably<00:03:04.050> one<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.440> smartest<00:03:04.620> guys<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.130> know

probably one of the smartest guys I know

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.750 
probably one of the smartest guys I know
however<00:03:07.070> when<00:03:08.070> tell<00:03:08.280> them<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.459> was<00:03:08.550> going<00:03:08.700> to

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
you should have a bike shop do it

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.300 
you should have a bike shop do it
because<00:03:12.060> it's<00:03:12.209> really<00:03:12.360> complicated<00:03:13.250> and<00:03:14.250> he

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
because it's really complicated and he

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.520 
because it's really complicated and he
said<00:03:14.550> it's<00:03:14.850> even<00:03:15.150> more<00:03:15.300> complicated<00:03:15.660> than<00:03:15.989> the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
said it's even more complicated than the

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.500 
said it's even more complicated than the
cars<00:03:16.860> which<00:03:17.520> I<00:03:17.670> knew<00:03:17.820> better<00:03:18.060> because<00:03:18.390> I've

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
cars which I knew better because I've

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.650 
cars which I knew better because I've
worked<00:03:18.720> on<00:03:18.870> cars<00:03:19.140> most<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.590> my<00:03:19.650> life<00:03:20.660> but

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
worked on cars most of my life but

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.750 
worked on cars most of my life but
actually<00:03:22.170> I'm<00:03:22.410> finding<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.070> it's<00:03:23.550> pretty

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
actually I'm finding that it's pretty

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.400 
actually I'm finding that it's pretty
simple<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.180> work<00:03:24.300> on<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:24.900> don't<00:03:25.260> be

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
simple to work on so don't be

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.860 
simple to work on so don't be
intimidated<00:03:25.650> by<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.160> so<00:03:27.060> I'll<00:03:27.360> be<00:03:27.480> back<00:03:27.660> with

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
intimidated by it so I'll be back with

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.790 
intimidated by it so I'll be back with
you<00:03:28.050> okay<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:29.820> it's<00:03:30.570> exactly<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.260> same<00:03:31.500> with

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
I don't regret my $15 purchase because

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.259 
I don't regret my $15 purchase because
of<00:04:00.510> that<00:04:00.660> and<00:04:00.989> two<00:04:01.980> because<00:04:02.549> these<00:04:02.970> free

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
of that and two because these free

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.039 
of that and two because these free
wheels<00:04:04.099> I've<00:04:05.099> read<00:04:05.580> reviews<00:04:06.030> where<00:04:06.450> they<00:04:06.750> are

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
wheels I've read reviews where they are

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.170 
wheels I've read reviews where they are
known<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.470> go<00:04:07.620> back<00:04:07.799> and<00:04:08.099> on<00:04:08.489> a<00:04:08.519> long<00:04:08.730> bike<00:04:08.940> ride

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
known to go back and on a long bike ride

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.900 
known to go back and on a long bike ride
I<00:04:09.330> don't<00:04:09.510> want<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.750> go<00:04:09.900> bad<00:04:10.080> but<00:04:10.260> now<00:04:10.730> in<00:04:11.730> case

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
I don't want to go bad but now in case

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.670 
I don't want to go bad but now in case
this<00:04:12.150> Shimano<00:04:12.569> goes<00:04:12.840> bad<00:04:13.079> I've<00:04:13.230> got<00:04:13.410> another

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
this Shimano goes bad I've got another

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.240 
this Shimano goes bad I've got another
free<00:04:13.890> will<00:04:14.099> so<00:04:14.400> a<00:04:14.579> little<00:04:15.000> bit<00:04:15.180> of<00:04:15.239> backup<00:04:15.690> so

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
free will so a little bit of backup so

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.069 
free will so a little bit of backup so
it's<00:04:17.250> not<00:04:17.430> really<00:04:17.729> much<00:04:17.880> quieter<00:04:18.479> it<00:04:18.810> still

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
it's not really much quieter it still

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.780 
it's not really much quieter it still
wobbles<00:04:19.500> around<00:04:19.590> on<00:04:19.979> there<00:04:20.220> as<00:04:20.519> you<00:04:20.669> can

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
wobbles around on there as you can

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.480 
wobbles around on there as you can
probably<00:04:21.000> see<00:04:21.440> but<00:04:22.440> even<00:04:22.740> so<00:04:22.919> I<00:04:22.950> don't<00:04:23.100> regret

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
probably see but even so I don't regret

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.870 
probably see but even so I don't regret
it<00:04:23.610> now<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.800> should<00:04:25.800> have<00:04:25.889> a<00:04:25.950> smoother<00:04:26.550> shifting

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
it now I should have a smoother shifting

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.030 
it now I should have a smoother shifting
bike<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.650> hopefully<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.680> little<00:04:28.919> more

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
bike and hopefully a little more

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.640 
bike and hopefully a little more
reliable<00:04:29.310> so<00:04:29.850> I<00:04:30.150> know<00:04:30.419> I<00:04:30.900> can<00:04:31.260> have<00:04:31.410> faith<00:04:31.620> that

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
reliable so I know I can have faith that

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.140 
reliable so I know I can have faith that
it's<00:04:31.979> not<00:04:32.160> going<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.430> let<00:04:32.550> me<00:04:32.639> down<00:04:32.820> when<00:04:33.030> I'm

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
it's not going to let me down when I'm

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.430 
it's not going to let me down when I'm
on<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.330> long<00:04:33.510> run<00:04:33.979> so<00:04:34.979> as<00:04:35.220> easy<00:04:35.490> as<00:04:35.669> that<00:04:36.440> okay

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
on a long run so as easy as that okay

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.010 
on a long run so as easy as that okay
now<00:04:37.740> in<00:04:37.950> conclusion<00:04:38.220> I<00:04:38.940> put<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:39.900> new

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
now in conclusion I put the new

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.469 
now in conclusion I put the new
freewheel<00:04:40.440> one<00:04:40.650> it<00:04:41.550> didn't<00:04:42.000> seem<00:04:42.150> to<00:04:42.240> make<00:04:42.419> a

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
freewheel one it didn't seem to make a

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.690 
freewheel one it didn't seem to make a
difference<00:04:42.900> in<00:04:43.080> wobble<00:04:43.500> or<00:04:43.710> clicking<00:04:44.370> noise

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
difference in wobble or clicking noise

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.430 
difference in wobble or clicking noise
but<00:04:45.180> I<00:04:45.210> thought<00:04:45.419> I<00:04:45.479> heard<00:04:45.600> a<00:04:45.720> slight<00:04:45.900> decrease

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
but I thought I heard a slight decrease

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.120 
but I thought I heard a slight decrease
in<00:04:46.560> grinding<00:04:47.130> noise<00:04:47.510> I<00:04:48.770> should<00:04:49.770> probably<00:04:49.889> come

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
in grinding noise I should probably come

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.680 
in grinding noise I should probably come
back<00:04:50.310> and<00:04:50.490> update<00:04:50.580> this<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:51.270> tell<00:04:51.419> you<00:04:51.510> guys

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
back and update this and tell you guys

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.020 
back and update this and tell you guys
if<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:52.020> shifts<00:04:52.350> smoother<00:04:52.770> after<00:04:53.310> installing

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
if it shifts smoother after installing

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.460 
if it shifts smoother after installing
this<00:04:54.180> freewheel<00:04:54.630> but<00:04:54.810> to<00:04:54.900> be<00:04:55.020> honest<00:04:55.289> that<00:04:55.350> was

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
this freewheel but to be honest that was

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.960 
this freewheel but to be honest that was
never<00:04:55.770> an<00:04:55.919> issue<00:04:55.979> of<00:04:56.280> mine<00:04:56.460> wasn't<00:04:56.789> the

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
never an issue of mine wasn't the

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.330 
never an issue of mine wasn't the
smoothest<00:04:57.210> shifting<00:04:57.750> bike<00:04:58.190> sometimes<00:04:59.190> it

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
smoothest shifting bike sometimes it

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.159 
smoothest shifting bike sometimes it
would<00:04:59.460> miss<00:04:59.639> a<00:04:59.669> gear<00:04:59.970> 2<00:05:00.270> sometimes<00:05:00.810> it<00:05:01.080> would

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
would miss a gear 2 sometimes it would

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.290 
would miss a gear 2 sometimes it would
jump<00:05:01.410> too<00:05:01.620> but<00:05:02.490> that<00:05:02.639> was<00:05:02.789> never<00:05:02.970> really<00:05:03.180> a

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
jump too but that was never really a

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.940 
jump too but that was never really a
concern<00:05:03.690> of<00:05:03.810> mine<00:05:03.960> I<00:05:03.990> don't<00:05:04.139> really<00:05:04.440> I'm<00:05:04.740> not

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
concern of mine I don't really I'm not

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.040 
concern of mine I don't really I'm not
really<00:05:05.100> concerned<00:05:05.340> about<00:05:05.639> that<00:05:05.970> but<00:05:06.240> if<00:05:06.900> I

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
really concerned about that but if I

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.659 
really concerned about that but if I
find<00:05:07.320> it's<00:05:07.470> a<00:05:07.560> lot<00:05:07.680> smoother<00:05:08.100> I'll<00:05:08.250> come<00:05:08.460> back

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
find it's a lot smoother I'll come back

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.320 
find it's a lot smoother I'll come back
and<00:05:09.030> let<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:09.870> guys<00:05:10.020> know<00:05:10.080> but<00:05:10.940> you<00:05:11.940> know<00:05:12.060> we'll

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
and let you guys know but you know we'll

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.760 
and let you guys know but you know we'll
see<00:05:12.479> how<00:05:12.570> it<00:05:12.690> goes<00:05:12.720> and<00:05:13.110> I<00:05:13.200> want<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.470> share<00:05:13.650> how

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
see how it goes and I want to share how

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.520 
see how it goes and I want to share how
easy<00:05:14.010> it<00:05:14.220> is<00:05:14.310> to<00:05:14.490> change<00:05:14.820> and<00:05:15.270> like<00:05:16.200> I<00:05:16.320> said<00:05:16.380> I

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
easy it is to change and like I said I

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.969 
easy it is to change and like I said I
don't<00:05:16.740> regret<00:05:16.979> it<00:05:17.100> I<00:05:18.560> part<00:05:19.560> of<00:05:19.620> the<00:05:19.680> reason<00:05:19.919> I

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
don't regret it I part of the reason I

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.409 
don't regret it I part of the reason I
want<00:05:20.160> to<00:05:20.250> change<00:05:20.460> does<00:05:20.669> because<00:05:21.060> I<00:05:21.150> wanted

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
want to change does because I wanted

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.029 
want to change does because I wanted
something<00:05:21.630> really<00:05:22.020> reliable<00:05:22.560> that<00:05:22.710> I<00:05:22.770> didn't

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
something really reliable that I didn't

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.520 
something really reliable that I didn't
have<00:05:23.160> to<00:05:23.280> worry<00:05:23.460> about<00:05:23.550> breaking<00:05:23.970> and<00:05:24.360> I<00:05:24.930> have

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
have to worry about breaking and I have

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.980 
have to worry about breaking and I have
read<00:05:25.740> reviews<00:05:26.220> of<00:05:26.520> this<00:05:26.789> bike<00:05:27.090> on<00:05:27.360> two<00:05:27.780> or

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
read reviews of this bike on two or

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.180 
read reviews of this bike on two or
three<00:05:28.020> occasions<00:05:28.260> where<00:05:28.800> they<00:05:28.919> said<00:05:29.099> the

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
three occasions where they said the

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.430 
three occasions where they said the
freewheel<00:05:29.580> went<00:05:29.820> out<00:05:29.970> of<00:05:30.120> it<00:05:30.240> so<00:05:30.539> hopefully<00:05:31.410> I

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
freewheel went out of it so hopefully I

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.839 
freewheel went out of it so hopefully I
don't<00:05:31.560> have<00:05:31.710> to<00:05:31.830> worry<00:05:32.070> about<00:05:32.130> that<00:05:32.550> anymore

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:32.849 
don't have to worry about that anymore

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.150 
don't have to worry about that anymore
and<00:05:33.330> it<00:05:33.780> will<00:05:33.900> last<00:05:34.139> for<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:34.770> life<00:05:34.950> of<00:05:35.070> the

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
and it will last for the life of the

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.080 
and it will last for the life of the
bike<00:05:35.370> but<00:05:35.870> we'll<00:05:36.870> see
