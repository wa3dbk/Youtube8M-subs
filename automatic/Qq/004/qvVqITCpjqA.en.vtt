00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.760 
out today it said you only get 90
miles<00:03:46.849> max<00:03:47.849> on<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.150> tires<00:03:48.480> but<00:03:49.050> it's<00:03:49.290> only<00:03:49.410> 15

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
miles max on the tires but it's only 15

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.680 
miles max on the tires but it's only 15
miles<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.099> work<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:50.489> that's<00:03:51.180> at<00:03:51.390> least<00:03:51.420> two

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
miles to work so that's at least two

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.990 
miles to work so that's at least two
days<00:03:52.019> of<00:03:52.290> driving<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:52.830> 15<00:03:53.250> there<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.640> 15

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
days of driving to the 15 there and 15

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.809 
days of driving to the 15 there and 15
back<00:03:54.440> so<00:03:55.440> I<00:03:55.950> guess<00:03:56.010> we'll<00:03:56.370> see<00:03:56.489> how<00:03:56.640> that<00:03:56.700> goes

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
back so I guess we'll see how that goes

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.809
