00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.810 
five feet or so and stomp down that one
real<00:03:09.230> easy<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.739> just<00:03:09.770> wait<00:03:10.130> on<00:03:10.160> him<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:10.550> do<00:03:10.700> it

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
real easy you just wait on him to do it

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.070 
real easy you just wait on him to do it
when<00:03:10.940> he<00:03:11.030> goes<00:03:11.180> up<00:03:11.360> in<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.540> air<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:11.900> roll

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
when he goes up in the air you roll

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.560 
when he goes up in the air you roll
backwards<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.770> he'll<00:03:13.670> miss<00:03:13.850> you<00:03:14.030> every<00:03:14.390> time

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
backwards and he'll miss you every time

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.390 
backwards and he'll miss you every time
now<00:03:15.020> I<00:03:15.050> screwed<00:03:15.410> up<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.709> when<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.010> rolled

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
now I screwed up I when I rolled

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.280 
now I screwed up I when I rolled
sideways<00:03:16.880> if<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.330> roll<00:03:17.510> sideways<00:03:18.020> you'll

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
sideways if you roll sideways you'll

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.900 
sideways if you roll sideways you'll
still<00:03:18.470> hit<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:18.800> you<00:03:19.250> might<00:03:19.520> can<00:03:19.730> roll

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
still hit you you might can roll

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.910 
still hit you you might can roll
underneath<00:03:20.209> him<00:03:20.540> I'm<00:03:20.660> not<00:03:20.870> sure<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:21.410> didn't<00:03:21.709> try

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
underneath him I'm not sure I didn't try

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.460 
underneath him I'm not sure I didn't try
I<00:03:22.190> rolled<00:03:22.550> backwards<00:03:23.060> so<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.840> rolling

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
I rolled backwards so and rolling

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.140 
I rolled backwards so and rolling
backwards<00:03:24.830> worked<00:03:25.040> for<00:03:25.250> me<00:03:25.400> in<00:03:25.550> fact<00:03:25.940> that

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
backwards worked for me in fact that

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.460 
backwards worked for me in fact that
right<00:03:26.390> there<00:03:26.630> it's<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.840> only<00:03:27.050> time<00:03:27.200> that<00:03:27.260> I

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
right there it's the only time that I

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.140 
right there it's the only time that I
got<00:03:27.620> hit<00:03:27.860> by<00:03:28.040> one<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.340> them<00:03:28.520> from<00:03:28.820> rolling

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
got hit by one of them from rolling

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.580 
got hit by one of them from rolling
backwards<00:03:29.570> and<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:29.750> was<00:03:29.870> because<00:03:29.989> I<00:03:30.230> rolled

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
backwards and that was because I rolled

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.060 
backwards and that was because I rolled
too<00:03:30.800> early<00:03:31.100> um<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:33.200> last<00:03:33.380> attack<00:03:33.770> that<00:03:33.920> he

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
too early um the last attack that he

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.520 
too early um the last attack that he
does<00:03:34.280> is<00:03:34.640> a<00:03:35.000> magical<00:03:35.540> attack<00:03:35.870> he'll<00:03:36.260> start

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
does is a magical attack he'll start

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.770 
does is a magical attack he'll start
breathing<00:03:36.770> out<00:03:37.070> this<00:03:37.280> gaseous<00:03:37.580> stuff<00:03:38.120> purple

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
breathing out this gaseous stuff purple
