00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the fit I think they did a very very

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.069 
the fit I think they did a very very
good<00:00:37.680> job<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.430> my<00:00:38.760> first<00:00:39.000> time<00:00:39.180> ordering<00:00:39.570> a

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
suit or blazer from them so I think they

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.779 
suit or blazer from them so I think they
did<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.050> very<00:00:43.079> good<00:00:43.320> job<00:00:43.500> there<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.280> one<00:00:44.550> size

did a very good job there is one size

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.549 
did a very good job there is one size
that<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.030> think<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.300> would<00:00:45.480> fix<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.200> little<00:00:46.440> bit

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
that I think I would fix a little bit

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.200 
that I think I would fix a little bit
it's<00:00:46.680> only<00:00:46.800> like<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.250> think<00:00:47.489> like<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> half<00:00:48.059> an

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
it's only like I think like a half an

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.209 
it's only like I think like a half an
inch<00:00:48.390> off<00:00:48.660> but<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.500> doesn't<00:00:49.770> make<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> big

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
inch off but it doesn't make a big

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.590 
inch off but it doesn't make a big
difference<00:00:50.579> as<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.700> can<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> jacket

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
difference as you can see the jacket

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.450 
difference as you can see the jacket
does<00:00:51.870> look<00:00:52.110> really<00:00:52.379> well<00:00:52.649> now<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> want<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.309> get

it<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.170> good<00:02:01.380> piece<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.399> time<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.640> it

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
it is a good piece and the time that it

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.670 
it is a good piece and the time that it
takes<00:02:03.390> for<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.780> actually<00:02:04.079> get<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.500> piece

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
takes for you to actually get the piece

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.429 
takes for you to actually get the piece
it<00:02:04.950> isn't<00:02:05.369> as<00:02:05.549> much<00:02:06.030> as<00:02:06.509> other<00:02:06.719> clothes<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.380> I

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
it isn't as much as other clothes that I

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.380 
it isn't as much as other clothes that I
have<00:02:07.619> tried<00:02:07.890> out<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.250> think<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.879> was<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.030> little
