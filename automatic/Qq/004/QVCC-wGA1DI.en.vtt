00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.869
 found for a little tutorial on 6 to 15 1 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.619
 rather technical gesture kind you have not 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.350
 wrong on my channel 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.000
 only I could do it so you 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.250
 go see it a lot I hope your 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.359
 emissions so this tutorial is the shot 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.609
 franc in blow of the scarf 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.710
 so for that you will need care 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.170
 keystone ronaldo evening nadine and shrug 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.540
 the only two who can do it 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.280
 first I show you an example if 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.079
 you are you are not ashamed these two 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.540
 days ie you have all the 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.980
 players one by one these two days so the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.110
 free kick it will give a kind of 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.059
 panenka a little bit all the edges then we 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.780
 realize what basically with ronaldinho or 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.680
 ronaldo 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.739
 placed in the left half of the small bow 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.430
 2 sec of repair surface you 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.129
 press once on x just once and 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.019
 you hold your left joystick 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.729
 totally to the left 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:09.030
 and then the left pole 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.960
 renaud bray and there I place myself in the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.310
 left side of the surface at two the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.740
 the bow of bags from the surface of 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.330
 repair the left pole must be at 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.210
 pretty much in the middle of your screen you 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.619
 tap jobs you call once 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.390
 on x and then you miss one 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.820
 totally left gesture towards the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.270
 left here I'm still done 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.760
 to show you once started pop 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.990
 there you press x once and you 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.400
 hold your left justice 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.340
 totally to the left 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.650
 here you see it's that it's hard 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.340
 was going to go back 1 it's really having 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.100
 luck but here it is stylish and 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.810
 try as friends like that you 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.509
 maybe you have to have either ronaldo 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.840
 either ronald jc the only two players 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.430
 who can do it so much the game you 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.320
 remonstrated I believe this amount to me 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.190
 fair is here because I do not comment 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.190
 get there 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.600
 left post of the goal should be at little 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.590
 near the middle of your screen there I am 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.340
 am sometimes real i will you 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.350
 show one last time so tac you 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.620
 so stop the surface finally in their 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.640
 circles in the left side you 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.560
 align the pole in the middle of you 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.970
 three screens you press once on x 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.070
 and you hold the left stick 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.330
 totally valid 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.100
 so here at first it looks complicated 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.620
 but training is enough 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.950
