00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
I've been fiddling around with this for

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.080 
I've been fiddling around with this for
a<00:00:09.150> couple<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.599> days<00:00:09.780> now<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:11.010> think<00:00:11.880> I've

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
a couple of days now and I think I've

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.770 
a couple of days now and I think I've
just<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.389> bit<00:00:12.540> cracked<00:00:12.929> it<00:00:13.110> uh<00:00:13.370> yeah<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.780> thought

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
this beauty for forty bucks and the guy

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.250 
this beauty for forty bucks and the guy
had<00:00:19.529> taken<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.039> stickers<00:00:20.490> off<00:00:20.670> but<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.300> don't

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
had taken the stickers off but I don't

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.509 
had taken the stickers off but I don't
know<00:00:22.410> if<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.769> see<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.310> he's<00:00:24.000> left<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
know if you can see this he's left the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.800 
know if you can see this he's left the
adhesive<00:00:26.519> residue<00:00:26.730> behind

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
adhesive residue behind

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.960 
adhesive residue behind
this<00:00:27.990> stuff<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.590> an<00:00:28.710> absolute<00:00:29.160> dog<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.670> get<00:00:29.820> off

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
this stuff is an absolute dog to get off

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.930 
this stuff is an absolute dog to get off
I<00:00:30.560> have<00:00:31.560> tried<00:00:31.830> everything<00:00:32.219> under<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> Sun

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
I have tried everything under the Sun

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:42.350 
I have tried everything under the Sun
and<00:00:34.160> I<00:00:35.160> think<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:35.850> works<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:40.160> video<00:00:41.360> mineral

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
and I think what works is video mineral

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.930 
and I think what works is video mineral
tips<00:00:42.719> which<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.230> your<00:00:43.410> hydrocarbon<00:00:44.899> and<00:00:46.730> a<00:00:47.730> bit

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
tips which is your hydrocarbon and a bit

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.139 
tips which is your hydrocarbon and a bit
of<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.120> scraper<00:00:48.980> so<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.399> apply<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.820> is

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
of a scraper so just apply this is

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.700 
of a scraper so just apply this is
actually<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> paint<00:00:51.780> scraper<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.440> I've<00:00:52.559> left

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
actually a paint scraper but I've left

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.270 
actually a paint scraper but I've left
the<00:00:52.890> plastic<00:00:53.160> guard<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:54.410> there<00:00:55.410> seems<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.100> be<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the plastic guard on there seems to be a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.400 
the plastic guard on there seems to be a
bit<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.640> two-stage<00:00:57.239> process<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:58.079> got<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.320> be

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
bit of a two-stage process you got to be

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.080 
bit of a two-stage process you got to be
gentle<00:00:58.680> otherwise<00:00:59.250> there's<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.609> danger<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
gentle otherwise there's a danger of

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.319 
gentle otherwise there's a danger of
taking<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.600> paint<00:01:00.899> off<00:01:01.109> but<00:01:01.760> what<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.789> tend<00:01:03.210> to

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
taking the paint off but what I tend to

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.899 
taking the paint off but what I tend to
do<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:06.530> just<00:01:07.530> whack<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> bit<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.630> turps<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.930> a

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
do is just whack a bit of the turps on a

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.560 
do is just whack a bit of the turps on a
bit<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.939> paper<00:01:12.060> towel<00:01:12.630> actually<00:01:15.950> just<00:01:16.950> sort<00:01:17.159> of

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
bit of paper towel actually just sort of

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.440 
bit of paper towel actually just sort of
that<00:01:18.570> impregnate

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.260 

then<00:01:25.450> with<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.750> scraper<00:01:27.000> very<00:01:28.000> light

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
then with the scraper very light

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
then with the scraper very light
pressure<00:01:28.920> we<00:01:29.920> just<00:01:30.160> stuffed<00:01:30.490> getting<00:01:30.910> in

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
pressure we just stuffed getting in

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.910 
pressure we just stuffed getting in
getting<00:01:33.460> rid<00:01:33.790> of<00:01:33.820> some<00:01:34.240> of<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.450> bigger<00:01:34.920> chunks

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
getting rid of some of the bigger chunks

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.550 
getting rid of some of the bigger chunks
it's<00:01:36.910> kind<00:01:37.270> of<00:01:37.360> coming<00:01:37.630> off<00:01:37.840> a<00:01:37.870> bit<00:01:38.140> easier

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
it's kind of coming off a bit easier

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.600 
it's kind of coming off a bit easier
tried<00:01:39.120> wd-40<00:01:40.120> and<00:01:40.440> if<00:01:41.440> you<00:01:41.590> let<00:01:41.770> that<00:01:41.920> sink<00:01:42.430> in

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
tried wd-40 and if you let that sink in

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.240 
tried wd-40 and if you let that sink in
for<00:01:42.670> 10<00:01:43.540> or<00:01:43.570> so<00:01:43.870> minutes<00:01:43.900> it<00:01:44.470> doesn't<00:01:44.800> do<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> bad

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
for 10 or so minutes it doesn't do a bad

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:56.990 
for 10 or so minutes it doesn't do a bad
job<00:01:45.280> but<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:48.790> stuff's<00:01:49.180> much<00:01:49.570> better<00:01:54.300> slowly

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
job but this stuff's much better slowly

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.969 
job but this stuff's much better slowly
slowly

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
slowly

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:06.719 
slowly
deep<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.280> deeper<00:02:00.729> into<00:02:00.880> this<00:02:01.150> stuff<00:02:05.580> so<00:02:06.580> it's

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
deep and deeper into this stuff so it's

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.490 
deep and deeper into this stuff so it's
just<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:07.060> little<00:02:07.210> bit<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.540> mechanical<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.170> little

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
just a little bit of mechanical a little

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.990 
just a little bit of mechanical a little
bit<00:02:08.649> of<00:02:08.770> chemical<00:02:11.070> does<00:02:12.070> seem<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.550> get<00:02:12.700> there

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
bit of chemical does seem to get there

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000 
bit of chemical does seem to get there
in<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.300> end

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.070 

it's<00:02:18.010> definitely<00:02:18.580> got<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:19.000> lot<00:02:19.660> less<00:02:19.870> effort

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
it's definitely got a lot less effort

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.410 
it's definitely got a lot less effort
involved<00:02:20.970> then<00:02:21.970> with<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.270> wd-40

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
involved then with the wd-40

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.850 
involved then with the wd-40
it's<00:02:25.420> need<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.810> lot<00:02:26.110> more<00:02:26.140> elbow<00:02:26.560> grease<00:02:28.709> so<00:02:29.709> you

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
it's need a lot more elbow grease so you

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.680 
it's need a lot more elbow grease so you
can<00:02:29.980> see<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.520> coming<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.300> just<00:02:31.510> be

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
can see that is coming it just be

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.610 
can see that is coming it just be
careful<00:02:32.140> don't<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:33.420> not<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.600> scrape<00:02:34.930> too<00:02:35.290> deep

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
careful don't to not to scrape too deep

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.800 
careful don't to not to scrape too deep
because<00:02:36.040> yeah<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:38.970> paint<00:02:39.970> can<00:02:40.300> come<00:02:40.630> off

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
because yeah the the paint can come off

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.150 
because yeah the the paint can come off
especially<00:02:41.470> on<00:02:41.860> these<00:02:42.040> cheap<00:02:42.400> bikes<00:02:44.160> that's

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
especially on these cheap bikes that's

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.840 
especially on these cheap bikes that's
coming<00:02:45.640> off<00:02:45.760> quite<00:02:46.090> nicely<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.870> I<00:02:46.989> I<00:02:47.730> think<00:02:48.730> to

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
coming off quite nicely and I I think to

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.870 
coming off quite nicely and I I think to
finish<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.330> job<00:02:49.570> after<00:02:50.019> I've<00:02:50.140> got<00:02:50.700> all<00:02:51.700> this

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
finish the job after I've got all this

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.380 
finish the job after I've got all this
stuff<00:02:52.180> off<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:53.100> nice<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:56.190> nice<00:02:57.190> clean<00:02:57.610> road<00:02:58.090> that

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
stuff off is nice a nice clean road that
