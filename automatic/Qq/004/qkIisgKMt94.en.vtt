00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.220
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.080
 our channel has again leo and in 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.970
 this video is about the trick of building 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.340
 but from the belly away that one again 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.220
 more variant and I'll show you 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.960
 how to do it 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.750
 First of all, your dog has to do this 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.910
 bouncing ever learn the whole 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.430
 Let's do it on a wall with a board 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.239
 it's easy to do that very easily 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.000
 teach 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.040
 because we put the board in first 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.540
 a very low angle to the wall 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.370
 and then we can do each other very well 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.640
 increase and then the dog understands 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.320
 scary fast if you like this 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.049
 do not bounce on the wall yet 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.960
 I would recommend it first time 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:58.250
 to watch the video and then 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.170
 to practice and then we can here 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.640
 carry on and also clearly 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.640
 to succeed more efficiently 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.890
 I already have this trick on the tree 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.290
 so I can practice here too 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.230
 use this tree to the trick just on 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.840
 to reduce this new level from the abdomen 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.470
 transferred and I just show here 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.240
 just my buddy like this gesture is 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.820
 so that the cleo understands then ok should that 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.160
 Do it here now and you'll see 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.910
 all you have to do is 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.010
 the foot to the other in the soft parts too 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.750
 hold and a bit of motivation 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.310
 does it work and if you do 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.870
 then properly motivated then the and 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.520
 understand okay it should me here too 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.260
 and then you can do that 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.200
 increase again and then slowly from 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.360
 this tree or a wall just there 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.790
 Of course, then it goes away too 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.430
 but it should of course be the same 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.460
 tree or the same wall are at the he 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.140
 previously exercised around now on the 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.240
 then go to the next level and this one 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.920
 Trying to learn alone is worthwhile 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.540
 it's such a toy to take where 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.030
 the dog really hot on it is here 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.160
 for example, the frisbee that one sees 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.380
 pretty much more motivated and glue 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.020
 then jumps also much more full 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.050
 the practical thing about this disc is 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.510
 that I have so cheap in hand 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.850
 can hold and therefore the cleo too 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.830
 can steer a bit in the movement 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.650
 so that's how they really do it 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.540
 Like me, he wants to do that in the case 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.280
 she comes from the right and therefore 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.410
 I take the frisbee with the 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.500
 right hand with it then I really do 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.400
 exactly from this side down so 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.400
 can steer away 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.450
 what I have in the recordings of these 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.450
 Ten more really painful 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.570
 I had to find out with you 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.120
 polish so if my dog â€‹â€‹with here 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.459
 full power with the claws ahead more 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.440
 or less in the abdomen that jumps 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.500
 leaves traces and I can tell you 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.390
 In the evening they say after this 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.760
 video has looked like my belly 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.900
 a flammkuchen and that should be you on 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.900
 best spared 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.189
 as you can see on the teeth here it is 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.530
 would be very helpful if the dog 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.390
 is really motivated and you can 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.549
 just with the toy on the and 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.690
 properly, therefore, is clearly promoting and 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:26.030
 then it works well 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:28.190
 better what you should pay attention to that 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.079
 you have sensible shoes and also 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.440
 surely what else is happening 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.440
 you see here 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.459
 I hope you liked it all 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.560
 helped you further 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.239
 As already mentioned, it is very quiet 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.409
 then you can transfer that to 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.909
 and then it will be very fast 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.889
 actually work very well too 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.540
 I would be very happy if you think so 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.709
 subscribed to the channel and see you at 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.709
 next video star 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.520
 Super
