00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.759
 how about friends of natural advice 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.890
 puntocom well in this video let's see 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.980
 how can we prevent the fall 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.530
 of good hair first of all the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.659
 Hair loss may be due 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.970
 mainly to two very factors 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:20.820
 important on the one hand that the hair 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.210
 is not receiving the nutrients that 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.999
 needs and on the other hand because 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.550
 somehow we are having too much 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:34.210
 production of an enzyme known as 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.040
 alpha 5 reductase which is what makes 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.290
 that the receivers of the 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.690
 hair follicles that are what nourish 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.600
 to the hair and therefore the hair is going 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.019
 weakening until it falls this is a 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.320
 explanation a little brief and concise but 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.960
 well I think the concept is clear 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.640
 it's about an enzyme that what it does is 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.440
 prevent the hair follicle from 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.899
 hair get the nutrients that 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.260
 then you need the remedy that you 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.570
 I bring today on the one hand what he is going to do 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.750
 is to inhibit the production of this enzyme 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.789
 called alpha 5 reductase and on the other hand 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.490
 will give the hair all the 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:15.009
 amino acids minerals and vitamins that 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.100
 you need for vitamin 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.899
 carotenoids vitamin c as soon as 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.560
 amino acids will also give you the 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.910
 christina series of flour and tryptophan and 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.800
 As for minerals, it's going to 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.100
 provide magnesium manganese sodium potassium 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.090
 aluminum and many others more and in second 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.789
 place then as I say 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.460
 and reduce the production of the enzyme 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.899
 alpha 5 reductase which is what makes 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.469
 the hair follicle is blocked and so 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.929
 So all those nutrients do not reach 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:48.090
 the hair so this remedy is 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.479
 doubly effective 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:56.149
 then as well let's see 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.149
 exactly what remedy is it 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:05.220
 surely you have already heard of the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.540
 green tea well then the green tea one of 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.500
 its wonderful properties is 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.390
 to stop hair loss apart 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.040
 to lose weight and apart from all your 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.100
 antioxidant richness green tea 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.590
 It serves to prevent the hair from 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.129
 fall and weaken 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.380
 It is therefore very important to buy it 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.360
 very cheap 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.640
 an infusion after will continue very good 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.800
 price 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.810
 and apart from that it is much better to prevent 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.640
 Hair loss before it is 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.140
 too late 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.780
 green tea the truth is that it is very 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.020
 well they are taken as an infusion and 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.440
 is inclusion is more or less of this 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.400
 color with green inclusions 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.770
 depending on the preparation of the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.420
 product may be darker or 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.610
 less dark but more or less the 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.120
 infusion is usually this I advise 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:00.570
 take approximately between 3 or 4 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.459
 cups of green tea a day according 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.680
 which is during the day that is what 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.489
 advisable for 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.519
 to favor say our hair 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.340
 and avoid the fall of agreement then 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.590
 as I already told you, green tea is a 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.409
 authentic amino acid pump vitamins 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.290
 essentials and minerals for hair and 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:24.209
 apart it will reduce alpha 5 reductase 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.000
 so you already know what you have to 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.090
 make between 3 and 4 cups a day from 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.790
 green to prevent hair loss 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.819
 in the case that you are working for 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.280
 if it's a long time outside and you can not 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.379
 take or prepare tea infusions 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.019
 green during the day do not worry 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:46.170
 because you can also have tea 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.720
 green in capsules 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.520
 in agreement you can take green tea in 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.340
 capsules I was taking them 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.750
 in fact I usually take them that are 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.450
 you're from this brand because it 's the most 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.209
 pure that I've found so far and they're 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.900
 pills that you can take and take and 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.850
 they do exactly the same effect since 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.060
 contains an isolated extract of green tea 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.640
 and it is then taken with water with a juice with 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.980
 coffee with what you want so you do not have 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.780
 to go preparing infusions and other 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.160
 as I say this is the one that I have 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.489
 found in the market because it's the 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.130
 more pure and good if you are interested I leave you 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.260

 infusion and the take is like that during the day 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.470
 as I tell you to prevent the fall of 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.450
 hair is essential since the 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.040
 treatments once it has already fallen 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.800
 the hair is no longer anything to do or 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.100
 that it is better to take action as soon as possible
