00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.180
 today we will demonstrate the ganache of 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.180
 chocolate 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.480
 but on our channel we'll try not to 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.180
 help when these doubts 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.070
 Let's start with the cream 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.040
 cream that we use is the 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.470
 canister milk cream easy to be 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.210
 found in any supermarket in 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.850
 any region 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.100
 but the important thing in it is that it has 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.720
 a good consistency in quality 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.370
 quality of this cream has to 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.050
 be good 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.340
 Look at the assistance we have 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.789
 in it if it is the cream of milk that 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.460
 formal reduction was not so 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:54.160
 little consistency of the increase in 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.640
 amount of chocolate 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.620
 This is very important what we are going to 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.829
 do we go, I'm here, are you using 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.600
 the chocolate it is not pressed the 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.530
 chocolate like some people 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.520
 find but chocolate can be used 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.260
 fractioned 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.250
 I'm using chocolate here 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:18.040
 good white with the jingle beads because 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.509
 This makes it easier to melt the 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.579
 because I 'm going to melt the 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.960
 chocolate I'll mix the sour cream 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:28.869
 we could use the cream as well 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.130
 hot put the chocolate to melt in the 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.500
 hot cream 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.020
 we could use white chocolate 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.500
 melted and put the sour cream 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.570
 ice cream and mixing it also will 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.119
 transform in the garachico we here we go 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.750
 melt the chocolate that can be stopped 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.000
 in water bath or in drury or in the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.460
 microwave microwaves always having 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.979
 be careful that at the 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.649
 seconds to move so that there is no risk of 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.659
 burn chocolate, huh? 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.659
 and then we will mix the sour cream 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:13.100
 Here we already have our chocolate 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:16.490
 melted white chocolate already on 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.890
 melt I put and already melted and 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.180
 It's all melted. He's not 11 years old. 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.160
 and has nothing to be melted irritate 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.230
 completely melted and now we 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.230
 Let's mix the cream here. 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:57.950
 the white chocolate he has fat is 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.700
 much fat 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:07.500
 so same chocolate chocolate taste 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.650
 white is fat so it will stay 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.140
 seem to move more at first nor 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.750
 consistency is softer than the 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:21.750
 milk chocolate or medium chocolate 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:23.760
 bitter or blackwell mother then it goes 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.330
 get softer when we get 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.920
 it ready and preferably do and 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.940
 one day the other if we go 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.959
 used for filling and for 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.069
 same situation we've been through 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.250
 we use it on the day or give a 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:45.720
 Warm up in the microwave for him. 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:48.660
 stay light so do not mix it well 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.130
 milk chocolate with melted chocolate and 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.130
 then we will put it in the container 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.400
 we here with a quantity 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.480
 minimum is ganache we are doing 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.709
 for demonstration 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:18.019
 so we did not need a 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:20.959
 whole recipe is very important you 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.389
 try with your sour cream 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:29.830
 quality chocolate that you 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.830
 prefer to see how it is 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:46.110
 The same situation is that we 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:56.190
 you have it right still hot 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:05:02.389
 We're going to put him in the film. 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.389
 made to the desired grass grass 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:23.960
 now and now I think the film itself 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:25.190
 let's go and blanketed refrigerator is 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.820
 ready our chocolate ganache 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.820
 White 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.780
 We remember that here too 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:36.230
 we can taste our izar 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.510
 white chocolate ganache there and if we 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.000
 and flavors to it is important to 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.640
 people remember how it's going to be a juice 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.610
 will be an essence is 15 of some 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.840
 fruit an essence there we have to 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:52.280
 put a larger amount of 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.720
 chocolate and if it is to do is with paste 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.760
 how do you show a paste of 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.170
 for example there is no damask 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.240
 need can use the same 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.240
 recipe and just add it to the
