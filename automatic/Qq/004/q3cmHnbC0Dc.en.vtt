00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.950
 tomato salad 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.260
 and cucumber 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.100
 for the 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.670
 joselo's kitchen on youtube today Saturday 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:28.560
 August 18 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:28.560
 from 2012 2 hard red tomatoes 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.060
 of the same color both 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.520
 hard because there are tomatoes that come already 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.690
 crushed or open busted 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.690
 these are hard 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:53.100
 because for health you have to have a lot 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.230
 care the same with cucumber 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.629
 had taught that cucumbers here 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.630
 they come in almost different sizes but 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.040
 this allows me to use one per day 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.540
 and the dried oregano 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:10.610
 the salt obviously I'm going to proceed 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.610
 to cut into slices 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.560
 this cucumber 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.160
 sliced into slices 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.040
 to place it in the salad 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:35.340
 and add the oil and the same will do with 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.340
 the tomato that I will cut 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.930
 in pits 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.590
 obviously eliminating 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.320
 where the stem is born 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.300
 I'll keep the pulp with the seeds 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.880
 because that is part of him 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.190
 you're from this taste of the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.780
 salads and they have all the nutrients 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.430
 when it is that I am going to teach you 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.350
 step by step the cucumber 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.000
 with Shell 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.250
 because in the shell is the vitamin 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.830
 we have cut the first half 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.890
 and we have removed this part 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.270
 I am pointing with my finger 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.270
 in the first half 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.650
 what are the tips 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.530
 of the cucumber 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:36.530
 the tomato 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.530
 me cutting by the sides 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.420
 by the sides 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.720
 to get cuts I said that I liked the 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.520
 tomato red hard because it allows me 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.700
 keep the pulp in the cuts that I 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.110
 make him 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.110
 any tomato is good 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.430
 but if I have the possibility 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.260
 if I'm going to pay I can choose 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.750
 so that it is the best 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.460
 so that I can eat 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.210
 this is the tomato part 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.980
 where the stem grows 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.790
 that I eliminate from the 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.790
 tomatoes 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:31.730
 Well, as you will see in this part of 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.730
 the tomato and cucumber salad 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.490
 we have sliced the cucumbers and 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.980
 in pits 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.430
 Julian type to make a tenderloin 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.450
 jumped off 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.450
 the tomato 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.450
 and this one is only releasing a game 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.450
 the tomato is releasing a juice 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.170
 if we 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.099
 we will take advantage of that game with a little 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.099
 olive oil 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.920
 a little salt to taste 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.410
 and a bath of oregano 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.710
 this is going to save it 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.080
 in our freezer 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.169
 so that it stays fresh 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.780
 until serving time 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:55.770
 and all 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.639
 the ingredients are 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.480
 absorbing the taste 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:06.710
 before the game of this tomato 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.370
 see how the tomato remains firm 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.370
 firm 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.629
 juice of this tomato olive oil 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:19.139
 the salt and bath of oregano is after 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:22.990
 the salad that I wanted to show you 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:26.409
 tomato with cucumber for this channel of the 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.819
 joselo's kitchen on youtube 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.820
 I will also take advantage of it since I am in 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:34.070
 the part of salads 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.070
 who had taught them the crowns of 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:40.200
 Romaine lettuce 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.720
 these are some lettuces that sell here 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.889
 and in other places perhaps with another name 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.370
 I have met here 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:51.210
 big clean 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.210
 without earth 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.730
 beautiful lettuce 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:03.120
 they have two in each pack 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:06.080
 well I use I have used 5 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.080
 5 leaves 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.870
 they are things of these 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:17.460
 5 leaves of these lettuces 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:19.409
 to wash them one more time although it was not 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.810
 necessary because they are bio-gardens I think 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:23.810
 according to this brand that I bought 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.790
 and the secret that I was taught that 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.340
 the lettuce is not cut with a knife 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:35.580
 cut by hand as I want 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.180
 Savor the lettuce then cut pieces 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.180
 generous 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:44.380
 like at home they do not like lettuce 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:46.860
 tomato and cucumber together 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.849
 well simply 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.849
 separated her 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.840
 the lake 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.840
 drain it 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.180
 I put them in the bowl where I'll do the 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:05.180
 salad 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.879
 the salad that is 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.530
 I have two salads I wanted to teach them 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:21.389
 only the tomato and cucumber but in a 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:24.330
 so we can have both is 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:26.400
 in the mix each person will be served in 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.590
 his plate 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.350
 and will season it 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:35.150
 the line to your liking with the oil of 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:38.280
 olive the salt another will add vinegar 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:41.270
 As you will see, I have stayed with the 

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.270
 cucumber tips 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.570
 with tomato tips 

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:51.640
 and so we present this video 

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:54.990
 tomato and cucumber salad for the 

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.990
 joselo's kitchen on youtube
