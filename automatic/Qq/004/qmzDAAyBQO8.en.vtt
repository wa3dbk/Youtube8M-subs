00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.070 
get in the higher level you go up to I
think<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.760> level<00:02:47.910> goes<00:02:48.150> up<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.420> 99<00:02:48.720> but

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
think the level goes up to 99 but

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.479 
think the level goes up to 99 but
basically<00:02:49.410> when<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.680> go<00:02:49.890> up<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.100> level<00:02:50.220> your

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
basically when you go up a level your

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.259 
basically when you go up a level your
unlock<00:02:50.880> like<00:02:51.680> extra<00:02:52.680> weapons<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.220> use<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.819> in

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
unlock like extra weapons to use in in

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.460 
unlock like extra weapons to use in in
them<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.560> game<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:55.980> different<00:02:56.819> costumes

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
them in the game and different costumes

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.640 
them in the game and different costumes
so<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:59.720> didn't<00:03:00.720> unlock<00:03:00.930> anything<00:03:01.230> even<00:03:01.530> though

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
so I didn't unlock anything even though

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.780 
so I didn't unlock anything even though
