you<00:00:48.770> take<00:00:48.950> that<00:00:49.129> same<00:00:49.430> pond<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.090> add<00:00:50.540> a

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
you take that same pond and add a

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.350 
you take that same pond and add a
sufficient<00:00:51.620> number<00:00:51.830> of<00:00:51.860> jets<00:00:52.129> to<00:00:52.339> it<00:00:52.460> come

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
sufficient number of jets to it come

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.820 
sufficient number of jets to it come
back<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.540> week<00:00:53.780> later<00:00:53.839> and<00:00:54.170> those<00:00:54.440> fish<00:00:54.680> are

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
back a week later and those fish are

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.740 
back a week later and those fish are
constantly<00:00:55.370> swimming<00:00:55.640> back<00:00:55.970> and<00:00:56.000> forth<00:00:56.239> it

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
constantly swimming back and forth it

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.630 
constantly swimming back and forth it
changes<00:00:57.290> their<00:00:57.440> whole<00:00:57.470> personalities<00:00:58.400> it

makes life exciting for them and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.290 
makes life exciting for them and
encourage<00:01:01.339> the<00:01:01.489> pond<00:01:01.699> is<00:01:01.850> extremely

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
encourage the pond is extremely

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.810 
encourage the pond is extremely
important<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:03.620> second<00:01:04.040> thing<00:01:04.159> jets<00:01:04.430> do<00:01:04.640> is

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
important the second thing jets do is

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.090 
important the second thing jets do is
they<00:01:04.970> add<00:01:05.089> oxygen<00:01:05.360> to<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.870> pond<00:01:06.110> being

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
they add oxygen to the pond being

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.770 
they add oxygen to the pond being
positioned<00:01:07.430> about<00:01:07.790> 12<00:01:08.150> inches<00:01:08.270> below<00:01:08.510> the

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
positioned about 12 inches below the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.660 
positioned about 12 inches below the
surface<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:09.320> gently<00:01:09.710> coming<00:01:10.010> up<00:01:10.190> and<00:01:10.340> rolling

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
surface and gently coming up and rolling

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.719 
surface and gently coming up and rolling
the<00:01:10.790> surface<00:01:11.210> it<00:01:11.870> picks<00:01:12.200> up<00:01:12.320> oxygen<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.159> it's<00:01:13.610> a

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
the surface it picks up oxygen so it's a

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.149 
the surface it picks up oxygen so it's a
real<00:01:13.909> asset<00:01:14.150> to<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.540> pond<00:01:14.750> in<00:01:14.870> that<00:01:14.990> sense<00:01:15.260> but

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
real asset to the pond in that sense but

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.730 
real asset to the pond in that sense but
also<00:01:16.220> Jets<00:01:17.210> will<00:01:17.420> make<00:01:17.600> your<00:01:17.780> skimmer<00:01:18.080> much

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
also Jets will make your skimmer much

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.920 
also Jets will make your skimmer much
more<00:01:18.979> efficient<00:01:19.460> if<00:01:19.610> you<00:01:20.180> get<00:01:20.360> a<00:01:20.390> well-placed

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
more efficient if you get a well-placed

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.960 
more efficient if you get a well-placed
skimmer<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:21.560> then<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:22.370> get<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.640> proper

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
skimmer and then you get the proper

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.970 
skimmer and then you get the proper
number<00:01:23.000> of<00:01:23.360> jets<00:01:23.600> in<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:23.750> pond<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.260> all<00:01:24.830> these

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
number of jets in the pond and all these

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.890 
number of jets in the pond and all these
Jets<00:01:25.310> are<00:01:25.460> gently<00:01:25.880> pushing<00:01:26.360> from<00:01:26.600> one<00:01:26.750> to

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
Jets are gently pushing from one to

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.570 
Jets are gently pushing from one to
another<00:01:26.930> and<00:01:27.410> having<00:01:27.980> all<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.250> debris

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
another and having all the debris

another and having all the debris
collect<00:01:29.270> in<00:01:29.390> front<00:01:29.600> of<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:29.720> skimmer<00:01:29.990> it'll

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
collect in front of the skimmer it'll

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.930 
collect in front of the skimmer it'll
make<00:01:30.980> your<00:01:31.100> skimmer<00:01:31.400> again<00:01:31.730> much<00:01:31.910> more

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
make your skimmer again much more

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.870 
make your skimmer again much more
effective<00:01:33.040> proper<00:01:34.040> placement<00:01:34.310> of<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.640> Jets

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
effective proper placement of the Jets

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.390 
effective proper placement of the Jets
is<00:01:35.060> very<00:01:35.270> important<00:01:35.810> what<00:01:36.620> you<00:01:36.770> want<00:01:36.950> to<00:01:37.040> do<00:01:37.220> is

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
is very important what you want to do is

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.520 
is very important what you want to do is
put<00:01:37.670> enough<00:01:37.940> jets<00:01:38.300> in<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:38.660> pond<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:39.260> place

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
put enough jets in the pond and place

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.500 
put enough jets in the pond and place
them<00:01:39.740> properly<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.370> again<00:01:40.850> they<00:01:41.330> will

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
them properly so that again they will

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.900 
them properly so that again they will
move<00:01:41.690> everything<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.350> skimmer<00:01:42.610> we<00:01:43.610> find

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
move everything to the skimmer we find

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.670 
move everything to the skimmer we find
that<00:01:44.060> placing<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.540> Jets<00:01:44.780> approximately<00:01:45.410> 12

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
that placing the Jets approximately 12

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.020 
that placing the Jets approximately 12
inches<00:01:45.770> underneath<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.430> surface<00:01:46.640> of<00:01:46.940> the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
inches underneath the surface of the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.360 
inches underneath the surface of the
water<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:47.510> then<00:01:48.410> adjusting<00:01:48.920> them<00:01:49.070> so<00:01:49.250> they

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
water and then adjusting them so they

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.760 
water and then adjusting them so they
come<00:01:49.580> up<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:49.820> gently<00:01:50.000> push<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.450> surface<00:01:50.990> you

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
come up and gently push the surface you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.830 
come up and gently push the surface you
need<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:52.040> place<00:01:52.250> them<00:01:52.430> about<00:01:52.700> once<00:01:52.970> every<00:01:53.120> 7

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
need to place them about once every 7

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.440 
need to place them about once every 7
feet<00:01:54.080> because<00:01:54.770> one<00:01:55.040> jet<00:01:55.310> will<00:01:55.490> push<00:01:55.670> about<00:01:56.000> 7

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
feet because one jet will push about 7

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.970

through<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.140> Jets<00:02:12.410> so<00:02:13.220> what<00:02:13.459> you<00:02:13.580> want<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.849> do

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
through the Jets so what you want to do

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.250 
through the Jets so what you want to do
is<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.269> want<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.480> use<00:02:14.629> those<00:02:14.810> Jets<00:02:15.140> as

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
is you want to use those Jets as

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.500 
is you want to use those Jets as
efficiently<00:02:15.680> as<00:02:15.739> you<00:02:15.800> can<00:02:15.940> by<00:02:16.940> placing<00:02:17.360> them

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
efficiently as you can by placing them

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.030 
efficiently as you can by placing them
12<00:02:17.750> inches<00:02:18.019> underneath<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:18.500> surface<00:02:18.709> and

12 inches underneath the surface and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.460 
12 inches underneath the surface and
having<00:02:19.370> them<00:02:19.459> come<00:02:19.670> up<00:02:19.730> again<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.659> adds<00:02:20.810> oxygen

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
having them come up again it adds oxygen

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.100 
having them come up again it adds oxygen
it<00:02:21.620> makes<00:02:21.800> your<00:02:21.920> skimmer<00:02:22.129> more<00:02:22.400> efficient

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
it makes your skimmer more efficient

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.720 
it makes your skimmer more efficient
placing<00:02:24.110> Jets<00:02:24.349> down<00:02:24.650> in<00:02:24.980> an<00:02:25.129> effort<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.519> try<00:02:25.700> to

move water on the bottom of the pond

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.010 
move water on the bottom of the pond
it's<00:02:28.280> just<00:02:28.550> that<00:02:28.730> it's<00:02:29.270> almost<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.690> waste<00:02:29.840> of

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
it's just that it's almost a waste of

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.380 
it's just that it's almost a waste of
time<00:02:30.260> when<00:02:30.980> you<00:02:31.130> get<00:02:31.340> down<00:02:31.490> four<00:02:31.819> or<00:02:31.910> five<00:02:32.090> feet

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
time when you get down four or five feet

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.130 
time when you get down four or five feet
there's<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:32.900> much

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
there's so much

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.290 
there's so much
head<00:02:33.290> pressure<00:02:33.590> from<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:34.520> water<00:02:34.790> pushing

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
head pressure from this water pushing

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.780 
head pressure from this water pushing
down<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.350> Jets<00:02:36.620> are<00:02:36.890> virtually

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
down that the Jets are virtually

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.870 
down that the Jets are virtually
ineffective<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:39.130> so<00:02:40.130> again<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.640> placement

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
ineffective and so again the placement

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.360 
ineffective and so again the placement
is<00:02:41.209> very<00:02:41.270> important<00:02:41.930> have<00:02:42.200> them<00:02:42.440> justice<00:02:43.190> so

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
is very important have them justice so

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.590 
is very important have them justice so
that<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:43.580> can<00:02:43.730> send<00:02:43.970> them<00:02:44.120> up<00:02:44.300> toward<00:02:44.569> the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
that you can send them up toward the

that you can send them up toward the
surface<00:02:45.190> we<00:02:46.190> like<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.550> use<00:02:46.819> either<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.300> mozzie

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
surface we like to use either a mozzie

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.830 
surface we like to use either a mozzie
jet<00:02:48.230> or<00:02:48.410> eductor<00:02:48.890> type<00:02:49.250> Jets<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:49.850> we<00:02:50.570> put<00:02:50.750> them

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
jet or eductor type Jets and we put them

predict what's going to happen is is is
very<00:02:58.010> hard<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.430> do<00:02:58.610> by<00:02:59.330> placing<00:02:59.840> these<00:02:59.959> jets

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
very hard to do by placing these jets

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.550 
very hard to do by placing these jets
into<00:03:01.090> with<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.239> swivels<00:03:02.630> on<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:02.930> just<00:03:03.319> under

into with the swivels on it just under

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.590 
into with the swivels on it just under
the<00:03:03.590> surface<00:03:03.860> what<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:04.940> allows<00:03:05.180> you<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.450> do

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
the surface what that allows you to do

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.930 
the surface what that allows you to do
is<00:03:05.780> is<00:03:05.989> once<00:03:06.320> you<00:03:06.470> start<00:03:06.500> up<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:06.860> pond<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.760> can

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
is is once you start up the pond you can

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.910 
is is once you start up the pond you can
fine-tune<00:03:08.209> it<00:03:08.600> if<00:03:08.750> you've<00:03:09.380> got<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.590> little<00:03:09.739> bit

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
fine-tune it if you've got a little bit

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.229 
fine-tune it if you've got a little bit
of<00:03:10.040> debris<00:03:10.220> collecting<00:03:10.700> in<00:03:10.820> this<00:03:10.910> corner<00:03:11.209> you

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
of debris collecting in this corner you

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.240 
of debris collecting in this corner you
can<00:03:11.480> turn<00:03:11.630> it<00:03:11.780> over<00:03:11.989> that<00:03:12.110> direction<00:03:12.320> if<00:03:13.040> you

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
can turn it over that direction if you

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.500 
can turn it over that direction if you
need<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.580> you<00:03:13.700> can<00:03:13.820> push<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:14.120> more<00:03:14.300> to<00:03:14.450> the

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
need to you can push it more to the

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.930 
need to you can push it more to the
middle<00:03:14.750> but<00:03:15.410> having<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.830> Jets<00:03:16.070> on<00:03:16.250> swivels<00:03:16.760> is

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
middle but having the Jets on swivels is

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.380 
middle but having the Jets on swivels is
extremely<00:03:17.900> important
