centerpiece<00:01:21.290> of<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.619> car<00:01:21.830> I've<00:01:22.280> actually

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
centerpiece of the car I've actually

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.630 
centerpiece of the car I've actually
researched<00:01:23.210> this<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:23.630> saw<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:23.990> video<00:01:24.260> from<00:01:24.800> on

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
researched this and saw a video from on

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.749 
researched this and saw a video from on
the<00:01:25.850> Food<00:01:26.149> Network<00:01:27.280> they<00:01:28.280> actually<00:01:28.580> did<00:01:28.729> a

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
the Food Network they actually did a

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.690 
the Food Network they actually did a
test<00:01:29.119> about<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.750> and<00:01:29.960> stuff<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.500> I<00:01:31.250> think<00:01:31.610> it

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
test about it and stuff and I think it

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.109 
test about it and stuff and I think it
turned<00:01:31.850> out<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.149> like<00:01:32.590> 326<00:01:33.590> licks<00:01:33.950> but<00:01:34.850> it<00:01:34.970> also

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
turned out to like 326 licks but it also

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.060 
turned out to like 326 licks but it also
depends<00:01:35.660> on<00:01:35.750> how<00:01:35.810> what<00:01:36.200> your<00:01:36.440> client<00:01:36.830> is<00:01:36.890> how

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
depends on how what your client is how

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.740 
depends on how what your client is how
big<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:37.520> is<00:01:37.640> how<00:01:37.970> much<00:01:38.210> pressure<00:01:38.539> you're

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
big it is how much pressure you're

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.380 
big it is how much pressure you're
putting<00:01:38.869> lots<00:01:39.320> of<00:01:39.470> bullshit<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:40.250> like<00:01:41.149> sin
