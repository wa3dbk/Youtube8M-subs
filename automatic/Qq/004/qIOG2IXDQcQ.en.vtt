when you are building with the potion of

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.489 
when you are building with the potion of
swiftness<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.839> increases<00:01:00.839> your<00:01:00.870> building

think<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.080> doubles<00:01:04.500> its<00:01:04.620> building<00:01:04.890> speed

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
think it just doubles its building speed
