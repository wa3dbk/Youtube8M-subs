cautious and your approach you approach
the<00:01:01.330> target<00:01:01.540> very<00:01:02.380> nicely<00:01:02.650> as<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:04.239> target

the target very nicely as the target
gets<00:01:04.930> closer<00:01:05.320> that's<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.370> pressure<00:01:06.610> time

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
gets closer that's the pressure time

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.940 
gets closer that's the pressure time
that's<00:01:07.360> where<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.960> pressure<00:01:08.170> all<00:01:08.470> builds<00:01:08.830> up

that's where the pressure all builds up

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.100 
that's where the pressure all builds up
and<00:01:09.160> this<00:01:09.670> is<00:01:09.880> a<00:01:09.910> time<00:01:10.210> you<00:01:10.450> can't<00:01:10.720> leave<00:01:10.930> it
