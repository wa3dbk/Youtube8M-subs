00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.000 
but this whole this whole quarter panel
is<00:00:33.180> just<00:00:33.210> filled<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.840> with<00:00:33.960> bondo<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.829> knew

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
is just filled in with bondo and I knew

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.310 
is just filled in with bondo and I knew
that<00:00:35.309> already

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
that already

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.979 
that already
it's<00:00:37.320> more<00:00:37.500> bondo<00:00:37.860> here<00:00:38.600> it's<00:00:39.600> trying<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.899> get

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
it's more bondo here it's trying to get

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.540 
it's more bondo here it's trying to get
it<00:00:40.140> all<00:00:40.260> shipped<00:00:41.040> away<00:00:41.450> to<00:00:42.450> determine<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:43.550> I'm

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
it all shipped away to determine if I'm

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.090 
it all shipped away to determine if I'm
gonna<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.000> end<00:00:45.180> up<00:00:45.329> replacing<00:00:45.600> those

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
gonna have to end up replacing those

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.810 
gonna have to end up replacing those
lower<00:00:47.100> quarter<00:00:47.910> panels<00:00:48.440> which<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.770> do<00:00:49.950> it's

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
lower quarter panels which I can do it's

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.720 
lower quarter panels which I can do it's
kind<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.090> expensive<00:00:53.539> but<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.730> just

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
kind of expensive but I can do it just

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.000 
kind of expensive but I can do it just
depends<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.149> if<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.420> want<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.859> restore<00:00:58.859> this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
depends on if I want to restore this

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.410 
depends on if I want to restore this
thing<00:00:59.250> or<00:00:59.460> if<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.609> want<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.879> turn<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.059> into<00:01:00.329> a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
thing or if I want to turn it into a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.070 
thing or if I want to turn it into a
crawler<00:01:02.059> it<00:01:03.059> might<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.329> cheaper<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.719> turn<00:01:03.960> it

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
crawler it might be cheaper to turn it

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.320 
crawler it might be cheaper to turn it
into<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.290> crawler<00:01:04.909> but<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.970> did<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> little

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
into a crawler but I did a little

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.620 
into a crawler but I did a little
stabbing<00:01:06.840> over<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:08.090> it's<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.240> quite<00:01:09.420> as

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
stabbing over here and it's not quite as

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.210 
stabbing over here and it's not quite as
bad<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.170> if<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.380> get<00:01:10.560> real<00:01:10.770> close

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
bad but if you get real close

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.670 
bad but if you get real close
you<00:01:12.670> can<00:01:12.850> see<00:01:13.120> where<00:01:13.810> it<00:01:13.900> was<00:01:13.960> pretty<00:01:14.230> rusty

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
you can see where it was pretty rusty

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.590 
you can see where it was pretty rusty
and<00:01:16.230> looks<00:01:17.230> like<00:01:17.380> someone<00:01:17.770> just<00:01:17.950> kind<00:01:18.190> of

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
and looks like someone just kind of

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.970 
and looks like someone just kind of
ground<00:01:19.600> it<00:01:19.750> down<00:01:19.930> enough<00:01:20.260> that<00:01:20.800> they<00:01:20.920> could

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
ground it down enough that they could

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.220 
ground it down enough that they could
fit<00:01:21.310> some<00:01:21.520> bondo<00:01:21.910> all<00:01:22.060> in<00:01:22.270> you<00:01:22.810> see<00:01:22.990> where<00:01:23.140> the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
fit some bondo all in you see where the

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:29.730 
fit some bondo all in you see where the
bondo<00:01:23.530> is<00:01:23.620> all<00:01:23.710> broken<00:01:24.130> in<00:01:24.220> here<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:29.560> I<00:01:29.710> said

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
bondo is all broken in here like I said

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.150 
bondo is all broken in here like I said
these<00:01:30.070> lower<00:01:30.280> quarter<00:01:30.670> panels<00:01:31.000> can<00:01:31.210> be

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
these lower quarter panels can be

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.230 
these lower quarter panels can be
replaced<00:01:33.630> all<00:01:34.630> you<00:01:34.810> have<00:01:34.930> to<00:01:35.020> do<00:01:35.170> is<00:01:35.350> just

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
replaced all you have to do is just

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.940 
replaced all you have to do is just
break<00:01:37.240> all<00:01:37.450> this<00:01:37.600> crap<00:01:37.900> out<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:38.380> then<00:01:38.830> you've

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
break all this crap out and then you've

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.550 
break all this crap out and then you've
got<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.160> line<00:01:39.430> right<00:01:39.610> there<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:39.880> just<00:01:40.500> sawed<00:01:41.500> it

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
got a line right there and just sawed it

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.840 
got a line right there and just sawed it
off<00:01:41.680> with<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.550> sawzall<00:01:43.000> and<00:01:44.550> then<00:01:45.550> you<00:01:45.700> would

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
off with the sawzall and then you would

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.840 
off with the sawzall and then you would
weld<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.240> weld<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.690> new<00:01:46.840> ones<00:01:47.020> in

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
weld and weld the new ones in

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.050 
weld and weld the new ones in
I<00:01:50.880> think<00:01:51.880> these<00:01:52.060> doors<00:01:52.330> are<00:01:52.479> pretty<00:01:52.660> solid<00:01:54.060> but

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
I think these doors are pretty solid but

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:10.859 
I think these doors are pretty solid but
the<00:01:55.180> only<00:01:55.300> way<00:01:55.450> to<00:01:55.510> really<00:01:55.720> know<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:09.720> little<00:02:10.720> bit

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
the only way to really know a little bit

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.730 
the only way to really know a little bit
more<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:13.420> know<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.690> best<00:02:13.840> way<00:02:13.990> really<00:02:14.110> is<00:02:14.530> to

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
more you know the best way really is to

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.910 
more you know the best way really is to
get<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.670> magnet<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.620> don't<00:02:17.620> know<00:02:17.709> where<00:02:17.830> my

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
get a magnet I don't know where my

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:28.620 
get a magnet I don't know where my
magnet<00:02:18.340> is<00:02:26.760> door<00:02:27.760> feels<00:02:28.000> like<00:02:28.180> it's<00:02:28.330> mostly

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
magnet is door feels like it's mostly

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.390 
magnet is door feels like it's mostly
solid<00:02:29.760> I'm<00:02:30.760> not<00:02:31.030> too<00:02:31.209> worried<00:02:31.450> about<00:02:31.510> doors

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
solid I'm not too worried about doors

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.830 
solid I'm not too worried about doors
there<00:02:33.400> if<00:02:33.880> I<00:02:33.970> turn<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.330> into<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.510> crawler

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
there if I turn it into a crawler

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.270 
there if I turn it into a crawler
they're<00:02:35.110> going<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.290> disappear<00:02:35.739> probably

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
they're going to disappear probably

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:47.190 
they're going to disappear probably
anyway<00:02:36.690> or<00:02:37.690> at<00:02:37.930> least<00:02:39.120> somewhat

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.190 

yeah<00:02:48.200> there's<00:02:48.620> a<00:02:48.770> chunk<00:02:49.130> of<00:02:49.720> rest<00:02:50.720> right<00:02:50.960> there

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
yeah there's a chunk of rest right there

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.060 
yeah there's a chunk of rest right there
under<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:51.500> fender

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.470 

now<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.130> fenders<00:02:56.560> they<00:02:57.560> had<00:02:58.330> originally<00:02:59.330> out

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
now the fenders they had originally out

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.180 
now the fenders they had originally out
of<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.690> factory<00:03:00.110> I<00:03:00.170> did<00:03:00.410> some<00:03:00.650> research<00:03:00.830> on

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
of the factory I did some research on

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.570 
of the factory I did some research on
this

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
this

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.290 
this
these<00:03:02.390> Broncos<00:03:02.900> some<00:03:03.140> of<00:03:03.290> them<00:03:03.410> came<00:03:03.650> with

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
these Broncos some of them came with

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.680 
these Broncos some of them came with
molded<00:03:05.300> fiberglass<00:03:07.120> fender<00:03:08.120> flares<00:03:08.390> that

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
molded fiberglass fender flares that

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.530 
molded fiberglass fender flares that
were<00:03:08.780> real<00:03:08.990> small<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:09.710> you<00:03:10.010> can<00:03:10.160> see<00:03:10.540> they

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
were real small and you can see they

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.280 
were real small and you can see they
filed<00:03:11.810> along<00:03:12.080> this<00:03:12.290> body<00:03:12.560> line<00:03:12.830> here<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.930> went

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
filed along this body line here and went

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.640 
filed along this body line here and went
up<00:03:15.350> all<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.950> way<00:03:16.040> around<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.750> that<00:03:17.780> was<00:03:18.470> out

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
up all the way around and that was out

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.680 
up all the way around and that was out
of<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.830> factory<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.550> I<00:03:20.440> can<00:03:21.440> tell<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:23.510> these

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
of the factory and I can tell that these

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.620 
of the factory and I can tell that these
fenders<00:03:23.930> have<00:03:24.170> not<00:03:24.290> been<00:03:24.500> cut<00:03:24.740> because

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
fenders have not been cut because

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.550 
fenders have not been cut because
there's<00:03:26.630> what's<00:03:26.840> left<00:03:27.080> of<00:03:27.200> one<00:03:27.380> of<00:03:27.470> the

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
there's what's left of one of the

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.140 
there's what's left of one of the
original<00:03:27.650> rivet<00:03:28.220> holes<00:03:30.010> there's<00:03:31.010> one<00:03:31.220> right

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
original rivet holes there's one right

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.600 
original rivet holes there's one right
there<00:03:32.390> you<00:03:32.570> know<00:03:32.660> they're<00:03:32.840> all<00:03:32.960> along<00:03:33.610> these

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
there you know they're all along these

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.980 
there you know they're all along these
fenders<00:03:34.850> are<00:03:35.060> pretty<00:03:35.270> trashed<00:03:35.630> anyway<00:03:36.220> I<00:03:37.990> for

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
fenders are pretty trashed anyway I for

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.770 
fenders are pretty trashed anyway I for
Christmas<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.560> have<00:03:39.800> asked<00:03:40.280> for<00:03:40.490> a<00:03:40.940> grinder<00:03:41.450> of

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
Christmas I have asked for a grinder of

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.620 
Christmas I have asked for a grinder of
real<00:03:42.350> one<00:03:42.560> because<00:03:42.680> I've<00:03:42.890> got<00:03:43.040> one<00:03:43.330> an<00:03:44.330> air

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
real one because I've got one an air

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.350 
real one because I've got one an air
controlled<00:03:45.080> grinder<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:46.760> my<00:03:46.850> compressor

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
controlled grinder and my compressor

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.310 
controlled grinder and my compressor
can't<00:03:47.600> really<00:03:48.220> keep<00:03:49.220> up<00:03:49.959> because<00:03:50.959> it's<00:03:51.260> a

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
can't really keep up because it's a

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.010 
can't really keep up because it's a
homemade<00:03:51.650> compressor<00:03:52.270> but<00:03:53.270> anyway<00:03:53.510> if<00:03:53.690> I<00:03:53.810> get

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
homemade compressor but anyway if I get

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.490 
homemade compressor but anyway if I get
that<00:03:54.500> grinder<00:03:55.390> then<00:03:56.390> I'll<00:03:56.600> be<00:03:56.720> able<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:56.959> get<00:03:57.470> a

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
that grinder then I'll be able to get a

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.550 
that grinder then I'll be able to get a
lot<00:03:57.680> more<00:03:57.709> done<00:03:58.720> as<00:03:59.720> far<00:03:59.959> as<00:03:59.990> cutting<00:04:00.470> away

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
lot more done as far as cutting away

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.790 
lot more done as far as cutting away
some<00:04:00.830> of<00:04:00.890> this<00:04:01.010> rust<00:04:01.310> and<00:04:02.530> figuring<00:04:03.530> out<00:04:03.620> where

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
some of this rust and figuring out where

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.610 
some of this rust and figuring out where
I<00:04:03.830> want<00:04:04.070> to<00:04:04.100> go<00:04:04.250> from<00:04:04.459> there<00:04:05.740> so<00:04:08.320> this<00:04:09.320> is<00:04:09.470> going

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
I want to go from there so this is going

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.090 
I want to go from there so this is going
to<00:04:09.680> be<00:04:09.860> Branko<00:04:10.820> equals<00:04:11.270> rust

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
to be Branko equals rust

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.610 
to be Branko equals rust
101<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:13.750> that<00:04:14.750> was<00:04:14.870> common<00:04:15.200> on<00:04:15.290> these<00:04:15.410> old

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
101 and that was common on these old

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.560 
101 and that was common on these old
Broncos<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.640> be<00:04:16.790> real<00:04:17.000> rusty<00:04:17.650> so<00:04:19.419> that's<00:04:20.419> why

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
Broncos to be real rusty so that's why

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
Broncos to be real rusty so that's why
parts<00:04:20.959> are<00:04:21.140> available<00:04:22.270> not<00:04:23.270> cheap<00:04:23.590> definitely

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
parts are available not cheap definitely

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.309 
parts are available not cheap definitely
not<00:04:24.740> cheap<00:04:25.120> but<00:04:26.120> available

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:30.319 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:32.950 

I<00:04:30.969> may<00:04:31.969> have<00:04:32.059> already<00:04:32.210> showed<00:04:32.539> you<00:04:32.659> all<00:04:32.749> this

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
I may have already showed you all this

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.409 
I may have already showed you all this
but<00:04:33.229> here's<00:04:33.860> another<00:04:34.569> spot<00:04:35.569> of<00:04:35.749> particularly

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
but here's another spot of particularly

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:43.359 
but here's another spot of particularly
nasty<00:04:38.419> rust<00:04:41.080> and<00:04:42.080> it<00:04:42.469> was<00:04:42.559> a<00:04:42.589> common<00:04:42.979> spot<00:04:43.189> on

00:04:43.359 --> 00:04:43.369 
nasty rust and it was a common spot on

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:46.570 
nasty rust and it was a common spot on
these<00:04:43.520> Broncos<00:04:43.999> to<00:04:44.180> rust<00:04:44.389> out<00:04:45.490> you<00:04:46.490> know

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
these Broncos to rust out you know

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.339 
these Broncos to rust out you know
obviously<00:04:47.059> this<00:04:47.240> sides<00:04:47.509> completely<00:04:48.020> rested

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
obviously this sides completely rested

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:50.739 
obviously this sides completely rested
through<00:04:48.619> the<00:04:49.460> other<00:04:49.639> side<00:04:49.939> is<00:04:50.119> not<00:04:50.270> quite<00:04:50.569> so

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:50.749 
through the other side is not quite so

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:56.820 
through the other side is not quite so
bad<00:04:54.009> but<00:04:55.009> I'll<00:04:55.580> definitely<00:04:55.789> find<00:04:56.389> a<00:04:56.509> way<00:04:56.539> to

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
bad but I'll definitely find a way to

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.269 
bad but I'll definitely find a way to
fix<00:04:57.830> it

00:04:58.269 --> 00:04:58.279 
fix it

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:02.350 
fix it
probably<00:04:58.969> just<00:05:00.430> torch<00:05:01.430> it<00:05:01.610> out<00:05:01.729> and<00:05:01.969> weld<00:05:02.180> in<00:05:02.330> a

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
probably just torch it out and weld in a

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:10.109 
probably just torch it out and weld in a
new<00:05:02.539> new<00:05:03.050> piece<00:05:03.319> there<00:05:04.029> because<00:05:07.119> the<00:05:08.119> door

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:10.119 
new new piece there because the door

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:12.549 
new new piece there because the door
when<00:05:11.119> you<00:05:11.149> lift<00:05:11.419> it<00:05:11.539> up<00:05:11.659> and<00:05:11.809> down<00:05:11.990> it's<00:05:12.319> kind

00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:12.559 
when you lift it up and down it's kind

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:20.339 
when you lift it up and down it's kind
of<00:05:12.680> loose<00:05:13.509> but<00:05:14.509> anyway<00:05:15.580> should<00:05:16.580> be<00:05:16.699> a<00:05:16.729> fun<00:05:16.969> ride

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:24.369 

but<00:05:21.349> you<00:05:21.529> know<00:05:21.649> I<00:05:22.779> decided<00:05:23.779> to<00:05:24.020> go<00:05:24.139> on<00:05:24.229> ahead

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:24.379 
but you know I decided to go on ahead

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:26.260 
but you know I decided to go on ahead
and<00:05:24.529> switch<00:05:24.949> it<00:05:24.979> back<00:05:25.279> to<00:05:25.339> black<00:05:25.610> for<00:05:25.999> just<00:05:26.149> a

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
and switch it back to black for just a

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.499 
and switch it back to black for just a
little<00:05:26.509> bit<00:05:26.719> I<00:05:26.930> know<00:05:27.139> it<00:05:27.349> was<00:05:27.469> a<00:05:27.499> waste<00:05:27.740> of<00:05:27.949> a

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:28.509 
little bit I know it was a waste of a

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:32.889 
little bit I know it was a waste of a
99-cent<00:05:29.509> can<00:05:30.139> of<00:05:30.289> paint<00:05:31.479> but<00:05:32.479> I<00:05:32.509> don't<00:05:32.749> really

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:32.899 
99-cent can of paint but I don't really

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:37.600 
99-cent can of paint but I don't really
care<00:05:33.849> I'm<00:05:34.849> going<00:05:34.969> to<00:05:35.059> end<00:05:35.180> up<00:05:36.399> grinding<00:05:37.399> it<00:05:37.490> all

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
care I'm going to end up grinding it all

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.549 
care I'm going to end up grinding it all
off<00:05:37.819> anyway<00:05:38.330> that<00:05:38.719> door<00:05:38.899> didn't<00:05:39.139> come<00:05:39.289> out<00:05:39.409> too

00:05:39.549 --> 00:05:39.559 
off anyway that door didn't come out too

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:40.929
