00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.030

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.270
 horses and all that 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.390
 this combination of colors and good 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.490
 guys the truth is that I liked this 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.020
 this program because for example you 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.270
 they are there the post of hunger are there 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.640
 playing and if they want games by 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.190
 example a non-arc and of flying are going to 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.739
 minecraft and we focused on 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.630
 seconds to put on and quickly 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.300
 we are going to put it here and we are going to put 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.970
 what is in 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.460
 weapons and filled we will give it in arc 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.560
 and that's how karate the bow is like 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.650
 what I liked, I loved it because in my 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.300
 case my friends forget a lot that they are 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.580
 the storage rooms and apart is very good 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.130
 because then you can put the game and what 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.800
 you can put here next and it does not matter 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.910
 not because playing is very good and good 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.010

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.930
