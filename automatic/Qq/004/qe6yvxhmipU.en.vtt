grind all the time by the horse just to
get<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.459> thickness<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.000> enough<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:39.170> can

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
get the thickness and enough so you can

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.469 
get the thickness and enough so you can
get<00:01:39.590> you<00:01:39.729> luck<00:01:40.729> not<00:01:41.390> inside<00:01:42.940> someplace<00:01:43.940> a<00:01:44.119> lot

get you luck not inside someplace a lot
of<00:01:44.599> grinding<00:01:44.780> but<00:01:45.190> is<00:01:46.190> better<00:01:46.750> for<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.840> reels

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
of grinding but is better for the reels

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.690 
of grinding but is better for the reels
that<00:01:48.259> you<00:01:48.470> gotta<00:01:48.649> cut<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.099> little<00:01:49.369> tips

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
that you gotta cut the little tips

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.600 
that you gotta cut the little tips
inside<00:01:50.149> is<00:01:50.450> like<00:01:50.750> a<00:01:50.780> folder<00:01:51.289> thing<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.429> when

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
inside is like a folder thing so when

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.359 
inside is like a folder thing so when
you<00:01:52.700> turn<00:01:52.910> the<00:01:53.090> knob<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:53.690> hole<00:01:54.500> realtor<00:01:55.099> won't

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
you turn the knob the hole realtor won't

you turn the knob the hole realtor won't
spin<00:01:55.729> same<00:01:56.569> make<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.229> sharpie<00:01:57.739> point<00:01:58.039> on<00:01:58.399> it

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
spin same make a sharpie point on it

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.490 
spin same make a sharpie point on it
then<00:02:00.200> they<00:02:00.500> put<00:02:00.679> the<00:02:00.800> knob<00:02:01.280> type<00:02:01.759> C<00:02:02.660> which<00:02:03.349> is

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
then they put the knob type C which is

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.000 
then they put the knob type C which is
burly<00:02:04.250> faith

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
burly faith

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.820 
burly faith
now<00:02:06.610> we<00:02:06.670> have<00:02:07.000> all<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.270> parts<00:02:07.480> phone<00:02:08.470> jacks

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
now we have all the parts phone jacks

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.040 
now we have all the parts phone jacks
the<00:02:09.550> plug<00:02:09.820> for<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.090> electric<00:02:10.540> and<00:02:10.660> the

the plug for the electric and the
rheostat<00:02:11.470> any<00:02:12.220> wire<00:02:12.520> will<00:02:12.820> tell<00:02:13.150> me<00:02:13.300> to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
rheostat any wire will tell me to

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.380 
rheostat any wire will tell me to
connect<00:02:13.780> all<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.260> stuff<00:02:14.500> like<00:02:14.820> I<00:02:15.820> always<00:02:16.150> use

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
connect all the stuff like I always use

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.530 
connect all the stuff like I always use
the<00:02:16.600> tweezers<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.530> solder<00:02:18.520> in<00:02:18.670> pain<00:02:18.940> just

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
the tweezers and a solder in pain just

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.310 
the tweezers and a solder in pain just
with<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.870> space<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:21.310> easier<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:22.480> always<00:02:23.050> put
