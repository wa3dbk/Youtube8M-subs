see any barrel extenders no this is not
the<00:00:33.250> OS<00:00:33.550> version<00:00:33.910> so<00:00:34.060> it's<00:00:34.210> not<00:00:34.420> quite<00:00:35.050> as<00:00:35.320> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
the OS version so it's not quite as a

the OS version so it's not quite as a
second<00:00:36.940> maybe<00:00:37.809> probably<00:00:38.260> not<00:00:38.350> quite<00:00:38.559> as<00:00:38.649> heavy

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829

-<00:00:39.130> it<00:00:39.280> has<00:00:39.399> a<00:00:39.430> nice<00:00:39.700> little<00:00:39.910> weight<00:00:40.149> -<00:00:40.329> I'm<00:00:40.420> not

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
- it has a nice little weight - I'm not

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.389 
- it has a nice little weight - I'm not
sure<00:00:40.660> how<00:00:40.750> much<00:00:40.870> of<00:00:41.079> ways<00:00:41.230> but<00:00:42.070> it<00:00:42.160> feels

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.700 

the<00:00:59.019> reason<00:00:59.260> I<00:00:59.320> even<00:00:59.559> bought<00:00:59.769> this<00:01:01.710> besides

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
the reason I even bought this besides

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.710 
the reason I even bought this besides
that<00:01:02.859> it<00:01:02.920> was<00:01:03.039> at<00:01:03.519> a<00:01:03.579> pretty<00:01:04.030> good<00:01:04.119> price<00:01:04.269> which

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
that it was at a pretty good price which

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.230 
that it was at a pretty good price which
I<00:01:04.809> won't<00:01:04.930> talk<00:01:05.379> about<00:01:05.650> is<00:01:06.580> that<00:01:06.790> it<00:01:07.090> you<00:01:07.210> know

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
I won't talk about is that it you know

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.080 
I won't talk about is that it you know
then<00:01:07.509> on<00:01:07.659> I<00:01:07.930> knew<00:01:08.500> to<00:01:08.830> non<00:01:09.009> OS<00:01:09.549> and<00:01:09.909> on<00:01:10.000> an

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
then on I knew to non OS and on an

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.980 
then on I knew to non OS and on an
optical<00:01:10.390> stabilizer<00:01:12.750> because<00:01:13.750> there<00:01:13.869> one

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
optical stabilizer because there one

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.359 
optical stabilizer because there one
makes<00:01:14.170> a<00:01:14.259> big<00:01:14.440> dealing<00:01:14.799> I<00:01:14.830> know<00:01:14.979> there's<00:01:15.190> out

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
makes a big dealing I know there's out

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.649 
makes a big dealing I know there's out
theory<00:01:15.820> that<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:18.250> you<00:01:18.369> know<00:01:18.460> if<00:01:18.549> you<00:01:18.670> like<00:01:19.390> if

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
theory that that you know if you like if

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.529 
theory that that you know if you like if
you're<00:01:19.899> at<00:01:20.020> 200<00:01:20.680> you<00:01:21.430> know<00:01:21.490> to<00:01:21.610> focus<00:01:21.909> at<00:01:22.060> 200

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
you're at 200 you know to focus at 200

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.810 
you're at 200 you know to focus at 200
millimeters<00:01:23.110> if<00:01:23.289> you<00:01:23.640> adjust<00:01:24.640> your<00:01:24.700> shutter

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
millimeters if you adjust your shutter

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.270 
millimeters if you adjust your shutter
speed<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:25.450> one<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.110> one<00:01:26.200> of<00:01:26.289> a<00:01:26.439> second<00:01:26.860> that<00:01:27.039> it

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
speed to one to one of a second that it

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.950 
speed to one to one of a second that it
will<00:01:27.399> help<00:01:27.549> compensate<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.299> you<00:01:28.360> can<00:01:28.509> help

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
will help compensate and you can help

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.980 
will help compensate and you can help
eliminate<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.560> hand<00:01:30.009> held<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:31.509> hand<00:01:31.720> shaking

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
eliminate the hand held the hand shaking

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.410 
eliminate the hand held the hand shaking
the<00:01:32.530> hand<00:01:32.710> vibration<00:01:33.159> or<00:01:33.250> whatever<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:34.300> know

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
the hand vibration or whatever you know

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.969 
the hand vibration or whatever you know
so<00:01:34.659> you<00:01:34.840> don't<00:01:34.990> need<00:01:35.200> optical<00:01:35.649> stabilization

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
so you don't need optical stabilization

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.100 
so you don't need optical stabilization
well<00:01:36.429> you<00:01:37.030> know<00:01:37.179> so<00:01:37.539> that<00:01:37.720> was<00:01:37.810> kind<00:01:37.990> of<00:01:38.020> my

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
well you know so that was kind of my

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.600 
well you know so that was kind of my
thing<00:01:38.200> it's<00:01:38.440> like<00:01:38.500> well<00:01:38.649> let's<00:01:38.830> get<00:01:38.950> this<00:01:39.190> and

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
thing it's like well let's get this and

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.789 
thing it's like well let's get this and
see<00:01:39.970> if<00:01:40.119> I<00:01:40.330> can<00:01:40.479> really<00:01:40.929> pull<00:01:41.319> that<00:01:41.440> off<00:01:41.649> with

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
see if I can really pull that off with

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.380 
see if I can really pull that off with
this<00:01:41.950> if<00:01:42.100> I<00:01:42.190> candid<00:01:42.670> them<00:01:42.759> not<00:01:42.970> even<00:01:43.090> going<00:01:43.330> to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
this if I candid them not even going to

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.039 
this if I candid them not even going to
worry<00:01:43.569> about<00:01:43.720> trying<00:01:44.709> to<00:01:44.799> send<00:01:45.039> it<00:01:45.130> back<00:01:45.280> and

all<00:01:58.959> but<00:01:59.170> I<00:01:59.409> could<00:01:59.709> get<00:01:59.860> as<00:02:00.069> low<00:02:00.220> as<00:02:00.250> one<00:02:00.490> two

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
all but I could get as low as one two

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.249 
all but I could get as low as one two
hundred<00:02:00.909> of<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.060> second<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:01.450> actually<00:02:01.780> worked

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
hundred of a second it actually worked

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.120 
hundred of a second it actually worked
out<00:02:02.319> pretty<00:02:02.380> good

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
out pretty good

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.709 
out pretty good
anything<00:02:03.789> lower<00:02:03.939> than<00:02:04.000> that<00:02:04.240> didn't<00:02:04.570> yes

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
anything lower than that didn't yes

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.120 
anything lower than that didn't yes
definitely<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:05.289> tripod<00:02:05.890> or<00:02:06.159> a<00:02:06.250> monopod<00:02:08.130> but

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
definitely a tripod or a monopod but

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.630 
definitely a tripod or a monopod but
like<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.399> said<00:02:09.640> one<00:02:09.850> 200<00:02:10.179> of<00:02:10.299> a<00:02:10.420> second<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:11.650> took

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
like I said one 200 of a second I took

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.400 
like I said one 200 of a second I took
pictures<00:02:12.880> with<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.239> handheld<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.989> put<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.260> on<00:02:14.380> a

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
pictures with a handheld I put it on a

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.009 
pictures with a handheld I put it on a
tripod<00:02:14.920> monopod<00:02:15.700> could<00:02:16.570> even<00:02:16.720> tell<00:02:16.930> the

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
tripod monopod could even tell the

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.890 
tripod monopod could even tell the
difference<00:02:17.049> between<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.799> picture

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.750 

what<00:02:23.349> another<00:02:23.709> thing<00:02:23.920> about<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.220> pictures<00:02:24.579> is

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
what another thing about the pictures is

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.190 
what another thing about the pictures is
that<00:02:24.909> at<00:02:25.200> 200<00:02:26.200> at<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.860> 2.8<00:02:27.579> aperture<00:02:28.200> the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
that at 200 at the 2.8 aperture the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.899 
that at 200 at the 2.8 aperture the
pictures<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:29.650> felt<00:02:29.890> kind<00:02:30.099> of<00:02:30.189> came<00:02:30.519> and<00:02:30.670> kind<00:02:30.849> of

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
pictures I felt kind of came and kind of

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.000 
pictures I felt kind of came and kind of
soft<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.269> flat<00:02:31.569> looking<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.680> course<00:02:32.920> a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
soft and flat looking and of course a

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.210 
soft and flat looking and of course a
little<00:02:33.129> bit<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.370> adjustment<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:35.220> Lightroom

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
little bit of adjustment in Lightroom

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.569 
little bit of adjustment in Lightroom
covering<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.090> pictures<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.599> life<00:02:38.400> but<00:02:39.400> I

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
covering that pictures to life but I

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.970 
covering that pictures to life but I
wasn't<00:02:39.819> exactly<00:02:39.970> astounded<00:02:40.750> by<00:02:40.870> them<00:02:41.170> but<00:02:41.859> you

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
wasn't exactly astounded by them but you

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.800 
wasn't exactly astounded by them but you
know<00:02:42.099> what<00:02:42.129> I<00:02:42.340> also<00:02:42.609> think<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.090> if<00:02:43.269> I<00:02:43.359> use<00:02:43.569> this

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
know what I also think of if I use this

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.420 
know what I also think of if I use this
like<00:02:44.019> at<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> wedding<00:02:44.290> or<00:02:44.680> something<00:02:44.980> like<00:02:45.040> that

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
like at a wedding or something like that

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.490 
like at a wedding or something like that
I<00:02:45.459> don't<00:02:45.670> really<00:02:45.909> need<00:02:46.150> crisp<00:02:46.599> clear<00:02:47.019> pictures

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
I don't really need crisp clear pictures

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.319 
I don't really need crisp clear pictures
I<00:02:47.620> want<00:02:48.099> them<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.340> be<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.489> little<00:02:48.730> bit<00:02:48.849> soft<00:02:49.150> and

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
I want them to be a little bit soft and

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.660 
I want them to be a little bit soft and
dreamy<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:50.500> what<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.709> plan<00:02:50.950> on<00:02:50.980> using<00:02:51.189> this<00:02:51.370> for

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
dreamy so what I plan on using this for

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.520 
dreamy so what I plan on using this for
I<00:02:51.970> don't<00:02:52.420> really<00:02:52.629> have<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.810> problem<00:02:53.230> with<00:02:53.349> some

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
I don't really have a problem with some

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.050 
I don't really have a problem with some
being<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.739> little<00:02:54.040> bit<00:02:54.159> soft<00:02:54.459> at<00:02:54.970> 2.8<00:02:55.780> at<00:02:56.260> 200

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
being a little bit soft at 2.8 at 200

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.619 
being a little bit soft at 2.8 at 200
thing<00:02:58.060> is<00:02:58.239> is<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.690> when<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:59.139> you<00:02:59.530> know<00:03:00.629> zoom

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
thing is is that when you you know zoom

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.479 
thing is is that when you you know zoom
out<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:01.870> little<00:03:01.959> bit<00:03:02.260> like<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.590> collect<00:03:02.889> a<00:03:03.040> 70<00:03:03.459> or

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
out a little bit like to collect a 70 or

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.250 
out a little bit like to collect a 70 or
100<00:03:04.150> or<00:03:04.269> something<00:03:04.450> like<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.569> the<00:03:04.930> pictures

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
100 or something like that the pictures

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.699 
100 or something like that the pictures
are<00:03:05.349> definitely<00:03:05.769> clearer<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.609> sharper<00:03:07.709> and

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
are definitely clearer and sharper and

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.220 
are definitely clearer and sharper and
with<00:03:08.950> more<00:03:09.099> detail<00:03:09.159> even<00:03:10.120> at<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.389> 2.8<00:03:10.959> so

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
with more detail even at the 2.8 so

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.479 
with more detail even at the 2.8 so
we'll<00:03:11.709> look<00:03:11.799> at<00:03:11.889> some<00:03:11.950> of<00:03:12.189> those<00:03:12.280> pictures

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
we'll look at some of those pictures

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.490 
we'll look at some of those pictures
then

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.680 

quality<00:03:18.040> very<00:03:18.550> nice<00:03:18.790> I<00:03:19.060> really<00:03:19.510> don't<00:03:19.630> care

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
quality very nice I really don't care

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.290 
quality very nice I really don't care
for<00:03:19.870> their<00:03:20.140> finish<00:03:20.500> here<00:03:20.890> this<00:03:21.460> flat<00:03:21.910> finish

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
for their finish here this flat finish

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.370 
for their finish here this flat finish
here<00:03:22.570> it<00:03:22.720> marks<00:03:23.320> up<00:03:23.470> real<00:03:23.680> easy<00:03:25.230> but<00:03:26.230> that's

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
here it marks up real easy but that's

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.020 
here it marks up real easy but that's
not<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.740> you<00:03:27.100> know<00:03:27.220> not<00:03:27.490> the<00:03:27.610> worst<00:03:27.790> thing<00:03:27.970> in

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
probably scratches up easy though but it

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.430 
probably scratches up easy though but it
has<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:46.030> weight<00:03:46.180> goes<00:03:46.450> on<00:03:46.660> it<00:03:46.840> doesn't<00:03:47.200> just

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
goodness it was like yeah I would have

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.010 
goodness it was like yeah I would have
to<00:03:57.820> worry<00:03:57.940> about<00:03:58.120> that<00:03:58.270> freezing<00:03:58.660> up<00:03:58.810> in<00:03:58.930> the

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
to worry about that freezing up in the

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.660 
to worry about that freezing up in the
winter<00:03:59.320> like<00:03:59.350> I<00:03:59.530> have<00:03:59.739> with<00:03:59.920> my<00:04:00.130> other<00:04:00.280> sigmod

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
winter like I have with my other sigmod

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.540 
winter like I have with my other sigmod
lines<00:04:00.850> my<00:04:01.090> 120<00:04:01.630> to<00:04:01.720> 400<00:04:02.230> so<00:04:02.770> even<00:04:03.250> like<00:04:03.400> the

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
lines my 120 to 400 so even like the

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.240 
lines my 120 to 400 so even like the
lens<00:04:03.820> lens<00:04:04.780> coatings<00:04:05.290> is<00:04:05.440> better<00:04:05.890> on<00:04:06.070> this

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
lens lens coatings is better on this

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.670 
lens lens coatings is better on this
than<00:04:06.310> it<00:04:06.550> is<00:04:06.640> on<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:07.030> 120<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:07.600> 400<00:04:08.200> that<00:04:08.320> I<00:04:08.380> have

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
than it is on the 120 to 400 that I have

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.500 
than it is on the 120 to 400 that I have
that<00:04:08.950> talked<00:04:09.220> about<00:04:09.400> another<00:04:09.670> video<00:04:09.970> it's

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
that talked about another video it's

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.780 
that talked about another video it's
very<00:04:10.630> it's<00:04:11.290> very<00:04:11.380> fast<00:04:11.860> is<00:04:12.070> very<00:04:12.250> smooth<00:04:12.580> it's

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
when I first put the lens on the camera

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.830 
when I first put the lens on the camera
it<00:04:16.930> tends<00:04:17.200> that<00:04:17.290> 100<00:04:17.919> in<00:04:18.519> like<00:04:18.700> after<00:04:19.090> then<00:04:19.720> it
