network<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:30.340> this<00:02:30.880> has<00:02:31.000> got<00:02:31.150> large<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:32.140> know

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
network so this has got large you know

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.260 
network so this has got large you know
noisier<00:02:32.650> hard<00:02:32.890> drives<00:02:33.130> inside<00:02:33.460> here<00:02:33.850> which

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
noisier hard drives inside here which

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.520 
noisier hard drives inside here which
can<00:02:34.420> be<00:02:34.510> locked<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.870> cupboard<00:02:35.140> out<00:02:35.320> of<00:02:35.440> the

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
can be locked in a cupboard out of the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.530 
can be locked in a cupboard out of the
way<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.070> has<00:02:36.160> nothing<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.700> do<00:02:36.850> with<00:02:37.450> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
way so it has nothing to do with the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.210 
way so it has nothing to do with the
wonderful<00:02:37.930> silence<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.590> your<00:02:38.860> muse<00:02:39.250> plus<00:02:39.700> here

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
wonderful silence of your muse plus here

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.710 
wonderful silence of your muse plus here
so<00:02:42.220> rather<00:02:42.370> than<00:02:42.490> having<00:02:42.550> large<00:02:43.030> noisy<00:02:43.330> drives

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
so rather than having large noisy drives

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.630 
so rather than having large noisy drives
inside<00:02:44.020> here<00:02:44.290> pack<00:02:44.710> them<00:02:44.890> away<00:02:44.950> somewhere<00:02:45.490> on

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
inside here pack them away somewhere on

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.670 
inside here pack them away somewhere on
a<00:02:45.670> network<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.630> you<00:02:46.810> can<00:02:46.960> run<00:02:47.080> it<00:02:47.200> just<00:02:47.500> as

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
a network and you can run it just as

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.390 
a network and you can run it just as
easily<00:02:49.500> one<00:02:50.500> other<00:02:50.650> option<00:02:50.860> would<00:02:51.130> be<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.280> use

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
easily one other option would be to use

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.340 
easily one other option would be to use
something<00:02:51.940> like<00:02:51.970> teamviewer<00:02:52.780> which<00:02:53.110> allows

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
something like teamviewer which allows

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.170 
something like teamviewer which allows
you<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.620> dial<00:02:53.860> in<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.460> muse<00:02:54.700> from<00:02:55.030> your

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
you to dial in to the muse from your

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.940 
you to dial in to the muse from your
iPad<00:02:55.510> or<00:02:55.540> even<00:02:56.080> from<00:02:56.230> your<00:02:56.350> phone<00:02:56.560> for<00:02:56.830> that

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
iPad or even from your phone for that

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.950 
iPad or even from your phone for that
matter<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.490> you<00:02:57.970> see<00:02:58.180> exactly<00:02:58.480> what's<00:02:58.780> in

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
matter and you see exactly what's in

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.760 
matter and you see exactly what's in
screen<00:02:59.290> so<00:02:59.980> in<00:03:00.280> theater<00:03:00.700> mode<00:03:01.560> which<00:03:02.560> looks

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
screen so in theater mode which looks

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.860 
screen so in theater mode which looks
like<00:03:02.920> that<00:03:03.070> on<00:03:03.220> your<00:03:03.310> main<00:03:03.460> screen<00:03:03.870> it's

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
like that on your main screen it's

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.010 
like that on your main screen it's
mirrored<00:03:05.470> on<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:06.280> iPad<00:03:06.850> by<00:03:07.330> this<00:03:07.570> is<00:03:07.720> actually

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
mirrored on the iPad by this is actually

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.570 
mirrored on the iPad by this is actually
quite<00:03:08.200> easy<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:09.640> navigate<00:03:11.160> using<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.340> touch

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
quite easy to navigate using the touch

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:24.390 
quite easy to navigate using the touch
of<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.820> finger<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:23.709> you've<00:03:23.830> seen<00:03:23.980> exactly

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
of a finger so you've seen exactly

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.610 
of a finger so you've seen exactly
what's<00:03:24.580> on<00:03:24.700> there<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.840> app<00:03:26.020> perhaps<00:03:26.440> is

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
what's on there the app perhaps is

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.260 
what's on there the app perhaps is
better<00:03:26.830> designed<00:03:27.340> for<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.670> iPad<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.209> it

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
better designed for the iPad and it

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.670 
better designed for the iPad and it
gives<00:03:28.450> you<00:03:28.540> far<00:03:28.810> more<00:03:28.840> information<00:03:29.530> with<00:03:29.620> the

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
gives you far more information with the

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.020 
gives you far more information with the
track<00:03:29.890> listings<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.430> all<00:03:30.520> those<00:03:30.640> sorts<00:03:30.970> of

find it as if I was using the mouse and
