this<00:00:00.719> is<00:00:00.930> just<00:00:01.140> a<00:00:01.319> I<00:00:01.939> believe<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:02.970> nine-inch

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
this is just a I believe a nine-inch

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.150 
this is just a I believe a nine-inch
balloon<00:00:03.720> you<00:00:03.899> can<00:00:03.929> either<00:00:04.200> use<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.560> seven<00:00:04.980> or<00:00:05.100> a

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
balloon you can either use a seven or a

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.099 
balloon you can either use a seven or a
nine<00:00:05.220> inch<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.850> twelve<00:00:06.390> inch<00:00:06.509> is<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.750> little<00:00:06.990> bit

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
nine inch a twelve inch is a little bit

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.169 
nine inch a twelve inch is a little bit
too<00:00:07.290> large<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:10.639> better<00:00:11.639> give<00:00:11.790> that<00:00:11.820> another

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
too large I better give that another

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.150 
too large I better give that another
minute<00:00:12.540> before<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.960> do<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.259> maybe<00:00:13.740> we'll<00:00:13.980> go

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
minute before I do that maybe we'll go

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.530 
minute before I do that maybe we'll go
ahead<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.429> cut<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.700> pins<00:00:14.910> out<00:00:15.089> while<00:00:15.330> this

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
ahead and cut the pins out while this

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.380 
ahead and cut the pins out while this
while<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.109> glue<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.320> setting<00:00:16.740> up<00:00:16.890> here<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:18.119> I

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
while the glue is setting up here and I

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:27.290 
while the glue is setting up here and I
need<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.630> styrofoam<00:00:19.170> plate<00:00:25.820> we<00:00:26.820> can<00:00:26.849> make<00:00:27.150> them

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
need a styrofoam plate we can make them

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.269 
need a styrofoam plate we can make them
this<00:00:27.449> size<00:00:27.689> if<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.019> like<00:00:28.230> I'll<00:00:28.560> go<00:00:28.890> ahead<00:00:28.980> and

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
this size if you like I'll go ahead and

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.690 
this size if you like I'll go ahead and
cut<00:00:30.029> one<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.300> these<00:00:30.390> out<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.340> and<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:32.520> make

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
cut one of these out and and just make

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.530 
cut one of these out and and just make
it<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.000> size<00:00:33.350> now<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> fin<00:00:34.710> serves<00:00:35.540> one

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
it this size now the fin serves one

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.569 
it this size now the fin serves one
primary<00:00:37.110> purpose<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.010> hold<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
primary purpose and that is to hold the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.000 
primary purpose and that is to hold the
balloon<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> center<00:00:39.649> if<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.829> balloon

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
balloon in the center if the balloon

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.410 
balloon in the center if the balloon
gets<00:00:41.160> off-center<00:00:41.760> these<00:00:42.030> things<00:00:42.270> will<00:00:42.390> just

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
gets off-center these things will just

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.110 
gets off-center these things will just
go<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.200> circles<00:00:43.399> so<00:00:44.399> when<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> balloon<00:00:45.000> is

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
go in circles so when the balloon is

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.979 
go in circles so when the balloon is
inflated<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.809> goes<00:00:46.020> between<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> two<00:00:46.829> pins<00:00:47.989> so

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
inflated it goes between the two pins so

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.299 
inflated it goes between the two pins so
I'll<00:00:49.440> draw<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.950> couple<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.520> these<00:00:52.039> these<00:00:53.039> pins

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
I'll draw a couple of these these pins

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.900 
I'll draw a couple of these these pins
on<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.239> again<00:00:55.370> they<00:00:56.370> don't<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.820> be

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
on here and again they don't have to be

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.170 
on here and again they don't have to be
exactly<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.570> right<00:00:57.600> size<00:00:58.820> their<00:00:59.820> primary

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
exactly the right size their primary

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.340 
exactly the right size their primary
purpose<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> hold<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> balloon<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
purpose is to hold the balloon in the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.219 
purpose is to hold the balloon in the
center<00:01:02.000> secondary<00:01:03.000> purpose<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.019> looks

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
center secondary purpose is so it looks

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.410 
center secondary purpose is so it looks
like<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.979> like<00:01:05.400> they<00:01:05.519> do<00:01:05.580> something<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.299> it

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
like it like they do something so it

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.250 
like it like they do something so it
looks<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.750> they<00:01:06.900> make<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.229> whole<00:01:08.159> thing

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
looks like they make the whole thing

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:35.830 
looks like they make the whole thing
stable<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.470> there<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.979> directional<00:01:11.820> stability

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.540 

okay<00:01:36.840> now<00:01:37.080> our<00:01:37.290> our<00:01:37.800> glue<00:01:37.980> should<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:38.340> dry

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
okay now our our glue should be dry

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.250 
okay now our our glue should be dry
enough<00:01:38.760> now<00:01:39.000> where<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.330> can<00:01:39.360> stretch<00:01:40.080> the

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
enough now where we can stretch the

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.460 
enough now where we can stretch the
balloon<00:01:40.380> over<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.450> once<00:01:42.450> again<00:01:42.570> sometimes

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
balloon over it once again sometimes

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.950 
balloon over it once again sometimes
this<00:01:43.680> may<00:01:43.890> take<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.160> second<00:01:44.730> and<00:01:45.000> what<00:01:45.810> I'm

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
this may take a second and what I'm

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.810 
this may take a second and what I'm
gonna<00:01:46.110> attempt<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.680> by<00:01:46.860> myself<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.550> first

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
gonna attempt it by myself the first

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.140 
gonna attempt it by myself the first
time<00:01:48.060> here<00:01:49.310> looks<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.640> works<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.000> lot

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
time here looks like it works a lot

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.800 
time here looks like it works a lot
better<00:01:51.210> stretching<00:01:51.930> over<00:01:52.230> there<00:01:52.410> rigid<00:01:52.770> foam

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
better stretching over there rigid foam

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.630 
better stretching over there rigid foam
and<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.900> course<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.200> want<00:01:55.410> to<00:01:55.440> Center<00:01:55.800> it<00:01:55.830> up<00:01:56.390> so

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
and of course I want to Center it up so

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.950 
and of course I want to Center it up so
right<00:01:59.640> now<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.880> one<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> little<00:02:00.480> bit<00:02:00.720> high

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
right now the one is a little bit high

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.510 
right now the one is a little bit high
I'm<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.380> gonna<00:02:01.500> try<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.830> take<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.130> little<00:02:02.310> bit

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
I'm just gonna try to take a little bit

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.330 
I'm just gonna try to take a little bit
of<00:02:02.690> blue<00:02:03.690> material<00:02:04.260> away<00:02:04.350> from<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:04.740> top<00:02:04.979> here

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
of blue material away from the top here

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.460 
of blue material away from the top here
to<00:02:06.120> get<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.510> it<00:02:06.720> blows<00:02:06.930> right<00:02:07.110> through<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
to get it so it blows right through the

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.190 
to get it so it blows right through the
center<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:07.920> straw<00:02:08.869> okay<00:02:09.869> now<00:02:10.020> it's

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
center of the straw okay now it's

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.620 
center of the straw okay now it's
looking<00:02:10.470> pretty<00:02:10.649> good<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:10.979> no<00:02:11.370> yeah<00:02:11.670> I'm<00:02:12.450> gonna

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
looking pretty good so no yeah I'm gonna

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.400 
looking pretty good so no yeah I'm gonna
mount<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.990> up<00:02:13.140> by<00:02:13.710> using<00:02:14.810> again<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.990> low<00:02:16.110> temp

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
mount it up by using again the low temp

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.040 
mount it up by using again the low temp
glue<00:02:16.500> gun<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:17.220> want<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.000> be<00:02:18.090> sure<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.630> don't<00:02:18.720> get

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
glue gun I want to be sure I don't get

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.000 
glue gun I want to be sure I don't get
any<00:02:19.110> glue<00:02:20.180> below<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.390> surface<00:02:21.830> I'm<00:02:22.830> gonna

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
any glue below the surface I'm gonna

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.510 
any glue below the surface I'm gonna
start<00:02:23.160> off<00:02:23.280> with<00:02:23.430> just<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.700> little<00:02:23.730> bit<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.360> glue

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
start off with just a little bit of glue

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:37.460 
start off with just a little bit of glue
and<00:02:34.790> doesn't<00:02:35.790> leak<00:02:35.940> out<00:02:36.120> give<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.350> little

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
and doesn't leak out give that a little

about as quick as I put it on but up
here<00:03:38.799> it's<00:03:39.799> almost<00:03:40.069> right<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:41.510> inflate<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:42.049> if

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
here it's almost right to inflate it if

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.379 
here it's almost right to inflate it if
more<00:03:43.340> than<00:03:43.370> one<00:03:43.489> person<00:03:44.000> is<00:03:44.090> going<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.239> be

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
using the same vehicle you can take the

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.330 
using the same vehicle you can take the
part<00:03:47.060> of<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.239> straw<00:03:47.569> that<00:03:47.840> you<00:03:48.189> cut<00:03:49.189> off<00:03:49.719> and

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
part of the straw that you cut off and

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.240 
part of the straw that you cut off and
we<00:03:52.340> can<00:03:53.049> bend<00:03:54.049> it<00:03:54.169> down<00:03:54.230> just<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.709> little<00:03:54.739> bit

we can bend it down just a little bit

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.530 
we can bend it down just a little bit
and<00:03:55.489> they<00:03:55.579> put<00:03:55.849> a<00:03:55.879> little<00:03:56.120> bit<00:03:56.239> of<00:03:56.329> glue<00:03:56.510> on

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
and they put a little bit of glue on

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.240 
and they put a little bit of glue on
that<00:03:56.930> and<00:03:57.169> that<00:03:57.319> way<00:03:57.439> they<00:03:57.620> can<00:03:57.650> insert<00:03:58.099> it

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
that and that way they can insert it

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.559 
that and that way they can insert it
into<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.760> bottom<00:04:02.769> to<00:04:03.769> inflate<00:04:04.159> it<00:04:04.340> if<00:04:05.030> one

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569
