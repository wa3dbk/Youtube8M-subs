transplanting so here's a here's a

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.040 
transplanting so here's a here's a
yogurt<00:00:32.430> container<00:00:32.610> I'm<00:00:33.149> gonna<00:00:33.360> show<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.660> what

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
yogurt container I'm gonna show you what

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.260 
yogurt container I'm gonna show you what
you<00:00:34.200> do<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:34.469> them<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:35.399> just<00:00:35.610> turn<00:00:35.969> them<00:00:36.149> over

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
you do with them so just turn them over

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
now you can see that I have four holes

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.619 
now you can see that I have four holes
in<00:00:40.350> them<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.890> I've<00:00:41.010> already<00:00:41.280> poked

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
in them that I've already poked

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.330 
in them that I've already poked
but<00:00:42.870> these<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.200> been<00:00:43.260> used<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.559> few<00:00:43.590> times<00:00:44.010> so

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
but these have been used a few times so

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.670 
but these have been used a few times so
I'm<00:00:44.940> gonna<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.300> them<00:00:45.480> again<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.410> take<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
I'm gonna do them again so you take a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.540 
I'm gonna do them again so you take a
little<00:00:46.890> push<00:00:47.219> pin<00:00:47.520> or<00:00:47.820> attack<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
little push pin or attack like this and

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.470 
little push pin or attack like this and
just<00:00:50.690> poke<00:00:51.690> holes<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.469> then<00:00:52.940> I'm<00:00:53.940> poking<00:00:54.329> them

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
just poke holes and then I'm poking them

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.689 
just poke holes and then I'm poking them
in<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> same<00:00:54.899> place<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.430> that<00:00:56.430> I've<00:00:56.550> already

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
in the same place that that I've already

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.709 
in the same place that that I've already
done<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.260> about<00:01:01.500> four<00:01:02.219> or<00:01:02.609> five<00:01:02.969> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
done and you do about four or five and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.899 
done and you do about four or five and
the<00:01:04.379> reason<00:01:04.650> why<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.860> poke<00:01:05.070> holes<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.610> that

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
the reason why you poke holes is that

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.670 
the reason why you poke holes is that
your<00:01:06.900> plan<00:01:07.229> doesn't<00:01:07.650> get<00:01:07.890> waterlogged<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.530> now

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
your plan doesn't get waterlogged so now

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.859 
your plan doesn't get waterlogged so now
that<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:10.950> ready<00:01:11.250> what<00:01:12.180> I'm<00:01:12.299> gonna<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.630> is

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
that it's ready what I'm gonna do is

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.820 
that it's ready what I'm gonna do is

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
cover it up with or fill this one

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.820 
cover it up with or fill this one
halfway<00:01:17.189> through<00:01:17.939> with<00:01:18.590> something<00:01:19.590> called

even<00:01:23.610> use<00:01:23.729> compost<00:01:25.729> compost<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:27.090> it's

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
even use compost compost because it's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.499 
even use compost compost because it's
full<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.600> nutrients<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.409> great<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:29.509> a

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
full of nutrients it's great for a

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.510 
full of nutrients it's great for a
growing<00:01:31.229> plant<00:01:32.509> so<00:01:33.509> here<00:01:33.920> here's<00:01:34.920> my<00:01:35.040> yogurt

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
growing plant so here here's my yogurt

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.980 
growing plant so here here's my yogurt
container<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.420> then<00:01:37.259> we're<00:01:37.350> gonna<00:01:37.470> pour<00:01:37.799> some

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
cut this one let's see let this one and

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.530 
cut this one let's see let this one and
now<00:01:53.280> remember<00:01:53.700> we're<00:01:53.850> not<00:01:54.000> disturbing<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
now remember we're not disturbing the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.170 
now remember we're not disturbing the
roots<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.990> let's<00:01:55.140> look<00:01:55.290> at<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.560> roots

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
roots and let's look at the roots

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.639 
roots and let's look at the roots
they<00:01:57.180> haven't<00:01:57.329> poked<00:01:57.689> out<00:01:57.869> from<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.170> back<00:01:58.320> yet

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
they haven't poked out from the back yet

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.429 
they haven't poked out from the back yet
so<00:01:59.159> which<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.460> great<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.719> all<00:02:00.960> we're<00:02:01.140> gonna<00:02:01.259> do

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
so which is great so all we're gonna do

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.240 
so which is great so all we're gonna do
is<00:02:01.560> place<00:02:01.890> them<00:02:02.189> gently<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:04.350> now<00:02:05.040> it

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
is place them gently on this and now it

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.429 
is place them gently on this and now it
looks<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:06.020> what<00:02:07.020> we're<00:02:07.140> going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.320> do

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
looks like this what we're going to do

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.869 
looks like this what we're going to do
is<00:02:07.560> we're<00:02:07.710> going<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.860> cover<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.310> one<00:02:08.520> up<00:02:08.670> with

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
is we're going to cover this one up with

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.680 
is we're going to cover this one up with
more<00:02:09.629> potting<00:02:10.500> mix<00:02:10.709> or<00:02:10.890> compost<00:02:11.760> either<00:02:12.420> one

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
more potting mix or compost either one

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.440 
more potting mix or compost either one
works<00:02:12.900> because

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
works because

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.320 
works because
both<00:02:13.629> are<00:02:13.810> full<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.140> nutrients<00:02:14.650> for<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.489> growing

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
both are full of nutrients for a growing

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.559 
both are full of nutrients for a growing
plant<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.700> here<00:02:19.030> we<00:02:19.180> go<00:02:20.910> say<00:02:21.910> make<00:02:22.180> sure<00:02:22.390> it's

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
plant so here we go say make sure it's

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.210 
plant so here we go say make sure it's
all<00:02:22.780> covered<00:02:23.170> because<00:02:23.620> there<00:02:23.769> are<00:02:23.890> certain

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
all covered because there are certain

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.420 
all covered because there are certain
holes<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:25.510> get<00:02:25.780> formed<00:02:26.019> on<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.290> sides<00:02:26.650> so

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
holes that get formed on the sides so

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.790 
holes that get formed on the sides so
put<00:02:27.640> them<00:02:27.760> in<00:02:27.970> if<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.080> want<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.379> can<00:02:29.500> poke

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
put them in if you want you can poke

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.830 
put them in if you want you can poke
them<00:02:29.980> with<00:02:30.010> your<00:02:30.220> fingers<00:02:30.730> push<00:02:31.180> them<00:02:31.390> deep<00:02:31.569> in

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.059 

and<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:36.489> are<00:02:36.519> done<00:02:37.260> just<00:02:38.260> press<00:02:38.500> them<00:02:38.860> a

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
and you are done just press them a

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.390 
and you are done just press them a
little<00:02:39.549> bit<00:02:39.730> in<00:02:39.880> so<00:02:40.799> it's<00:02:41.799> getting<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.220> good

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
little bit in so it's getting a good

make sure is first time when you when
you<00:03:05.980> when<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.459> water<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.450> water<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.870> a

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
you when you water it you water it a

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.660 
you when you water it you water it a
little<00:03:08.200> deep<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:08.799> which<00:03:08.950> means<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:09.370> give<00:03:09.549> it<00:03:09.640> a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
little deep so which means you give it a

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.240 
little deep so which means you give it a
lot<00:03:09.819> more<00:03:10.030> water<00:03:10.209> then<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:11.680> next<00:03:12.069> time

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
lot more water then the next time

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.809 
lot more water then the next time
onwards<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:14.440> in<00:03:14.709> a<00:03:14.829> few<00:03:15.040> weeks<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:15.459> maybe<00:03:15.700> a

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
onwards so in a few weeks and maybe a

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.020 
onwards so in a few weeks and maybe a
week<00:03:16.180> or<00:03:16.390> so<00:03:17.190> your<00:03:18.190> plan<00:03:18.489> should<00:03:18.760> start

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
week or so your plan should start

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.520 
week or so your plan should start
looking<00:03:19.180> like<00:03:19.359> this<00:03:19.750> and<00:03:19.989> this<00:03:20.109> one<00:03:20.319> is<00:03:20.410> a

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
looking like this and this one is a

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.220 
looking like this and this one is a
sweet<00:03:20.980> pea<00:03:21.310> plant<00:03:21.670> they<00:03:22.480> grow<00:03:22.690> really<00:03:23.049> well

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
sweet pea plant they grow really well

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.660 
sweet pea plant they grow really well
and<00:03:24.989> do<00:03:25.989> you<00:03:26.109> see<00:03:26.319> how<00:03:26.560> moist<00:03:26.859> this<00:03:27.130> is<00:03:27.340> this<00:03:27.519> is

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
and do you see how moist this is this is

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.970 
and do you see how moist this is this is
pretty<00:03:27.940> much<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.500> moistness<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.829> you're

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
pretty much the moistness that you're

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.690 
pretty much the moistness that you're
looking<00:03:30.370> for<00:03:31.139> don't<00:03:32.139> overwater<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.220> because

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
looking for don't overwater it because

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.400 
looking for don't overwater it because
that<00:03:33.850> would<00:03:34.030> definitely<00:03:34.630> kill<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.959> plant<00:03:35.170> or

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
that would definitely kill the plant or

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.550 
that would definitely kill the plant or
it<00:03:35.500> would<00:03:35.620> start<00:03:35.920> rotting<00:03:36.160> from<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.489> bottom

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
it would start rotting from the bottom

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.449 
it would start rotting from the bottom
so<00:03:38.560> now<00:03:38.850> you<00:03:39.850> are<00:03:40.060> set<00:03:40.389> with<00:03:40.660> your<00:03:41.280> sapling<00:03:42.280> and

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
so now you are set with your sapling and

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.509 
so now you are set with your sapling and
it's<00:03:42.579> probably<00:03:43.420> another<00:03:43.950> let's<00:03:44.950> say<00:03:45.160> four

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
it's probably another let's say four

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.030 
it's probably another let's say four
weeks<00:03:45.790> five<00:03:46.720> weeks<00:03:47.109> and<00:03:47.470> this<00:03:47.739> should<00:03:47.950> be

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
weeks five weeks and this should be

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.709 
weeks five weeks and this should be
ready<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.310> be<00:03:48.609> planted<00:03:48.819> outside<00:03:49.530> good<00:03:50.530> luck
