gonna do a quick video and show you guys
how<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.330> break<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.719> your<00:00:09.840> tires<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.710> get<00:00:10.800> a

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
how to break in your tires to get a

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.990 
how to break in your tires to get a
little<00:00:11.040> bit<00:00:11.130> more<00:00:11.219> traction<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.759> get<00:00:11.880> those

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
little bit more traction and get those

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.759 
little bit more traction and get those
tires<00:00:12.240> up<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.690> pace<00:00:13.139> just<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.469> little<00:00:13.679> bit

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
tires up on pace just a little bit

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.620 
tires up on pace just a little bit
faster<00:00:14.160> now<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.670> can<00:00:14.910> do<00:00:15.030> this<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.240> few

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
faster now you can do this a few

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.650 
faster now you can do this a few
different<00:00:15.900> ways<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.350> actually<00:00:16.980> have<00:00:17.310> an<00:00:17.430> old<00:00:17.660> 10

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
different ways I actually have an old 10

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.689 
different ways I actually have an old 10
scale<00:00:18.900> axle<00:00:19.410> out<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.590> like<00:00:19.740> an<00:00:19.859> SC<00:00:20.070> 10<00:00:20.250> or<00:00:20.369> t4

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
scale axle out of like an SC 10 or t4

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.790 
scale axle out of like an SC 10 or t4
with<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> hex<00:00:21.359> on<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.439> put<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.680> in

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
with a hex on it so you can put that in

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
with a hex on it so you can put that in
a<00:00:22.830> drill<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.189> could<00:00:23.340> use<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> sanding

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
a drill and you could use a sanding

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.089 
a drill and you could use a sanding
block<00:00:23.880> or<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.779> could<00:00:24.900> use<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.289> tire<00:00:25.470> sander<00:00:25.859> so

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
block or you could use a tire sander so

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.380 
block or you could use a tire sander so
we're<00:00:26.279> gonna<00:00:26.369> use<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.609> tire<00:00:26.789> sander<00:00:27.119> today

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
we're gonna use the tire sander today

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.480 
we're gonna use the tire sander today
and<00:00:27.630> I'll<00:00:28.470> show<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.710> exactly<00:00:28.949> how<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.160> do<00:00:29.369> it

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and I'll show you exactly how we do it

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.550 
and I'll show you exactly how we do it
so<00:00:29.609> let's<00:00:29.760> let's<00:00:30.240> move<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.660> camera<00:00:30.869> let's<00:00:31.380> go

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
so let's let's move the camera let's go

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.840 
so let's let's move the camera let's go
let's<00:00:31.949> go<00:00:32.070> breaking<00:00:32.340> some<00:00:32.489> tires<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.820> just

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
let's go breaking some tires and just

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.700 
let's go breaking some tires and just
see<00:00:33.000> exactly<00:00:33.059> how<00:00:33.360> it's<00:00:33.480> done<00:00:33.540> ok<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.680> can

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
see exactly how it's done ok so you can

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.110 
see exactly how it's done ok so you can
hear<00:00:34.890> my<00:00:34.980> power<00:00:35.190> supply<00:00:35.399> running<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.030> we're

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
hear my power supply running and we're

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.459 
hear my power supply running and we're
gonna<00:00:36.210> use<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.600> sky<00:00:37.140> RC<00:00:37.440> tire<00:00:37.649> sander<00:00:38.129> but

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
gonna use this sky RC tire sander but

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.450 
gonna use this sky RC tire sander but
the<00:00:40.469> way<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.739> thing<00:00:40.890> basically<00:00:40.980> works<00:00:41.309> is

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the way this thing basically works is

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.100 
the way this thing basically works is
it's<00:00:41.579> got<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> switch<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.239> goes<00:00:42.480> both

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
it's got a switch that goes both

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.020 
it's got a switch that goes both
directions<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.399> spin<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.760> tire

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
directions so that you can spin the tire

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.209 
directions so that you can spin the tire
in<00:00:45.210> either<00:00:45.420> direction<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.920> course<00:00:47.129> you

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
in either direction and of course you

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.779 
in either direction and of course you
just<00:00:47.370> Chuck<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.700> tire<00:00:47.969> up<00:00:48.120> right<00:00:48.300> here<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
just Chuck the tire up right here on the

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.119 
just Chuck the tire up right here on the
on<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.940> 12<00:00:51.120> millimeter<00:00:51.300> hacks<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.920> first

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
on the 12 millimeter hacks so the first

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.139 
on the 12 millimeter hacks so the first
thing<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.309> obviously<00:00:53.610> want<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:53.940> mark

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
thing you obviously want to do is mark

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.340 
thing you obviously want to do is mark
your<00:00:54.300> tires<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.809> see<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.110> one

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
your tires and you can see that this one

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.189 
your tires and you can see that this one
actually<00:00:55.920> says<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.969> don't<00:00:57.390> love<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.750> they're

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
actually says I don't love you they're

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.410 
actually says I don't love you they're
not<00:00:58.289> says<00:00:58.559> there's<00:00:58.800> an<00:00:58.859> R<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.070> there<00:00:59.399> so<00:01:00.270> go

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
not says there's an R in there so go

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.150 
not says there's an R in there so go
ahead<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.660> put<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:00.930> toy<00:01:01.559> around<00:01:01.710> here<00:01:01.980> this

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
ahead and put this toy around here this

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.070 
ahead and put this toy around here this
is<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.430> an<00:01:02.489> aka<00:01:02.850> chain-linked<00:01:03.359> that's<00:01:03.510> brand

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
is just an aka chain-linked that's brand

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.899 
is just an aka chain-linked that's brand
spankin<00:01:04.500> new<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.769> needs<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.040> be<00:01:05.070> scuffed<00:01:05.729> in

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
spankin new that needs to be scuffed in

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.530 
spankin new that needs to be scuffed in
and<00:01:06.780> clearly<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.880> right-handed<00:01:08.880> tire<00:01:09.060> needs<00:01:09.420> to

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
and clearly a right-handed tire needs to

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.990 
and clearly a right-handed tire needs to
spin<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:10.200> way<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.530> we'll<00:01:10.920> go<00:01:11.040> ahead<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.280> wish

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
spin this way so we'll go ahead and wish

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.310 
spin this way so we'll go ahead and wish
that<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> powers<00:01:12.510> not<00:01:12.540> too<00:01:12.840> crazy<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.229> this

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
that the powers not too crazy on this

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.550 
that the powers not too crazy on this
thing<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.619> we'll<00:01:13.740> see<00:01:13.860> if<00:01:13.920> we're<00:01:14.040> gonna<00:01:14.130> spit

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
thing and we'll see if we're gonna spit

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.780 
thing and we'll see if we're gonna spit
okay<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.799> there<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.460> go

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
okay so there you go

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.539 
okay so there you go
so<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:19.170> these<00:01:19.350> tire<00:01:19.680> Sanders<00:01:20.159> some<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.430> them

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
so with these tire Sanders some of them

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.830 
so with these tire Sanders some of them
don't<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.880> lot<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.030> clearance<00:01:21.420> underneath

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
don't have a lot of clearance underneath

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.179 
don't have a lot of clearance underneath
your<00:01:22.049> bench<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.439> that's<00:01:22.680> why<00:01:22.830> I'm<00:01:22.920> doing<00:01:23.130> this

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
your bench and that's why I'm doing this

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.100 
your bench and that's why I'm doing this
on<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> edge<00:01:23.659> normally<00:01:24.659> how<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.020> at

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
on the edge normally how you do this at

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.690 
on the edge normally how you do this at
the<00:01:25.170> track<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:25.799> now<00:01:25.890> I'm<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.280> RC<00:01:26.549> room

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the track but for now I'm in the RC room

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.100 
the track but for now I'm in the RC room
and<00:01:26.820> I'll<00:01:26.880> go<00:01:27.000> ahead<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.840> here

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
and I'll go ahead and just do it here

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.080 
and I'll go ahead and just do it here
but<00:01:28.229> now<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.310> use<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> variety<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.909> your

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
but now you can use a variety of your

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
but now you can use a variety of your
things<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.360> use<00:01:30.570> something<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:30.840> this

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
things you can use something like this

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.260 
things you can use something like this
just<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.770> sanding<00:01:32.159> block<00:01:32.189> with<00:01:32.880> some<00:01:32.909> sandpaper

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
just a sanding block with some sandpaper

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.920 
just a sanding block with some sandpaper
on<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.659> from<00:01:33.750> 3m<00:01:34.159> which<00:01:35.159> works<00:01:35.369> really<00:01:35.549> nice

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
on it from 3m which works really nice

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.020 
on it from 3m which works really nice
but<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:36.960> prefer<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> sweet<00:01:39.000> little

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
but I prefer this this is a sweet little

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.490 
but I prefer this this is a sweet little
gadget<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:39.960> get<00:01:40.049> over<00:01:40.200> at<00:01:40.290> gravity

and<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.570> thing<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.110> don't<00:01:49.470> know<00:01:49.530> how<00:01:49.649> how<00:01:49.920> well

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
and this thing I don't know how how well

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.200 
and this thing I don't know how how well
you<00:01:50.220> guys<00:01:50.280> will<00:01:50.490> see<00:01:50.640> what<00:01:50.729> there's<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.939> fine

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
you guys will see what there's a fine

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.569 
you guys will see what there's a fine
side<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.899> there's<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.740> more<00:01:52.979> abrasive<00:01:53.220> side

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
side and there's a more abrasive side

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.300 
side and there's a more abrasive side
and<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:53.939> thing<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.420> aluminum<00:01:55.159> and<00:01:56.159> this

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
and this thing it's aluminum and this

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.100 
and this thing it's aluminum and this
thing<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.490> works<00:01:56.820> really<00:01:57.210> really<00:01:57.540> well<00:01:57.960> so

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
thing just works really really well so

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.870 
thing just works really really well so
this<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:58.530> I'll<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:58.680> using<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.280> I'm<00:01:59.729> just

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
this is what I'll be using and I'm just

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.010 
this is what I'll be using and I'm just
going<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.030> go<00:02:00.119> ahead<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.390> use<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.630> fine<00:02:00.840> edge

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
going to go ahead and use the fine edge

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.270 
going to go ahead and use the fine edge
for<00:02:01.259> now<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.649> we'll<00:02:01.829> just<00:02:01.920> go<00:02:02.040> ahead<00:02:02.100> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
for now so we'll just go ahead and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.459 
for now so we'll just go ahead and
basically<00:02:02.719> it's<00:02:03.719> trying<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.079> do<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.290> real

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
basically it's trying to do this real

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.830 
basically it's trying to do this real
quick<00:02:04.700> turn<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:07.520> then<00:02:08.599> we<00:02:09.599> need<00:02:09.750> to

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
quick turn this on and then we need to

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.760 
quick turn this on and then we need to
put<00:02:09.929> some<00:02:10.050> more<00:02:10.110> power<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.500> it

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
put some more power in it

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.820 
put some more power in it
the<00:02:11.370> downside<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.849> these<00:02:11.940> tire<00:02:12.180> centers

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.620 

they<00:02:15.830> don't<00:02:16.010> have<00:02:16.100> that<00:02:16.220> much<00:02:16.340> torque

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.300 

all<00:02:23.630> right<00:02:23.750> so<00:02:23.960> if<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.650> look<00:02:24.830> really<00:02:24.980> closely

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
all right so if you look really closely

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.760 
all right so if you look really closely
now<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.930> can<00:02:27.050> see<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.320> there's<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.530> lot<00:02:27.680> of

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
now you can see that there's a lot of

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.980 
now you can see that there's a lot of
like<00:02:27.860> scuffing<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.640> kind<00:02:29.240> of<00:02:29.300> funkiness<00:02:29.660> on

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
like scuffing and kind of funkiness on

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.870 
like scuffing and kind of funkiness on
the<00:02:30.140> actual<00:02:30.350> tire<00:02:30.590> itself<00:02:30.920> right<00:02:31.160> like<00:02:31.340> the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
the actual tire itself right like the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.090 
the actual tire itself right like the
pin<00:02:32.120> clearly<00:02:32.480> has<00:02:32.570> got<00:02:33.110> an<00:02:33.320> edge<00:02:33.560> on<00:02:33.800> it<00:02:33.950> but

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
pin clearly has got an edge on it but

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.650 
pin clearly has got an edge on it but
there's<00:02:34.220> like<00:02:34.370> extra<00:02:34.760> flashing<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.480> stuff

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
there's like extra flashing and stuff

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.090 
there's like extra flashing and stuff
you<00:02:35.900> see<00:02:36.020> there's<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.170> little<00:02:36.230> bit<00:02:36.350> of<00:02:36.500> graph<00:02:36.710> on

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
you see there's a little bit of graph on

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.790 
you see there's a little bit of graph on
my<00:02:37.280> table<00:02:37.490> or<00:02:37.700> whatever<00:02:37.970> no<00:02:38.720> big<00:02:38.750> deal<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:39.290> what

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
my table or whatever no big deal so what

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.130 
my table or whatever no big deal so what
we'll<00:02:39.890> do<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.570> we'll<00:02:41.570> go<00:02:41.690> ahead<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:41.870> turn<00:02:42.050> this

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
we'll do is we'll go ahead and turn this

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.790 
we'll do is we'll go ahead and turn this
thing<00:02:42.230> down<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.440> minimum<00:02:42.910> turn<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.030> back<00:02:44.150> on

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
thing down to minimum turn it back on

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.280 
thing down to minimum turn it back on
let<00:02:45.800> it<00:02:45.920> spin<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.750> this<00:02:47.750> time<00:02:47.960> what<00:02:48.080> we'll<00:02:48.200> do

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
let it spin and this time what we'll do

00:02:48.290 --> 00:03:01.770 
let it spin and this time what we'll do
is<00:02:48.410> we'll<00:02:48.500> just<00:02:48.650> use<00:02:48.740> this<00:02:48.920> little<00:02:49.610> scuff<00:02:49.790> pad

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.119 

now<00:03:02.780> if<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.020> look<00:03:03.200> look<00:03:03.500> at<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.680> finish<00:03:03.950> now

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
now if you look look at the finish now

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.089 
now if you look look at the finish now
way<00:03:04.970> better<00:03:05.300> so<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.019> tires<00:03:06.230> scuffed<00:03:06.680> in<00:03:06.890> we

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
way better so the tires scuffed in we

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.559 
way better so the tires scuffed in we
got<00:03:07.280> rid<00:03:07.430> of<00:03:07.459> all<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.760> nastiness<00:03:08.120> all<00:03:08.450> the

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
got rid of all the nastiness all the

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.420 
got rid of all the nastiness all the
fuzziness<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.230> this<00:03:09.709> tire<00:03:09.920> is<00:03:10.010> literally

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
fuzziness and this tire is literally

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.960 
fuzziness and this tire is literally
ready<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.849> be<00:03:10.940> sauced<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:11.540> hit<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.230> track

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
ready to be sauced and hit the track

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.130 
ready to be sauced and hit the track
okay<00:03:13.970> so<00:03:14.030> it's<00:03:14.239> just<00:03:14.300> that<00:03:14.629> easy<00:03:14.840> you

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
okay so it's just that easy you

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.210 
okay so it's just that easy you
basically<00:03:15.500> make<00:03:15.650> sure<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:15.830> you're<00:03:16.010> spinning

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
basically make sure that you're spinning

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.250 
basically make sure that you're spinning
the<00:03:16.340> tire<00:03:16.550> in<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.700> right<00:03:16.819> direction<00:03:16.989> you<00:03:17.989> use

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
the tire in the right direction you use

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.990 
the tire in the right direction you use
the<00:03:18.860> type<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.160> you<00:03:19.430> know<00:03:19.489> you<00:03:19.580> use<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.760> little

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
the type of you know you use a little
