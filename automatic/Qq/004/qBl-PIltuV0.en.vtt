00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
nervous and I kind of just wanted to

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.760 
nervous and I kind of just wanted to
explain<00:01:00.059> myself<00:01:00.239> okay<00:01:00.840> all<00:01:01.410> right<00:01:01.559> I

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
explain myself okay all right I

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.110 
explain myself okay all right I
understand<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.609> think<00:01:02.699> people

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
understand it and I think people

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.000 
understand it and I think people
appreciate<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.750> too<00:01:03.930> but<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.350> think<00:01:04.680> it's

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
appreciate that too but I think it's

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.260 
appreciate that too but I think it's
hard<00:01:05.220> for<00:01:05.280> people<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.729> understand<00:01:06.150> like

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
hard for people to understand like

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.000 
hard for people to understand like
