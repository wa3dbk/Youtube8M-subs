00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
for the UI segmented control so we're

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.280 
for the UI segmented control so we're
gonna<00:01:12.810> go<00:01:13.020> by<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.290> outlet<00:01:14.180> to<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.210> segment<00:01:16.170> and

gonna go by the outlet to I segment and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.410 
gonna go by the outlet to I segment and
control<00:01:16.880> we're<00:01:17.880> gonna<00:01:18.000> call<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.360> couldn't

things so you don't get all confused and
we're<00:01:28.320> gonna<00:01:28.439> make<00:01:28.650> an<00:01:28.770> iboutlet<00:01:29.930> for<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.290> UI

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
we're gonna make an iboutlet for the UI

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.100 
we're gonna make an iboutlet for the UI
label<00:01:32.060> all<00:01:33.060> right<00:01:33.150> now<00:01:33.299> I'm<00:01:33.450> gonna<00:01:33.689> call<00:01:33.990> it

label all right now I'm gonna call it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.410 
label all right now I'm gonna call it
label<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.829> that's<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.250> outlet<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.119> label

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
label so that's the outlet for a label

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.810 
label so that's the outlet for a label
now<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.680> I'm<00:01:37.979> showing<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.430> simple

now I'm just I'm showing you a simple

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.819 
now I'm just I'm showing you a simple
demonstration<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.720> course<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.619> build

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
demonstration of course you can build

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.109 
demonstration of course you can build
off<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.220> as<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.579> said<00:01:42.890> let's<00:01:43.890> go<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.119> let's

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
off of this as I said let's go to let's

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.700 
off of this as I said let's go to let's
do<00:01:45.780> another<00:01:45.930> ID<00:01:46.259> outlet<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:48.030> UI<00:01:48.299> button<00:01:48.710> and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
do another ID outlet for a UI button and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.030 
do another ID outlet for a UI button and
we'll<00:01:50.100> call<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.369> button<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:51.750> you'll<00:01:52.680> see<00:01:52.890> where

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
we'll call it button so you'll see where

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.460 
we'll call it button so you'll see where
this<00:01:53.130> comes<00:01:53.310> into<00:01:53.579> play<00:01:53.960> you<00:01:54.960> will<00:01:55.079> understand

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
this comes into play you will understand

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.709 
this comes into play you will understand
it<00:01:55.590> by<00:01:55.710> hopefully<00:01:56.520> you'll<00:01:56.939> understand<00:01:57.420> if<00:01:57.540> at

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
it by hopefully you'll understand if at

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.850 
it by hopefully you'll understand if at
the<00:01:57.840> end<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.790> video<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:01.049> we<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.560> three

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
the end of the video so we have three

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.370 
the end of the video so we have three
one<00:02:02.130> for<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.460> UI<00:02:02.579> say<00:02:02.850> ran<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.149> control<00:02:03.479> one

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
one for the UI say ran in control one

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.819 
one for the UI say ran in control one
for<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.710> UI<00:02:04.829> label<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.460> one<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.000> button

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
for the UI label and one for the button

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.600 
for the UI label and one for the button
and<00:02:07.829> now<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.069> action<00:02:08.849> sends<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> action<00:02:10.610> to

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
and now we action sends the action to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.780 
and now we action sends the action to
the<00:02:11.790> segmented<00:02:12.480> control<00:02:12.810> telling<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.349> what

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
the segmented control telling it what

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.729 
the segmented control telling it what
we're<00:02:14.790> gonna<00:02:14.879> go<00:02:15.090> -<00:02:15.689> IB<00:02:16.260> action<00:02:19.400> switch

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
we're gonna go - IB action switch

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:30.140 
we're gonna go - IB action switch
control<00:02:22.739> and<00:02:25.159> ID<00:02:26.159> center<00:02:27.000> okay<00:02:28.760> so<00:02:29.760> now<00:02:29.879> let's

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
control and ID center okay so now let's

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.179 
control and ID center okay so now let's

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
we're gonna make an if statement first

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.409 
we're gonna make an if statement first
and<00:02:55.169> explain<00:02:55.530> this<00:02:55.680> all<00:02:55.919> as<00:02:56.180> well<00:02:57.180> as<00:02:57.299> I

the what segment you tap on is zero so

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.379 
the what segment you tap on is zero so
zero<00:04:26.639> is

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
zero is

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.420 
zero is
four<00:04:27.689> is<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.560> far<00:04:29.550> left<00:04:29.879> side<00:04:31.189> segment<00:04:32.189> piece

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
four is the far left side segment piece

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.869 
four is the far left side segment piece
and<00:04:32.729> one<00:04:33.629> is<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:34.110> one<00:04:34.259> next<00:04:34.409> to<00:04:34.590> that<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.949> if

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:35.879 
and one is the one next to that and if

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.119 
and one is the one next to that and if
you<00:04:35.999> would<00:04:36.150> want<00:04:36.330> to<00:04:36.389> do<00:04:36.539> more<00:04:36.810> you<00:04:37.800> would<00:04:37.919> just

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
you would want to do more you would just

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.909 
you would want to do more you would just
copy<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.639> paste<00:04:38.879> this<00:04:39.120> and<00:04:39.330> add<00:04:40.110> two<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:40.860> two

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
copy and paste this and add two and two

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.450 
copy and paste this and add two and two
would<00:04:41.729> be<00:04:41.759> the<00:04:41.879> one<00:04:42.120> next<00:04:42.479> to<00:04:42.689> one<00:04:43.499> so<00:04:44.340> it<00:04:44.430> goes

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
would be the one next to one so it goes

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.029 
would be the one next to one so it goes
from<00:04:44.610> left<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.419> right<00:04:45.689> and<00:04:45.900> so<00:04:46.529> on<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:46.889> so

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
from left to right and so on and so

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:47.450 
from left to right and so on and so
forth

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
forth

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.730

and here we're just saying that the

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.309 
and here we're just saying that the
label<00:04:50.159> that<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.879> the<00:04:51.300> text<00:04:51.629> of<00:04:51.749> the<00:04:51.840> label<00:04:51.960> is

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
label that the the text of the label is

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.420 
label that the the text of the label is
gonna<00:04:52.499> be<00:04:52.710> this<00:04:53.520> is<00:04:53.699> first<00:04:53.969> and<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:55.139> button<00:04:55.710> at

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
gonna be this is first and the button at

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.659 
gonna be this is first and the button at
the<00:04:56.610> bottom<00:04:56.699> that<00:04:56.909> we're<00:04:56.999> gonna<00:04:57.090> be<00:04:57.270> making<00:04:58.199> is

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
the bottom that we're gonna be making is

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.820 
the bottom that we're gonna be making is
hidden<00:04:59.669> it's<00:05:00.599> not<00:05:00.930> hidden<00:05:01.169> so<00:05:01.710> you<00:05:02.460> can<00:05:02.689> either

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
hidden it's not hidden so you can either

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.129 
hidden it's not hidden so you can either
equal<00:05:04.830> that<00:05:04.979> to<00:05:05.159> no<00:05:05.340> or<00:05:05.639> equal<00:05:06.029> that<00:05:06.210> yes<00:05:06.599> so<00:05:06.930> in

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
equal that to no or equal that yes so in

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:08.959 
equal that to no or equal that yes so in
this<00:05:07.229> case<00:05:07.469> it's<00:05:07.860> not<00:05:08.340> gonna<00:05:08.550> be<00:05:08.699> hidden

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:08.969 
this case it's not gonna be hidden

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:11.629 
this case it's not gonna be hidden
hidden<00:05:09.539> and<00:05:09.870> in<00:05:10.259> this<00:05:10.379> case<00:05:10.680> it<00:05:10.979> is<00:05:11.039> going<00:05:11.550> to

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
hidden and in this case it is going to

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.610 
hidden and in this case it is going to
be<00:05:11.729> hidden<00:05:13.580> okay<00:05:14.580> so<00:05:15.419> that's<00:05:16.080> pretty<00:05:16.139> much<00:05:16.349> it

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
be hidden okay so that's pretty much it

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.469 
be hidden okay so that's pretty much it
we're<00:05:16.830> just<00:05:16.949> going<00:05:17.129> to<00:05:17.159> be<00:05:17.279> do<00:05:17.729> two<00:05:18.000> segments

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
we're just going to be do two segments

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:24.050 
we're just going to be do two segments
and<00:05:20.180> for<00:05:21.180> this<00:05:21.300> time<00:05:21.479> but<00:05:21.689> you<00:05:21.810> can<00:05:22.020> as<00:05:22.879> you<00:05:23.879> can
