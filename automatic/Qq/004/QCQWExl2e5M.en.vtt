just what i'm doing is facilitate
movement<00:00:17.640> facilitate<00:00:18.640> the<00:00:19.030> flexibility<00:00:20.020> and

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
movement facilitate the flexibility and

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.410 
movement facilitate the flexibility and
strength<00:00:20.440> so<00:00:20.950> different<00:00:21.910> technique<00:00:22.240> i<00:00:22.390> use

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
strength so different technique i use

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.930 
strength so different technique i use
the<00:00:22.750> 1i<00:00:22.930> right<00:00:23.380> now<00:00:23.500> i<00:00:23.530> use<00:00:23.650> the<00:00:23.980> most<00:00:24.010> is<00:00:24.460> try

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.840 
the 1i right now i use the most is try
genex<00:00:25.330> which<00:00:26.290> is<00:00:26.530> basically<00:00:27.190> in<00:00:27.670> a<00:00:27.820> nutshell

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
genex which is basically in a nutshell

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.609 
genex which is basically in a nutshell
as<00:00:28.840> a<00:00:28.870> way<00:00:29.260> of<00:00:29.290> telling<00:00:29.710> the<00:00:29.920> muscle<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:32.410> tell

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
as a way of telling the muscle to tell

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.079 
as a way of telling the muscle to tell
the<00:00:32.739> brain<00:00:32.980> while<00:00:33.339> I<00:00:33.579> need<00:00:33.820> to<00:00:33.940> be<00:00:34.059> more

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.089 
the brain while I need to be more

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:36.419 
the brain while I need to be more
flexible<00:00:34.480> I<00:00:35.019> can<00:00:35.350> do<00:00:35.530> more<00:00:35.679> flexible<00:00:36.100> and<00:00:36.280> I

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:36.429 
flexible I can do more flexible and I

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:41.040 
flexible I can do more flexible and I
can<00:00:36.640> be<00:00:37.440> stronger<00:00:38.440> so<00:00:39.359> you<00:00:40.359> want<00:00:40.600> a<00:00:40.719> technique

bicep and so what I'm doing and trying

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.969 
bicep and so what I'm doing and trying
to<00:01:21.039> assist<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.670> bicep<00:01:22.119> by<00:01:22.329> activating<00:01:22.990> muscle

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
to assist the bicep by activating muscle

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.760 
to assist the bicep by activating muscle
around<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:25.149> biceps<00:01:25.689> to<00:01:25.929> assistance<00:01:26.560> so<00:01:26.740> that

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
around the biceps to assistance so that

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.490 
around the biceps to assistance so that
the<00:01:27.549> bicep<00:01:27.939> can<00:01:28.149> work<00:01:28.420> with<00:01:28.600> good<00:01:28.810> support<00:01:29.259> and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
the bicep can work with good support and

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.919 
the bicep can work with good support and
when<00:01:30.159> it<00:01:30.310> does<00:01:30.640> a<00:01:30.670> flexion<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.600> extension

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
when it does a flexion and the extension

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.850 
when it does a flexion and the extension
and<00:01:32.229> so<00:01:32.380> on<00:01:32.530> well<00:01:33.310> that<00:01:33.549> it's<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:35.229> not<00:01:35.500> just

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
and so on well that it's it's not just

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.940 
and so on well that it's it's not just
working<00:01:36.340> with<00:01:36.700> tissue<00:01:37.689> around<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:38.200> is<00:01:38.500> full<00:01:38.799> of

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
working with tissue around it is full of

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.950 
working with tissue around it is full of
scars<00:01:39.219> issue<00:01:39.490> it<00:01:39.939> cannot<00:01:40.240> pick<00:01:40.569> it<00:01:40.719> up<00:01:40.840> the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
scars issue it cannot pick it up the

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.380 
scars issue it cannot pick it up the
track<00:01:41.259> it's<00:01:41.710> an<00:01:41.829> embedded<00:01:42.189> and<00:01:42.340> so<00:01:42.520> on<00:01:42.579> it's

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
track it's an embedded and so on it's

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.320 
track it's an embedded and so on it's
basically<00:01:43.600> just<00:01:43.689> a<00:01:44.020> way<00:01:44.560> of<00:01:44.590> helping<00:01:45.330> healing

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
basically just a way of helping healing

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.839 
basically just a way of helping healing
faster<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.909> right<00:01:49.209> now<00:01:49.240> we<00:01:49.420> got<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.810> PEC<00:01:50.140> minor

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:50.849 
faster so right now we got the PEC minor

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.620 
faster so right now we got the PEC minor
peg<00:01:51.849> miners<00:01:52.179> as<00:01:52.299> an<00:01:52.420> internal<00:01:52.780> rotation<00:01:53.110> and

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
peg miners as an internal rotation and

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.389 
peg miners as an internal rotation and
he<00:01:55.630> had<00:01:55.750> a<00:01:55.780> bit<00:01:56.110> of<00:01:56.140> issue<00:01:56.349> i<00:01:56.500> was<00:01:57.069> doing<00:01:57.280> his

cracking<00:02:06.640> sound<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:07.479> so<00:02:07.750> i'm<00:02:07.899> just<00:02:07.929> looking

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
cracking sound and so i'm just looking

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.830 
cracking sound and so i'm just looking
at<00:02:08.590> you<00:02:08.709> see<00:02:08.950> if<00:02:09.579> i'm<00:02:09.759> trying<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.209> with<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:10.569> try

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
at you see if i'm trying to with a try

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.140 
at you see if i'm trying to with a try
genex<00:02:11.170> technique<00:02:11.620> I'm<00:02:11.829> just<00:02:12.310> trying<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.760> make

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
genex technique I'm just trying to make

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.470 
genex technique I'm just trying to make
sure<00:02:13.959> it's<00:02:14.340> going<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.430> be<00:02:15.519> I<00:02:15.730> do<00:02:15.940> said<00:02:16.269> you<00:02:16.360> get

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
sure it's going to be I do said you get

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.500 
sure it's going to be I do said you get
some<00:02:16.690> testing<00:02:17.170> so<00:02:17.380> late<00:02:17.590> tension<00:02:17.980> test

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
some testing so late tension test

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.430 
some testing so late tension test
contraction<00:02:19.510> test<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.019> make<00:02:20.139> sure<00:02:20.170> it's

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
contraction test and make sure it's

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.729 
contraction test and make sure it's
firing<00:02:20.799> properly<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.970> has<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.180> proper<00:02:22.750> i<00:02:22.989> signal

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
firing properly it has a proper i signal

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.140 
firing properly it has a proper i signal
you<00:02:23.769> so<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.010> already<00:02:24.190> started<00:02:24.609> and<00:02:24.970> it's

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
you so I already started and it's

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.789 
you so I already started and it's
already<00:02:25.450> better<00:02:25.690> than<00:02:25.810> what<00:02:25.989> it<00:02:26.109> was<00:02:26.139> he<00:02:26.769> was

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
already better than what it was he was

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.039 
already better than what it was he was
admitted<00:02:27.370> there's<00:02:28.000> about<00:02:28.180> 10<00:02:28.450> degrees<00:02:28.600> less

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
admitted there's about 10 degrees less

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.770 
admitted there's about 10 degrees less
so<00:02:29.530> now<00:02:29.560> somebody<00:02:30.160> in<00:02:30.250> cryogenics<00:02:30.880> it's

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
so now somebody in cryogenics it's

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.379 
so now somebody in cryogenics it's
gotten<00:02:32.230> gained<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.500> bit<00:02:32.769> more<00:02:33.389> flexibility

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:34.389 
gotten gained a bit more flexibility

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:34.890 
gotten gained a bit more flexibility
with

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
with

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.610 
with
and<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:36.310> contraction<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.349> gradually<00:02:38.349> push

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
and is a contraction so gradually push

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.309 
and is a contraction so gradually push
against<00:02:39.040> my<00:02:39.189> hand<00:02:39.480> it's<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.569> bit<00:02:40.750> more<00:02:40.959> quack

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
against my hand it's a bit more quack

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.550 
against my hand it's a bit more quack
all<00:02:41.500> crisp<00:02:41.890> so<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.730> react<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.150> be<00:02:43.420> quicker<00:02:43.720> ok

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
all crisp so you react to be quicker ok

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.160 
all crisp so you react to be quicker ok
so<00:02:45.489> again<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:46.030> I'll<00:02:46.150> just<00:02:46.180> do<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.540> anyway<00:02:46.930> if

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
so again so I'll just do it anyway if

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.850 
so again so I'll just do it anyway if
usually<00:02:47.709> if<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.129> body<00:02:48.370> needs<00:02:48.670> it<00:02:49.680> don't<00:02:50.680> they

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
usually if the body needs it don't they

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.910 
usually if the body needs it don't they
feel<00:02:51.209> I'm<00:02:52.209> not<00:02:52.450> bringing<00:02:52.659> much<00:02:52.810> pressure<00:02:53.079> it's

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.710 

it's<00:02:56.920> very<00:02:57.280> very<00:02:57.640> dellinger<00:02:58.180> pressure<00:02:58.450> it's

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
it's very very dellinger pressure it's

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.440 
it's very very dellinger pressure it's
not<00:02:58.930> much<00:02:59.310> but<00:03:00.310> it's<00:03:00.459> enough<00:03:00.579> as<00:03:00.939> you<00:03:01.060> can<00:03:01.239> see

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
not much but it's enough as you can see

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.849 
not much but it's enough as you can see
to<00:03:01.689> wait<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.349> muscle<00:03:02.769> up<00:03:04.170> sorry<00:03:05.170> oh<00:03:05.349> I'm<00:03:05.709> not

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
to wait the muscle up sorry oh I'm not

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.680 
to wait the muscle up sorry oh I'm not
it's<00:03:06.010> not<00:03:06.129> funny<00:03:07.739> but<00:03:08.739> it's<00:03:08.920> very<00:03:09.220> I'm<00:03:09.909> barely

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
it's not funny but it's very I'm barely

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.229 
it's not funny but it's very I'm barely
doing<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.409> can<00:03:11.650> barely<00:03:12.549> spreading<00:03:13.150> the

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
doing this I can barely spreading the

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.509 
doing this I can barely spreading the
fiber<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:14.530> want<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:14.799> be<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:14.950> professional

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
fiber you want to be a professional

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.490 
fiber you want to be a professional
athlete<00:03:15.670> that's<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.720> steps<00:03:17.019> behind<00:03:17.260> the

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
athlete that's the steps behind the

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:25.610 
athlete that's the steps behind the
scene<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:24.220> usually<00:03:24.790> this<00:03:25.030> type<00:03:25.269> of<00:03:25.299> reaction

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
scene so usually this type of reaction

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.399 
scene so usually this type of reaction
means<00:03:26.620> you<00:03:26.799> will<00:03:27.010> react<00:03:27.340> well<00:03:27.579> to<00:03:28.139> press<00:03:29.139> again

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:29.409 
means you will react well to press again

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:34.770 
means you will react well to press again
30<00:03:29.739> on<00:03:29.920> track<00:03:30.299> ok<00:03:31.299> Oh<00:03:32.040> resistant<00:03:33.780> definitely

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
30 on track ok Oh resistant definitely

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.270 
30 on track ok Oh resistant definitely
is<00:03:34.870> crisper<00:03:35.349> but<00:03:35.379> he<00:03:35.650> still<00:03:35.859> has<00:03:36.040> some

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
is crisper but he still has some

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.869 
is crisper but he still has some
trembling<00:03:37.560> so<00:03:38.560> again<00:03:38.889> I'll<00:03:39.069> look<00:03:39.220> around<00:03:39.400> and

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
trembling so again I'll look around and

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.150 
trembling so again I'll look around and
see<00:03:40.480> what<00:03:40.629> I<00:03:40.660> you<00:03:40.780> slowly<00:03:41.349> salgo<00:03:41.919> from

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
see what I you slowly salgo from

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.150 
see what I you slowly salgo from
structure<00:03:42.669> muscle<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.180> muscle<00:03:43.299> and<00:03:43.769> see<00:03:44.769> in<00:03:45.040> a

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
structure muscle to muscle and see in a

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.819 
structure muscle to muscle and see in a
vessel<00:03:45.730> hey<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.750> weakest<00:03:47.230> link<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:47.650> I<00:03:47.769> know

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
vessel hey the weakest link and I know

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.559 
vessel hey the weakest link and I know
what<00:03:48.190> works<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:48.699> doesn't<00:03:48.849> work<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.299> from

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
what works it doesn't work and from

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.439 
what works it doesn't work and from
there<00:03:49.750> we<00:03:49.930> can<00:03:49.959> move<00:03:50.290> on<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.709> then<00:03:51.669> TJ<00:03:52.030> can

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
there we can move on and then TJ can

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.899 
there we can move on and then TJ can
with<00:03:52.810> this<00:03:52.959> training<00:03:53.680> program<00:03:54.040> PJ<00:03:54.400> will<00:03:54.730> know

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
with this training program PJ will know

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:56.580 
with this training program PJ will know
okay<00:03:55.030> we<00:03:55.180> need<00:03:55.449> to<00:03:55.569> work<00:03:55.720> this<00:03:55.900> aspect<00:03:56.379> in<00:03:56.530> the

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
okay we need to work this aspect in the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.119 
okay we need to work this aspect in the
fact<00:03:57.180> or<00:03:58.180> maybe<00:03:58.449> it'll<00:03:58.569> be<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.840> deltoid<00:03:59.440> maybe

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
fact or maybe it'll be the deltoid maybe

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.949 
fact or maybe it'll be the deltoid maybe
device<00:04:00.519> have<00:04:00.760> more<00:04:01.030> a<00:04:01.060> different<00:04:01.629> angle

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
device have more a different angle

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.589 
device have more a different angle
difference<00:04:02.319> so<00:04:03.129> this<00:04:03.760> is<00:04:03.970> basically<00:04:04.209> what<00:04:04.540> I

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
difference so this is basically what I

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.890 
difference so this is basically what I
do<00:04:04.690> it<00:04:05.590> takes<00:04:05.889> it<00:04:06.099> takes<00:04:06.129> time<00:04:07.120> but<00:04:07.359> you<00:04:07.810> have

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
do it takes it takes time but you have

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.650 
do it takes it takes time but you have
good<00:04:08.049> results<00:04:08.229> with<00:04:08.470> it
