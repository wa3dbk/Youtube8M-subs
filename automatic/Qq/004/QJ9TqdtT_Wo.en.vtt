00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.849
 hello guy for a long time wanted to candle you 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.860
 tell one sensible mechanic 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.219
 advised candles on bosch carism 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.280
 platin and bought tried very stayed 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:24.150
 pleased he stumbled over me a box with 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:31.360
 bosch platinum spark steep candles 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:37.200
 this is an old century for shitty but all 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:39.670
 in fact honestly tell you they are awesome 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.950
 there is white here 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:48.370
 some kind of ceramic contact book 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.850
 fairly inexpensive candles took Russia 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.239
 trade 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.520
 Russia usual shop on Russia they there 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.810
 hare type on the fourteenth in my 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:02.670
 if I'm not mistaken under the sixteenth 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:06.670
 head turnkey 16 well, you know 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.409
 thats shorter pretty candles from personal 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.380
 a meeting 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.630
 Well, since I touched making candles 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.200
 let me show how anyone can change and 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.200
 does not know 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.749
 in order to change the candles you need for 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.000
 started to open the hood 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:27.460
 open the hood here we see this 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.479
 that's a big iron thing 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:39.780
 this is our engine in front of us we see 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:49.899
 here have a look here these things on 1 2 3 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:54.429
 3 and 4 1 coil here it is and 2 coil it 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:57.340
 the wires go from the coils too candles then 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.819
 there are essentially two times one three four 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.479
 candles 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:05.709
 what do we need to change 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.819
 these candles first need to detach 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.950
 wires 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.230
 let me show you on one coil 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.239
 the second coil is similar i'll show you 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.400
 on one side 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.400
 need to unplug the wires push 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:25.500
 we pull out on the other hand the same way 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.500
 drags under 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:38.950
 abs pulled out so we will need 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.770
 head for 10 and 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.280
 in my case it is a screwdriver with a head 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.290
 on 10 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:54.330
 we unscrew from here these 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:03:00.160
 here are these bolts that hold the coil 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:02.860
 open or 1 2 gently do not drop it 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.010
 all down there 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.740
 protection all the coil unscrewed we and him 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.550
 yearning 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.990
 pulling out abs 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:24.540
 here we see the tips with the coil itself 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:26.530
 this is one side 2 similarly so 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.290
 the coil that is, we removed 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.180
 further go just wire and him 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.790
 pull the same disconnect from 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.100
 this coil and this from here i have two 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.220
 just wires going to from the coil and 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.880
 coil mat 2 unscrew everything we have 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.880
 such channels 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.510
 candle wells 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:52.330
 there we put the key long on the 16th candlestick 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:58.610
 and in turn, unscrew the candles insert 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:02.840
 there I want to draw new ones 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:05.720
 attention to the fact that you are looking to 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.600
 these tips here were not in oil 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.910
 if they are not you then you will need 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.310
 to replace 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.460
 rings of spark plug wells 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.190
 they are now here inside they 

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:21.739
 are changing 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.050
 easy enough but you need to shoot 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.400
 the valve cover is probably different 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.710
 story about it will explain later in the Well 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.700
 basically everything is just trying 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:39.190
 explain as best I could hopefully 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.190
 I will help someone thanks before the meeting
