Ciccone<00:02:19.360> when<00:02:19.540> i<00:02:19.660> treat<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.080> parking<00:02:20.500> space<00:02:20.740> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
Ciccone when i treat a parking space the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.750 
Ciccone when i treat a parking space the
same<00:02:21.580> way<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.790> treat<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.209> woman<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:23.070> enter<00:02:24.070> it<00:02:24.220> slow

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
same way I treat a woman I enter it slow

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.050 
same way I treat a woman I enter it slow
and<00:02:25.180> smooth<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:26.050> steady<00:02:26.500> I'm<00:02:27.489> just<00:02:27.670> thinking

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
and smooth and steady I'm just thinking

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.250 
and smooth and steady I'm just thinking
am<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:28.810> on<00:02:28.840> MTV<00:02:29.560> Cribs

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
am I on MTV Cribs

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.780 
am I on MTV Cribs
then<00:02:32.260> I<00:02:32.350> thought<00:02:32.590> about<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.160> realized<00:02:33.340> maybe

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
then I thought about it I realized maybe

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.790 
then I thought about it I realized maybe
that's<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.420> reason<00:02:34.690> I'm<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.020> bad<00:02:35.230> at<00:02:35.260> parking

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
that's the reason I'm so bad at parking

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.100 
that's the reason I'm so bad at parking
so<00:02:36.190> I<00:02:36.220> also<00:02:36.459> treat<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.030> parking<00:02:37.420> space<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.720> same

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
so I also treat a parking space the same

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.199 
so I also treat a parking space the same
way<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.320> treat<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.739> woman<00:02:38.910> whenever<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:40.000> see<00:02:40.180> one

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
way I treat a woman whenever I see one

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.100 
way I treat a woman whenever I see one
that's<00:02:40.540> available<00:02:40.750> I<00:02:41.440> get<00:02:41.860> over<00:02:42.220> excited

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
that's available I get over excited

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.900 
that's available I get over excited
enter<00:02:44.110> out<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.470> wrong<00:02:44.650> angle<00:02:44.830> miss<00:02:45.550> then

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
enter out the wrong angle miss then

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.900 
enter out the wrong angle miss then
