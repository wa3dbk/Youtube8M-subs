00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
trace stuck in it this will work on 99%

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.129 
trace stuck in it this will work on 99%
of<00:00:09.990> all<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:11.150> cases<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.750> them<00:00:13.559> failing<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.429> open

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
of all the cases of them failing to open

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.630 
of all the cases of them failing to open
normally<00:00:16.139> how<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:16.320> could<00:00:16.740> tell<00:00:17.070> if<00:00:17.430> they're

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
normally how we could tell if they're

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.970 
normally how we could tell if they're
still<00:00:17.940> fixable<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.690> when<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.410> hear<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:21.150> unit

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
still fixable is when you hear the unit

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.689 
still fixable is when you hear the unit
do<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:24.080> do<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.260> um<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:26.250> could<00:00:26.400> hear<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
do the do that um you could hear the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.330 
do the do that um you could hear the
mechanism<00:00:27.269> going<00:00:27.529> for<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.619> tray<00:00:28.890> would<00:00:29.099> just

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
mechanism going for the tray would just

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:38.240 
mechanism going for the tray would just
not<00:00:29.519> open<00:00:31.430> you<00:00:32.430> hear<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:36.950> so<00:00:37.950> let's<00:00:38.070> get

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
not open you hear it going so let's get

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.560 
not open you hear it going so let's get
to<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:39.770> what<00:00:40.770> we're<00:00:40.980> gonna<00:00:41.160> do<00:00:41.430> um<00:00:41.730> it's

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
to it what we're gonna do um it's

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.619 
to it what we're gonna do um it's
basically<00:00:43.850> get<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.000> unit<00:00:45.300> up<00:00:45.450> obviously<00:00:46.610> and

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
basically get the unit up obviously and

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.830 
basically get the unit up obviously and
peel<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.960> plastic<00:00:49.559> right<00:00:49.800> here<00:00:50.809> now<00:00:51.809> you

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
peel this plastic right here now you

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.220 
peel this plastic right here now you
could<00:00:52.110> use<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.289> knife<00:00:52.649> or<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.489> can<00:00:53.670> use<00:00:53.820> your

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
could use a knife or you can use your

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.720 
could use a knife or you can use your
regular<00:00:55.230> flip<00:00:55.800> screwdriver

regular flip screwdriver

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.670 
regular flip screwdriver
I'll<00:00:57.239> use<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> knife<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.530> convenience

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and you're gonna basically peel it out

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.359 
and you're gonna basically peel it out
carefully<00:01:02.789> little<00:01:03.120> by<00:01:03.239> little<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:04.220> it<00:01:05.220> should

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
carefully little by little and it should

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.179 
carefully little by little and it should
come<00:01:05.549> out<00:01:05.790> without<00:01:06.330> much<00:01:07.080> trouble<00:01:10.010> once<00:01:11.010> on

come out without much trouble once on

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.200 
come out without much trouble once on
the<00:01:11.280> inside<00:01:13.189> you're<00:01:14.189> gonna<00:01:14.310> you're<00:01:14.850> gonna<00:01:14.970> be

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the inside you're gonna you're gonna be

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.050 
the inside you're gonna you're gonna be
able<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.659> see<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.229> tiny<00:01:16.619> wheel<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.880> what

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
able to see this tiny wheel this is what

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.719 
able to see this tiny wheel this is what
holds<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.509> city<00:01:18.750> down<00:01:18.990> when<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.549> insert<00:01:20.549> an

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
holds the city down when you insert an

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.719 
holds the city down when you insert an
exceeding<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.360> what<00:01:21.570> not<00:01:22.100> however<00:01:23.100> what<00:01:23.700> I

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
exceeding and what not however what I

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.700 
exceeding and what not however what I
discover<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.869> might<00:01:25.080> be<00:01:25.290> holding

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
discover is that it might be holding

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.070 
discover is that it might be holding
down<00:01:25.890> too<00:01:26.220> much<00:01:26.430> since<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.750> what<00:01:27.990> is

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
down too much since it is what is

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.830 
down too much since it is what is
actually<00:01:29.780> making<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.960> trade<00:01:31.320> not<00:01:31.560> open<00:01:32.840> see

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
actually making the trade not open see

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.749 
actually making the trade not open see
without<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.320> wheel<00:01:34.530> you'll<00:01:34.979> see<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.280> spin<00:01:35.579> for

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
without the wheel you'll see it spin for

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.140 
without the wheel you'll see it spin for
a<00:01:35.790> little<00:01:36.030> bit<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:37.460> it<00:01:38.460> will<00:01:38.549> open<00:01:38.729> without

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
a little bit and it will open without

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.359 
a little bit and it will open without
any<00:01:39.329> issue<00:01:39.509> however<00:01:40.110> if<00:01:40.500> we<00:01:40.590> were<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.860> put<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> CD

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
any issue however if we were to put a CD

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.940 
any issue however if we were to put a CD
inside<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.110> would<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.530> go<00:01:43.710> all

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
inside of it this it would just go all

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.389 
inside of it this it would just go all
over<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.670> skid<00:01:45.210> scratch<00:01:45.540> break<00:01:46.079> or<00:01:46.439> cause<00:01:46.979> any

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
over and skid scratch break or cause any

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.510 
over and skid scratch break or cause any
more<00:01:47.640> more<00:01:48.299> serious<00:01:48.720> internal<00:01:49.110> damage<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:50.369> now

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
more more serious internal damage so now

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.429 
more more serious internal damage so now
in<00:01:50.850> order<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.240> fix<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.689> type<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.930> problem

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
in order to fix this type of problem

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.639 
in order to fix this type of problem
what<00:01:53.430> we'll<00:01:53.640> do<00:01:54.110> give<00:01:55.110> me<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.590> second<00:01:57.649> to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
what we'll do give me just a second to

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.069 
what we'll do give me just a second to
get<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.040> tiny<00:01:59.399> wheel<00:01:59.700> now<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.840> tiny

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
get this tiny wheel now and this tiny

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.730 
get this tiny wheel now and this tiny
what<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.409> could<00:02:01.560> basically<00:02:01.740> see<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:03.740> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
what you could basically see that the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.730 
what you could basically see that the
wheel<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.130> itself<00:02:05.579> has<00:02:06.030> three<00:02:06.409> little<00:02:07.409> teeth

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
wheel in itself has three little teeth

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.619 
wheel in itself has three little teeth
that<00:02:08.610> are<00:02:09.349> wedge<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:11.220> little

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
that are wedge in this little

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.059 
that are wedge in this little
compartment<00:02:12.629> so<00:02:12.989> let's<00:02:13.140> take<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.379> apart

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
compartment so let's take it apart

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.809 
compartment so let's take it apart
we'll<00:02:14.280> take<00:02:14.549> it<00:02:14.700> apart<00:02:15.000> by<00:02:15.209> basically<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:16.819> so

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
we'll take it apart by basically just so

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.170 
we'll take it apart by basically just so
you<00:02:17.909> comes<00:02:18.239> out<00:02:18.420> very<00:02:18.629> easily<00:02:18.930> by<00:02:20.030> doing<00:02:21.030> it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
you comes out very easily by doing it

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.270 
you comes out very easily by doing it
arm<00:02:21.480> counterclockwise<00:02:22.439> o'clock<00:02:23.040> eyes

right there but now we're going to get
one<00:03:02.519> of<00:03:02.670> these<00:03:02.819> tiny<00:03:03.180> pieces<00:03:03.420> underneath<00:03:04.349> the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
one of these tiny pieces underneath the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.729 
one of these tiny pieces underneath the
metal<00:03:05.340> plate<00:03:06.079> how<00:03:07.079> are<00:03:07.139> you<00:03:07.290> gonna<00:03:07.379> do<00:03:07.590> that

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
metal plate how are you gonna do that

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.910 
metal plate how are you gonna do that
well<00:03:08.519> we're<00:03:08.819> just<00:03:08.849> gonna<00:03:09.530> not<00:03:10.530> put<00:03:10.799> it

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
well we're just gonna not put it

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.420 
well we're just gonna not put it
correctly<00:03:11.549> and<00:03:12.109> there's<00:03:13.109> a<00:03:13.379> multiple<00:03:13.950> ways<00:03:14.190> to

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
correctly and there's a multiple ways to

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.300 
correctly and there's a multiple ways to
doing<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:15.019> one<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.290> discoveries<00:03:16.889> is

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
doing that one that I discoveries is

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.099 
doing that one that I discoveries is
basically<00:03:17.790> just<00:03:18.090> left<00:03:18.449> a<00:03:18.599> little<00:03:18.780> bit<00:03:19.049> and

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
basically just left a little bit and

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.559 
basically just left a little bit and
lift<00:03:22.109> a<00:03:22.290> little<00:03:22.530> bit<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:22.859> just<00:03:23.329> have<00:03:24.329> the

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
lift a little bit and just have the

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.250 
lift a little bit and just have the
other<00:03:24.750> two<00:03:25.049> pieces<00:03:26.299> go<00:03:27.299> in<00:03:27.480> accordingly<00:03:27.989> like

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
other two pieces go in accordingly like

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.500 
other two pieces go in accordingly like
that<00:03:29.930> so<00:03:30.930> like<00:03:31.139> that<00:03:31.349> we<00:03:31.650> could<00:03:31.859> see<00:03:32.239> that<00:03:33.239> the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
that so like that we could see that the

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.890 
that so like that we could see that the
tube<00:03:33.750> little<00:03:34.049> plastic<00:03:34.470> teeth<00:03:34.739> are<00:03:35.069> in<00:03:35.519> there

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
tube little plastic teeth are in there

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.330 
tube little plastic teeth are in there
correctly<00:03:36.900> however<00:03:37.139> this<00:03:37.470> other<00:03:37.799> one<00:03:38.069> it's

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
correctly however this other one it's

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.490 
correctly however this other one it's
underneath<00:03:38.849> where<00:03:39.239> it's<00:03:39.389> supposed<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.780> be<00:03:39.930> so

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
underneath where it's supposed to be so

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.390 
underneath where it's supposed to be so
we<00:03:40.560> have<00:03:40.769> some<00:03:41.069> some<00:03:41.519> hard<00:03:41.730> off<00:03:41.819> on<00:03:41.970> an<00:03:42.090> even

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
we have some some hard off on an even

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.610 
we have some some hard off on an even
thing<00:03:44.400> not<00:03:44.819> so<00:03:45.120> nicely<00:03:45.510> place<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:46.049> regardless

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
thing not so nicely place but regardless

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.780 
thing not so nicely place but regardless
