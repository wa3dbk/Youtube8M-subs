00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.950
 in the business of kicking 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:15.950
 oriane cloutier hello attitude 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.170
 agreed to wear our clown nose so 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.710
 to not take things too personal 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.970
 did remember that life is 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.859
 so much easier and simpler 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.320
 when you have the right attitude and the right attitude 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.910
 does that mean what 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.760
 these two positions because it's the head 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.800
 not to take the head 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.629
 people often me I have I've had 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.500
 comments to say we know nothing 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.239
 looks like you 're still good 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.860
 mood was always smiling 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.239
 it looks like nothing ever goes wrong 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.440
 in your life I reassure you I am 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.920
 normal I am human 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.170
 I do not have a perfect life and this is 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.899
 not always pink and cloudless 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.030
 it's just that I chose not to 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.229
 not focus and on what they see 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.729
 always mans I could give you a 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.130
 example I snatched my mirror 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.360
 practically my cars mistake by 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.830
 I imagine a snowplow I never 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.810
 because I came back from a 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.229
 training a day to lorient in a 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.740
 very busy street is very narrow and 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.049
 my mirror was very chipped what I 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.430
 tell me I say to myself the city wanted 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.720
 send me the message to remind me 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.610
 because it's my side mirror 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.950
 driver to remind me that life 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.320
 for perfect than any perfect time 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.090
 so accept to have as being 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.979
 human being and not being a party 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.150
 I 'm trying to tell you maybe that 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.119
 I leave an eye and then I try to 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.399
 to forget or is there not 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.259
 maybe but it allows me to put a 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.090
 smile on my face sometimes when we 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.540
 open I have more taste to cry than 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.899
 to laugh when it's tax time 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.890
 that we have badly planned our things and 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.850
 that we had not planned an amount 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.869
 of money we have to shell out I 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.840
 could have a bad attitude 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.490
 and then start crying started white 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.250
 but the government starts to blame 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.000
 the whole world will not change the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.580
 situation 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.440
 so for gpo always to ride 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.210
 yes things happen for reasons 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.130
 it's not always fun I'm here 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.250
 first to tell you that I surrender 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.610
 account that the things I have to live the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.720
 things 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.640
 hard so all the slaps of the times 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.530
 we receive 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.220
 but I accept to live them and put 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.880
 my clown nose 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.250
 when it's necessary to call me 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.530
 to laugh at me to remind myself that the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.450
 ridiculous kills and that I accept to be 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.450
 in a video to watch you with a 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.000
 study it reminds me of a story when 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.330
 I saw artists entrepreneurs and I 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.850
 tell me wow must really have 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:56.850
 the humility of times to dress in 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.830
 weird eccentric costumes for and 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.170
 do not see any criticism 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.090
 I think it's impressive but I 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.520
 so precisely the artists 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.940
 are a perfect example of altitude 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.490
 in these cases where whaou 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.740
 to accept self-laughing to accept from 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.330
 do not take personal things 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.430
 I see so many people stop 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.019
 on what others say 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.060
 stop letting yourself be shaken by this 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.610
 that others say that will not change the 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.959
 situation and it's you the worst when 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.010
 you are storing the simple ones that you 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.800
 have frustration 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.200
 gd a friend at the pot a long time we were talking 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.790
 this cottage is you it's roof 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.489
 because you are the ones who stop 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.239
 to sleep is it that made you hard to 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.920
 dead and who two of the bad blood with 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.100
 this situation the others did not 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.709
 yet that leaves them the right to 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:51.180
 jerk off and change your web attitude 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.610
 wear your clown nose remember 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.530
 him as often as possible and smile 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.530
 to life and life will make you well
