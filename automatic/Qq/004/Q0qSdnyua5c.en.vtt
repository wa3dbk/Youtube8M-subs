00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.490 
the concept of what this episode
actually<00:02:03.210> tries<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.540> do<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.930> kind<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.290> once

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
actually tries to do and it kind of once

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.959 
actually tries to do and it kind of once
again<00:02:04.740> proves<00:02:05.070> my<00:02:05.250> theory<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.729> where<00:02:05.939> I

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
again proves my theory of where I

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.270 
again proves my theory of where I
thought<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.630> story<00:02:06.810> was<00:02:06.990> going<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.290> go<00:02:07.590> for

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
thought the story was going to go for

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.300 
thought the story was going to go for
instance

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310

about you know aki-nee and saying that

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.390
