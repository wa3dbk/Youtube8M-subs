00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
that that you can take over so pretty

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.709 
that that you can take over so pretty
much<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:43.069> splits<00:03:43.459> you<00:03:43.579> it<00:03:44.120> takes<00:03:44.389> the<00:03:44.449> three

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:44.719 
much it splits you it takes the three

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:46.599 
much it splits you it takes the three
servers<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.620> it<00:03:45.709> gives<00:03:45.859> you<00:03:45.949> a<00:03:45.980> color<00:03:46.310> there's

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
servers and it gives you a color there's

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.390 
servers and it gives you a color there's
green<00:03:46.879> red<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.209> blue<00:03:47.689> now<00:03:48.049> what<00:03:48.919> you<00:03:48.949> can<00:03:49.099> do

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
green red and blue now what you can do

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.289 
green red and blue now what you can do
is<00:03:49.669> you<00:03:49.819> go<00:03:49.969> into<00:03:50.299> them<00:03:50.449> self<00:03:50.750> again<00:03:52.299> you

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
is you go into them self again you

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.119 
is you go into them self again you
basically<00:03:53.599> just<00:03:53.930> end<00:03:54.319> up<00:03:54.439> gathering<00:03:54.949> like

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
basically just end up gathering like

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:56.800 
basically just end up gathering like
these<00:03:55.310> points<00:03:55.790> everything<00:03:56.180> like<00:03:56.329> that<00:03:56.359> for

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
these points everything like that for

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.229 
these points everything like that for
capturing<00:03:57.590> outpost<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.639> like<00:03:58.849> that<00:03:59.030> and<00:03:59.180> you

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
capturing outpost and like that and you

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.929 
capturing outpost and like that and you
can<00:03:59.329> capture<00:03:59.540> them<00:03:59.780> in<00:04:00.759> various<00:04:01.759> different

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:01.939 
can capture them in various different

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:06.580 
can capture them in various different
ways<00:04:02.120> by<00:04:03.099> breaking<00:04:04.099> down<00:04:04.129> the<00:04:04.310> walls<00:04:04.340> of<00:04:05.590> you

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
ways by breaking down the walls of you

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.860 
ways by breaking down the walls of you
know<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.829> gates<00:04:07.009> or<00:04:07.310> whatever

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
know the gates or whatever

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.940 
know the gates or whatever
you<00:04:09.870> know<00:04:10.020> where<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.290> can<00:04:10.410> break<00:04:10.560> down<00:04:10.590> walls

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
you know where you can break down walls

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.130 
you know where you can break down walls
as<00:04:11.250> well<00:04:11.520> you<00:04:12.209> can<00:04:12.360> fully<00:04:12.540> break<00:04:12.750> down<00:04:12.930> all<00:04:13.050> the

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
as well you can fully break down all the

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.780 
as well you can fully break down all the
walls<00:04:13.290> if<00:04:13.560> you<00:04:13.650> really<00:04:13.890> want<00:04:14.130> but<00:04:14.459> I<00:04:14.489> mean<00:04:14.700> that

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
walls if you really want but I mean that

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.370 
walls if you really want but I mean that
takes<00:04:15.060> time<00:04:15.330> and<00:04:15.360> you<00:04:15.720> know<00:04:15.840> let's<00:04:15.989> face<00:04:16.169> it

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
takes time and you know let's face it

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.770 
takes time and you know let's face it
when<00:04:16.500> you're<00:04:16.650> being<00:04:16.919> invaded<00:04:17.459> you<00:04:18.450> don't

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
when you're being invaded you don't

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.319 
when you're being invaded you don't
really<00:04:18.959> have<00:04:19.200> you<00:04:19.530> know<00:04:19.560> much<00:04:19.980> time<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.549> do

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
really have you know much time to do

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.150 
really have you know much time to do
that<00:04:22.850> but<00:04:23.850> pretty<00:04:24.120> much<00:04:24.620> easier<00:04:25.620> ways<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.830> get

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
that but pretty much easier ways to get

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.100 
that but pretty much easier ways to get
in<00:04:26.370> besides<00:04:26.760> just<00:04:27.000> using<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.480> your<00:04:27.720> basic

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
in besides just using you your basic

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.090 
in besides just using you your basic
guys<00:04:28.260> on<00:04:28.500> foot<00:04:28.740> is<00:04:29.010> they<00:04:29.310> have<00:04:29.580> ballistas<00:04:31.100> that

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
guys on foot is they have ballistas that

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.510 
guys on foot is they have ballistas that
got<00:04:32.510> trebuchet<00:04:33.830> catapult<00:04:34.830> it<00:04:35.250> may<00:04:35.400> have

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
got trebuchet catapult it may have

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.780 
got trebuchet catapult it may have
battering<00:04:36.030> rams<00:04:36.620> to<00:04:37.620> make<00:04:37.800> things<00:04:38.190> easier<00:04:38.580> now

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
battering rams to make things easier now

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.700 
battering rams to make things easier now
you<00:04:38.850> have<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.360> build<00:04:39.540> them<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:40.050> they<00:04:40.500> take<00:04:40.680> a

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
you have to build them and they take a

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.520 
you have to build them and they take a
little<00:04:40.860> while<00:04:41.070> to<00:04:41.250> build<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.760> the<00:04:42.530> enemies

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
little while to build and the enemies

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.580 
little while to build and the enemies
can<00:04:43.860> actually<00:04:44.310> destroy<00:04:44.840> them<00:04:45.840> when<00:04:46.440> they're

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
can actually destroy them when they're

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.230 
can actually destroy them when they're
in<00:04:46.740> construction<00:04:47.340> so<00:04:47.580> you<00:04:47.639> kind<00:04:47.880> of<00:04:47.940> got<00:04:48.120> to

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
in construction so you kind of got to

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.760 
in construction so you kind of got to
protect<00:04:48.540> them<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:48.840> everything<00:04:49.080> that<00:04:49.320> I<00:04:49.380> mean

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
protect them and everything that I mean

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.640 
protect them and everything that I mean
well<00:04:50.340> vs<00:04:50.639> world<00:04:50.790> actually<00:04:51.150> takes<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:51.650> pretty

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
well vs world actually takes a pretty

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.320 
well vs world actually takes a pretty
decent<00:04:53.010> amount<00:04:53.190> of<00:04:53.220> strategy<00:04:53.700> so<00:04:53.880> i<00:04:53.910> would

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
decent amount of strategy so i would

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.580 
decent amount of strategy so i would
suggest<00:04:54.450> really<00:04:54.840> running<00:04:55.110> around<00:04:55.440> with<00:04:55.530> a

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
suggest really running around with a

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.140 
suggest really running around with a
good<00:04:55.740> group<00:04:55.919> of<00:04:56.040> people<00:04:58.700> but<00:04:59.700> once<00:05:00.030> you

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
good group of people but once you

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.670 
good group of people but once you
actually<00:05:00.330> break<00:05:00.720> through<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.110> walls<00:05:01.350> of<00:05:01.590> the

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
actually break through the walls of the

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.990 
actually break through the walls of the
game<00:05:01.889> what's<00:05:02.160> going<00:05:02.310> to<00:05:02.370> happen<00:05:02.700> is<00:05:02.820> they're

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
game what's going to happen is they're

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.060 
game what's going to happen is they're
going<00:05:03.120> to<00:05:03.180> have<00:05:03.360> an<00:05:03.479> elite<00:05:03.780> dude<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.410> you<00:05:04.979> know
