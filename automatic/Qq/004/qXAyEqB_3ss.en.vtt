00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
with a spawn trapping guide on the map

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.799 
with a spawn trapping guide on the map
dome<00:00:09.620> so<00:00:10.620> this<00:00:11.219> map<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.880> pretty<00:00:12.330> simple<00:00:12.630> a

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
dome so this map is pretty simple a

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.379 
dome so this map is pretty simple a
spawn<00:00:13.080> trap<00:00:13.349> on<00:00:13.590> on<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.519> simplest<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.089> all

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
spawn trap on on the simplest of all

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.240 
spawn trap on on the simplest of all
maps<00:00:15.690> maybe<00:00:16.320> next<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.920> mission<00:00:17.580> or<00:00:17.880> carbon<00:00:18.660> um

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
maps maybe next to mission or carbon um

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.830 
maps maybe next to mission or carbon um
so<00:00:20.250> basically<00:00:20.279> on<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.180> map<00:00:21.420> you're<00:00:21.750> gonna

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
spawn for like every single map and I'd

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.399 
spawn for like every single map and I'd
literally<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.909> able<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.240> go<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:37.049> by<00:01:37.200> myself

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409

literally be able to go just by myself
and<00:01:37.799> spawn<00:01:38.070> trap<00:01:38.340> also<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.450> making<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.840> more

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
and spawn trap also be making a more

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.990 
and spawn trap also be making a more
advanced<00:01:40.740> guide<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.250> spawn<00:01:41.430> trapping<00:01:41.700> with

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
advanced guide for spawn trapping with

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.639 
advanced guide for spawn trapping with
the<00:01:42.240> spawns<00:01:42.540> exactly<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.229> they'll<00:01:43.350> be<00:01:43.439> able<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
the spawns exactly so they'll be able to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.749 
the spawns exactly so they'll be able to
spawn<00:01:43.860> right<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.189> front<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.549> than<00:01:44.700> you
