00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 something happens you think you also wanted 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.390
 well it's not what I really had in 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.390
 mind 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.730
 what would happen 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.130
 if some of us is a sinner 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.130
 now if it seriously happens to the human 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.770
 virgin because I'm your older brother and 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.530

 because it's sin I keep telling myself that 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.560

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.560

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.140
 I dream of girls like you 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.199
 subjects in the kingdom of god we can not 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.449
 get lost we can not leave like that and that's 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.490
 a horrible sin the bible calls it 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.080
 abomination in Leviticus if a man 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.979
 sleep with another man both deserve 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.950
 the death penalty 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.070

 and a homosexual wants to leave behind his 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.270
 homosexuality and find a psychiatrist 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.430
