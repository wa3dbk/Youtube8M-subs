00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
hi my name is Enoch Neff if you

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.549 
hi my name is Enoch Neff if you
subscribe<00:00:09.690> my<00:00:09.840> channel<00:00:10.200> then<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.440> will

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
subscribe my channel then you will

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.770 
subscribe my channel then you will
probably<00:00:10.830> recognize<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:11.759> tree<00:00:12.090> it's<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.570> UM

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
probably recognize this tree it's the UM

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.980 
probably recognize this tree it's the UM
tree<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.259> started<00:00:13.650> last<00:00:13.799> winter<00:00:14.269> in<00:00:15.269> some

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
tree that I started last winter in some

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.040 
tree that I started last winter in some
part<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.560> tree<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.300> wire<00:00:18.300> already<00:00:18.570> began

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
part of the tree the wire already began

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.370 
part of the tree the wire already began
to<00:00:19.289> cut<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.130> today<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:21.060> have<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.810> remove<00:00:22.140> this

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
to cut in so today I have to remove this

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.470 
to cut in so today I have to remove this
and<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:23.039> have<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.269> prune<00:00:24.269> the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
and I have to prune the

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.010 
and I have to prune the
long<00:00:26.109> and<00:00:26.470> lagging<00:00:27.189> branches<00:00:28.090> to<00:00:28.449> just<00:00:28.779> get

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
long and lagging branches to just get

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.270 
long and lagging branches to just get
more<00:00:29.410> attractive<00:00:30.689> more<00:00:31.689> attractive<00:00:32.169> canopy

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.770 

so<00:00:36.280> this<00:00:36.430> is<00:00:36.520> an<00:00:36.579> example<00:00:36.940> of<00:00:37.150> a<00:00:37.360> wire<00:00:37.570> that

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
so this is an example of a wire that

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.310 
so this is an example of a wire that
began<00:00:38.020> to<00:00:38.230> cut<00:00:38.440> in<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:39.790> is<00:00:39.879> to<00:00:40.030> say<00:00:40.210> that<00:00:40.320> this

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
began to cut in it is to say that this

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.189 
began to cut in it is to say that this
is<00:00:41.470> no<00:00:41.589> big<00:00:41.769> problem<00:00:42.250> on<00:00:42.489> elm<00:00:43.390> trees<00:00:43.809> and

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
is no big problem on elm trees and

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.360 
is no big problem on elm trees and
especially<00:00:44.920> on<00:00:45.010> this<00:00:45.129> tree<00:00:45.400> here<00:00:45.820> that<00:00:46.269> is

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
especially on this tree here that is

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.430 
especially on this tree here that is
developing<00:00:48.370> very<00:00:48.430> fast<00:00:48.670> but<00:00:49.360> it<00:00:49.660> is<00:00:49.780> a<00:00:49.809> big

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
developing very fast but it is a big

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.660 
developing very fast but it is a big
problem<00:00:50.800> on<00:00:51.160> conifers<00:00:51.820> because<00:00:52.660> these<00:00:52.900> marks

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
problem on conifers because these marks

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.020 
problem on conifers because these marks
will<00:00:54.690> probably<00:00:55.690> never<00:00:55.900> ever<00:00:56.079> heal<00:00:56.620> so<00:00:57.030> here

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
will probably never ever heal so here

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.090 
will probably never ever heal so here
you<00:00:58.149> can<00:00:58.270> see<00:00:58.539> a<00:00:58.750> mark<00:00:59.079> of<00:00:59.350> two<00:00:59.789> wires<00:01:00.789> that<00:01:01.539> I

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
you can see a mark of two wires that I

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.160 
you can see a mark of two wires that I
applied<00:01:03.100> two<00:01:04.030> years<00:01:04.360> ago<00:01:04.660> and<00:01:05.020> the<00:01:06.750> mark<00:01:07.750> was

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
applied two years ago and the mark was

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.370 
applied two years ago and the mark was
pretty<00:01:08.530> deep<00:01:08.770> one<00:01:09.100> year<00:01:09.430> ago<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:09.910> in<00:01:10.630> one

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
pretty deep one year ago and in one

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.820 
pretty deep one year ago and in one
year's<00:01:11.830> time<00:01:11.890> this<00:01:12.750> mark<00:01:13.750> became<00:01:14.229> very<00:01:14.440> flat

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
year's time this mark became very flat

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.749 
year's time this mark became very flat
and<00:01:15.130> even<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:15.700> so<00:01:16.000> in<00:01:16.270> some<00:01:17.200> years<00:01:17.560> no<00:01:18.550> one

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
and even and so in some years no one

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.100 
and even and so in some years no one
will<00:01:18.789> ever<00:01:19.090> notice<00:01:19.570> that

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
will ever notice that

00:01:20.110 --> 00:03:25.710 
will ever notice that
why<00:01:20.440> was<00:01:20.740> applied<00:01:21.100> on<00:01:21.280> this<00:01:21.429> branch<00:01:21.759> here

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.479 

so<00:03:26.720> this<00:03:26.900> is<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.140> finish<00:03:27.410> tree<00:03:27.650> as<00:03:28.160> you<00:03:28.340> can

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
so this is the finish tree as you can

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.460 
so this is the finish tree as you can
see<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:28.970> managed<00:03:29.420> to<00:03:29.569> make<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.750> bundle<00:03:30.019> in<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.290> very

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
see I managed to make a bundle in a very

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.949 
see I managed to make a bundle in a very
short<00:03:30.860> time<00:03:31.220> in<00:03:31.250> only<00:03:31.550> half<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:32.000> year<00:03:32.030> from<00:03:32.569> raw
