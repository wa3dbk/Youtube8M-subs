has a more attractive on/off button

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.540 
has a more attractive on/off button
rather<00:00:40.399> than<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:41.590> switch<00:00:42.590> on<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:43.129> previous

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
rather than the switch on the previous

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.540 
rather than the switch on the previous

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
one with the red on off light now what

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.000 
one with the red on off light now what
you'll<00:00:46.670> find<00:00:46.940> with<00:00:47.269> the<00:00:47.809> glaad<00:00:48.050> a<00:00:48.289> model<00:00:48.800> of

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
you'll find with the glaad a model of

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.489 
you'll find with the glaad a model of
the<00:00:49.850> dual<00:00:50.030> purpose<00:00:50.210> machine<00:00:50.690> is<00:00:51.199> that<00:00:51.379> it

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:51.499 
the dual purpose machine is that it

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:53.279 
the dual purpose machine is that it
differs<00:00:51.890> from<00:00:51.920> some<00:00:52.429> of<00:00:52.550> its<00:00:52.699> Chinese

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
differs from some of its Chinese

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.590 
differs from some of its Chinese
counterparts<00:00:54.289> because<00:00:54.949> it<00:00:55.579> has<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:56.179> nice

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
counterparts because it has a nice

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.500 
counterparts because it has a nice
smooth<00:00:57.230> operation<00:00:58.219> for<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:58.670> movement<00:00:59.390> of<00:00:59.449> the

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
smooth operation for the movement of the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.509 
smooth operation for the movement of the
carriage<00:00:59.899> so<00:01:00.440> instead<00:01:00.829> on<00:01:01.010> some<00:01:01.249> of<00:01:01.339> the

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
carriage so instead on some of the

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.149 
carriage so instead on some of the
Chinese<00:01:01.909> ones<00:01:02.239> where<00:01:02.569> you<00:01:02.749> have<00:01:02.780> a<00:01:03.159> push-pull

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
Chinese ones where you have a push-pull

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.060 
Chinese ones where you have a push-pull
system<00:01:04.940> on<00:01:05.089> there<00:01:05.300> you<00:01:05.840> have<00:01:06.080> two<00:01:06.500> wheels<00:01:06.770> and

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
system on there you have two wheels and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.899 
system on there you have two wheels and
outer<00:01:07.310> wheel<00:01:08.229> move<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:09.640> miscarriage<00:01:10.640> from

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
outer wheel move the miscarriage from

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.030 
outer wheel move the miscarriage from
left<00:01:11.150> to<00:01:11.210> right<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:11.810> then<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.680> have<00:01:12.830> a<00:01:12.860> nice

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
left to right and then you have a nice

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.149 
left to right and then you have a nice
in<00:01:13.820> a<00:01:13.940> wheel<00:01:14.150> which<00:01:14.960> moves<00:01:15.260> the<00:01:15.530> cylinder

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
in a wheel which moves the cylinder

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.219 
in a wheel which moves the cylinder
carriage<00:01:16.490> from<00:01:16.790> left<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.119> right<00:01:17.329> it's<00:01:18.020> very

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
carriage from left to right it's very

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.350 
carriage from left to right it's very
quick<00:01:18.530> easy<00:01:18.860> motion<00:01:21.460> or<00:01:22.460> you'll<00:01:22.610> find<00:01:22.939> on<00:01:23.180> the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
quick easy motion or you'll find on the

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.230 
quick easy motion or you'll find on the
globe<00:01:24.079> machines<00:01:24.439> is<00:01:24.799> this<00:01:25.040> Bo<00:01:25.520> clamp<00:01:25.820> holder

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
globe machines is this Bo clamp holder

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.560 
globe machines is this Bo clamp holder
that<00:01:26.840> allows<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.430> clamp<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.729> mortise<00:01:29.360> key

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
that allows you to clamp the mortise key

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.859 
that allows you to clamp the mortise key
in<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.320> jaws<00:01:30.560> here<00:01:30.860> but<00:01:31.100> then<00:01:31.219> the<00:01:31.340> Bo<00:01:31.579> is

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
in the jaws here but then the Bo is

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.569 
in the jaws here but then the Bo is
clamped<00:01:32.869> at<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:33.229> other<00:01:33.409> end<00:01:33.680> that<00:01:33.829> means<00:01:34.310> when

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
clamped at the other end that means when

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.910 
clamped at the other end that means when
the<00:01:34.700> cutter<00:01:35.030> is<00:01:35.420> cutting<00:01:35.899> the<00:01:36.020> key<00:01:36.229> it<00:01:36.649> won't

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
the cutter is cutting the key it won't

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.749 
the cutter is cutting the key it won't
spin<00:01:37.549> and<00:01:38.299> go<00:01:39.110> out<00:01:39.289> of<00:01:39.320> alignment<00:01:39.640> you'll<00:01:40.640> also

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
spin and go out of alignment you'll also

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.060 
spin and go out of alignment you'll also
find<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.210> difference<00:01:41.509> between<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:42.289> newer

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
find the difference between the newer

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.719 
find the difference between the newer
model<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:43.609> the<00:01:44.060> older<00:01:44.450> model<00:01:44.719> is<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.729> the

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
model and the older model is the the

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.730 
model and the older model is the the
knob<00:01:46.969> for<00:01:47.299> clamping<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:47.930> keys<00:01:48.140> together<00:01:48.350> is<00:01:48.710> a

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
knob for clamping the keys together is a

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.810 
knob for clamping the keys together is a
lot<00:01:48.979> smoother<00:01:49.460> a<00:01:50.350> lot<00:01:51.350> easier<00:01:51.799> to<00:01:52.009> use<00:01:52.250> as

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
lot smoother a lot easier to use as

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.680 
lot smoother a lot easier to use as
opposed<00:01:53.180> to<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.509> slightly<00:01:54.109> older<00:01:54.259> type
