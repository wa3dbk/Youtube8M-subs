00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
right now so I'm gonna do it um probably

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.960 
right now so I'm gonna do it um probably
all<00:01:43.860> those<00:01:44.100> calls<00:01:44.369> were<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.820> different

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
all those calls were just a different

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.810 
all those calls were just a different
units<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:46.290> my<00:01:46.530> next<00:01:46.799> video<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.100> was<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.549> she

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
units so on my next video I was like she

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.240 
units so on my next video I was like she
loves<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.149> vote<00:01:48.899> her<00:01:49.470> um<00:01:49.710> we're<00:01:49.950> gonna<00:01:50.009> figure
