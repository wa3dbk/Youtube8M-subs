and will come complete with rest and

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.690 
and will come complete with rest and
waterproofing<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> Galaxy<00:01:04.439> s5<00:01:04.949> it

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
waterproofing just like the Galaxy s5 it

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.609 
waterproofing just like the Galaxy s5 it
also<00:01:05.909> will<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:06.240> nice<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.659> see<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.110> Galaxy<00:01:07.500> Note

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
also will be nice to see the Galaxy Note

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.670 
also will be nice to see the Galaxy Note
4<00:01:07.890> with<00:01:08.460> even<00:01:08.820> more<00:01:09.260> outdoor<00:01:10.260> proof

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
4 with even more outdoor proof

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.890 
4 with even more outdoor proof
capabilities<00:01:11.400> like<00:01:11.610> maybe<00:01:12.360> make<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.630> even

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
capabilities like maybe make it even

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.899 
capabilities like maybe make it even
more<00:01:12.930> water<00:01:13.380> resistant<00:01:13.860> than<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.130> galaxy<00:01:14.549> s5

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
more water resistant than the galaxy s5

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.270 
more water resistant than the galaxy s5
because<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.689> Galaxy<00:01:16.110> s5<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.890> little<00:01:17.159> bit

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
because the Galaxy s5 it's a little bit

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.280 
because the Galaxy s5 it's a little bit
water<00:01:17.430> resistant<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.180> don't<00:01:18.689> dump<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.110> too

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
water resistant but don't dump it in too

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.140 
water resistant but don't dump it in too
much<00:01:19.439> water<00:01:19.680> because<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.220> will<00:01:20.430> give<00:01:20.850> out<00:01:21.000> on

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
much water because it will give out on

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.850 
much water because it will give out on
you<00:01:21.270> eventually<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.229> could<00:01:22.500> see<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> note

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
you eventually if we could see the note

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.410 
you eventually if we could see the note
4<00:01:23.070> even<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.400> even<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.880> little<00:01:24.060> bit<00:01:24.210> more

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
4 even be even a little bit more

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.730 
4 even be even a little bit more
resistant<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.020> would<00:01:25.140> be<00:01:25.229> great<00:01:25.439> more<00:01:25.619> like

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
resistant that would be great more like

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.219 
resistant that would be great more like
