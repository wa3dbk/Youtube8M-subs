00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:21.590 
in now your engine maybe just a little

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.519 
in now your engine maybe just a little
bit<00:07:22.069> different<00:07:22.580> but<00:07:23.150> basically<00:07:23.389> all<00:07:24.080> the

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:24.529 
bit different but basically all the

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:27.490 
bit different but basically all the
injectors<00:07:25.009> come<00:07:25.219> out<00:07:25.370> the<00:07:25.520> same<00:07:25.789> way<00:07:26.500> they

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.500 
injectors come out the same way they

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.040 
injectors come out the same way they
might<00:07:27.740> some<00:07:28.039> of<00:07:28.069> the<00:07:28.279> Yamaha<00:07:28.699> injectors<00:07:29.389> the

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.050 
might some of the Yamaha injectors the

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.800 
might some of the Yamaha injectors the
high-pressure<00:07:30.469> units<00:07:30.979> on<00:07:31.129> the<00:07:31.250> back<00:07:31.810> most

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:32.810 
high-pressure units on the back most

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.920 
high-pressure units on the back most
some<00:07:33.020> are<00:07:33.169> on<00:07:33.229> the<00:07:33.349> side<00:07:33.650> most<00:07:34.430> of<00:07:34.580> the

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:34.930 
some are on the side most of the

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.779 
some are on the side most of the
Mercury's<00:07:35.930> are<00:07:36.110> on<00:07:36.199> the<00:07:36.349> side<00:07:36.589> but<00:07:37.580> they're

00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:37.789 
Mercury's are on the side but they're

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:40.029 
Mercury's are on the side but they're
basically<00:07:38.270> all<00:07:38.419> the<00:07:38.750> Sun<00:07:38.990> just<00:07:39.349> find<00:07:39.560> you<00:07:39.740> fuel

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:40.039 
basically all the Sun just find you fuel

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:42.490 
basically all the Sun just find you fuel
rail<00:07:40.279> you<00:07:40.610> injectors<00:07:41.150> make<00:07:42.139> you<00:07:42.289> a<00:07:42.319> little

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:42.500 
rail you injectors make you a little

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.600 
rail you injectors make you a little
diagram<00:07:42.770> how<00:07:43.310> everything<00:07:43.759> goes<00:07:44.000> apart<00:07:45.580> put<00:07:46.580> it

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:46.610 
diagram how everything goes apart put it

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.249 
diagram how everything goes apart put it
back<00:07:46.699> together<00:07:46.909> the<00:07:47.300> same<00:07:47.539> way<00:07:47.779> and<00:07:48.110> you're

00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:48.259 
back together the same way and you're

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:56.770 
back together the same way and you're
done

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:56.780 

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.840
