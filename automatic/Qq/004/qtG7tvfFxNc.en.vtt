away<00:00:37.290> guys<00:00:37.829> we<00:00:38.640> can't<00:00:39.120> resist<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.600> urge<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.780> do

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
away guys we can't resist the urge to do

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.170 
away guys we can't resist the urge to do
that<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.379> yeah<00:00:40.860> did<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.309> find<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.059> be

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
that I yeah did you find it to be

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.250 
that I yeah did you find it to be
compelling<00:00:46.340> do<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.430> think<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:47.789> real<00:00:48.260> yeah

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
compelling do you think it's real yeah

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.779 
compelling do you think it's real yeah
that's<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.770> question<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.160> always<00:00:50.370> comes<00:00:50.460> up

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
that's the question that always comes up

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.740 
that's the question that always comes up
with<00:00:50.969> these<00:00:51.059> videos<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:52.370> think<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.699> one<00:00:54.059> I'm

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
with these videos I think this one I'm

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.540 
with these videos I think this one I'm
gonna<00:00:54.899> say<00:00:54.989> yes<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.590> think<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.890> was<00:00:56.010> real<00:00:56.219> for

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
gonna say yes I think it was real for

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.680 
gonna say yes I think it was real for
the<00:00:56.670> first<00:00:56.879> time<00:00:57.059> one<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.239> these<00:00:57.390> videos<00:00:57.660> that

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the first time one of these videos that

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.540 
the first time one of these videos that
we've<00:00:57.930> drawn<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.289> kind<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.980> thought<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.250> might

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
we've drawn I kind of thought it might

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.670 
we've drawn I kind of thought it might
be<00:00:59.699> fake<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> reasons<00:01:01.140> are<00:01:01.469> because

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
be fake and but the reasons are because

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.319 
be fake and but the reasons are because
there's<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> weird<00:01:02.460> glitchy<00:01:02.879> moment

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
there's like a weird glitchy moment

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.640 
there's like a weird glitchy moment
maybe<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.629> was<00:01:03.750> my<00:01:03.870> internet<00:01:04.199> where<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.409> ball

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
maybe it was my internet where the ball

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.620 
maybe it was my internet where the ball
bounces<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> Lighting's<00:01:06.180> kind<00:01:06.510> of

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
bounces that and the Lighting's kind of

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.630 
bounces that and the Lighting's kind of
off<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.140> thought<00:01:07.860> okay<00:01:08.159> these<00:01:08.310> are<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> bunch<00:01:08.520> of

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
off I thought okay these are a bunch of

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.280 
off I thought okay these are a bunch of
frat<00:01:08.820> guys<00:01:09.000> could<00:01:09.299> they<00:01:09.390> really<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:10.260> know

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
frat guys could they really you know

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.240 
frat guys could they really you know
coordinate<00:01:11.130> even<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.549> After<00:01:11.970> Effects

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
coordinate even have After Effects

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.380 
coordinate even have After Effects
frat<00:01:14.250> guys<00:01:14.400> aren't<00:01:14.610> talented<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:15.299> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
frat guys aren't talented but to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.730 
frat guys aren't talented but to
coordinate<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.960> many<00:01:16.170> they<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.470> act<00:01:16.619> like

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
coordinate that many they can act like

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.249 
coordinate that many they can act like
they're<00:01:17.009> interested<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.549> girl<00:01:17.700> for<00:01:17.939> an<00:01:18.030> hour

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
they're interested in a girl for an hour

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.480 
they're interested in a girl for an hour
yeah<00:01:19.259> that's<00:01:19.680> really<00:01:19.830> hard<00:01:20.100> for<00:01:20.220> them<00:01:20.340> I'm

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
yeah that's really hard for them I'm

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.940 
yeah that's really hard for them I'm
sure<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> don't<00:01:21.750> know<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:22.229> cool<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.770> it's

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
sure but I don't know it's cool if it's

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.149 
sure but I don't know it's cool if it's
real<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:24.390> probably<00:01:24.869> real<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.860> think

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
real and it's probably real I I think

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.370 
real and it's probably real I I think
that<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> was<00:01:27.090> real<00:01:27.330> up<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.900> because<00:01:28.020> like

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
that it was real up just because like

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.780 
that it was real up just because like
that's<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.920> sort<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.130> thing<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.310> goes<00:01:29.520> on

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
that's the sort of thing that goes on

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.690 
that's the sort of thing that goes on
now<00:01:30.180> for<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.439> real<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.159> difficult

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
now for it to be real the difficult

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.700 
now for it to be real the difficult
thing<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.270> must<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.659> taken<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.530> many

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
thing is it must have taken so many

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.590 
thing is it must have taken so many
tries<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.520> there<00:01:35.640> was<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.820> big<00:01:36.000> crowd<00:01:36.240> there

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
tries and there was a big crowd there

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.240 
tries and there was a big crowd there
and<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.409> would<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.650> hard<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.009> get<00:01:38.100> that

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
and so it would be hard to get that

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.390 
and so it would be hard to get that
crowd<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.850> wait<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.450> with<00:01:39.630> bated<00:01:40.049> breath<00:01:40.079> for

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
crowd to wait like with bated breath for

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.850 
crowd to wait like with bated breath for
20<00:01:41.400> tries<00:01:41.640> 50<00:01:42.390> tries<00:01:42.659> ready<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.259> mean<00:01:43.649> you're

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
20 tries 50 tries ready I mean you're

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.200 
20 tries 50 tries ready I mean you're
talking<00:01:43.950> about<00:01:44.130> multiple<00:01:44.549> bounces<00:01:45.090> there

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
talking about multiple bounces there

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.090 
talking about multiple bounces there
that<00:01:45.329> shit's<00:01:45.570> difficult<00:01:46.140> yeah<00:01:46.560> I'm<00:01:46.890> gonna<00:01:47.009> be

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
that shit's difficult yeah I'm gonna be

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.889 
that shit's difficult yeah I'm gonna be
an<00:01:47.159> engineering<00:01:47.520> student<00:01:47.790> or<00:01:48.149> somebody<00:01:48.540> who's

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
an engineering student or somebody who's

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.780 
an engineering student or somebody who's
figured<00:01:49.200> out<00:01:49.439> their<00:01:49.560> trajectory<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.549> where

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
figured out their trajectory of where

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.969 
figured out their trajectory of where
it's<00:01:50.880> exactly<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.869> appropriate<00:01:52.320> force<00:01:52.680> to

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it's exactly the appropriate force to

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.480 
it's exactly the appropriate force to
apply<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.640> angle<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.450> entry<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.350> know<00:01:55.590> that

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
apply to the angle of entry I know that

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.060 
apply to the angle of entry I know that
got<00:01:56.640> weird<00:01:56.790> but<00:01:57.329> anyway<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:58.049> will<00:01:58.619> say<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.860> I

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
got weird but anyway I I will say this I

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.740 
got weird but anyway I I will say this I
want<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.729> believe<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.329> real<00:02:00.390> somebody

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
want to believe that it's real somebody
