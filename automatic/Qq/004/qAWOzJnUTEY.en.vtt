00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:04.839
 hello everyone guys I'm manuela and today I'll talk about the recent tac that that 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:07.600
 is among the various things going to touch the statistics of the famous 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.630
 the weapon so hated by most of the players who are tired of seeing 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:13.219
 only in a matter of sol 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.250
 Countess Priests Many Statistics Presenting Game Charter Understand Them 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.500
 colored bars and in the description of the weapon 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.539
 they are fake 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.800
 card I am invented I do not know based on what they have misseri 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.090
 recovered there are available real data recovered from the files on pc that 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.079
 tell us the statistics of the various weapons 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.030
 therefore 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.400
 what we are talking about now are purely speculation my head carisbo 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.400
 they are not real data but the things I have that seemed 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.220
 to be changed 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.700
 I'm pretty sure of what I say euro 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.370
 I confirmed legend of forum looking around on youtube I have the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.630
 absolute certainty only when the pc version will also receive his 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.590
 make us 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.330
 then passing the changes we say that they have been socially treated 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.370
 the first one that will be because to the eye 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.880
 for the recoil modification 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.049
 before the 3 c there is the false true quite limited recoil very predictable 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.470
 non-specific he always went to the upper right 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.070
 let's say richardson value of 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.280
 60 60 towards top right 10 10 in your absence 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.960
 a value of the day 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.410
 hey therefore allowed it to be easily corrected in general anyway 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.200
 to much less recoil 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.290
 now instead 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.120
 it would seem that these values ​​have been increased 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.400
 arequipa in mind that 70 are the values ​​of the 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.700
 higher than you see the assault foci and have been put in 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.750
 all directions laughing the extremely Swiss baby track weapon 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.470
 now for all the times it starts alone 3 doors to the left we say it is 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.190
 changed a lot and 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.460
 this brings us the second modification Pope's holy spirit attack 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.760
 superstition defines how fast Rome will return to 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.320
 own initial position and the famous in this value the cell was in fact era 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.310
 the only automatic rifle with a value of 1600 moods all the others 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.270
 rifles were around 1500 in value 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.480
 my idea is that it was definitely reduced it was probably put to 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.539
 1500 like all the other partners 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:15.419
 automatic to those rifles 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:19.430
 A single shot gust is slightly different 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:25.450
 it is this sum to change in November again - accurate. in 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:27.539
 particular from the distance 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:31.140
 the files we pass the third change in the only one in my opinion 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.230
 not necessary star has changed the targeting time almost all 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.109
 assault rifles put us 0 25 seconds 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:44.730
 to enter mode miraflor alpha used surely slower arrested 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:48.519
 affected with the videos, however, we say that machine guns read yes 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:49.699
 settle int 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:52.999
 I'm back in 35 seconds made history 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:58.189
 latin but alphan will be seem to be in half text slower than procida 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.229
 was faster than e 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:04.199
 machine guns read so I think it will be because it has but will have 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:05.020
 seen 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.889
 they said almost surely in seconds 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.099
 these are direct modifications 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.369
 that is, things actually changed or data but changes 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:20.149
 that are are consequences to this according to me proposals change the most 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:23.709
 important to when you shoot without aiming cell difference yesterday 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.139
 I heard it a lot when someone fired without aiming from a distance in 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.809
 which you were able to do that idiot now simply and you can't make it 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:34.069
 many - coolpix 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.399
 why superspeed recoil have been modified now 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:40.970
 it is no longer the same as before 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.229
 prisci away ruccelai up close like like killing icon 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:49.129
 not even a machine gun is now much more like other assault rifles 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.169
 right now it would seem that 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:56.169
 it has become a car that I April. 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:58.949
 the kind of low care possible 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:02.609
 in particular it feels the difference on the long distance ie it will serve 

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:07.309
 square from a distance over 50 meters it will be difficult to keep the apple on 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:10.719
 target you have when you don't tibi reddet as mentioned before it has become 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:13.119
 much more difficult 

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:17.269
 I personally find that from the point of view of the balance between brought forward Mrs 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.340
 surely this should solve some things 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.300
 lau that certainly more balanced than the lower related rifles 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.030
 therefore to make fame similar should eliminate this big gap 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.330
 that there was between the two categories of assault rifle I am looking for fast alassio 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.240
 it was torrent now I am convinced that many continued to use the famas 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.090
 papa is beginning to see that often hyalillo the k in command around like that 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.310
 easy adaptation 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.150
 there is the possibility that the photo ratings basin will once again be depopulated 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.330
 if you remember it was the hand being afraid 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.229
 the first few months gambling blackberry 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.490
 however from the distance with the changes they made could never 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.819
 rivaling assault rifles children could be an alternative but not you 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.389
 should replace 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.610
 I believe that corroborate 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.289
 at least as a weapon 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:03.479
 harder 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.780
 with those really played a lot with which I find myself better than the famous too 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:09.779
 before landing so I think I will continue with 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.319
 tequila and everything to finish 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.120
 flights break a lance in favor of 3d art I agree with many of those 

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:20.559
 who say that weapons are really too similar indeed if they show up 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:25.010
 the upbeat statistique data always divides the same 2 3 weapons category with 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.220
 meanwhile grana padano 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.599
 tantra lawn po about 4 hours 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:34.479
 oh oh well thinking about it boom from a more sporting point of view so to speak 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.339
 something I prefer 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:39.710
 it is obvious that the variety is beautiful even I do not like that you always see 

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:43.269
 the usual weapons, however, in the end I prefer they want few weapons 

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:44.379
 equilibrarte 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:48.340
 and that the same person prevails especially is a game like all the 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:51.449
 types more than a war simulation 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.499
 is an extremely competitive sports game 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:59.189
 and in my opinion with this peck she could have managed to give that 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:01.740
 last touch up to make it even freer here 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.219
 at least in weapons 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:07.419
 then if he undermines them the second time the stezzano carriage would become prominent 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:08.599
 via rolla 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:10.659
 this country will never happen 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:14.080
 that's all guys with that, and since I know you're a crazy fan of 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.169
 statistics no I know it is not but I am preparing videos that you 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.169
 they will explain how to lose various weapons statistics 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.200
 word from the analysis and now I put it to you on a comfortable structure 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.409
 to end 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:28.539
 no body 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:34.569
 and apart from this, of course, if you like me video, you want to be always 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:37.110
 updated on what place you subscribe to the channel 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.590
 if you want to talk to me become a fan on feisbuc torres communicate surely 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.430
 better than on youtube the links and of these things you are all described then 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:46.789
 I can't repeat 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.330
 hello everyone guys next time
