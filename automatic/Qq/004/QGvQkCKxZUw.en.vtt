 Percent of your own life is worth as much as it is easily damaged on this one 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:18.020
 Farm in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul it is 4500 its a medium sized 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:22.289
 Company of farmers romance no trace he is more processes of the summer 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.769
 the managing director for single customer studied economics and does that 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.019
 Business usually from the desk 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.410
 except when customers sign up for their visit Bultmann cooperates with me is very well 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.860
 get on more 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.860
 around 9 percent is expected 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.500
 but then at that time it was 12 8 0 2 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.940
 Brose Poletto Serb Boris 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.890
 in a matter of seconds will be on the radio in the genetic data 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.810
 indicating who the father of the animal is 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.320
 Mariak says that sorts of stations were broadcast in Brazil 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.920
 Even today, at the age of two to three, slaughtered five years ago 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.900
 Werup the protest by the church is not our work here today in it 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.480
 Animals breed more meat up to a certain age 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.690
 to produce 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.000
 We make a selection to select the animals that have a better plant 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.260
 and more muscle meat, Ryan Malone develop endless most of the mails per 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.510
 With this we gradually increase quality and efficiency to the goal 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.510
 to produce more food per hectare 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.560
 like looking at elite 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.730
 like the Czech Republic 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.340
 on the catwalk the grandmothers and grandfathers Biskys of morning 4 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.170
 since the indices Timo Asterisk most widespread in Brazil they 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.650
 tolerates heat well and has become genetic in recent decades 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.340
 beware Dr 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.350
 The attacker analyze the physique of a trend down to the smallest detail 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.350
 detail 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.970
 These are the measures of superlatives 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.970
 also in financial terms 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:12.289
 Dr 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:16.759
 here a prize winner costs over one million euros, it is a kind of test laboratory 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:19.799
 in which the genetic plants are multiplied the later on the 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.430
 Legs come and become meat 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.119
 before that was Barca 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:28.229
 the key of the genetic testing lab lies in these hands 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.769
 Brazilian state attacker into the field of research 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:32.819
 beef cattle 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.909
 We had many in the meat industry calling it the nation's bollards 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:42.739
 This is where the arch of extensive livestock farming in Brazil became possible 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.629
 made 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.150
 Bregenz of the BBC what the efficiency is writing we are researching here 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.200
 Animal is less and produces more that is our focus for the future 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:58.059
 To develop animals that eat the iger and put on more meat - the prognosis 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:59.269
 at 1 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.519
 Nothing is left to chance when it comes to feeding the animals 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.459
 Brazilian children are being kept on pasture eating grass 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.799
 which is the most sustainable which grows on which soils 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.049
 fastest 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.079
 The researchers Cole have been responsible for developing new adapted varieties 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.509
 most of them are originally from Africa 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:23.169
 when they come to the market they are called for example in Mombasa or man 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.599
 pays 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.679
 Ten years of research for an optimized kilo of meat 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:31.930
 I have to go BP 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.760
 Red June when it comes to the growing demand for animal 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.720
 Protein in the world kill motivator from Asia sure the best location 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:40.459
 take over 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.659
 We not only have the necessary space but also the necessary space 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.590
 Technology not public only logically are absolutely capable 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.540
 to double our meat production or even triple bile 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.660
 first critic 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.660
 Abruzzo way 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.119
 Even today, every third animal comes from Brazil on the world market 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:02.789
 every tenth of these companies 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:07.209
 a battle cry of the group becomes Preetz one of over 140 world-wide 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.379
 The company can sleep up to 90,000 animals per day 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.790
 Brazil's national interest in feeding the world with meat 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.090
 you tangible 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.530
 who PS up to the largest meat processor and exporter of 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.939
 World ascended 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:30.649
 from family businesses to global players with friezes of investment 

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:32.710
 the state development bank 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.710
 Brazil's government promotes growth 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:40.469
 JBS is moving $ 30 billion a year today 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.680
 and has numerous competitors in a short time around the globe 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.210
 incorporated 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.199
 Where previously offered grow so strong because opportunities opened up 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.529
 and because our customers demand it 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:59.199
 only if the market is the Berber if there is only above the demand of ours 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.079
 Culture and that is getting bigger - both elected with exorbitant 

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:06.079
 Growth figures, especially in emerging markets 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.069
 One of the more money does not claim to be the master of all things 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.389
 No Israel, we just want to serve the market 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.389
 and means that there are still young children should be in front of children 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:22.009
 and that is at the expense of the forest in the Amazon they have 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.529
 Environmental organizations like Greenpeace 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:28.179
 they denounce most meat producers do not know where from 

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:32.199
 they do not illegally buy animals from farms on their premises 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.870
 Use Amazon area 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.160
 on the map, the deforested areas are colored red 80 percent of it 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.839
 go to the account of livestock says a study of environmentalists 

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:46.710
 the degree programs to international retail chains are the goal 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.460
 putting Brazilian meat producers under economic pressure 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.510
 what you and i Betty Hoffmann many meet with the meat processors 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:57.139
 stated that its major international customers threatened 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.370
 The Brazilians did not have to cancel existing supply contracts 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.570
 take a different stance 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.510
 No borders made no global group of meat from Brazil buys 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.490
 he wants his name with the topic deforestation dirty but not so 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.170
 they have demanded from the Brazilian meat company their drivers too 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:20.180
 check something against doing Erbach the industry is taking action now 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.180
 they have to prove to the world that they came 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.990
 We expect 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.729
 how many referee support damages we do not need anymore 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:32.060
 understood to increase its production 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.919
 When it comes to environmental protection, he remains completely calm Rad Allan 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.860
 They are already breeding against this idea tomorrow that the breeders always 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.879
 against environmentalists we do not see it that much i think that 

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:48.539
 Protecting the environment and helping in the future will make our material more expensive 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:49.030
 do 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.490
 because increasing demand leads to rising prices if the 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.759
 Production is limited 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:58.999
 dpa New Year has halved the pastures for his herds - the 

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:01.509
 freed area now different 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:04.349
 we still stay 2000 hectares 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:06.069
 a lot of space for the turnaround
