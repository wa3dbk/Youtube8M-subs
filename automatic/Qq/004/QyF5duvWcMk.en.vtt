00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:11.690
 hello i am an assignment i am a teacher 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:14.030
 Biology at school I want to know here I am in 2011 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.520
 year finished first and no then 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.230
 the academy will wash you no sechenov now judging 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.869
 differently here 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.300
 studied in psychiatry residency 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.050
 now I have a residency in neurology 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.730
 childhood age at the moment then 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.880
 have I combine teaching 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.880
 activity along with the doll medical 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.060
 It seems to me that in the work of tutors 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.850
 the most important thing is to give some 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.610
 structure and system of any subject 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.220
 with her an important humanitarian subject or 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.420
 this is math with physics 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:06.980
 make students understand the principle itself 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.930
 the subject well what is that for the subject give 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.470
 structure as a chair is more accurate to find 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.300
 structured information and then 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.220
 such information is not easily digested 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.800
 remembered and there is some sort of 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.040
 logic they are just there and memorizing 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.190
 large amount of material and i try 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.450
 as much as possible at you a log more likely 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:34.590
 theoretical subject to give as much as possible 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:38.670
 I also always try to find logic 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.009
 individual approach i mean i always 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.280
 see what state the student comes in 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.280
 i.e. he can come 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.620
 sleepy and lazy and then I have to 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.040
 jiggle just a little motivate 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.020
 so here the pressure sometimes comes in 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.320
 good in this very 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.110
 lifting distance and then how would my 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.470
 the task is just not spruce support i 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.010
 always focusing on in addition to some 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.119
 minutes 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:13.550
 giving material on the student's state 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.550
 what in how it comes with what 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.260
 and if we talk about the exams will be us 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.090
 probably not only jumping in general what 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.480
 when some kind of stress situation and 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.400
 man is not anxious in summer 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.020
 the applicant for example and it is understandable 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.450
 anxiety because here in this particular 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.090
 day and hour decides everything there the future is 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.000
 partly fate you go there or 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.040
 no, and the absolute feels normal when 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.420
 this alarm, in principle, to us and 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.060
 anxiety is needed in order to 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.370
 maximally mobilized their strength and 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.380
 intellectual resources of this 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.140
 concentration there something 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.610
 remembered focused 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.970
 focused into some sort of 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.640
 details and principle 3 you are not in alarm 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.709
 nothing bad is bad when she is for something 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.080
 right off the scale that is when she 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.240
 becomes adaptive in this and when 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:33.160
 all thoughts fly and only here 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.900
 able to panic of horror and probably not 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.180
 I know if this can be called advice or 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.770
 recommendations of course important to me 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.470
 focus on the process 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.620
 current that is, if the test is necessary 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.750
 combine questions if you don't know 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.560
 these then maybe something later 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.260
 I remember in the course of action always 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.300
 right here and now stay not 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.970
 run away the future and not run away in this 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.640
 panic horror i'll fail there we are 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.500
 all this my life is over this no 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.810
 all this you can then think now 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.739
 there are specific questions and on them 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.739
 important to concentrate 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.840
 if we talk about the preparation then to me 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:46.340
 it seems that u start with the base number 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:49.430
 base that is good to get out theory before 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.730
 how to start solving tests that is 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.870
 good to know thoroughly starting there with 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:59.840
 botany and ecology well 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.180
 re base before theoretical base 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.610
 before proceeding to the test but this 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.310
 my such deep conviction is better 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.130
 spend time on theoretical knowledge 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.980
 on what to read the book than there 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.050
 run index index preparation 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:18.230
 giga and solve this in huge 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.800
 the amount of cramming un at test 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.930
 questions not the fact that they will meet 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.980
 obviously and the second point is unavailable 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:30.880
 understanding of the subject I am all overwhelmingly in 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.880
 the theory
