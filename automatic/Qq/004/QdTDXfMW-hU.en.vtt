00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
final thoughts on this kit I was really

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.790 
final thoughts on this kit I was really

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
debating whether I should give this kid

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.670 
debating whether I should give this kid
a<00:05:57.860> thumbs<00:05:58.100> up<00:05:58.280> or<00:05:58.400> not<00:05:58.490> and<00:05:58.930> my<00:05:59.930> colleague<00:06:00.500> and

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
a thumbs up or not and my colleague and

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.620 
a thumbs up or not and my colleague and
fellow<00:06:00.740> Gunpla<00:06:01.160> builder<00:06:01.340> Yuri<00:06:01.760> stepped<00:06:02.479> in

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
fellow Gunpla builder Yuri stepped in

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.990 
fellow Gunpla builder Yuri stepped in
and<00:06:02.720> said<00:06:03.280> if<00:06:04.280> you're<00:06:04.490> really<00:06:04.520> thinking<00:06:04.940> about

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
and said if you're really thinking about

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.560 
and said if you're really thinking about
it<00:06:05.180> that<00:06:05.270> much<00:06:05.510> it's<00:06:05.960> probably<00:06:06.380> a<00:06:06.410> no<00:06:06.590> and

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
it that much it's probably a no and

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.060 
it that much it's probably a no and
truthfully<00:06:08.570> when<00:06:08.810> I<00:06:08.840> think<00:06:09.080> about<00:06:09.169> it<00:06:09.350> he's

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
truthfully when I think about it he's

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.670 
truthfully when I think about it he's
kind<00:06:10.250> of<00:06:10.370> right<00:06:10.550> this<00:06:11.120> kit<00:06:11.360> requires<00:06:11.539> so<00:06:12.229> much

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
kind of right this kit requires so much

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.310 
kind of right this kit requires so much
effort<00:06:13.400> and<00:06:13.639> so<00:06:14.120> much<00:06:14.510> work<00:06:14.840> to<00:06:15.020> make<00:06:15.169> it<00:06:15.200> look

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
effort and so much work to make it look

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.680 
effort and so much work to make it look
nice<00:06:15.680> I<00:06:15.800> thought<00:06:16.039> the<00:06:16.220> chrome<00:06:17.060> finish<00:06:17.300> would

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
nice I thought the chrome finish would

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.210 
nice I thought the chrome finish would
win<00:06:17.870> me<00:06:18.020> over<00:06:18.050> and<00:06:18.470> let<00:06:18.590> me<00:06:18.680> ignore<00:06:18.860> some<00:06:19.190> of

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
win me over and let me ignore some of

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.560 
win me over and let me ignore some of
the<00:06:19.310> problems<00:06:19.639> that<00:06:19.700> the<00:06:20.060> fact<00:06:20.240> that<00:06:20.389> it's<00:06:20.510> at

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
the problems that the fact that it's at

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.600 
the problems that the fact that it's at
one<00:06:20.720> point<00:06:20.930> out<00:06:21.139> I<00:06:21.380> say<00:06:22.010> well<00:06:22.160> don't<00:06:22.370> get<00:06:22.520> the

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
one point out I say well don't get the

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.370 
one point out I say well don't get the
1.0<00:06:23.030> but<00:06:23.060> if<00:06:23.240> you<00:06:23.300> get<00:06:23.419> this<00:06:23.570> chrome<00:06:23.810> finish<00:06:24.110> it

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
1.0 but if you get this chrome finish it

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.620 
1.0 but if you get this chrome finish it
makes<00:06:24.590> it<00:06:24.710> alright<00:06:25.030> it<00:06:26.030> just<00:06:26.120> really<00:06:26.450> doesn't

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
makes it alright it just really doesn't

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.180 
makes it alright it just really doesn't
there's<00:06:26.930> so<00:06:27.169> many<00:06:27.320> problems<00:06:27.830> with<00:06:27.860> so<00:06:28.070> much

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
there's so many problems with so much

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.310 
there's so many problems with so much
time<00:06:28.580> and<00:06:28.789> effort<00:06:28.910> put<00:06:29.690> into<00:06:29.840> this<00:06:30.050> kit<00:06:30.229> to

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
time and effort put into this kit to

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.510 
time and effort put into this kit to
make<00:06:30.440> it<00:06:30.560> look<00:06:30.710> nice<00:06:30.889> and<00:06:31.100> in<00:06:31.160> the<00:06:31.250> end<00:06:31.370> it

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 
make it look nice and in the end it

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.180 
make it look nice and in the end it
looks<00:06:31.550> good<00:06:32.270> but<00:06:32.510> nothing<00:06:32.659> great<00:06:33.070> there's<00:06:34.070> the

looks good but nothing great there's the
case<00:06:34.370> of

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:34.909 
case of

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:37.210 
case of
it's<00:06:35.330> just<00:06:35.780> not<00:06:36.050> worth<00:06:36.349> the<00:06:36.380> effort

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
it's just not worth the effort

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.790 
it's just not worth the effort
so<00:06:37.520> unfortunately<00:06:38.420> I<00:06:38.870> cannot<00:06:39.230> give<00:06:39.440> this<00:06:39.590> kid
