broccoli and I buy this in a large bag
from<00:01:28.350> Costco<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.130> then<00:01:29.250> they<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.700> separate

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
from Costco and then they have separate

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.539 
from Costco and then they have separate
individual<00:01:30.720> packs<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.340> just

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
individual packs in there and I just

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.480 
individual packs in there and I just
kind<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.820> cut<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.240> open<00:01:33.920> seen<00:01:34.920> these<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
kind of cut this open seen these and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.429 
kind of cut this open seen these and
this<00:01:35.610> could<00:01:35.790> actually<00:01:35.909> be<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.329> separate<00:01:36.780> packet

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
this could actually be a separate packet

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.200 
this could actually be a separate packet
so<00:01:37.710> if<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.070> steam<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.729> for<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.030> few

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
so if you just steam this for a few

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.120 
so if you just steam this for a few
minutes<00:01:39.509> either<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.409> microwave<00:01:40.890> or<00:01:41.100> on

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
remember I'm about freezing is that I I

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.820 
remember I'm about freezing is that I I
think<00:06:04.810> a<00:06:04.870> lot<00:06:05.020> of<00:06:05.050> people<00:06:05.350> don't<00:06:05.500> do<00:06:05.710> it

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
think a lot of people don't do it

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.790 
think a lot of people don't do it
correctly<00:06:06.220> it<00:06:06.460> has<00:06:06.669> to<00:06:06.970> be<00:06:07.120> fresh<00:06:07.540> frozen<00:06:08.380> so

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
correctly it has to be fresh frozen so

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.379 
correctly it has to be fresh frozen so
you<00:06:08.860> don't<00:06:09.130> want<00:06:09.370> to<00:06:09.460> freeze<00:06:09.730> something<00:06:10.240> if

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
they freeze it within 15 minutes of

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.129 
they freeze it within 15 minutes of
cooking<00:06:39.160> something<00:06:39.520> when<00:06:40.210> you<00:06:40.360> unfreeze<00:06:40.900> it
