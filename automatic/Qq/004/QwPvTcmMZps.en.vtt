00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.910 
the truck wouldn't start the battery I
bought<00:01:52.100> back<00:01:52.340> in<00:01:52.550> January<00:01:53.330> died<00:01:53.899> on<00:01:54.170> me<00:01:54.320> so<00:01:54.860> I

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
bought back in January died on me so I

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.920 
bought back in January died on me so I
had<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:55.100> go<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.430> get<00:01:55.580> another<00:01:55.670> one<00:01:56.030> I<00:01:56.210> figured

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
had to go and get another one I figured

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.650 
had to go and get another one I figured
I'd<00:01:57.050> take<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.320> rest<00:01:57.500> of<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:57.710> day<00:01:57.830> and<00:01:57.979> do<00:01:58.130> this

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
I'd take the rest of the day and do this

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:09.490 
I'd take the rest of the day and do this
distasteful<00:01:59.660> but<00:01:59.960> necessary<00:02:01.060> activity<00:02:08.500> okay

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
distasteful but necessary activity okay

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.080 
distasteful but necessary activity okay
well<00:02:09.679> when<00:02:09.830> we<00:02:09.920> get<00:02:10.070> in<00:02:10.190> here<00:02:10.429> close<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.970> have

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
well when we get in here close and have

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.820 
well when we get in here close and have
a<00:02:11.120> look<00:02:11.390> at<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.600> problem<00:02:12.049> as<00:02:12.320> you<00:02:12.470> can<00:02:12.620> see

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
a look at the problem as you can see

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.740 
a look at the problem as you can see
that's<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.940> little<00:02:14.120> bit<00:02:14.269> of<00:02:14.360> grinding

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
that's a little bit of grinding

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.880 
that's a little bit of grinding
happening<00:02:15.140> here<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.470> that's<00:02:15.680> actually

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
happening here and that's actually

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.400 
happening here and that's actually
paper-thin<00:02:16.489> up<00:02:16.880> there<00:02:17.150> now<00:02:17.690> before<00:02:17.989> I<00:02:18.019> got<00:02:18.200> too

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
paper-thin up there now before I got too

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.080 
paper-thin up there now before I got too
carried<00:02:18.739> away<00:02:18.799> I'm<00:02:19.280> gonna<00:02:19.810> compare<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:22.489> one<00:02:22.940> I

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
carried away I'm gonna compare the one I

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.220 
carried away I'm gonna compare the one I
bought<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:24.280> run<00:02:25.280> this<00:02:25.400> on<00:02:25.640> here<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:27.019> looks

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
bought to run this on here and it looks

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.840 
bought to run this on here and it looks
close<00:02:27.470> enough<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:28.040> see<00:02:28.220> if<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.400> bolt<00:02:28.610> pattern

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
close enough to see if the bolt pattern

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.440 
close enough to see if the bolt pattern
matches<00:02:29.390> up<00:02:30.100> yeah<00:02:31.100> before<00:02:31.820> I<00:02:32.000> do<00:02:32.120> anything

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
matches up yeah before I do anything

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.699 
matches up yeah before I do anything
honest<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:32.750> got<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:32.989> pry<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:34.100> caliper<00:02:34.790> open<00:02:35.709> so

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
honest I got to pry the caliper open so

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.120 
honest I got to pry the caliper open so
that<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.070> new<00:02:37.220> pads<00:02:37.519> will<00:02:37.790> fit<00:02:37.970> in<00:02:38.120> there

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
that the new pads will fit in there

do so I'll have to try open a bit more
that's<00:04:52.460> as<00:04:52.639> far<00:04:52.850> as<00:04:52.910> it<00:04:53.120> goes

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.570 

still<00:05:29.020> gotta<00:05:29.260> do<00:05:29.500> the<00:05:29.530> other<00:05:29.830> side<00:05:30.160> but<00:05:30.490> I'm

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
still gotta do the other side but I'm

still gotta do the other side but I'm
not<00:05:30.700> gonna<00:05:31.410> show<00:05:32.410> that<00:05:32.710> I<00:05:33.190> think<00:05:33.820> this<00:05:34.150> is

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
not gonna show that I think this is

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:41.760 
not gonna show that I think this is
boring<00:05:34.720> enough<00:05:34.930> for<00:05:35.110> you<00:05:35.170> guys<00:05:35.940> yeah<00:05:40.440> the<00:05:41.440> lugs

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
boring enough for you guys yeah the lugs

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.790 
boring enough for you guys yeah the lugs
tightened<00:05:42.310> up<00:05:42.430> and<00:05:42.670> then<00:05:42.790> I<00:05:42.880> can<00:05:43.620> turn<00:05:44.620> the

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
tightened up and then I can turn the

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.460 
tightened up and then I can turn the
truck<00:05:44.980> around<00:05:46.290> and<00:05:47.290> get<00:05:47.620> the<00:05:47.740> other<00:05:47.890> side<00:05:47.980> down
