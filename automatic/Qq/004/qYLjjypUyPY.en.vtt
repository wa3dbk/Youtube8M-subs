00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 nice all smith coar guys with a 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.759
 new episode of the balotelli is broken 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.529
 milan in this episode as you see 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.900
 at the beginning I buy coppola that yes 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.309
 will reveal a good goalkeeper of the truth 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.530
 however very slow a good one 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.800
 goalkeeper but now I do n't care I have to 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.650
 say something I just wanted to tell you that 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.810
 this series will be quite short in the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.970
 sense I think I finish a dozen of them 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.689
 episodes in two weeks maybe it will be 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.990
 also already finished because I wanted to 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.180
 I do n't know how to show you how 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.910
 they will play this type of series for later 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.649
 in fifa 14 to then begin a series 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.280
 a little more complex than this 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.399
 like I'm already in mind with teams 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.680
 more expensive and obviously with the fact 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.129
 of the thousand credits to the player's goals 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.969
 oh well you understand so nothing is the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.559
 first to match 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.329
 Predict the first meeting at the verse 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.860
 she didn't play badly for she had been 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.320
 quite boring the game indeed 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.199
 ends 1 to 0 goals from balotelli there are 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.680
 there were even a few shots on goal 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:06.450
 few occasions however I win 590 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.970
 about credits that will allow me to 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.990
 buy a bulwark of the defense of 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.890
 milan 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.500
 zaccardo fact that I think is a 75 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.100
 if it was a recent 74th beast assembly 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.560
 lethal would be with 71 speed creeds 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.820
 76 say 66 defense would be 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.259
 fortissimo 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.540
 however who cares I put it in 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.430
 defense will prove to be a hallucinatory package 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.900
 evidence is at the end for a second 75 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.360
 match meet to pour we have a 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.950
 a bit lol team with midfielders 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.340
 no of the defending midfielders and bobby 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.439
 zamora in midfield there is a little laugh 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.479
 this team is in fact normal 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.420
 find these opponents at the beginning 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.340
 when you have a team with little understanding 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.460
 however the game ends one thousand a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.259
 0 with mario balotelli's first goal on 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.680
 header with cross and if not 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.450
 wrong in itself was 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.280
 which is not bad long and there will be 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.440
 several beautiful goals even within one 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.750
 goalkeeper had up to here for his 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.119
 goalkeeper was a bronze in the so oh well 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.530
 there are goals like that 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.150
 however this was a nice action 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.530
 of balotelli I forgot again 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.870
 once to change the numbers to 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.120
 players will think about it in the third episode 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:24.550
 first when registered for the third 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:27.280
 episode so I believe today I will make the changes 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.820
 of for example the mesh number 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.060
 I will put 45 balotelli at 20 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:37.420
 then zac abuse number table have 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.370
 coppola won't even go and see about 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.220
 wikipedia 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.860
 ends the game 5 to 0 with this goal 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.470
 replied replied by adrien silva 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.660
 I think it's called that that's enough 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.489
 good a nice shot is not very fast 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.550
 but I have a good midfielder 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.170
 put as attacking midfielder 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.220
 the opponent here such ugly between goals by 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.590
 adrian silba's dance two seems to me of 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.690
 having seen so I win is also not seen 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:10.269
 how many credits I buy another fan 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.760
 carpenter of the Milan is spoken of on 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.830
 muntari that boys would never have 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.630
 said but in this game and I found 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.400
 really very strong in 451 I put it 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.100
 central midfielder I always find him 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.320
 in attack to attack pull everything 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.780
 done then you will see in this match either 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.340
 in defense when he had to recover a little 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.840
 less in defense because yes 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.510
 pushed especially in attack then not 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.700
 it has a pretty high speed 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.680
 thus meeting the third game of spill 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.290
 that will have a slightly nicer team 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.060
 with whiteley to the left of the gran 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.400
 left that really quick then 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.720
 found needle ribeiro and other players 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.160
 carini in fact always passed in 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.500
 advantage this player before 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.790
 all with a goal of 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.250
 ecclestone maybe 10 then I take the ball with 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.440
 balo shooting in the door so at the house in the sky 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.290
 goal is really a sniper this 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.420
 player puts any shot that is not 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.700
 believe we are not afraid wrong one 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.700
 shot with balotelli then white on 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.310
 band puts a nice cross in the middle not 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.200
 I guess it's not no bedimo king says you go 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.540
 to take a coffee meanwhile marks thiago 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.190
 ribeiro 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.860
 I believe that if thiago ribeiro now me 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.950
 the fucking names don't come 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:29.070
 montari great header on her 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:32.040
 what a carpenter's goal that made great 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.530
 bullshit , perhaps the part of Zaccardo, not 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.950
 it was zaccardo anyway it also marks white 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.230
 of my opponent 3 to 2 for him is a 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.300
 I keep banging and repeating actions first 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.580
 first he is the next half 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.700
 muntari is still a double 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.320
 unbelievable and it almost even arrived 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.640
 on the third goal he had a couple of 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:57.090
 incredible occasions balotelli 43 shot 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.790
 this too is an infallible head 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.050
 This player is not over yet 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.190
 because you also mark my opponent 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:08.729
 still contributed true that leads on 4 4 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:12.060
 then at the end after he lost the ball 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:14.520
 on the three quarter fraction of 12 adrian si 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.200
 goes to the square to the right of the goalkeeper 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.360
 that there really can not do anything 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.720
 the game ends 4 to 5 for me 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:25.950
 to the opponent quita in this instant 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:29.210
 in fact it is nothing then ends 5 4 for 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:33.900
 I also win a lot of credits here 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:37.470
 interesting pieces like 120 only that 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.850
 now you will see something in the sense 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.700
 now I don't know how many credits or 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.770
 precisely when the ends 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:48.090
 loading I tell you 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:50.669
 they on 1300 thousand 2313 therefore are gods 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.100
 good credits unfortunately selling the rose 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.970
 since balotelli is injured one 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.560
 single day 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.380
 I don't want to buy healing 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.260
 so i will buy an attacker to do 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.200
 then replace the boys write in 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.060
 comments which attacker should 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.040
 to replace balotelli but it's not that 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.010
 there is a lot of choice or matri or pazzini 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.800
 so I don't know who you are anymore 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.900
 strong if you have tried both of them 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.540
 with which without found better me 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.180
 honestly I thought more about crazy 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.010
 because it seems a little stronger to say the least 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.110
 the truth both in the game and in reality 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.820
 but maybe even maceseanu a little more 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.320
 fast can be more dangerous 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.510
 let me know you in the comments like them 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.460
 you have found anyway raga 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.320
 the episode ends here not forgotten 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.090
 I like to leave a 200 like 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.220
 tomorrow there will be a new episode 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:41.080
 then Monday I won't be able to load another one 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:44.060
 because they are not there so it will postpone 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.420
 amarth beyond the exit of the fourth 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.090
 episode as usual I invite you to 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.970
 comment by writing which players 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:55.430
 would you prefer that I buy before and 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:58.730
 obviously the two attackers do me 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.500
 know what i should take e 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.390
 obviously subscribe to the channel at 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.970
