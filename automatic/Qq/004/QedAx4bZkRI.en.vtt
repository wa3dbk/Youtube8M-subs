00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:04.010
 a very true story 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.420
 chapter 1 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.830
 the composer 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.829
 this is the story of primitive bad face 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:14.269
 he had a very particular way of seeing life and its situations 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.130
 when he was in trouble he blamed everyone for his situation 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.769
 - to himself 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.769
 I used to be a very negative and dramatic person 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.419
 On the other hand, when he started a love relationship, he felt that his 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.180
 life had meaning he firmly believed that that person had brought him the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.740
 desired happiness 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.600
 unconsciously he believed that his partner belonged to him as if he were an object 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.000
 and when some of their love affairs ended it felt as if the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.150
 world was going to end and said things like me without you I'm dying i 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.620
 without you I have no reason to live 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.700
 at that time his friends said that his attitude did not affect anyone else more 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.260
 that to himself and that because of that the problem was not so serious 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.880
 but not all was negativity in the life of primitive no 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.690
 he had a talent 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.160
 he knew how to compose songs 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.090
 his songs were so catchy they were so easy to remember and the risk was a 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.030
 delight 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.960
 the lyrics of their songs rhymed and seemed so romantic 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.250
 suddenly primitive was famous and known for his songs 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.400
 the interpreters or singers asked him to write songs for them 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.520
 include them in your repertoire 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.230
 his friends who previously thought that his negative attitude only affected him 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.950
 the same 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.810
 they stopped thinking that 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.909
 Well now your negative thoughts your firm tendency of others to 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.790
 feeling happy and his dramatic phrases were now being repeated by millions of 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.350
 people singing their songs 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.680
 little by little a large part of the young people adopted their twisted ideas of 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.520
 love and spite because nobody told them about emotional intelligence and those 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.780
 things that seem so boring to unnecessary 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.370
 after a few years the poor primitive died thinking that his vision 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.369
 dark and painful life was the only true 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:18.769
 despite his primitive death is still present in the present as a child 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.899
 He listened to his songs and began to write his songs with the same style 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:24.289
 from primitive 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:27.649
 but he was not the only child influenced by him 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:31.969
 one day one of them realized that he lived inside a bubble and that the 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:33.209
 life was not pain 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.129
 suffering negativity and codependence 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.429
 how it made it look primitive 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:42.289
 Then he discovered this video and at that moment he understood that he was not the only one 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:46.549
 that he was giving up the mentality that was presented to him from childhood 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.569
 to start creating your own 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.430
 a more purposeful optimistic inclusive mentality 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.110
 cheerful 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.249
 sanÃ¡ and conviction 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:00.419
 he also discovered that there are songs that have this positive essence and 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.219
 began to change musical repertoire 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:08.039
 sometimes he listens to the old primitive prank songs and sings them but 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:11.279
 today in tends that it is only a song and it is no longer 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:14.279
 his life style
