00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.910
 Do you think your favorite juice is squeezed by hand with all the love and with apples 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.009
 freshly picked from the tree? Maybe not. 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.589
 Like all current foods apple juice is manufactured scale 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.629
 industrial and so it has to be 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.900
 in only one factory each year, 40 thousand tons of juice are transformed into juice 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.499
 apples 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:27.829
 In Quebec, apple juice is made mainly from apples 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:28.640
 little machines 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.200
 90% of production is done at harvest time in October 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.830
 the process begins when a conveyor belt carries the apples 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.530
 the place of inspection 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.310
 the apples fall in the reverse direction the conveyor belt so that 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:49.310
 wet leaves and other materials adhere to it 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.920
 the apples are stored in silos for several hours so that they do not 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.700
 damage too much in the fall 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.740
 this ramp 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.520
 it slows them a bit 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.620
 you can start making the juice 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.360
 you have to wash the apples 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.330
 This first bath eliminates the pebbles that usually present both the fruit fall 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.910
 As the support pickup a cold water shower completes the washing process 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.310
 the apples are cut into small pieces in this titrator to 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.590
 producing a paste are added enzymes that break down the cellular structure of 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.440
 the fruit and facilitate maximum extraction of juice 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.030
 then the pasta is sent to the maceration area where it will stay between 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.150
 60 and 90 minutes 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.420
 then the juice is extracted the paste is pumped into a powerful 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.840
 hydraulic press 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.210
 inside the press some filters retain the skin the seeds and the 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.020
 stems of apples 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.290
 Quality control is strict 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.670
 At each stage of the process, samples of the juice are taken to ensure that 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.170
 hygiene controls are met 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.060
 the juice is filtered to retain even the smallest particles 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:16.069
 the juice passes from one state to another through these immense tanks 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:22.259
 the next step that is pasteurization 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:26.849
 the juice reaches the exchanger where it is heated up to 88 degrees 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.629
 and then it goes back to cool to 50 degrees 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.139
 Enzymes are added to hydrate the pectin 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:39.459
 This is the ultrafiltration process where some filter membranes with pores 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.759
 microscopic retain even the smallest particles 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.699
 the apple how is already perfectly filtered 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.849
 it is verified its clarity its aroma its color and the content of natural sugar 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.469
 of the fruit 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:59.279
 Since the juice is produced October should be preserved all year 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:03.139
 a part of the production is stored in this sterilized warehouse where 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.149
 will wait to be bottled throughout the year 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:11.619
 Each tank can contain 110 thousand liters of filtered juice 

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:16.889
 no preservative is added 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:23.409
 then the juice is poured into the containers that are reached at a rate of 100 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:30.409
 per minute 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:37.969
 then they are hermetically sealed 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:48.679
 Two straws are stuck to the side of the tetrabricks 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.389
 In another automated chain the juice is bottled 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:02.129
 the bottles circulate in a row on this conveyor belt 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:09.129
 they are washed and disinfected with hydrogen peroxide in this sterilized room 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:16.569
 then rinse with water before moving to the filling area 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:22.779
 Each minute 120 bottles are filled with pasteurized apple juice and 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:23.669
 seal with a stopper
