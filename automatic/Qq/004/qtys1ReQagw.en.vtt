00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
think that having group studies based or

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.580 
think that having group studies based or
places<00:02:07.090> where<00:02:07.120> people<00:02:07.300> can<00:02:07.870> get<00:02:08.019> together<00:02:08.170> not

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
places where people can get together not

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.139 
places where people can get together not
have<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.069> worry<00:02:09.250> about<00:02:09.369> being<00:02:09.610> quiet<00:02:09.940> we

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
have to worry about being quiet we

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.850 
have to worry about being quiet we
definitely<00:02:10.539> be<00:02:10.629> an<00:02:10.690> asset<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:11.050> campus<00:02:11.470> having

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
definitely be an asset to campus having

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.369 
definitely be an asset to campus having
clinical<00:02:12.400> offices<00:02:12.819> on<00:02:13.060> campus<00:02:13.090> will<00:02:14.019> allow

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
clinical offices on campus will allow

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.140

more students to participate and allow

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.390 
more students to participate and allow
