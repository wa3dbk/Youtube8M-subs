00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
two little stains on it right here and

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.209 
two little stains on it right here and
another<00:00:27.619> pretty<00:00:28.789> nasty<00:00:29.789> heat<00:00:30.660> right<00:00:31.019> here<00:00:31.219> now

another pretty nasty heat right here now

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.270 
another pretty nasty heat right here now
the<00:00:32.279> LG<00:00:32.850> itself<00:00:33.719> came<00:00:34.530> out<00:00:34.739> without<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.190> scratch

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the LG itself came out without a scratch

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.459 
the LG itself came out without a scratch
which<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.090> which<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.719> most<00:00:36.899> important

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
which is which is the most important

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.700 
which is which is the most important
thing<00:00:38.000> so<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.239> case<00:00:39.540> did<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> job<00:00:40.260> really<00:00:40.530> well

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
thing so this case did a job really well

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.760 
thing so this case did a job really well
this<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> dual<00:00:44.520> layer<00:00:45.239> case<00:00:45.690> which<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.559> made

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
this is a dual layer case which is made

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.790 
this is a dual layer case which is made
out<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:46.980> two<00:00:47.190> layers<00:00:47.750> one<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.930> silicone<00:00:49.500> and

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
out of two layers one is silicone and

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.819 
out of two layers one is silicone and
the<00:00:50.129> other<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> hard<00:00:51.149> shell<00:00:51.770> now<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
the other is a hard shell now the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.740 
the other is a hard shell now the
silicone<00:00:53.489> layer<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.210> very<00:00:54.690> flexible<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:56.750> its

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
silicone layer is very flexible and its

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.779 
silicone layer is very flexible and its
main<00:00:58.050> purpose<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.129> provide<00:00:59.489> shock

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
main purpose is to provide shock

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.349 
main purpose is to provide shock

the hard shell isn't covering your case
your<00:01:14.130> phone<00:01:15.140> now<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.200> hard<00:01:17.009> shell<00:01:17.220> itself<00:01:17.670> is

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
your phone now the hard shell itself is

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.710 
your phone now the hard shell itself is
made<00:01:18.630> out<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.110> special<00:01:19.470> mixture<00:01:20.340> of

made out of a special mixture of
materials<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.990> incipio<00:01:22.770> had<00:01:23.280> registered<00:01:24.060> as

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
materials that incipio had registered as

materials that incipio had registered as
a<00:01:24.270> parent<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:25.770> tough<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:26.880> also<00:01:27.590> very

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
a parent it's tough but it's also very

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.560 
a parent it's tough but it's also very
flexible<00:01:31.009> compared<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.280> many<00:01:32.640> other<00:01:32.790> hard

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
flexible compared to many other hard

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.090 
flexible compared to many other hard
shells<00:01:34.670> it's<00:01:35.670> also<00:01:36.090> very<00:01:36.479> light<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.200> it's

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
shells it's also very light and it's

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.219 
shells it's also very light and it's
very<00:01:38.880> soft<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.570> touch

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
very soft to touch

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.160 
very soft to touch
although<00:01:40.770> it's<00:01:41.040> not<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:42.119> slippery<00:01:42.750> as<00:01:42.869> many

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
although it's not as slippery as many

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.210 
although it's not as slippery as many
other<00:01:43.409> hard<00:01:43.740> shell<00:01:44.390> cases<00:01:45.390> out<00:01:45.570> there<00:01:46.220> so

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
other hard shell cases out there so

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.990 
other hard shell cases out there so
let's<00:01:48.060> put<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.930> phone<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.220> case<00:01:53.000> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
let's put the phone in the case the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:08.820 
let's put the phone in the case the
installation<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.869> very<00:01:54.990> easy

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:16.110 

there<00:02:09.520> it<00:02:10.360> sits<00:02:10.690> very<00:02:11.620> well<00:02:12.220> on<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.760> lg<00:02:13.210> g2<00:02:15.120> you

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
there it sits very well on the lg g2 you

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.480 
there it sits very well on the lg g2 you
can<00:02:16.360> see<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.780> cutouts<00:02:17.230> for<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:17.980> camera<00:02:18.460> in

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
can see the cutouts for the camera in

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.990 
can see the cutouts for the camera in
buttons<00:02:19.030> are<00:02:19.800> really<00:02:20.800> good<00:02:23.670> also<00:02:24.670> for<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
buttons are really good also for the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.740 
buttons are really good also for the
charger<00:02:25.510> cord<00:02:25.870> right<00:02:26.530> here<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.550> speakers

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.600 

this<00:02:31.750> case<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.320> very<00:02:32.350> slim<00:02:33.070> so<00:02:33.100> it's

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
this case is very slim so it's

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.350 
this case is very slim so it's
maintaining<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.980> sliminess<00:02:35.980> of<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.520> LG<00:02:36.910> g2

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
maintaining the sliminess of the LG g2

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.770 
maintaining the sliminess of the LG g2
it<00:02:38.140> sits<00:02:38.500> really<00:02:38.710> well<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.940> can<00:02:40.000> see<00:02:40.510> that

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
it sits really well you can see that

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.260 
it sits really well you can see that
there<00:02:41.020> is<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.200> raised<00:02:41.560> lip<00:02:41.950> above<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.880> screen<00:02:43.240> a

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
there is a raised lip above the screen a

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.949 
there is a raised lip above the screen a
very<00:02:43.600> decent<00:02:45.210> raised<00:02:46.210> lip<00:02:47.070> we<00:02:48.070> should<00:02:48.959> make

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
very decent raised lip we should make

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.420 
very decent raised lip we should make
sure<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:51.250> your<00:02:51.520> LG<00:02:52.090> g2<00:02:52.990> stays<00:02:53.530> intact<00:02:53.950> in

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
sure that your LG g2 stays intact in

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.600 
sure that your LG g2 stays intact in
