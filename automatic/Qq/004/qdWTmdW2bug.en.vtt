now people tell us that the Bible is the

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.850 
now people tell us that the Bible is the
pure<00:00:06.700> Word<00:00:06.939> of<00:00:07.120> God<00:00:07.149> and<00:00:07.660> they<00:00:08.230> say<00:00:08.380> we<00:00:08.680> should

pure Word of God and they say we should

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.680 
pure Word of God and they say we should
turn<00:00:09.070> away<00:00:09.190> from<00:00:09.370> the<00:00:09.700> Quran<00:00:09.969> we<00:00:10.330> should<00:00:10.510> go<00:00:10.629> to

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
turn away from the Quran we should go to

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.610 
turn away from the Quran we should go to
the<00:00:10.930> Bible<00:00:11.260> and<00:00:11.320> my<00:00:12.929> promise<00:00:13.929> to<00:00:14.080> you<00:00:14.230> is<00:00:14.440> that

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.620 
the Bible and my promise to you is that

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.530 
the Bible and my promise to you is that
as<00:00:14.769> you<00:00:14.920> read<00:00:15.099> the<00:00:15.309> Quran<00:00:15.639> you<00:00:15.880> will<00:00:16.029> find<00:00:16.330> a

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:16.540 
as you read the Quran you will find a

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.900 
as you read the Quran you will find a
world<00:00:16.810> of<00:00:17.050> difference<00:00:17.560> but<00:00:17.920> it<00:00:18.099> is<00:00:18.220> possible

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
world of difference but it is possible

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.910 
world of difference but it is possible
that<00:00:19.060> some<00:00:19.539> people<00:00:19.570> are<00:00:20.080> not<00:00:20.260> familiar<00:00:20.529> with

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
that some people are not familiar with

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.130 
that some people are not familiar with
the<00:00:21.190> Bible<00:00:21.310> I<00:00:21.670> often<00:00:22.150> think<00:00:22.359> that<00:00:22.510> when<00:00:22.750> people

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
the Bible I often think that when people

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.170 
the Bible I often think that when people
like<00:00:23.289> Sam<00:00:23.560> come<00:00:23.800> up<00:00:23.949> here<00:00:24.279> and<00:00:24.430> they<00:00:24.699> preach<00:00:24.970> to

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
like Sam come up here and they preach to

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.150 
like Sam come up here and they preach to
us<00:00:25.270> that<00:00:25.449> the<00:00:25.539> Bible<00:00:25.869> is<00:00:25.960> 100%<00:00:26.529> the<00:00:26.859> Word<00:00:27.010> of

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
us that the Bible is 100% the Word of

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.509 
us that the Bible is 100% the Word of
God

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
God

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:28.830 
God
they're<00:00:27.730> not<00:00:27.880> quite<00:00:28.150> familiar<00:00:28.359> with<00:00:28.630> the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
they're not quite familiar with the

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.620 
they're not quite familiar with the
Bible<00:00:28.960> I<00:00:29.730> would<00:00:30.730> like<00:00:30.970> to<00:00:31.090> point<00:00:31.300> out<00:00:31.449> to<00:00:31.599> you

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
Bible I would like to point out to you

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.680 
Bible I would like to point out to you
that<00:00:31.720> in<00:00:31.990> fact<00:00:32.019> it's<00:00:32.710> a<00:00:32.830> book<00:00:33.100> if<00:00:34.059> a<00:00:34.390> book

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
that in fact it's a book if a book

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.200 
that in fact it's a book if a book
describes<00:00:35.640> history<00:00:36.640> by<00:00:37.469> gratuitously

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
describes history by gratuitously

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.869 
describes history by gratuitously
including<00:00:40.210> sexual<00:00:40.809> imagery<00:00:41.230> those<00:00:42.160> parts<00:00:42.730> of

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
including sexual imagery those parts of

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.389 
including sexual imagery those parts of
that<00:00:43.059> book<00:00:43.329> cannot<00:00:43.809> be<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.110> Word<00:00:44.260> of<00:00:44.350> God<00:00:44.410> and

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
that book cannot be the Word of God and

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.280 
that book cannot be the Word of God and
I<00:00:45.520> would<00:00:45.670> say<00:00:45.850> that<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.149> Bible<00:00:46.570> often<00:00:47.110> does

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
I would say that the Bible often does

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.770 
I would say that the Bible often does
this<00:00:47.559> and<00:00:48.399> one<00:00:48.610> place<00:00:48.850> in<00:00:49.030> which<00:00:49.180> it<00:00:49.329> does<00:00:49.510> this

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
this and one place in which it does this

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.200 
this and one place in which it does this
and<00:00:50.320> I'd<00:00:50.440> have<00:00:50.649> Sam<00:00:51.100> read<00:00:51.489> that<00:00:51.640> out<00:00:51.670> for<00:00:52.030> you

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
and I'd have Sam read that out for you

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.479 
and I'd have Sam read that out for you
is<00:00:52.420> in<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.710> Book<00:00:54.129> of<00:00:54.250> Ezekiel<00:00:54.579> in<00:00:55.059> chapter<00:00:55.930> 23

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
is in the Book of Ezekiel in chapter 23

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.220 
is in the Book of Ezekiel in chapter 23
so<00:00:57.489> I<00:00:57.520> would<00:00:57.789> ask<00:00:58.000> some<00:00:58.480> as<00:00:58.660> he's<00:00:58.809> asked<00:00:59.110> me<00:00:59.170> a

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
so I would ask some as he's asked me a

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.979 
few questions
I<00:01:00.190> would<00:01:00.579> ask<00:01:00.730> them<00:01:00.969> when<00:01:01.239> he<00:01:01.329> comes<00:01:01.600> up<00:01:01.780> here

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
I would ask them when he comes up here

I would ask them when he comes up here

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
from the Quran but I wonder how many

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.290 
from the Quran but I wonder how many
people<00:03:19.190> really<00:03:19.370> think<00:03:19.760> that<00:03:19.940> these<00:03:20.090> two

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
people really think that these two

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.570 
people really think that these two
verses<00:03:20.510> are<00:03:20.930> comparable<00:03:21.620> what<00:03:22.130> he<00:03:22.220> said<00:03:22.400> was

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
verses are comparable what he said was

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.740 
verses are comparable what he said was
there<00:03:22.730> is<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:22.850> verse<00:03:23.060> in<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.360> Quran<00:03:23.570> which

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
there is a verse in the Quran which

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.900 
there is a verse in the Quran which
speaks<00:03:24.020> of<00:03:24.170> women<00:03:24.500> have<00:03:24.709> swelling<00:03:25.250> breasts

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
speaks of women have swelling breasts

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.880

and<00:03:26.570> that's<00:03:26.750> comparable<00:03:27.320> with<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.650> verse

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
and that's comparable with the verse

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.580 
and that's comparable with the verse
which<00:03:28.100> he<00:03:28.280> read<00:03:28.520> which<00:03:28.940> said<00:03:29.240> that<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.990> certain

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590
