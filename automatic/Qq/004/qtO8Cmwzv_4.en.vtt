00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:12.529
 what do these want? 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:14.379

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:30.390
 they buy from the money 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.020
 that others give them papers and play with it 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.930
 hag 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.240
 that it's worth more next week 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.340
 when yesterday 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.450
 the lift from Sinn results in talk of rearing 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.670
 Management is like leaning up and down a chain of body 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.880
 shakes down 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.390
 welfare state 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.970
 Jobs are a brake on returns 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.570
 but not to 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.289
 but if it jams you play the well-known pieces 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.120
 how expensive is paid policy 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.890
 until the magic 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.989

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.070
 what's the name of 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.150
 more value and what does more win 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.490
 why does such a thing gain more meaning? 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.950
 I never go to logic here at work 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.270
 These very special specialists have the super fast 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.710
 accounting analysts know that no one else knows 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.400

 rise right judge they would have the best one high 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.740
 the stockbrokers 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.149
 a poker table invites Neubauer 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.430
 The staff will also be present 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.650
 a playground without children but with a return save place 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.500
 Rothen stock exchanges jump from value so high up through the courses 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.290
 and squeal commissioning system Reisch 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.630
 Elger message possible case and from it to 2 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.890
 you play with our existence 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.440
 with our life 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.230
 You pretend that nothing would stand then you would always look everywhere 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.299
 have a job is still there 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.499

 the value as daily or even high in the plus notes again they would have been 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.859
 that's true they have not merged today 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.559
 What is such a kind of capital? 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:35.339
 has so much money to do 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:38.359
 is there any property there probably nobody owns? 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.819
 Polis can be possession is not possession of anyone just obsession and nothing 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.099
 wins more value 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.579
 Added value is only on paper and discuss 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.129
 loses the right 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.959

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.549
 can not exist in our world 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.699
 Life itself funny to the world of things and fantasy crumbles 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.799
 breaks into insignificance to dispose of us 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.370
 so the man himself conducts the brew from the sweetest of his 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.309
 individual parts 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:11.299

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:18.319
 He sees Sven at all 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.459
 a steep from the big worlds mosaic of the incredible whole only a cinema 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.759
 tiny piece

 the soon an army of digital prophecy the red as bass open to it 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:30.270

 to buy the real and real capital 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:34.159
 to destroy 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.729
 the sense-giving overview 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:39.889
 even second place is there 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.769
 could not guess 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.769
 which huge amount we report today 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.729
 and we have our politics 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:51.449
 to fear the bare necessities even in a makeshift manner
