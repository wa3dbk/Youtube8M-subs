00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
guys but basically GTA 5 online is going

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.400 
guys but basically GTA 5 online is going
to<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.609> down<00:00:29.849> for<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.210> full<00:00:30.449> day<00:00:30.480> so

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
to be going down for a full day so

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.459 
to be going down for a full day so
basically<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.579> guess<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.930> what<00:00:34.320> we've

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
basically I guess this is what we've

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.900 
basically I guess this is what we've
been<00:00:34.500> all<00:00:34.710> been<00:00:34.920> waiting<00:00:35.070> for<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
been all been waiting for this is the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.940 
been all been waiting for this is the
point<00:00:36.120> I'm<00:00:36.450> assuming<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.170> guess<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.710> could<00:00:37.829> all

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
point I'm assuming I guess we could all

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.139 
point I'm assuming I guess we could all
assume<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> time<00:00:39.120> that

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
assume that this is the time that

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.819 
assume that this is the time that
they're<00:00:39.450> taking<00:00:39.719> away<00:00:39.840> all<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.350> modern<00:00:40.530> money

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
they're taking away all the modern money

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.290 
they're taking away all the modern money
and<00:00:41.070> they're<00:00:41.610> gonna<00:00:41.730> be<00:00:41.820> doing<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.090> lot<00:00:42.120> of

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
and they're gonna be doing a lot of

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.760 
and they're gonna be doing a lot of
stuff<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.840> guess<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.170> wasn't<00:00:43.320> something<00:00:43.590> I

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
stuff I guess it wasn't something I

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.380 
stuff I guess it wasn't something I
couldn't<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.190> fixed<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.700> patch<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.210> guess

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
couldn't be fixed in a patch so I guess

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.670 
couldn't be fixed in a patch so I guess
that<00:00:45.539> makes<00:00:45.660> sense<00:00:45.780> why<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.260> didn't<00:00:46.410> get<00:00:46.530> one

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
that makes sense why we didn't get one

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.260 
that makes sense why we didn't get one
of<00:00:46.710> those<00:00:46.890> they're<00:00:47.460> gonna<00:00:47.579> have<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.030> shut

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
of those they're gonna have to just shut

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.029 
of those they're gonna have to just shut
the<00:00:48.420> server's<00:00:48.780> down<00:00:48.809> for<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> full<00:00:49.530> day<00:00:49.770> and

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
the server's down for a full day and

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.590 
the server's down for a full day and
they're<00:00:50.550> gonna<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.910> try<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.180> clean<00:00:51.420> up

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
they're gonna have to try to clean up

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.930 
they're gonna have to try to clean up

if there's anything that you guys want
to<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.220> might<00:01:29.640> throw<00:01:29.820> up<00:01:29.909> another<00:01:30.299> video

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
to do I might throw up another video

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.030 
to do I might throw up another video
that<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.990> guys<00:01:31.020> could<00:01:31.290> maybe<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.710> know<00:01:31.770> that

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
that you guys could maybe you know that

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.830 
that you guys could maybe you know that
spend<00:01:32.490> some<00:01:32.640> money<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:32.880> something<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.689> guys

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
spend some money on something you guys

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.560 
spend some money on something you guys
could<00:01:34.079> do<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:35.009> yeah<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.579> seems<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.390> guess

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
could do but yeah it seems like I guess

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.670 
could do but yeah it seems like I guess
it<00:01:36.689> only<00:01:36.780> makes<00:01:37.049> sense<00:01:37.140> what<00:01:37.439> do<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.590> guys

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
it only makes sense what do you guys

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.080 
it only makes sense what do you guys
think<00:01:37.740> are<00:01:38.220> they<00:01:38.280> taking<00:01:38.549> away<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> modded

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
think are they taking away the modded

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.149 
think are they taking away the modded
money<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:40.229> only<00:01:40.380> makes<00:01:40.590> sense<00:01:40.710> that's<00:01:40.979> why

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
money it only makes sense that's why

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.310 
money it only makes sense that's why
it's<00:01:41.310> going<00:01:41.520> down<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.880> whole<00:01:42.060> day<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.540> why

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
it's going down for a whole day and why

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.480 
it's going down for a whole day and why
they're<00:01:43.470> doing<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.740> maintenance<00:01:44.070> period

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490
