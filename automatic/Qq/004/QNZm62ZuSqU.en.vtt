00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
and today I have a gaming pc build for

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.320 
and today I have a gaming pc build for
six<00:00:14.040> hundred<00:00:14.340> dollars<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:14.940> think<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.179> did

six hundred dollars and I think I did

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.779 
six hundred dollars and I think I did
really<00:00:15.360> well<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.170> build<00:00:16.490> so<00:00:17.490> yeah<00:00:17.609> let's

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
really well in this build so yeah let's

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.150 
really well in this build so yeah let's
get<00:00:17.880> into<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.090> for<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.359> CPU<00:00:18.840> only<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.289> AMD<00:00:19.710> FX

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
get into it for the CPU only the AMD FX

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.290 
get into it for the CPU only the AMD FX

right now this has a ten dollar off

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.589 
right now this has a ten dollar off
promo<00:00:26.550> code<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.230> 109<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.590> 99<00:00:29.359> this<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.510> an

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
promo code and is 109 and 99 this is an

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.350 
promo code and is 109 and 99 this is an
insanely<00:00:31.050> good<00:00:31.320> processor<00:00:31.830> being<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
insanely good processor being that the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.170 
insanely good processor being that the
competitor<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.410> an<00:00:34.860> intel<00:00:35.250> i3<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.850> can't

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
competitor to it is an intel i3 I can't

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.970 
competitor to it is an intel i3 I can't
exactly<00:00:36.809> name<00:00:37.200> which<00:00:37.440> one<00:00:37.739> currently<00:00:39.680> yeah<00:00:40.680> so

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
exactly name which one currently yeah so

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.190 
exactly name which one currently yeah so
the<00:00:41.070> competitor<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.930> think<00:00:43.140> at

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the competitor for this is a I think at

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.860 
the competitor for this is a I think at
the<00:00:43.290> high<00:00:43.410> end<00:00:43.440> intel<00:00:44.010> i3<00:00:44.480> but<00:00:45.480> being<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the high end intel i3 but being that

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.389 
the high end intel i3 but being that
that<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.440> has<00:00:46.680> two<00:00:47.070> cores<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:48.329> has<00:00:48.510> six<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.399> I

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
that it has two cores this has six and I

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.939 
that it has two cores this has six and I
think<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.640> has<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> same<00:00:51.180> clock<00:00:51.449> speed

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
think it has like the same clock speed

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.439 
think it has like the same clock speed
there's<00:00:52.949> no<00:00:53.250> reason<00:00:53.640> not<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.879> go<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.270> this

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
there's no reason not to go with this

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.869 
there's no reason not to go with this
really<00:00:54.930> i<00:00:55.110> think<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.800> until<00:00:55.980> i<00:00:56.010> 3<00:00:56.430> series<00:00:56.760> is

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
really i think that until i 3 series is

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.569 
really i think that until i 3 series is
a<00:00:56.910> bit<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.719> failure<00:00:57.930> i<00:00:58.109> actually<00:00:58.710> own<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.340> seep

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
a bit of a failure i actually own a seep

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.700 
a bit of a failure i actually own a seep
and<00:01:00.090> intel<00:01:00.329> cpu<00:01:00.719> myself<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.320> I'm<00:01:01.410> not<00:01:01.530> really

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
and intel cpu myself so I'm not really

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.070 
and intel cpu myself so I'm not really
biased<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:04.400> yeah<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.119> cpu<00:01:06.510> cooler<00:01:06.750> on

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
biased but yeah for the cpu cooler on

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.410 
biased but yeah for the cpu cooler on
one<00:01:07.290> would<00:01:07.409> be<00:01:07.500> cooler<00:01:07.799> master<00:01:08.220> hyper<00:01:08.250> 212<00:01:08.760> evo

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
one would be cooler master hyper 212 evo

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.080 
one would be cooler master hyper 212 evo
cpu<00:01:10.229> cooler<00:01:10.500> right<00:01:11.189> now<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.670> twenty<00:01:11.939> nine

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
cpu cooler right now this is twenty nine

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.539 
cpu cooler right now this is twenty nine
dollars<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.689> twenty-eight<00:01:12.990> cents<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.520> a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
dollars and twenty-eight cents and is a

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.890 
dollars and twenty-eight cents and is a
great<00:01:14.850> cooler<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.390> could<00:01:15.540> actually<00:01:15.659> probably

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
great cooler you could actually probably

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.200 
great cooler you could actually probably
push<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.439> cpu<00:01:16.860> up<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.159> 4<00:01:17.490> gigahertz<00:01:17.759> if<00:01:18.119> you

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
push this cpu up to 4 gigahertz if you

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.600 
push this cpu up to 4 gigahertz if you
want<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.720> totally<00:01:18.930> fine<00:01:19.549> for<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
want and be totally fine for the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.039 
want and be totally fine for the
motherboard<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.360> msi<00:01:22.220> 970<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.400> g43<00:01:24.390> ATX

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049

motherboard I with the msi 970 a g43 ATX
am3+<00:01:25.619> motherboard<00:01:26.340> right<00:01:27.180> now<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.900> sixty

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
am3+ motherboard right now this is sixty

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.410 
am3+ motherboard right now this is sixty
dollars<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> decent<00:01:29.880> motherboard<00:01:30.299> I

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
dollars and is a decent motherboard I

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.240 
dollars and is a decent motherboard I
mean<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.720> not<00:01:30.840> high<00:01:31.320> quality<00:01:31.740> by<00:01:31.890> any<00:01:32.070> means

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
mean it's not high quality by any means

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.460 
mean it's not high quality by any means
but<00:01:32.460> unless<00:01:32.670> you're<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.060> doing<00:01:33.150> like

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
but unless you're going to be doing like

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.899 
but unless you're going to be doing like
extreme<00:01:34.470> overclocking<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.520> six

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
extreme overclocking to like six

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.160 
extreme overclocking to like six
gigahertz<00:01:36.210> or<00:01:36.570> something<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.020> and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
gigahertz or something like that and

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.280 
gigahertz or something like that and
there's<00:01:37.470> really<00:01:37.650> no<00:01:37.950> need<00:01:38.509> um<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.990> yeah<00:01:40.140> that's

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
there's really no need um so yeah that's

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.050 
there's really no need um so yeah that's

megahertz<00:01:48.090> memory<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.570> heard<00:01:48.720> me<00:01:48.869> right<00:01:49.020> this

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
megahertz memory you heard me right this

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.410 
megahertz memory you heard me right this
is<00:01:49.799> eighteen<00:01:50.280> sixty<00:01:50.579> six<00:01:50.759> megahertz<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.299> i

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
is eighteen sixty six megahertz and i

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.870 
is eighteen sixty six megahertz and i
believe<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.840> cast<00:01:52.049> latency<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.590> nine<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.729> if

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
believe the cast latency is nine so if

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.130 
believe the cast latency is nine so if
anything<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.450> will<00:01:54.630> actually<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:55.049> an

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
anything this will actually be an

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.999 
anything this will actually be an
upgrade<00:01:55.560> from<00:01:55.799> 1600<00:01:56.610> megahertz<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.180> actually

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
upgrade from 1600 megahertz and actually

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.969 
upgrade from 1600 megahertz and actually
this<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.369> cheaper<00:02:00.000> than<00:02:00.659> like<00:02:01.020> ninety-five

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
this is cheaper than like ninety-five

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.240

call it but like that sheet metal grate
on<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:01.050> front<00:04:01.260> not<00:04:01.380> really<00:04:01.590> sheet<00:04:01.830> metal<00:04:02.070> but

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
on the front not really sheet metal but

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010
