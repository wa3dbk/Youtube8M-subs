 oh damn I picked her up randomly 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.710
 so come on come on four more hits and 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.160

 just 2x xp left to level one 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.660
 he has eight lives now 16 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.770
 I have it now 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:32.490
 let him throw him pumpkin pie he 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.490
 eats and 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:42.799
 and I need him to eat it all the same 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:42.799
 now I throw everything again so let's eat 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.620
 You see, he has 8 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.770
 life has increased there so probably 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:04:02.820
 Now I have another zombie already 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:04:02.820
 let's start and also such it now 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.670
 damn fast I can not stand these small 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.940
 oh yeah there are a lot of them already these snappers 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.140
 Well, let's finish it two more hits 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:29.300
 all now we do not have clouds and the mouse should 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.630
 be 2 levels already so probably i will 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.630
 day 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.370
 because it's not a thing that's volatile 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.330
 the mouse will attack all the attack 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:46.160
 I really hope that they themselves now 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:46.160
 burn everything so guys let's 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.689
