00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.860
 I bring a review about a book that is 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.250
 a classic and I'm talking about pride and 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.089
 prejudice by jane austen good this is 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.089
 one of my favorite books 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.119
 the history of this book is about 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:30.640
 family see in the end that they are the Lord and 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.560
 the lady apenet then comes 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.030
 jane who is the oldest daughter and is 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.130
 considered the most beautiful of the 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.440
 family then be ready 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.690
 who is the protagonist of the book then 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:46.450
 comes mari that is a very girl 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.990
 reserved and finally they are fighting and 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.120
 katie who are the youngest and are the 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.350
 who are anxious to go out to the 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.930
 society 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.880
 well this book has been narrated in a 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.260
 era in which the most important thing was 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.840
 get a good match so that 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.880
 be done because the daughters did not have 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.240
 right to family inheritance for being 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.290
 women 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.479
 and if you are sure that nothing but the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.939
 love is going to make her think about 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.250
 get married and james is a very girl 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.170
 kindly that has very very good 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:25.890
 relationship with good law in a dance 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.040
 that is in the city know Mr. 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.890
 bingley- to his sister and Mr. Darcy 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.910
 bing lee falls in love immediately with 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.950
 jane but since the two are a little 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:43.150
 reserved and timid the relationship is not 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:47.400
 note so much then is Mr. darcy that 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:51.760
 He is a very, very proud person but 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.740
 that makes him comfortable being excluded from the 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.040
 group does not like to socialize with others 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.270
 people but during the story he's going 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.070
 fanned sale talking about 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.500
 conversations with elisabeth until 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:07.930
 it reaches a point where they no longer know 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.840
 whether they like you or not and if you say that 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.290
 they hate for being such a proud person 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.290
 and giving is said to be a person of a 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.660
 lower level that could not be fixed in 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.550
 she but for him are certain little things 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.130
 that you think and that does not matter if 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.320
 they could have a relationship but they spend 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.260
 some problems if some 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.960
 characters like wickham that make the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.300
 isi hate more and more to give 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.490
 but after the same give himself the one that 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.620
 clarify what is happening with the lord 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.380
 Whitham and other matters 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.960
 with bing lee jane that make the isi 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.780
 to realize that if not bad 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.030
 He is not a bad person because despite 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.340
 that is proud has its reasons and 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.700
 his reasons because he has to take care 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.850
 of his sister who is much younger than 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.600
 he then he has his reasons for 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.210
 act in a certain way and at the end of the 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.490
 story I love because the two of them 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.020
 meet with the dad of the isi who is one of 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.810
 my favorite characters from all the 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:17.590
 story because he has a patience there 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.570
 a sarcasm and uses a sarcasm that gives 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.330
 laugh I do not know is one of the best 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.760
 characters throughout the book and do not 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.760
 I want to tell a lot because I feel it is 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.070
 a book that is worth reading if 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.360
 have the opportunity to do it, do it 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:36.610
 it's a classic and also 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.200
 the story is very beautiful also I 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.240
 I really like the movie because I feel 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.070
 which will be very good adaptation 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.680
 of this book I know there are several 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.170
 movies and there's also a series but 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.140
 the series I did not like so much this is a 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.080
 book with a language from another era 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.300
 then I would not recommend it to start 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.670
 in the world of reading because I feel 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.550
 that we could not enjoy it so well 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.070
 I read it after I had read 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.040
 other books and I really enjoyed it 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.470
 quite because I managed to understand all the 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.770
 history and the way you are 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.870
 written because if you choose it as a first 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.320
 book I think the reading would be done to you 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.200
 very heavy and I would not enjoy it so much 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.120
 or maybe you would not like it as much as 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:27.350
 it would be if you read it later 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.449
 I still recommend that you read lean and 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.030
 if you do, you can comment here below 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.460
 what did you think or have you read 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.960
 another jane book to you I would love 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.400
 know your thoughts although the book I 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.370
 recommend 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.070
 and if that would be all for today's video 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.030
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.030
 in the next
