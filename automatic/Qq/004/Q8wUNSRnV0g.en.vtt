00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.510
 Hello everyone, Katrina Rei and today 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.330
 I want to tell you about the book 50 no 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.880
 that's not what you thought 50 days to 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.920
 my suicide this book got to 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.020
 I saw her in my arms in the book 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.510
 the store and on the most prominent shelf go 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.609
 usually stands bestseller and remembered that 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.980
 once I heard about this book and 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.740
 without hesitation I decided to buy it but myself 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.289
 beginning I had some questions to these 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.640
 books some doubts i saw that 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.360
 this book has taken some kind of fear of intimacy 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.640
 not the usual foreign popular 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.040
 books of this kind don’t pass and mine 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.520
 on snow tripods as I read 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.020
 pages 8 of this book, I realized something 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.980
 not that useful to watch on the Internet 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.760
 Only here are the edges with 1 with which weave 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.170
 it turned out that with a spark of action this is a pseudonym 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.730
 anastasia from astrakhan who on 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.609
 the time of writing this book was 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.579
 fifteen years this is all i explained 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.979
 I want to praise for what she 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.310
 I could knock here all write 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.680
 because she is not thin and yet for what 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.260
 praise her for ingenuity because if 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.930
 would really have been on the cover of the book 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.340
 written no se si hago them to him 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.369
 how to remove 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.950
 forgive them if I saw this 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.350
 the last name on the cover of the book I would probably 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.750
 bypassed her because split 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.210
 a book with that defiant title 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.819
 from Russian author wildebeest in general I am so 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.079
 kind of ordinary liter bowl enclose 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:39.240
 The plot of this hole and the process is not that 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.579
 teen girl named harry and uterus 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.850
 that is, seven days, but what's big 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.740
 continued life and so having read a little 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.179
 better plug this book seriously 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.630
 don't ask me to think 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:54.450
 because the language of the book is dry and not very 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.670
 intuitive beautiful main i'm not 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.039

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.079

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.399
 what you many moments that 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.629
 seem completely unrealistic as 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.019
 if it's all the movie Alice this is not 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.130
 must 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.890
 but in spite of all this the cast has passed 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.990
 because in fact it delays and 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.970
 read some easy enough 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.250
 moments of the passage of the book like 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.550
 more some less but in the end 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.310
 I read it now I will read a quote from 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.810

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.010
