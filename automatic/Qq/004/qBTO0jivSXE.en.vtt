highest point in our province of Ontario

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.380 
highest point in our province of Ontario
and<00:00:27.560> just<00:00:28.560> want<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.950> give<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> demonstration<00:00:29.640> of

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
and just want to give a demonstration of

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.370 
and just want to give a demonstration of
a<00:00:30.779> typical<00:00:31.710> traditional<00:00:32.669> snowshoe<00:00:33.540> versus<00:00:34.350> a

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
a typical traditional snowshoe versus a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.290 
a typical traditional snowshoe versus a
typical<00:00:35.310> modern<00:00:35.910> snowshoe<00:00:36.590> so<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.980> a

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
typical modern snowshoe so this is a

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.060 
typical modern snowshoe so this is a
sixteen<00:00:39.300> by<00:00:39.329> thirty<00:00:39.900> bear<00:00:40.290> paw<00:00:40.530> snowshoe

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
sixteen by thirty bear paw snowshoe

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.130 
sixteen by thirty bear paw snowshoe
that's<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.579> snowshoe<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.390> use<00:00:42.780> around

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
that's the snowshoe that I use around

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.400 
that's the snowshoe that I use around
camp<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.480> probably<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.899> fairly

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
camp and this is probably a fairly

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.799 
camp and this is probably a fairly
typical<00:00:46.590> sized<00:00:47.210> modern<00:00:48.210> snowshoe<00:00:48.920> I<00:00:50.809> don't

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
typical sized modern snowshoe I don't

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.290 
typical sized modern snowshoe I don't
know<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.140> dimensions<00:00:52.679> it's<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.190> model<00:00:53.429> 830

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
know it's dimensions it's the model 830

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.770 
know it's dimensions it's the model 830
which<00:00:55.109> maybe<00:00:55.559> means<00:00:56.039> 8<00:00:56.370> by<00:00:56.760> 30<00:00:57.120> inches<00:00:57.449> I'm<00:00:57.629> not

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
which maybe means 8 by 30 inches I'm not

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.759 
which maybe means 8 by 30 inches I'm not
really<00:00:57.929> sure<00:00:58.280> first<00:00:59.280> thing<00:01:00.260> if<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.410> compare

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
really sure first thing if we compare

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.060 
really sure first thing if we compare
the<00:01:01.920> weights<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:04.230> traditional<00:01:04.830> shoe

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
the weights the the traditional shoe

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.880 
the weights the the traditional shoe
with<00:01:05.370> fish<00:01:05.700> line<00:01:05.970> we've<00:01:06.440> it's<00:01:07.440> quite<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> bit

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
with fish line we've it's quite a bit

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.280 
with fish line we've it's quite a bit
lighter<00:01:08.130> but<00:01:08.450> perhaps<00:01:09.450> I'll<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.990> look<00:01:10.140> up

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
lighter but perhaps I'll have to look up

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.800 
lighter but perhaps I'll have to look up
weights<00:01:10.530> back<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.250> home<00:01:11.430> but<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.480> can<00:01:12.600> tell

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
weights back at home but you can tell

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:50.490 
weights back at home but you can tell
right<00:01:12.840> away<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.230> it's<00:01:13.500> later

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.830 

and<00:01:51.500> then<00:01:52.039> the<00:01:52.189> same<00:01:52.429> thing<00:01:52.689> so<00:01:53.689> we're<00:01:53.810> just

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
and then the same thing so we're just

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:35.369 
and then the same thing so we're just
comparing<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.469> location<00:01:55.340> on<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.579> shoes

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.979 

so<00:02:36.379> of<00:02:36.920> course<00:02:37.129> the<00:02:37.430> binding<00:02:38.000> on<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.360> this

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
so of course the binding on the this

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.670 
so of course the binding on the this
modern<00:02:39.560> shoe<00:02:40.180> does<00:02:41.180> not<00:02:41.360> allow<00:02:41.540> hands-free<00:02:42.349> on

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
modern shoe does not allow hands-free on

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:53.100 
modern shoe does not allow hands-free on
and<00:02:42.890> off<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:44.510> that's<00:02:44.629> one<00:02:46.269> disadvantage

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.980 

first<00:02:54.110> thing<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.410> noticed<00:02:54.770> when<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:54.920> put<00:02:55.130> it<00:02:55.220> on

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
first thing I noticed when I put it on

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.440 
first thing I noticed when I put it on
is<00:02:56.990> it's<00:02:57.440> designed<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.340> give<00:02:58.460> me<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.670> great<00:02:59.060> calf

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
is it's designed to give me a great calf

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.870 
is it's designed to give me a great calf
stretch<00:02:59.960> with<00:03:00.530> this<00:03:00.710> nice<00:03:00.890> bulky<00:03:01.340> cramp<00:03:01.670> on

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
stretch with this nice bulky cramp on

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:37.590 
stretch with this nice bulky cramp on
under<00:03:02.300> my<00:03:02.330> toes

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.190 

okay<00:03:38.860> so<00:03:40.480> our<00:03:41.480> you<00:03:41.600> know<00:03:41.690> spot<00:03:41.930> where<00:03:42.050> you<00:03:42.110> can

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
okay so our you know spot where you can

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.670 
okay so our you know spot where you can
see<00:03:42.350> both<00:03:42.560> packs<00:03:44.590> so<00:03:47.350> obviously<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.650> the

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
see both packs so obviously the the

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.700 
see both packs so obviously the the
modern<00:03:49.400> shoe<00:03:49.840> doesn't<00:03:50.840> provide<00:03:51.230> because<00:03:51.590> it

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
modern shoe doesn't provide because it

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.730 
modern shoe doesn't provide because it
doesn't<00:03:52.100> have<00:03:52.220> as<00:03:52.310> much<00:03:52.460> surface<00:03:52.790> area

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
doesn't have as much surface area

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.140 
doesn't have as much surface area
doesn't<00:03:54.740> provide<00:03:54.980> nearly<00:03:55.310> a<00:03:55.490> floatation<00:03:56.090> and

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
doesn't provide nearly a floatation and

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.650 
doesn't provide nearly a floatation and
the<00:03:57.190> float<00:03:58.190> that<00:03:58.490> it<00:03:58.640> packs<00:03:58.880> out<00:03:59.120> is<00:03:59.330> quite<00:03:59.540> a

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
the float that it packs out is quite a

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:07.410 
the float that it packs out is quite a
bit<00:03:59.870> narrower<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:06.050> boat<00:04:06.320> of<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.530> modern<00:04:06.980> shoe

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
bit narrower the boat of the modern shoe

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.810 
bit narrower the boat of the modern shoe
but<00:04:08.420> just<00:04:08.690> barely<00:04:08.960> and<00:04:09.290> if<00:04:09.380> if<00:04:10.220> we<00:04:10.430> have<00:04:10.610> any

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
but just barely and if if we have any

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.700 
but just barely and if if we have any
sort<00:04:11.120> of<00:04:11.240> a<00:04:11.360> wide<00:04:11.600> load<00:04:11.960> on<00:04:12.260> these<00:04:12.470> things

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
sort of a wide load on these things

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:35.070 
sort of a wide load on these things
which<00:04:13.460> we<00:04:13.580> don't<00:04:13.760> recommend<00:04:14.000> but<00:04:14.300> it<00:04:14.390> happens

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.370 

if<00:04:36.080> you're<00:04:36.320> on<00:04:36.500> a<00:04:37.120> trip<00:04:38.120> with<00:04:38.300> us<00:04:38.450> and<00:04:38.780> everyone

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
if you're on a trip with us and everyone

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.580 
if you're on a trip with us and everyone
has<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.890> traditional<00:04:40.640> snowshoes<00:04:41.270> and<00:04:42.140> you

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
has the traditional snowshoes and you

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.540 
has the traditional snowshoes and you
have<00:04:43.870> even<00:04:44.870> if<00:04:44.960> you're<00:04:45.110> not<00:04:45.320> breaking<00:04:46.070> trail

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
have even if you're not breaking trail

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.910 
have even if you're not breaking trail
you<00:04:47.090> will<00:04:47.330> essentially<00:04:48.140> be<00:04:48.410> breaking<00:04:48.890> your

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
you will essentially be breaking your

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.360 
you will essentially be breaking your
own<00:04:49.070> trail<00:04:50.470> regardless<00:04:51.470> of<00:04:51.620> what<00:04:51.800> position<00:04:51.950> in

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
own trail regardless of what position in

00:04:52.370 --> 00:05:01.879 
own trail regardless of what position in
line

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:23.880 

you<00:05:02.889> getting<00:05:03.099> all<00:05:03.189> this

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.820 

so<00:05:24.430> with<00:05:24.610> the<00:05:24.700> modern<00:05:25.060> shoe<00:05:25.330> a<00:05:25.600> small<00:05:26.200> honor

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
so with the modern shoe a small honor

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.060 
so with the modern shoe a small honor
shoe<00:05:27.130> I<00:05:27.190> mean<00:05:27.460> you<00:05:27.520> can<00:05:27.670> get<00:05:27.820> very<00:05:28.030> large<00:05:28.330> ones

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
shoe I mean you can get very large ones

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.860
