myself<00:00:32.480> today<00:00:33.379> we're<00:00:33.680> talking<00:00:33.830> about<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.570> the

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
myself today we're talking about the the

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.350 
myself today we're talking about the the
Gerber<00:00:36.019> Gator<00:00:36.670> machete<00:00:37.670> they<00:00:37.910> actually<00:00:38.180> make

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
Gerber Gator machete they actually make

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.850 
Gerber Gator machete they actually make
this<00:00:38.480> in<00:00:38.660> two<00:00:38.809> different<00:00:39.140> sizes<00:00:39.350> one<00:00:39.800> of

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
this in two different sizes one of

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.799 
this in two different sizes one of
them's<00:00:40.010> about<00:00:40.250> that<00:00:40.460> long<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.000> i<00:00:41.600> thought

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
them's about that long and i thought

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.450 
them's about that long and i thought
about<00:00:41.870> buying<00:00:42.290> it<00:00:42.500> it<00:00:42.620> didn't<00:00:42.890> cost<00:00:43.129> really

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
about buying it it didn't cost really

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.270 
about buying it it didn't cost really
that<00:00:43.910> much<00:00:44.150> more<00:00:44.420> I<00:00:44.690> just<00:00:45.019> decided<00:00:45.589> I<00:00:45.739> like<00:00:45.980> the

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
that much more I just decided I like the

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.479 
that much more I just decided I like the
the<00:00:46.850> shorter<00:00:47.360> frame<00:00:47.780> better<00:00:48.440> it's<00:00:49.250> a<00:00:49.309> little

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
the shorter frame better it's a little

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:50.740 
the shorter frame better it's a little
bit<00:00:49.579> easier<00:00:49.879> to<00:00:49.940> carry<00:00:50.210> in<00:00:50.300> your<00:00:50.390> side<00:00:50.600> it's

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
bit easier to carry in your side it's

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.569 
bit easier to carry in your side it's
actually<00:00:50.870> reasonable<00:00:51.680> to<00:00:51.800> draw<00:00:52.040> it<00:00:52.100> from<00:00:52.460> a

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
actually reasonable to draw it from a

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.490 
actually reasonable to draw it from a
belt<00:00:52.820> sheath<00:00:53.120> I<00:00:53.360> think<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:53.930> longer<00:00:54.289> one

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
belt sheath I think the longer one

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.619 
belt sheath I think the longer one
you're<00:00:54.649> kind<00:00:54.860> of<00:00:54.950> using<00:00:55.160> a<00:00:55.250> two<00:00:55.430> hand<00:00:55.700> draw<00:00:56.000> to

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
you're kind of using a two hand draw to

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.330 
you're kind of using a two hand draw to
get<00:00:56.809> it<00:00:56.960> out<00:00:57.110> so<00:00:57.440> I<00:00:57.680> went<00:00:57.890> with<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.070> smaller

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
get it out so I went with the smaller

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.279 
get it out so I went with the smaller
one<00:00:58.610> I'm<00:00:58.760> pretty<00:00:59.000> happy<00:00:59.239> with<00:00:59.510> it<00:00:59.690> and<00:00:59.840> we

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
one I'm pretty happy with it and we

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:01.869 
one I'm pretty happy with it and we
decided<00:01:00.590> to<00:01:00.800> do<00:01:00.949> this<00:01:01.100> review<00:01:01.340> up<00:01:01.640> here

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
decided to do this review up here

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.069 
decided to do this review up here
because<00:01:02.059> I'm<00:01:02.239> gonna<00:01:02.360> take<00:01:02.539> you<00:01:02.690> over<00:01:02.719> here<00:01:03.020> a

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
because I'm gonna take you over here a

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.290 
because I'm gonna take you over here a
little<00:01:03.230> oak<00:01:03.440> tree<00:01:03.710> that's<00:01:03.829> been<00:01:04.100> maybe<00:01:04.970> some

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
little oak tree that's been maybe some

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.200 
little oak tree that's been maybe some
trimming<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:06.070> we'll<00:01:07.070> give<00:01:07.280> it<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:07.580> try<00:01:07.759> out<00:01:08.030> on

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
trimming and we'll give it a try out on

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.550 
trimming and we'll give it a try out on
some<00:01:08.420> actual<00:01:08.840> woods<00:01:09.050> so<00:01:09.200> that's<00:01:09.350> why<00:01:09.470> we

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
some actual woods so that's why we

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.260 
some actual woods so that's why we
decided<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.920> do<00:01:10.039> the<00:01:10.160> review<00:01:10.430> up<00:01:10.550> here<00:01:10.759> but

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
decided to do the review up here but

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.880 
decided to do the review up here but
overall<00:01:11.570> I<00:01:11.720> mean<00:01:11.960> what<00:01:12.229> do<00:01:12.320> I<00:01:12.350> think<00:01:12.440> of<00:01:12.770> it

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
overall I mean what do I think of it

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.609 
overall I mean what do I think of it
it's<00:01:13.160> a<00:01:13.280> very<00:01:13.460> well-built<00:01:14.000> tool<00:01:14.410> it's<00:01:15.410> got

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
it's a very well-built tool it's got

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.010 
it's a very well-built tool it's got
that<00:01:15.800> really<00:01:16.100> nice<00:01:16.520> kind<00:01:16.880> of<00:01:17.030> sticky<00:01:17.539> grippy

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
got a great shape to the the handle when

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:27.730 
got a great shape to the the handle when
you<00:01:26.209> when<00:01:26.509> you<00:01:26.630> hold<00:01:26.990> it<00:01:27.170> in<00:01:27.289> your<00:01:27.380> hand<00:01:27.649> it

fits very well if you're doing kind of
some<00:01:31.039> precision<00:01:31.640> work<00:01:31.819> your<00:01:32.030> thumb<00:01:32.330> fits<00:01:32.660> very

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
some precision work your thumb fits very

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.389 
some precision work your thumb fits very
nicely<00:01:33.200> in<00:01:33.590> there<00:01:33.709> that's<00:01:33.920> how<00:01:34.099> it's<00:01:34.280> designed

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
nicely in there that's how it's designed

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.190 
nicely in there that's how it's designed
to<00:01:34.670> work<00:01:34.759> I<00:01:34.910> wouldn't<00:01:35.240> hit<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:36.080> know

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
to work I wouldn't hit you know

to work I wouldn't hit you know
full-scale<00:01:36.770> hard<00:01:37.099> like<00:01:37.340> that<00:01:37.369> is<00:01:37.700> actually

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
full-scale hard like that is actually

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:39.520 
full-scale hard like that is actually
gonna<00:01:38.119> harm<00:01:38.420> your<00:01:38.660> thumb<00:01:38.929> if<00:01:39.080> you<00:01:39.170> do<00:01:39.319> that

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
gonna harm your thumb if you do that

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
perfect to fit in your hand and be able

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.320 
perfect to fit in your hand and be able
to<00:01:48.619> solve<00:01:48.860> assault<00:01:49.310> works<00:01:49.520> very<00:01:49.759> well<00:01:49.880> so

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
to solve assault works very well so

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.940 
to solve assault works very well so
we'll<00:01:50.780> pause<00:01:50.989> the<00:01:51.170> camera<00:01:51.349> a<00:01:51.560> minute<00:01:51.800> we'll<00:01:51.920> be

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
we'll pause the camera a minute we'll be

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.010 
we'll pause the camera a minute we'll be
right<00:01:52.220> back<00:01:52.459> and<00:01:52.640> we'll<00:01:52.759> show<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.300> tool

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
right back and we'll show you the tool

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.229 
right back and we'll show you the tool
in<00:01:54.170> action<00:01:56.470> alright<00:01:57.470> so<00:01:57.800> let's<00:01:58.550> check<00:01:58.849> out<00:01:59.030> the

00:01:59.229 --> 00:01:59.239 
in action alright so let's check out the

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:01.359 
in action alright so let's check out the
saw<00:01:59.720> side<00:02:00.050> of<00:02:00.170> this<00:02:00.259> first<00:02:00.560> this<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:00.830> oak<00:02:01.160> so

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
saw side of this first this is oak so

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:02.800 
saw side of this first this is oak so
this<00:02:01.489> is<00:02:01.610> about<00:02:01.849> as<00:02:01.970> hard<00:02:02.179> as<00:02:02.300> anything<00:02:02.690> you're

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
this is about as hard as anything you're

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.260 
this is about as hard as anything you're
gonna<00:02:02.929> ever<00:02:03.110> cut<00:02:03.470> I'd<00:02:04.429> say<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:04.789> branch<00:02:05.090> is

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
gonna ever cut I'd say this branch is

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.910 
gonna ever cut I'd say this branch is
about<00:02:05.539> the<00:02:05.690> perfect<00:02:06.080> diameter<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.679> what<00:02:06.800> you

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
about the perfect diameter of what you

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.949 
about the perfect diameter of what you
might<00:02:07.069> be<00:02:07.220> cutting<00:02:07.489> on<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.090> build<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.479> lean-to<00:02:08.720> or

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
might be cutting on a build a lean-to or

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.380 
might be cutting on a build a lean-to or
a<00:02:09.140> shelter<00:02:09.739> or<00:02:09.770> something<00:02:09.920> like<00:02:10.399> that

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
a shelter or something like that

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.790 
a shelter or something like that
and<00:02:11.599> this<00:02:11.750> pattern<00:02:11.959> is<00:02:12.230> pretty<00:02:12.440> much<00:02:12.560> like<00:02:12.739> a

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
and this pattern is pretty much like a

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.040 
and this pattern is pretty much like a
crosscut<00:02:13.099> saw<00:02:13.370> I'd<00:02:14.270> say<00:02:14.510> this<00:02:14.629> is<00:02:14.690> about<00:02:15.020> a

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
crosscut saw I'd say this is about a

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.290 
crosscut saw I'd say this is about a
one-inch<00:02:15.349> again<00:02:16.220> oak<00:02:16.370> branch<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:16.970> let's<00:02:17.150> see

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
one-inch again oak branch so let's see

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:31.570 
one-inch again oak branch so let's see
what<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.510> takes<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.930> cut<00:02:18.379> through<00:02:18.620> it

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.350 

there<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.730> go<00:02:33.230> again<00:02:34.230> that's<00:02:34.380> about<00:02:34.680> one<00:02:34.920> is

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
there you go again that's about one is

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.150 
there you go again that's about one is
and<00:02:36.360> that's<00:02:36.480> little<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.959> live<00:02:37.260> piece<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.890> white

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
and that's little a live piece of white

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.580 
and that's little a live piece of white
oak<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.870> you're<00:02:39.870> not<00:02:39.990> going<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.230> cut<00:02:40.380> anything

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
oak so you're not going to cut anything

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.680 
oak so you're not going to cut anything
much<00:02:40.920> tougher<00:02:41.130> than<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:42.510> we'll<00:02:42.600> go

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
much tougher than that and we'll go

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.030 
much tougher than that and we'll go
ahead<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:42.990> try<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.200> shopping<00:02:43.709> side<00:02:43.920> of

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
ahead and try the shopping side of

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.309 
ahead and try the shopping side of
machete<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:45.300> tree<00:02:45.540> needs<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.870> go<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.050> keep

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
machete this tree needs to go I keep

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.660 
machete this tree needs to go I keep
cutting<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.590> down<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.040> keeps<00:02:47.250> basically

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
cutting it down and it keeps basically

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.760 
cutting it down and it keeps basically
cost<00:02:47.910> us<00:02:48.150> here<00:02:48.420> coming<00:02:48.780> back<00:02:48.989> I'll<00:02:49.650> probably

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
cost us here coming back I'll probably

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.500 
cost us here coming back I'll probably
come<00:02:50.100> back<00:02:50.130> with<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.520> saw<00:02:50.730> later<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.239> take<00:02:51.390> it

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
come back with the saw later and take it

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.449 
come back with the saw later and take it
out<00:02:51.600> at<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.780> bottom<00:02:51.930> but<00:02:52.290> well<00:02:53.100> cut<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.370> about

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
out at the bottom but well cut it about

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.710 
out at the bottom but well cut it about
right<00:02:53.700> here<00:02:53.790> that's<00:02:54.000> about<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.300> good<00:02:54.450> two

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
right here that's about a good two

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.380 
right here that's about a good two
inches<00:02:55.489> maybe<00:02:56.489> more<00:02:56.790> than<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:56.940> am<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.270> can

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
inches maybe more than I am and I can

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.699 
inches maybe more than I am and I can
barely<00:02:57.569> get<00:02:57.780> my<00:02:57.900> hand<00:02:58.140> around<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.440> probably

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
barely get my hand around that probably

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:59.900 
barely get my hand around that probably
bigger<00:02:58.920> than<00:02:59.010> you'd<00:02:59.220> normally<00:02:59.250> cut<00:02:59.730> with<00:02:59.850> a

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
bigger than you'd normally cut with a

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.630 
bigger than you'd normally cut with a
machete<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.950> haven't<00:03:01.950> used<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.190> this<00:03:02.310> way<00:03:02.459> yet

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
machete and haven't used it this way yet

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.970 
machete and haven't used it this way yet
so<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:02.820> don't<00:03:02.910> know<00:03:03.030> how<00:03:03.840> it's<00:03:04.019> gonna<00:03:04.140> perform<00:03:04.650> a

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
so I don't know how it's gonna perform a

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.340 
so I don't know how it's gonna perform a
lot<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.580> is<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.730> real<00:03:06.000> world<00:03:06.209> test<00:03:06.510> let's

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
lot so this is a real world test let's

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:37.500 
lot so this is a real world test let's
take<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.530> look

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.110 

well<00:03:38.510> I<00:03:38.540> can't<00:03:38.870> complain<00:03:39.110> about<00:03:39.260> that<00:03:40.120> the

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
well I can't complain about that the

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.080 
well I can't complain about that the
edge<00:03:41.270> held<00:03:41.600> up<00:03:41.750> beautifully<00:03:43.060> absolutely<00:03:44.060> a

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
edge held up beautifully absolutely a

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.050 
edge held up beautifully absolutely a
great<00:03:44.390> tool<00:03:45.130> if<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:46.280> had<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.520> do<00:03:46.610> it<00:03:46.730> again<00:03:46.940> and

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
great tool if I had to do it again and

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.250 
great tool if I had to do it again and
choose<00:03:47.210> between<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:47.630> large<00:03:47.840> one<00:03:48.080> of<00:03:48.200> the

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
choose between the large one of the

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.780 
choose between the large one of the
smaller<00:03:48.560> one<00:03:48.830> I'd<00:03:49.550> stick<00:03:49.970> with<00:03:50.150> this<00:03:50.360> again<00:03:51.110> I

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
smaller one I'd stick with this again I

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.370 
smaller one I'd stick with this again I
really<00:03:52.790> like<00:03:55.480> that<00:03:56.480> it<00:03:56.600> can<00:03:56.690> be<00:03:56.810> carried<00:03:57.050> on

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
really like that it can be carried on

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.560 
really like that it can be carried on
the<00:03:57.500> belt<00:03:58.000> without<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.240> being<00:03:59.360> really

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
the belt without it being really

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.810 
the belt without it being really
inconvenient<00:04:00.200> if<00:04:01.160> you're<00:04:01.340> going<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:01.520> rely<00:04:01.790> on

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
inconvenient if you're going to rely on

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.070 
inconvenient if you're going to rely on
this<00:04:02.060> in<00:04:02.210> the<00:04:02.270> brush<00:04:02.510> that<00:04:02.690> still<00:04:02.900> make<00:04:03.050> sure

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
this in the brush that still make sure

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.630 
this in the brush that still make sure
you<00:04:03.290> take<00:04:03.440> a<00:04:03.470> good<00:04:03.680> knife<00:04:03.890> with<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.310> something

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
you take a good knife with you something

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.760 
you take a good knife with you something
like<00:04:04.760> you<00:04:04.910> know<00:04:05.920> my<00:04:06.920> buck<00:04:07.130> 110<00:04:08.560> for<00:04:09.560> more

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
like you know my buck 110 for more
