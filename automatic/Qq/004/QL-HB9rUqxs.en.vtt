00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
video like I said what I used to do is

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.890 
video like I said what I used to do is
hook<00:01:36.090> my<00:01:36.299> weight<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:37.310> onto<00:01:38.689> something<00:01:39.689> like

that<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.500> lay<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.220> weight<00:01:41.400> across

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
that and lay the weight across

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.300 
that and lay the weight across
I'll<00:01:43.380> go<00:01:43.619> ahead<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.920> show<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.189> what<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.520> is

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
that the setup that I have in the garage

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:50.059 
that the setup that I have in the garage
isn't<00:02:43.349> really<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.989> way<00:02:46.200> those<00:02:47.390> trusses<00:02:49.069> were

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
isn't really the way those trusses were

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.670 
isn't really the way those trusses were
designed<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:51.569> hold<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:52.019> weight<00:02:52.290> they<00:02:52.620> were

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
designed to hold that weight they were

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.520 
designed to hold that weight they were
designed<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.549> hold<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.660> sheetrock<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.410> you

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
designed to hold the sheetrock that you

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.400 
designed to hold the sheetrock that you
see<00:02:55.769> there<00:02:56.069> and<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:57.000> roof<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.569> I<00:02:58.080> do<00:02:58.140> have

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
see there and the roof and I do have

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.140 
see there and the roof and I do have
cracking<00:02:58.709> in<00:02:59.010> my<00:02:59.130> sheet<00:02:59.400> rack<00:02:59.610> by<00:02:59.849> the<00:02:59.910> way

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
cracking in my sheet rack by the way

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.199 
cracking in my sheet rack by the way
because<00:03:00.959> of<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.140> movement<00:03:01.590> or<00:03:01.680> whatever<00:03:02.209> did

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
because of the movement or whatever did

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.750 
because of the movement or whatever did
crack<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.630> sheetrock<00:03:04.220> so<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.250> don't<00:03:05.549> want

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
crack the sheetrock so I don't want

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.250 
crack the sheetrock so I don't want
anyone<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.239> think<00:03:06.299> that<00:03:06.690> that's<00:03:06.900> not<00:03:09.080> or<00:03:10.080> that

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
anyone to think that that's not or that

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
her on one of those wires around the

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.050 
her on one of those wires around the
stud<00:03:51.319> it<00:03:52.319> would<00:03:52.440> require<00:03:52.620> some<00:03:52.829> extra<00:03:53.579> work

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
stud it would require some extra work
