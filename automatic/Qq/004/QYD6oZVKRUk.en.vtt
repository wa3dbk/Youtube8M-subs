7th of May and I'm really nervous for me
it<00:00:03.720> feels<00:00:03.840> like<00:00:04.049> even<00:00:04.200> more<00:00:04.560> than<00:00:04.620> it<00:00:04.950> all<00:00:05.130> the

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
it feels like even more than it all the

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.950 
it feels like even more than it all the
elections<00:00:05.790> of<00:00:05.879> my<00:00:06.000> life<00:00:06.210> that<00:00:06.420> I<00:00:06.480> can<00:00:06.750> remember

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
elections of my life that I can remember

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.930 
elections of my life that I can remember
in<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.379> first<00:00:07.529> one<00:00:07.770> I<00:00:07.799> can<00:00:08.099> remember<00:00:08.340> was<00:00:08.730> when

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
in the first one I can remember was when

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.580 
in the first one I can remember was when
Tony<00:00:09.330> Blair<00:00:09.599> was<00:00:09.750> elected<00:00:10.170> for<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.410> first

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
Tony Blair was elected for the first

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.530 
Tony Blair was elected for the first
time<00:00:10.889> I<00:00:11.160> feel<00:00:11.370> like<00:00:11.490> someone<00:00:11.790> else<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.210> taking

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
time I feel like someone else is taking

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.060 
time I feel like someone else is taking
hold<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.049> message<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.679> this<00:00:13.769> always

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
hold of the message and this always

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.220 
hold of the message and this always
happens<00:00:14.490> necessarily<00:00:15.299> because<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.660> parties

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
happens necessarily because the parties

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.200 
happens necessarily because the parties
decide<00:00:16.590> their<00:00:17.010> strongest<00:00:17.310> points<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.090> they

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
decide their strongest points and they

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.790 
decide their strongest points and they
kind<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.600> really<00:00:18.840> campaign<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.439> push<00:00:19.619> those

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
kind of really campaign to push those

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.230 
kind of really campaign to push those
points<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.310> forefront<00:00:20.789> then<00:00:21.060> at<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.180> same

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
us centric approach and we fail to look

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.830 
us centric approach and we fail to look
at<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.760> reality<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.210> what's<00:00:51.390> happening<00:00:51.719> over

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
to share with because people have with

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.210 
to share with because people have with
these<00:04:56.539> preconceptions<00:04:57.110> about<00:04:57.410> poetry<00:04:57.830> but<00:04:58.160> I

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.170 
feel like now is a great moment to share
this<00:05:00.199> because<00:05:00.530> of<00:05:01.039> what's<00:05:01.460> going<00:05:01.550> on<00:05:01.910> and<00:05:01.940> the

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
this because of what's going on and the

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.640 
this because of what's going on and the
conversations<00:05:02.720> that<00:05:02.780> aren't<00:05:03.050> happening<00:05:03.349> and

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
George's poetry and in his ability to

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:11.740 
George's poetry and in his ability to
create<00:05:10.250> poetry<00:05:10.430> over<00:05:11.060> the<00:05:11.210> weird<00:05:11.479> disconnect

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
create poetry over the weird disconnect
