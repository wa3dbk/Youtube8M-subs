00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
 so hello and that is welcomed first 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:13.440
 in a little tutorial from me and 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:17.430
 although many of my group have me 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.210
 asked if I can show it this way 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.480
 then when I made a tree round 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.099
 because many somehow do not get along 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.109
 Actually, that's the easiest thing 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.780
 easier five additions 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.579
 the square tree but somehow they have 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.989
 said yes when first worked out and 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.890
 now it does not work anymore I know too 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.500
 not why and why and the pictures 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.750
 they just do not explain anything and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.149
 that's why i thought i show 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.860
 you get started as it is done 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.329
 I have only now for that 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.559
 a few is already where you can do that 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:01.350
 He is behind for the beginning 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:03.870
 angelic and yes I'll tell you that 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.869
 because sometimes you need it 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.060
 afterwards only the chopsticks 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.970
 to hide a long time and but you know that 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.659
 I'll put it down and show it 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.659
 the beginning 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.280
 [Music] 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:33.969
 I think so see 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:37.569
 I always take a bottle here 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:43.090
 she has everything pointed up here 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:46.750
 tapering smejkal arable land and life 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.420
 we add three webs I put a 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.200
 star together that was where i said 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.500
 then has indeed so evenly 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:01.470
 distance to the trunk directly in the 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.470
 In the middle I put this bottle 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.020
 so 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.580
 that's the bottom one died with 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.739
 can me also otherwise the 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.270
 and we want to do that afterwards 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.819
 Not 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.610
 that means that came with this was also 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.180
 there will be no extra 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:31.560
 stuck with it only with this on 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.599
 make always two about it and there 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.330
 which is now too short I do 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:42.360
 directly again the new staff on it 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.239
 we can not get that packed 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.670
 I can not find that two pieces yet 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:53.760
 rules that is you two pieces can do it 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.930
 to offer the bars 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.930
 [Applause] 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.959
 [Music] 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:09.140
 yes always directly over both over it 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.090
 you can see that you see it yourself 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:17.120
 there is nothing that I am there anyway 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:20.810
 Doing it differently as you do with it 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.320
 Safety always over two 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.320
 brothers 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.650
 [Music] 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.620
 [Applause] 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.620
 in the 2nd 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.620
 12 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.720
 Yes 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:48.980
 [Music] 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.980
 the girl can 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 12 here is so short now 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.310
 I'm already living over it 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.940
 1 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.940
 on 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.870
 after a while you can turn it too 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.870
 [Applause] 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.799
 2 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.440
 at 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.370
 No 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:35.800
 always over 2 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.800
 [Music] 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:44.120
 doing this one could turn stebe 100 was 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:45.830
 should not just stay 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:51.550
 [Applause] 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:55.450
 [Music] 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:05:04.660
 you see that over 2 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:13.200
 [Music] 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:13.200
 and below it all looks so yes 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:20.139
 but it is important that the whole 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:25.310
 time has said urban 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:27.760
 the rear over the first and over the 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:32.320
 second 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.320
 another rod-off 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.440
 over and over the second 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.199
 or a steak sense 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.440
 [Music] 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.889
 on the 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:06:00.030
 and over the next there comes this one 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.030
 must make effects 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.430
 Always hold it once over it 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.640
 is 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:14.490
 [Music] 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:23.239
 [Applause] 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:23.239
 [Music] 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.210
 which once won is once 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.740
 have made 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:36.960
 at the beginning then that is very fast and so 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.259
 That was the beginning I wanted 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.110
 Do not actually show it now because like 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:44.300
 you can see the now nice book 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:51.030
 regulations 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:54.979
 yes and now you go on like this and 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:58.440
 monument now I have understood 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:07:00.810
 and I think all the new ones on me 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:05.520
 I'm so scared we are now 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:09.570
 already with 231 new members in the 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.550
 are group and that is totally funny 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.280
 totally cool and should you continue 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.530
 we have any questions with me 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:19.620
 nobody has to buy 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:22.110
 he bought names is of course trying 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:25.229
 always as good as it gets 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.270
 to explain everything to you if he puts the 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:29.340
 stars are whether it is a why now 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.169
 no idea we always have you 

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.000
 any problems just say 

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:37.320
 decision 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.610
 I try to help but with 

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.090
 security are 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:45.590
 other nice girls in the group the 

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.590
 that already makes x1000 math 

00:07:46.039 --> 00:07:52.330
 maybe we'll do my video too 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:56.690
 Writing is not a problem 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.690
 [Applause]
