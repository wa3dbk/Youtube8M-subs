same people each time but it's bad

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.010 
same people each time but it's bad
because<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:12.120> means<00:02:12.270> they<00:02:12.420> don't<00:02:12.660> get<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.870> make

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020

portal outside Pirates of the Caribbean
it's<00:02:19.170> just<00:02:19.560> where<00:02:19.710> you<00:02:19.740> happen<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.220> be<00:02:20.310> seeing

very cheap animation making everything

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.140 
very cheap animation making everything
interchangeable<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:26.010> efficient<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:27.060> it

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
interchangeable is efficient but it

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.700 
interchangeable is efficient but it
means<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.480> nothing<00:02:27.630> gets<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:28.050> be<00:02:28.170> special

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
means that nothing gets to be special

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.650 
means that nothing gets to be special
and<00:02:28.950> speaking<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.730> interchangeable<00:02:30.420> it

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.480 
and speaking of interchangeable it
doesn't<00:02:31.320> seem<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.830> make<00:02:32.010> any<00:02:32.070> difference

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490

doesn't seem to make any difference
which<00:02:33.000> spells<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.660> use<00:02:33.990> there<00:02:34.890> will<00:02:35.010> be<00:02:35.100> a

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
which spells you use there will be a

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.160 
which spells you use there will be a
slightly<00:02:35.520> different<00:02:35.880> spell<00:02:36.390> animation<00:02:37.020> with

slightly different spell animation with
each<00:02:37.290> one<00:02:37.560> but<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.860> results<00:02:38.190> will<00:02:38.340> always<00:02:38.790> be

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
each one but the results will always be

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.880 
each one but the results will always be
the<00:02:39.150> same<00:02:39.420> which<00:02:39.750> cuts<00:02:40.110> down<00:02:40.200> on<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.500> lot<00:02:40.709> of<00:02:40.830> the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
motivation to collect them all the cards

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.199 
motivation to collect them all the cards
do<00:02:43.320> have<00:02:43.560> stats<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.130> classes<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.000> would

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
do have stats and classes so you would

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.720 
do have stats and classes so you would
think<00:02:45.240> those<00:02:45.720> things<00:02:45.930> would<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:47.010> know<00:02:47.190> make<00:02:47.670> a

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
think those things would you know make a

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.670 
think those things would you know make a
difference<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.510> yes<00:02:49.140> making<00:02:49.560> them

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
difference and yes making them

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.230 
difference and yes making them
interchangeable<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.400> easier<00:02:50.700> on<00:02:50.850> kids<00:02:51.090> who

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
interchangeable is easier on kids who

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.880 
interchangeable is easier on kids who
want<00:02:51.450> quite<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:51.870> card<00:02:52.170> game<00:02:52.410> minded
