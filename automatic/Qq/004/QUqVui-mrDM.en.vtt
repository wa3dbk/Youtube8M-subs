00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
no not at all no the only thing I did

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.149 
no not at all no the only thing I did
notice<00:02:58.430> is<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.629> looked<00:02:59.840> at<00:02:59.989> some<00:03:00.159> point

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
notice is that you looked at some point

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.649 
notice is that you looked at some point
as<00:03:01.340> if<00:03:01.489> you<00:03:01.579> were<00:03:01.700> running<00:03:01.849> that<00:03:02.060> cable<00:03:02.480> there

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
as if you were running that cable there

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.229 
as if you were running that cable there
is<00:03:03.170> most<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.650> it<00:03:03.890> is<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.040> short<00:03:04.370> lead<00:03:04.609> on<00:03:04.849> it<00:03:05.000> yeah

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
is most of it is a short lead on it yeah

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.509 
is most of it is a short lead on it yeah
yeah<00:03:05.959> I<00:03:05.989> think<00:03:06.140> you<00:03:06.620> know<00:03:06.739> working<00:03:06.980> any<00:03:07.220> sort

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
yeah I think you know working any sort

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.970 
yeah I think you know working any sort
of<00:03:07.579> distance<00:03:08.000> especially<00:03:08.349> maybe<00:03:09.349> you<00:03:09.560> wanted

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
of distance especially maybe you wanted

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.009 
of distance especially maybe you wanted
to<00:03:10.040> get<00:03:10.159> anything<00:03:10.340> higher<00:03:10.639> yeah<00:03:11.120> of<00:03:11.599> a<00:03:11.810> ladder

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
to get anything higher yeah of a ladder

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.649 
to get anything higher yeah of a ladder
idea<00:03:12.409> no<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:12.650> do<00:03:12.799> know<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:14.120> know<00:03:14.269> you<00:03:14.329> might

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
idea no I do know you know you might

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.479 
idea no I do know you know you might
find<00:03:14.810> yourself<00:03:14.989> lifting<00:03:15.409> that<00:03:15.799> actually<00:03:16.400> off

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
find yourself lifting that actually off

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.030 
find yourself lifting that actually off
the<00:03:16.639> ground<00:03:16.879> right<00:03:17.209> what<00:03:18.049> what<00:03:18.260> is<00:03:18.620> really

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
the ground right what what is really

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.460 
the ground right what what is really
important<00:03:19.609> to<00:03:19.730> remember<00:03:20.319> people<00:03:21.319> that

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
important to remember people that

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.960 
important to remember people that
anything<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.010> you're<00:03:22.400> using<00:03:22.639> outside

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
anything that you're using outside

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.670 
anything that you're using outside
anything<00:03:23.659> electrical<00:03:23.959> whether<00:03:24.260> it's<00:03:24.409> a<00:03:24.500> lawn

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
anything electrical whether it's a lawn

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.580 
anything electrical whether it's a lawn
mower<00:03:24.950> power<00:03:25.700> saw<00:03:26.000> whatever<00:03:26.299> it<00:03:26.569> is<00:03:26.720> needs<00:03:27.440> to

mower power saw whatever it is needs to

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.699 
mower power saw whatever it is needs to
be<00:03:27.799> connected<00:03:28.069> to<00:03:28.549> an<00:03:28.819> RCD<00:03:29.720> socket<00:03:30.230> as<00:03:30.650> a

be connected to an RCD socket as a
residual<00:03:31.579> current<00:03:31.790> device<00:03:32.470> so<00:03:33.470> that<00:03:33.650> if

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
residual current device so that if

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.379 
residual current device so that if
anything<00:03:34.129> goes<00:03:34.340> wrong<00:03:34.699> if<00:03:34.879> divert<00:03:35.090> to

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
anything goes wrong if divert to

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.720 
anything goes wrong if divert to
accidentally<00:03:35.840> cut<00:03:36.019> through<00:03:36.169> a<00:03:36.260> cord<00:03:36.560> or<00:03:37.250> kick

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
accidentally cut through a cord or kick

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.159 
accidentally cut through a cord or kick
the<00:03:37.849> plug<00:03:38.060> or<00:03:38.239> something<00:03:38.480> it<00:03:38.599> will<00:03:38.720> cut<00:03:38.959> out

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169 
the plug or something it will cut out

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:40.809 
the plug or something it will cut out
immediately<00:03:39.410> a<00:03:39.709> sense<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.190> any<00:03:40.340> any

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
immediately a sense is any any

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.520 
immediately a sense is any any
difference<00:03:41.510> in<00:03:41.660> current<00:03:42.019> little<00:03:42.230> cut<00:03:42.379> out

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
difference in current little cut out

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.349 
difference in current little cut out
immediately<00:03:42.769> so<00:03:43.069> when<00:03:43.760> you've<00:03:43.910> got<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.060> short

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
immediately so when you've got a short

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.240 
immediately so when you've got a short
cord<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:44.930> you're<00:03:45.349> leaning<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.709> long<00:03:45.859> way<00:03:46.040> the

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
cord and you're leaning a long way the

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.409 
cord and you're leaning a long way the
danger<00:03:46.609> is<00:03:46.760> that<00:03:46.790> you're<00:03:47.030> actually<00:03:47.150> going<00:03:47.359> to

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
danger is that you're actually going to

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.170 
danger is that you're actually going to
pick<00:03:47.629> up<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:47.930> extension<00:03:48.079> lead<00:03:49.090> where<00:03:50.090> the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
pick up the extension lead where the

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.869 
pick up the extension lead where the
extension<00:03:50.660> lead<00:03:50.810> is<00:03:50.930> connected<00:03:51.079> to<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.650> reel

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
extension lead is connected to the reel

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.400 
extension lead is connected to the reel
and<00:03:52.879> you've<00:03:53.569> got<00:03:53.720> enough<00:03:53.959> weight<00:03:54.169> in<00:03:54.319> the

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
and you've got enough weight in the

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.589 
and you've got enough weight in the
pulse<00:03:54.620> or<00:03:54.829> without<00:03:55.160> picking<00:03:55.489> up<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:55.699> reel<00:03:56.419> as

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
pulse or without picking up the reel as

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.680 
pulse or without picking up the reel as
well<00:03:56.780> but<00:03:57.379> overall<00:03:57.739> I<00:03:57.889> think<00:03:58.310> that<00:03:58.549> I<00:03:59.090> did

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
well but overall I think that I did

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:00.369 
well but overall I think that I did
notice

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
notice

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.099 
notice
yeah<00:04:01.250> well<00:04:01.609> disconnect<00:04:02.120> that<00:04:02.150> before<00:04:02.599> we<00:04:02.720> mess

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
yeah well disconnect that before we mess

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.189 
yeah well disconnect that before we mess
around<00:04:03.139> with<00:04:03.590> it<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:04.430> did<00:04:04.879> notice<00:04:05.299> the<00:04:06.019> little

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:06.199 
around with it I did notice the little

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.960 
around with it I did notice the little
orange<00:04:06.709> thing<00:04:06.949> on<00:04:07.069> the<00:04:07.190> top<00:04:07.400> what's<00:04:07.669> that<00:04:07.849> is

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
orange thing on the top what's that is

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.580 
orange thing on the top what's that is
that<00:04:08.090> presumably<00:04:08.660> for<00:04:08.840> oil<00:04:08.989> for<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.349> chain

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
that presumably for oil for the chain

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.199 
that presumably for oil for the chain
yeah<00:04:09.949> this<00:04:10.129> is<00:04:10.220> just<00:04:10.430> like<00:04:10.549> any<00:04:10.730> other<00:04:10.910> chain

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
yeah this is just like any other chain

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.089 
yeah this is just like any other chain
tool<00:04:11.419> you<00:04:11.599> need<00:04:11.930> to<00:04:12.079> have<00:04:12.169> chain<00:04:12.409> oil<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.889> keep

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
tool you need to have chain oil to keep

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.740 
tool you need to have chain oil to keep
it<00:04:13.280> lubricated<00:04:13.519> right<00:04:14.120> on<00:04:14.239> the<00:04:14.329> chain<00:04:14.540> in<00:04:14.690> the

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
it lubricated right on the chain in the

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.930 
it lubricated right on the chain in the
bar<00:04:14.930> you<00:04:15.139> know<00:04:15.290> excellent<00:04:15.889> yeah<00:04:16.159> doesn't<00:04:16.639> come

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
bar you know excellent yeah doesn't come

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.300 
bar you know excellent yeah doesn't come
with<00:04:17.090> oil<00:04:17.269> and<00:04:17.659> so<00:04:18.169> oh<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.620> there's<00:04:18.889> a<00:04:18.949> marker

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
with oil and so oh and there's a marker

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.699 
with oil and so oh and there's a marker
I<00:04:19.340> don't<00:04:19.609> know<00:04:19.699> if<00:04:19.789> you<00:04:19.880> can<00:04:20.090> see<00:04:20.329> that<00:04:20.709> let's

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
I don't know if you can see that let's

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.600 
I don't know if you can see that let's
turn<00:04:22.460> that<00:04:22.669> round<00:04:23.199> there's<00:04:24.199> a<00:04:24.550> there's<00:04:25.550> a

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
turn that round there's a there's a

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.879 
turn that round there's a there's a
little<00:04:25.699> gauge<00:04:26.030> there<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:27.470> shows<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:27.770> how

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
little gauge there that shows you how

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.680 
little gauge there that shows you how
much<00:04:28.039> China<00:04:28.370> all<00:04:28.610> you've<00:04:28.760> got<00:04:28.970> how<00:04:29.330> often<00:04:29.630> does

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
much China all you've got how often does

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.070 
much China all you've got how often does
that<00:04:29.780> need<00:04:29.990> topping<00:04:30.320> up<00:04:30.440> Dave<00:04:31.780> well<00:04:32.780> it's

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
that need topping up Dave well it's

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.140 
that need topping up Dave well it's
worth<00:04:33.260> checking<00:04:33.289> after<00:04:34.010> every<00:04:34.250> use<00:04:34.400> over<00:04:34.789> yeah

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
worth checking after every use over yeah

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.850 
worth checking after every use over yeah
with<00:04:35.360> a<00:04:35.389> chance<00:04:35.690> or<00:04:35.930> you<00:04:36.110> tend<00:04:36.320> to<00:04:36.380> top<00:04:36.590> up<00:04:36.740> your

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
with a chance or you tend to top up your

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.129 
with a chance or you tend to top up your
oil<00:04:36.919> after<00:04:37.610> you<00:04:37.669> run<00:04:37.820> out<00:04:37.940> of<00:04:37.969> fuel<00:04:38.240> right<00:04:38.810> so

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
oil after you run out of fuel right so

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.990 
oil after you run out of fuel right so
obviously<00:04:39.560> without<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:39.919> constant<00:04:40.700> supply<00:04:40.940> of

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
obviously without the constant supply of

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.629 
obviously without the constant supply of
fuel

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
fuel

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.339 
fuel
yeah<00:04:41.819> you<00:04:42.180> need<00:04:42.330> to<00:04:42.389> check<00:04:42.719> it<00:04:42.870> more<00:04:42.990> regularly

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
yeah you need to check it more regularly

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.969 
yeah you need to check it more regularly
yeah<00:04:43.979> we're<00:04:44.490> checking<00:04:44.520> okay<00:04:45.240> and<00:04:45.860> and<00:04:46.860> of

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
yeah we're checking okay and and of

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.149 
yeah we're checking okay and and of
course<00:04:47.189> I'm<00:04:47.310> assuming<00:04:47.430> not<00:04:48.330> being<00:04:48.659> a<00:04:49.159> gardener

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
course I'm assuming not being a gardener

of any description I'm assuming these
spikes<00:04:53.520> here<00:04:53.849> are<00:04:54.300> to<00:04:54.539> jam<00:04:54.779> into<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.370> helps

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
spikes here are to jam into the helps

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.339 
spikes here are to jam into the helps
grip<00:04:56.580> into<00:04:56.759> the<00:04:56.969> wood<00:04:57.150> it<00:04:57.479> stops<00:04:57.749> it<00:04:57.900> bounce<00:04:58.110> it

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
stops the blade kicking about yet okay

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.890 
stops the blade kicking about yet okay
so<00:05:01.009> if<00:05:02.009> I<00:05:02.699> dunno<00:05:03.029> I<00:05:03.120> was<00:05:03.240> summing<00:05:03.599> up<00:05:03.719> what

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
so if I dunno I was summing up what

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.920 
so if I dunno I was summing up what
you've<00:05:04.020> said<00:05:04.289> tell<00:05:04.560> me<00:05:04.710> if<00:05:04.770> I'm<00:05:04.919> wrong<00:05:05.099> but

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
you've said tell me if I'm wrong but

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.540 
you've said tell me if I'm wrong but
heavy-duty<00:05:06.930> enough<00:05:07.379> to<00:05:07.560> actually<00:05:07.740> be<00:05:08.039> used<00:05:08.310> on

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
heavy-duty enough to actually be used on

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.179 
heavy-duty enough to actually be used on
it<00:05:09.240> on<00:05:09.539> stuff<00:05:09.840> like<00:05:09.990> that<00:05:10.289> branches

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:11.189 
it on stuff like that branches

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:13.100 
it on stuff like that branches
what<00:05:11.520> would<00:05:11.610> you<00:05:11.699> say<00:05:11.879> diameter<00:05:12.449> you<00:05:12.810> probably

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
what would you say diameter you probably

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.290 
what would you say diameter you probably
got<00:05:13.349> to<00:05:13.379> almost<00:05:13.800> three<00:05:14.069> inch<00:05:14.219> diameter<00:05:14.460> 75

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
got to almost three inch diameter 75

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.510 
got to almost three inch diameter 75
millimeter<00:05:15.779> that<00:05:16.110> that's<00:05:16.349> quite<00:05:16.590> a<00:05:16.620> big<00:05:16.830> chunk

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
millimeter that that's quite a big chunk

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.740 
millimeter that that's quite a big chunk
is<00:05:17.669> there<00:05:17.879> in<00:05:18.060> mind<00:05:18.270> if<00:05:18.449> you're<00:05:18.539> cutting

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
is there in mind if you're cutting

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.189 
is there in mind if you're cutting
anything<00:05:19.169> that's<00:05:19.409> that<00:05:19.919> size<00:05:20.699> up<00:05:21.150> a<00:05:21.300> tree<00:05:21.569> it's

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
anything that's that size up a tree it's

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.200 
anything that's that size up a tree it's
going<00:05:22.379> to<00:05:22.529> come<00:05:22.710> down<00:05:22.889> it's<00:05:23.129> yeah<00:05:23.279> I<00:05:23.310> notice

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
going to come down it's yeah I notice

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.040 
going to come down it's yeah I notice
you<00:05:24.330> got<00:05:24.509> your<00:05:24.629> helmet<00:05:24.900> on

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
you got your helmet on

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.429 
you got your helmet on
that's<00:05:25.650> something<00:05:26.189> okay<00:05:26.870> and<00:05:27.870> of<00:05:28.020> course<00:05:28.259> the

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:28.439 
that's something okay and of course the

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:30.529 
that's something okay and of course the
extension<00:05:29.039> is<00:05:29.219> is<00:05:29.699> pretty<00:05:30.029> good<00:05:30.210> as<00:05:30.360> well<00:05:30.389> I

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
extension is is pretty good as well I

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.629 
extension is is pretty good as well I
don't<00:05:30.840> know<00:05:30.960> how<00:05:31.169> did<00:05:31.889> we<00:05:32.009> measure<00:05:32.219> how<00:05:32.430> far

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
don't know how did we measure how far

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.670 
don't know how did we measure how far
that<00:05:32.819> goes<00:05:33.000> out<00:05:33.240> I<00:05:35.300> think<00:05:36.300> we<00:05:36.449> can<00:05:36.629> see<00:05:36.870> it

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
that goes out I think we can see it

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.100 
that goes out I think we can see it
looked<00:05:37.860> to<00:05:37.949> me<00:05:38.069> like<00:05:38.099> about<00:05:38.370> 12<00:05:38.759> foot<00:05:39.110> from

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
looked to me like about 12 foot from

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.529 
looked to me like about 12 foot from
start<00:05:40.409> to<00:05:40.589> finish<00:05:40.620> so<00:05:40.919> if<00:05:41.159> we<00:05:41.339> tighten<00:05:42.240> that<00:05:42.479> up

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
start to finish so if we tighten that up

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.959 
start to finish so if we tighten that up
I<00:05:42.990> don't<00:05:43.949> know<00:05:44.039> whether<00:05:44.219> the<00:05:44.400> camera<00:05:44.729> can<00:05:44.849> get

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:44.969 
I don't know whether the camera can get

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:48.140 
I don't know whether the camera can get
it<00:05:45.089> all<00:05:45.270> in<00:05:45.300> shot<00:05:45.779> but<00:05:46.710> you<00:05:47.159> know<00:05:47.279> I'm<00:05:47.699> an<00:05:47.909> I'm

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
it all in shot but you know I'm an I'm

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.200 
it all in shot but you know I'm an I'm
only<00:05:48.360> 5<00:05:48.629> foot<00:05:48.839> nothing<00:05:49.020> but<00:05:49.490> you<00:05:50.490> know<00:05:50.610> we're

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
only 5 foot nothing but you know we're

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.360 
only 5 foot nothing but you know we're
look<00:05:51.419> you're<00:05:51.569> looking<00:05:51.900> at<00:05:52.050> at<00:05:52.199> least<00:05:52.229> 12<00:05:52.770> to<00:05:52.979> 13

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
look you're looking at at least 12 to 13

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.429 
look you're looking at at least 12 to 13
foot<00:05:53.639> height<00:05:53.879> there<00:05:54.120> so<00:05:54.360> that's<00:05:55.229> pretty

00:05:55.429 --> 00:05:55.439 
foot height there so that's pretty

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:57.230 
foot height there so that's pretty
extensive<00:05:56.129> and<00:05:56.310> would<00:05:56.759> cover<00:05:56.969> most

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
extensive and would cover most

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.879 
extensive and would cover most
overhanging<00:05:57.750> branches<00:05:58.319> that<00:05:58.560> you<00:05:58.649> want<00:05:58.800> to

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
overhanging branches that you want to

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.670 
overhanging branches that you want to
keep<00:05:59.520> away<00:05:59.699> as<00:06:00.000> Dave's<00:06:00.270> done<00:06:00.479> there<00:06:00.689> from<00:06:00.960> from

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
keep away as Dave's done there from from

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.679 
keep away as Dave's done there from from
the<00:06:01.770> roof<00:06:01.949> or<00:06:02.189> from<00:06:02.399> you<00:06:02.550> from<00:06:03.120> your<00:06:03.270> guttering

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:03.689 
the roof or from you from your guttering

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:06.469 
the roof or from you from your guttering
so<00:06:04.439> the<00:06:05.039> professionals<00:06:05.819> say<00:06:05.969> it's<00:06:06.120> a<00:06:06.180> good<00:06:06.360> bit

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
so the professionals say it's a good bit

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.779 
so the professionals say it's a good bit
of<00:06:06.569> kit<00:06:06.889> we've<00:06:07.889> got<00:06:08.069> to<00:06:08.189> go<00:06:08.279> along<00:06:08.399> with<00:06:08.550> their

words so that's the tighten pole saw

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:15.740 
words so that's the tighten pole saw
