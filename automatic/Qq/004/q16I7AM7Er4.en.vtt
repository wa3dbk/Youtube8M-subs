and try to play counter attack but we

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.630 
and try to play counter attack but we
went<00:01:07.229> from<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.560> beginning<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.159> tried<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.490> put

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
went from the beginning we tried to put

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.460 
went from the beginning we tried to put
down<00:01:08.790> under<00:01:09.060> pressure<00:01:09.299> we<00:01:09.990> were<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.229> top<00:01:10.409> of

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
down under pressure we were on top of

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.160 
down under pressure we were on top of
them<00:01:10.770> was<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> idea<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.720> could<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.020> until

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
them was the idea and we could do until

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.850 
them was the idea and we could do until
then<00:01:14.509> you<00:01:15.509> think<00:01:15.689> you'll<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:15.900> some<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.439> bit

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
then you think you'll get some a bit

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.920 
then you think you'll get some a bit

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
performance like that we are at the top

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.950 
performance like that we are at the top
of<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.070> record<00:01:23.460> because<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.570> last<00:01:24.720> five

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
of this record because in the last five

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.270 
of this record because in the last five
years<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.259> team<00:01:25.470> has<00:01:25.530> been<00:01:25.770> really<00:01:26.070> good<00:01:26.220> so

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
years the team has been really good so

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.020 
years the team has been really good so
today<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.330> another<00:01:27.659> good<00:01:28.170> game<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.729> i<00:01:29.729> think

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
today is another good game and i think

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.940 
today is another good game and i think
it<00:01:30.090> would<00:01:30.180> be<00:01:30.299> very<00:01:30.329> good<00:01:30.720> for<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.020> funds<00:01:31.290> so

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
it would be very good for the funds so

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.810 
it would be very good for the funds so
we<00:01:32.100> will<00:01:32.220> enjoy<00:01:32.369> until<00:01:32.790> saturday

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.630 

all<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.750> pressure<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.230> every<00:01:40.590> night<00:01:40.800> I<00:01:43.640> think

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
all the pressure and every night I think

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.760 
all the pressure and every night I think
that<00:01:44.729> when<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.930> an<00:01:46.140> important<00:01:46.680> game

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
that when you have an important game

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
that when you have an important game
coming<00:01:47.430> soon<00:01:47.640> if<00:01:48.510> the<00:01:48.720> players<00:01:48.960> play<00:01:49.200> well<00:01:49.410> and

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
coming soon if the players play well and

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.880 
coming soon if the players play well and
score<00:01:50.790> four<00:01:51.090> goals<00:01:51.120> and<00:01:51.630> especially<00:01:52.530> against

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
score four goals and especially against

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.410 
score four goals and especially against
a<00:01:52.979> top<00:01:53.190> side<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.550> Grandma<00:01:53.880> did<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.180> have<00:01:54.300> to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
a top side like Grandma did you have to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.140

earlier<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.560> confidence<00:02:05.100> why's<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:06.000> must

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
earlier in the confidence why's it must

earlier in the confidence why's it must
do<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> world<00:02:06.690> of<00:02:06.840> good<00:02:06.900> you<00:02:07.170> not<00:02:07.320> been<00:02:07.500> well<00:02:07.680> I

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
think that was really important for us

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.170 
think that was really important for us
but<00:02:10.229> they<00:02:10.430> again<00:02:11.430> we<00:02:11.580> will<00:02:11.670> play<00:02:11.850> against<00:02:12.060> a

win<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.180> then<00:02:15.420> if<00:02:16.140> we<00:02:16.320> can<00:02:16.680> reduce<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.100> gap

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
you know that would be difficult will be

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.940 
you know that would be difficult will be
tight<00:02:42.950> but<00:02:43.030> we<00:02:44.030> play<00:02:44.269> really<00:02:44.480> well<00:02:44.689> away<00:02:45.680> we

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
tight but we play really well away we

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.670 
tight but we play really well away we
had<00:02:46.099> to<00:02:46.280> do<00:02:46.400> things<00:02:46.639> that<00:02:46.790> they<00:02:46.849> were<00:02:47.269> doing

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680
