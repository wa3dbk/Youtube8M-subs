00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.019
 Welcome to a new edition of the fair Live TV Reportage 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.289
 Summertime is vacation time and many a man steers this year again 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.980
 by car from his holiday destination to the stopover Alesheim Stelle 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.029
 However, this is certainly not one of the highlights of a place 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.640
 in Unna album find because of the high gasoline prices right because no one else 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.190
 to be reminded 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.980
 Electric vehicles are therefore the great hope of the twenty-first 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.040
 However, her early success depends largely on her 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.650
 Range from here it was not only on more efficient and cheaper 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.300
 Batteries but also on the n-energy throughout the vehicle intelligent 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.530
 to manage electronics in their use for this meanwhile most modern 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.380
 Semiconductors ensure that the electrical energy in batteries and in the 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.620
 Electric vehicle is used particularly efficiently and the range of the 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.930
 Cars thus increased significantly 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.930
 no big city in 2020 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.380
 the spoils integrated solar and wind turbines provide enough 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.030
 green stream 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.740
 an electric vehicles with their quiet drives 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.110
 not just changing the big city numbers 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.000
 The engine no longer sits under the hood open up completely new 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.390
 Free rooms 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.390
 hor 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.060
 Euro and that also applies to the interior of the vehicle 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.360
 Until then, there is still a lot to do 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.109
 which costs of the batteries are the essential reason 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.259
 why vehicles today can not compete with conventional ones 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.599
 to improve this technology 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.680
 Engineers of a Munich-based semiconductor company test lithium-ion batteries 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.680
 in special research vehicle 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:29.179
 During test drives, they collect data and analyze the bar in-house 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:32.879
 the scientists are expanding the energy storage 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.159
 to explore it further 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.940
 we will investigate and with the use of electronics 14 young batteries 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.099
 can do more efficient so that can be used in the restaurant 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.939
 whole is also priced interesting 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.439
 so that the expensive batteries pay off 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.289
 they have to absorb as much energy as possible 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:54.289
 and that is exactly what the engineers are trying to achieve 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.040
 For this, the Munich scientists have a new electronic 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.040
 Circuit constructed 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.200
 A battery consists of several cells whose capacities fluctuate 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:13.189
 be subject to 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.930
 Normally, the current flow stops when charging as soon as the cell with the 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.129
 lowest capacity is full 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:21.040
 the bigger ones 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.989
 Center not fully loaded 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.400
 however, the new battery also has several tracks 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.379
 which are located on an iron core 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.760
 the current now flows out of the small cell in a study 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.169
 creates a magnetic field 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.139
 this energetic field prepares itself over the iron core 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.139
 also out to the big school 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:55.719
 the current flow from the cell with the lowest capacity is stopped 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:04:01.459
 the energy of the magnetic field of the large coil turns into electricity and 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.459
 flows in a cell 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.329
 this process of energy transfer 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.959
 Repeats until the small cell is free enough again 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.959
 Reduced capacity 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.430
 the doctors can fully charge all the cells 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.490
 In the experiment, the battery was refueling with this active equalization control 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.490
 actually more power than a conventional one 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.099
 and now 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.099
 should she prove herself in practice? 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:52.029
 the driver in the black sheep has a conventional 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:53.699
 who in white 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.699
 about the new technologies 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:03.259
 so that the energy storage are claimed equally 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.259
 Both bike path would say the same route 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.889
 and of course exactly the same driving style 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:19.639
 and so 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.639
 it goes through Munich 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:28.409
 unlike combustion engines, the drives show even at low 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:29.120
 speeds 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.120
 full power 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:42.399
 After about 40 kilometers, the driver registers with the bright drove and the 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:45.399
 new system still no performance degradation 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:50.220
 conventional technologies 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.220
 shows, however, speak 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:57.039
 the test proves 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:01.100
 the new electronic system can store more energy in the battery 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.100
 and use these for the sat nav in the car 

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:18.389
 Around 45 kilometers, the test drive is over 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.050
 the result 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.620
 The range is already increasing today thanks to the electronic control system 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.339
 by ten percent 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:28.279
 and that's not all 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:31.349
 in cooperation with more than 30 partners, the Munich work 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.039
 Scientists in the project the three k 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:37.039
 on additional components for even more range 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:43.139
 The project is going to have electronic components and Bryce's showing 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:44.499
 semiconductor-developed 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:48.839
 that make electric driving 35 percent more efficient 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.599
 inside and the project itself will cause the 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:55.599
 Electric cars will be faster in the market 

00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:00.009
 Smart semiconductors are the key to being competitive 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:02.110
 electric cars 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.800
 Increase efficiency by 35 percent 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.800
 Help electromobility to make a breakthrough 

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:16.370
 while some floors 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.610
 higher and a few years later 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.379
 how is not only the interior of vehicles changing? 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:30.059
 the quiet and clean e-mobile bring Easter home all the way to Ott 

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:34.599
 and while you relax 

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:37.110
 is it the sport wirig 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.550
 and 8 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.080
 on 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.669
 RTL II banned that sounds yes at least further it says that in 

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:50.210
 Considering the donation flow Director is selling 

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.729
 and so far then our fair Leipzig party leader he has today 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:57.349
 they were good with them and until the next one
