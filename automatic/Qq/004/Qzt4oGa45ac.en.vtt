00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.430
 ah 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:17.320
 hi my name is james that in tongue 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.330
 indigenous huitoto means Turkish monkey 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.570
 I am a young girl who was born in a forest of 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.270
 Colombia three years ago I still remember 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.160
 the first days when I was traveling from branch 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.919
 on branch clinging to the back of my 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.869
 parents just when I was learning 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.899
 what family life was like 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.120
 separated from my pack have passed many 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.270
 moons since I last saw my 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.329
 parents and I think it's very difficult for 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.579
 come back to find someone still not 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.190
 I understand why he took me to a farm 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.800
 where she lived tied to a wire that 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.230
 it only allowed me to move on the floor and 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.230
 look from afar at the glasses of the 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.539
 trees that follow me to the wind 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.999
 during my life as a pet I shared the 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.819
 place with a group of dogs I had to 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:06.190
 eat what they ate drink what 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:08.470
 they had to play as they played 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.480
 but over time my health deteriorated 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.360
 and I was about to die 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.550
 today my life has changed alive in company 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.500
 of a handsome monkey of my same species 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.440
 in the zoo of cali I am 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.240
 recovering from my illness my dream is 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.520
 that the Cali zoo can build 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.260
