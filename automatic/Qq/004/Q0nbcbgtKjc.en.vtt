00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.680 
you about the side effects of kidney
dialysis<00:00:07.760> there<00:00:08.760> are<00:00:08.910> many<00:00:09.090> different<00:00:09.510> side

and some of them depend on the type of

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.400 
and some of them depend on the type of
dialysis<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:14.880> you're<00:00:15.059> getting<00:00:15.330> there<00:00:16.260> are

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
of dialysis that a person can actually

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.580 
of dialysis that a person can actually
do<00:00:25.260> at<00:00:25.529> home<00:00:25.949> or<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.240> job<00:00:27.449> with<00:00:28.380> this

do at home or on the job with this
particular<00:00:29.130> type<00:00:29.369> there's<00:00:29.849> actually<00:00:30.449> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
particular type there's actually a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.060 
particular type there's actually a
couple<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.080> other<00:00:31.289> subtypes<00:00:31.980> one<00:00:32.880> involves

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
basically what it's called ambulatory

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.680 
basically what it's called ambulatory
dialysis<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:38.489> particular<00:00:39.000> person<00:00:39.420> has

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
dialysis and this particular person has

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.500 
dialysis and this particular person has
a<00:00:40.079> catheter<00:00:40.860> that's<00:00:41.250> been<00:00:41.610> implanted<00:00:42.149> into

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
a catheter that's been implanted into

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.889 
a catheter that's been implanted into
their<00:00:42.719> abdomen<00:00:43.250> they<00:00:44.250> are<00:00:44.520> doing<00:00:44.899> exchanges

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
their abdomen they are doing exchanges

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.779 
their abdomen they are doing exchanges
with<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.140> diet<00:00:46.410> solution<00:00:46.980> where<00:00:47.520> they

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
with the diet solution where they

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.740 
with the diet solution where they
basically<00:00:48.450> pour<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.710> diet<00:00:50.190> solution<00:00:50.750> go

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
basically pour in the diet solution go

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.450 
basically pour in the diet solution go
on<00:00:51.899> about<00:00:52.110> their<00:00:52.289> business<00:00:52.320> for<00:00:52.920> four<00:00:53.160> or<00:00:53.280> five

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
on about their business for four or five

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.970 
on about their business for four or five
hours<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.210> then<00:00:54.539> drain<00:00:54.899> out<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.140> diet

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
hours and then drain out the diet

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.560 
hours and then drain out the diet
solution<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.610> exchange<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.149> with<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.300> new

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
solution and exchange it with a new

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.130 
solution and exchange it with a new
solution<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:59.160> risk<00:00:59.670> in<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.570> particular

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
solution the risk in this particular

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.799 
solution the risk in this particular
type<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.710> infection<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.850> particular

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
type is infection in that particular

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.350 
type is infection in that particular
area<00:01:03.989> where<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> catheter<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.220> because<00:01:06.030> again

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
area where the catheter is because again

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.100 
area where the catheter is because again
you<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.770> exposure<00:01:07.770> from<00:01:08.330> your<00:01:09.330> outside<00:01:09.780> skin

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
you have exposure from your outside skin

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.469 
you have exposure from your outside skin
there<00:01:10.799> could<00:01:11.010> be<00:01:11.159> any<00:01:11.490> source<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.970> bacteria

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
there could be any source of bacteria

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.960 
there could be any source of bacteria
that<00:01:12.510> may<00:01:12.869> enter<00:01:13.350> into<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.830> diet<00:01:14.340> solution<00:01:14.490> so

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that may enter into the diet solution so

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.370 
that may enter into the diet solution so
you<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> very<00:01:15.630> high<00:01:15.869> risk<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.290> infection

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
you have a very high risk of infection

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.070 
you have a very high risk of infection
not<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> catheter<00:01:18.150> area<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:18.900> also

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
not just on the catheter area but also

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.800 
not just on the catheter area but also
inside<00:01:19.799> your<00:01:20.100> peritoneal<00:01:20.670> cavity<00:01:21.360> or<00:01:21.659> your

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
inside your peritoneal cavity or your

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.020 
inside your peritoneal cavity or your
peritoneum<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:23.070> there's<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.340> very<00:01:23.580> high<00:01:23.790> risk

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
peritoneum so there's a very high risk

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.399 
peritoneum so there's a very high risk
for<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.420> source<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.840> infection

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
for that source of infection

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.070 
for that source of infection
another<00:01:26.310> type<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.700> side<00:01:27.330> effect<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:27.990> be

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
another type of side effect that can be

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.890 
another type of side effect that can be
associated<00:01:28.710> with<00:01:28.740> PD<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.900> actually

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
associated with PD is actually

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.499 
associated with PD is actually
developing<00:01:31.439> hernias<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.909> reason<00:01:33.299> why<00:01:33.450> is

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
developing hernias the reason why is

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.600 
developing hernias the reason why is
because<00:01:33.750> your<00:01:34.320> muscles<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:35.070> your<00:01:35.100> abdomen

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
because your muscles in your abdomen

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.999 
because your muscles in your abdomen
become<00:01:36.150> weak<00:01:36.479> when<00:01:36.900> using<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.500> form<00:01:37.799> of

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
become weak when using this form of

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.429 
become weak when using this form of
dialysis<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.820> because<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.750> have<00:01:39.990> all<00:01:40.259> of

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
dialysis and because you have all of

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.370 
dialysis and because you have all of
that<00:01:40.619> liquid<00:01:41.119> solution<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.420> there<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.960> is

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
that liquid solution in there it is

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.469 
that liquid solution in there it is
pushing<00:01:43.590> putting<00:01:44.100> even<00:01:44.220> more<00:01:44.399> pressure<00:01:44.729> on

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
pushing putting even more pressure on

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.719 
pushing putting even more pressure on
these<00:01:45.720> already<00:01:45.960> weak<00:01:46.530> muscles<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.700> a

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
these already weak muscles so you have a

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.780 
these already weak muscles so you have a
very<00:01:48.000> high<00:01:48.210> risk<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.630> developing<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.259> hernia<00:01:49.790> if

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
very high risk of developing a hernia if

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.719 
very high risk of developing a hernia if
you're<00:01:51.090> using<00:01:51.740> hemodialysis<00:01:52.740> that's<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.549> type

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
you're using hemodialysis that's a type

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.280 
you're using hemodialysis that's a type
of<00:01:53.759> dialysis<00:01:54.329> where<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.600> actually<00:01:54.810> are<00:01:55.110> going

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
of dialysis where you actually are going

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.219 
of dialysis where you actually are going
into<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> dialysis<00:01:56.729> center<00:01:56.780> about<00:01:57.780> three<00:01:58.079> days

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
into a dialysis center about three days

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.810 
into a dialysis center about three days
a<00:01:58.259> week<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.890> you're<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.430> there<00:01:59.579> for<00:01:59.729> about

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
a week and you're in there for about

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.899 
a week and you're in there for about
four<00:02:00.210> hours<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.899> there<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.189> can<00:02:02.369> also<00:02:02.549> have

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
four hours and there you can also have

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.810 
four hours and there you can also have
infection<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:04.290> more<00:02:04.860> common<00:02:05.310> side<00:02:05.490> effects

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
infection but more common side effects

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.809 
infection but more common side effects
are<00:02:06.000> things<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.479> low<00:02:06.869> blood<00:02:07.170> pressure

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
are things like low blood pressure

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.700 
are things like low blood pressure
having<00:02:08.819> very<00:02:09.090> dry<00:02:09.539> skin<00:02:09.599> itchy<00:02:10.470> skin

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
having very dry skin itchy skin

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.560 
having very dry skin itchy skin
and<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:11.950> can<00:02:12.100> actually<00:02:12.310> also<00:02:12.850> become

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
and you can actually also become

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.420 
and you can actually also become
malnourished<00:02:13.780> if<00:02:14.440> you're<00:02:14.620> not<00:02:14.800> consuming

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
malnourished if you're not consuming

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.080 
malnourished if you're not consuming
enough<00:02:15.640> high<00:02:16.360> quality<00:02:16.990> protein<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:18.090> another

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
enough high quality protein and another

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.060 
enough high quality protein and another
possible<00:02:19.720> side<00:02:20.110> effect<00:02:20.170> would<00:02:20.590> be<00:02:20.710> actually

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
possible side effect would be actually

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.130 
possible side effect would be actually
having<00:02:21.250> excess<00:02:21.820> levels<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.420> phosphorus<00:02:22.960> if

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
having excess levels of phosphorus if

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.750 
having excess levels of phosphorus if
you<00:02:23.320> aren't<00:02:23.530> following<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:24.280> renal<00:02:24.610> diet

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
you aren't following the renal diet

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.160 
you aren't following the renal diet
that's<00:02:24.970> been<00:02:25.210> prescribed<00:02:25.660> for<00:02:25.900> you

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
that's been prescribed for you

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.140 
that's been prescribed for you
so<00:02:26.650> there's<00:02:26.860> actually<00:02:27.090> several<00:02:28.090> different

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
so there's actually several different

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.660 
so there's actually several different
side<00:02:28.630> effects<00:02:28.960> that<00:02:29.050> can<00:02:29.260> occur<00:02:29.580> depending<00:02:30.580> on

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
side effects that can occur depending on

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.090 
side effects that can occur depending on
whether<00:02:30.880> you're<00:02:31.480> using<00:02:31.510> peritoneal<00:02:32.470> dialysis

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
whether you're using peritoneal dialysis

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.420 
whether you're using peritoneal dialysis
or<00:02:33.420> hemodialysis
