everyone<00:00:01.979> this<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.190> the<00:00:02.399> flooville<00:00:02.730> speck<00:00:03.000> 5<00:00:03.510> I

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
everyone this is the flooville speck 5 I

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.249 
everyone this is the flooville speck 5 I
made<00:00:04.440> it<00:00:04.560> into<00:00:04.830> a<00:00:04.859> saltwater<00:00:05.220> tank<00:00:06.259> currently

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
made it into a saltwater tank currently

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.129 
made it into a saltwater tank currently
I<00:00:07.319> have<00:00:07.379> running<00:00:07.830> is<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.130> orbit<00:00:08.670> marine<00:00:09.300> which

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
I have running is the orbit marine which

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.610 
I have running is the orbit marine which
is<00:00:10.290> made<00:00:10.410> by<00:00:10.440> current<00:00:10.800> USA<00:00:11.450> eighteen<00:00:12.450> inch<00:00:12.719> LED

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
is made by current USA eighteen inch LED

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.799 
is made by current USA eighteen inch LED
I<00:00:13.889> think<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.250> pulls<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.580> about<00:00:14.759> 15<00:00:15.179> watts<00:00:15.450> in

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
I think it pulls it about 15 watts in

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.040 
I think it pulls it about 15 watts in
total<00:00:16.640> this<00:00:17.640> also<00:00:17.970> has<00:00:18.119> two<00:00:18.420> channels<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.869> blue

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
total this also has two channels of blue

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.590 
total this also has two channels of blue
two<00:00:19.650> channels<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.070> white<00:00:20.240> awesome<00:00:21.240> light<00:00:21.390> for

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
two channels of white awesome light for

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.240

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the remote that comes with fever the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.240 
the remote that comes with fever the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
light and that remote gives me the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.639 
light and that remote gives me the
options<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.670> having<00:00:47.789> cloud<00:00:48.690> cover<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.500> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
options of having cloud cover like I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.560 
options of having cloud cover like I
said<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.670> lightning<00:00:50.969> storm<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.300> I'll<00:00:51.390> just

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
said the lightning storm so I'll just

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.209 
said the lightning storm so I'll just
throw<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> cloud<00:00:52.379> cover<00:00:52.590> one<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.070> see

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
throw on a cloud cover one you can see

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.000 
throw on a cloud cover one you can see
the<00:00:53.309> difference<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.000> does<00:00:54.829> so<00:00:55.829> as<00:00:55.920> you

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the difference in what it does so as you

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.639 
the difference in what it does so as you
can<00:00:56.100> see<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.430> gets<00:00:56.550> brighter<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.149> dimmer<00:00:57.649> and

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
can see it gets brighter and dimmer and

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.560 
can see it gets brighter and dimmer and
the<00:00:59.129> changes<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.670> colors<00:01:00.030> goes<00:01:00.270> from<00:01:00.480> a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
the changes in colors goes from a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.299 
the changes in colors goes from a
lighter<00:01:00.780> white<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> blue<00:01:02.000> back<00:01:03.000> again

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
lighter white to a blue back again

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.410 
lighter white to a blue back again
really<00:01:05.309> gives<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.640> neat<00:01:05.760> effect<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
really gives you neat effect for the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.230 
really gives you neat effect for the
