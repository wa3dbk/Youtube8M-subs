 and on the right the coffee for the descents 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.070
 We can coordinate the national destinations letters as seen in our 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.300

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.149
 the letters drag us 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.080
 click on the one we want 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.470
 and if it stays selected clicked then where we have to release it 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.250
 we can click on several letters in order 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.840
 and then move them in front of everyone or behind 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.020
 clicking to the right of all 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.020

 what with the joker and it's not 7 

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:26.679
 and then to the right in two 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.599
 we see also move at the beginning the letters that we have left for the two 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:39.969
 trios 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:41.829
 when a player who touches him 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.509
 steal the deck card 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:47.759
 we can try against by clicking on the well in this case on the rich 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:54.139
 and we can put together the three kings and order the rest of the cards 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:03.400
 in our next turn 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.649
 we could lower more 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:07.779
 to get off 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:09.539
 after stealing letter 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:14.319
 we click on all the cards of the trios and then click on your descents 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.409
 same with the other trio 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:17.999
 we long for avenue 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:21.579
 waiting for the other players to give their approval we have worked 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.579
 hello noble and we have been wrong in nothing 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.069
 once all 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.449
 and before jumping letter 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:34.639
 that moment of releasing the letters we can to the items that have been downloaded 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.239
 in this case like nobody that lowered we follow the game 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.109
 while the game continues 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.229
 some comments on the stairs 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:49.819
 the stairs in the conti can turn around 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.819
 after SMEs 2 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.639
 also on a ladder there can not be two consecutive wild cards 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.159
 the jokers give you a descending ladder 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:02.479
 already in which they are 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.909
 or to other stairs we have a player 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.900
 unless you want a staircase with less than four cards as they are placed 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.859
 two jokers together 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.729
 in other cases you can move on the stairs of the same player 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.370
 yes 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.650
 can move if it has been changed by the letter to which he prostituted 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.669
 or if this one 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.740
 at the ends of the race of at least five cards 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:28.939
 we go back to the game another player is coming down 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.699
 and ask us to validate your descent 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.309
 how is it correct 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:35.909
 we click on life 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:39.060
 as he has a trio of doces and we have a 2 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.060
 in the next turn we will just let go 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.059
 it's our turn 

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:02.559
 we just kart 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:06.059
 we take the 2 we propose in it has 2 6 kilograms 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.349
 when everyone validates we release letter 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.710
 to finish talking about the jokers say that the trios can see all 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.710
 how and what do we want 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:04.080
 we can see the counting of the game menus 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.449
 nor the starting 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.530
 we can activate or deactivate the sound warnings 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.219
 the tick tac on your turn 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:13.370
 the music can show the round tÃºan on the table 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.389
 in the minute help 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:21.839
 We can see 

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:23.229
 which they call current 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:26.580
 the current round who played or how many points we have 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.969
 yes during your shift 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:37.110
 entertain yourself with other things 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.260
 you think that the other players who are waiting for you to draw a card 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:43.969
 the cha team 2 ' 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:45.599
 what luck 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:47.789
 but if you have any questions 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:50.789
 hesitate to ask or at any time 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.849
 we have only one letter left 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:00.289
 if we play a king a 9 8 jun 2 we won 

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:04.939
 no no luck 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.330
 he feels player did not have luck either 

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:23.839
 but it seems what he will do if he had these bands 

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:32.129
 we validate the play 

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:37.639
 and we come back to life 

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:43.240
 they feared game the points are counted and the cards are shown to each player 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.240
 you are left in your hand 

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:50.869
 they are again distributing letters 

00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:54.059
 and start a new round now a try out and a straight 

00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:58.010
 and the game continue and so 

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.139
 up to the end 

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:00.189
 the three stairs
