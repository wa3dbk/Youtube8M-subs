hi<00:00:00.750> there<00:00:00.960> and<00:00:01.110> welcome<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.439> mr.<00:00:01.650> Arnold's

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
hi there and welcome to mr. Arnold's

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.039 
hi there and welcome to mr. Arnold's
Matt's<00:00:02.250> in<00:00:02.550> this<00:00:03.179> video<00:00:03.449> we're<00:00:03.600> gonna<00:00:03.689> look<00:00:03.870> at

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
Matt's in this video we're gonna look at

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.960 
Matt's in this video we're gonna look at
multiplying<00:00:04.740> by<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.009> decimal<00:00:05.609> so<00:00:05.759> we're<00:00:05.850> gonna

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
multiplying by a decimal so we're gonna

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.480 
multiplying by a decimal so we're gonna
take<00:00:06.150> whole<00:00:06.480> numbers<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.350> then<00:00:07.919> multiply

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
take whole numbers and then multiply

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.660 
take whole numbers and then multiply
them<00:00:08.760> by<00:00:08.790> decimal<00:00:09.719> numbers<00:00:10.519> hopefully<00:00:11.519> you've

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
them by decimal numbers hopefully you've

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.499 
them by decimal numbers hopefully you've
looked<00:00:11.820> at<00:00:12.179> my<00:00:12.540> video<00:00:12.929> on<00:00:13.429> the<00:00:14.429> grid<00:00:14.759> method<00:00:15.150> of

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
looked at my video on the grid method of

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.529 
looked at my video on the grid method of
long<00:00:15.900> multiplication<00:00:16.800> because<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:18.029> method

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
long multiplication because this method

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.050 
long multiplication because this method
is<00:00:18.960> very<00:00:19.710> very<00:00:20.430> similar<00:00:21.080> so<00:00:22.080> I'm<00:00:22.380> gonna<00:00:22.500> start

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
is very very similar so I'm gonna start

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.390 
is very very similar so I'm gonna start
like<00:00:24.060> before<00:00:24.449> with<00:00:25.140> my<00:00:25.320> grid<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.890> I'm<00:00:26.250> gonna

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
like before with my grid and I'm gonna

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.970 
like before with my grid and I'm gonna
put<00:00:26.730> my<00:00:26.760> multiplication<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.930> nope<00:00:28.140> here<00:00:28.380> I'm

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
put my multiplication so I nope here I'm

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.370 
put my multiplication so I nope here I'm
gonna<00:00:29.130> take<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.550> 68<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.539> break<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.080> down

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
gonna take the 68 and break that down

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.110 
gonna take the 68 and break that down
into<00:00:31.769> sixty<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.200> eight<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.809> 0.6<00:00:36.809> well

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
into sixty and eight and the 0.6 well

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.040 
into sixty and eight and the 0.6 well
multiplying<00:00:39.120> by<00:00:39.239> decimals<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.809> quite

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
multiplying by decimals is quite

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.319 
multiplying by decimals is quite
difficult<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.800> I'm<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.520> gonna<00:00:41.670> multiply<00:00:41.969> it

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
difficult so I'm just gonna multiply it

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.760 
difficult so I'm just gonna multiply it
by<00:00:42.510> six<00:00:42.930> first<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.190> hopefully<00:00:45.180> you'll<00:00:45.390> see

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
by six first and hopefully you'll see

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.560 
by six first and hopefully you'll see
how<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:47.100> works<00:00:47.399> out<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:47.760> us<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> end

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
how this works out for us in the end

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.540 
how this works out for us in the end
so<00:00:49.020> I'm<00:00:49.110> going<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:49.379> six<00:00:49.710> times<00:00:49.980> six<00:00:50.250> gives

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
so I'm going to do six times six gives

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.279 
so I'm going to do six times six gives
me<00:00:50.940> 36<00:00:51.620> we<00:00:52.620> got<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.949> extra<00:00:53.219> zero<00:00:53.550> there<00:00:54.140> we<00:00:55.140> do

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
me 36 we got that extra zero there we do

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.959 
me 36 we got that extra zero there we do
6<00:00:55.649> times<00:00:55.860> 8<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.309> 48<00:00:56.809> and<00:00:58.219> like<00:00:59.219> before<00:00:59.579> we're

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
6 times 8 is 48 and like before we're

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.520 
6 times 8 is 48 and like before we're
gonna<00:01:00.090> add<00:01:00.300> these<00:01:00.629> numbers<00:01:00.870> together<00:01:01.199> so

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
gonna add these numbers together so

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.620 
gonna add these numbers together so
we're<00:01:01.620> gonna<00:01:01.710> do<00:01:01.890> 360<00:01:02.850> I'm<00:01:03.840> gonna<00:01:04.080> add<00:01:04.850> 48<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
we're gonna do 360 I'm gonna add 48 to

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.880 
we're gonna do 360 I'm gonna add 48 to
it<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.439> 360<00:01:08.430> plus<00:01:08.939> 48<00:01:09.420> 0<00:01:09.780> +<00:01:10.530> 8<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.770> 8<00:01:11.510> 6<00:01:12.510> +<00:01:12.720> 4<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.409> 10

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
it so 360 plus 48 0 + 8 is 8 6 + 4 is 10

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.719 
it so 360 plus 48 0 + 8 is 8 6 + 4 is 10
so<00:01:14.400> put<00:01:14.610> down<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.030> zero<00:01:15.299> carry<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:16.020> 1<00:01:16.350> 1<00:01:17.159> +<00:01:17.400> 3

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
so put down the zero carry the 1 1 + 3

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.550 
so put down the zero carry the 1 1 + 3
is<00:01:18.000> 4<00:01:18.479> now<00:01:19.380> we're<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:19.950> quite<00:01:20.009> done<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.939> yet

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
is 4 now we're not quite done just yet

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.330 
is 4 now we're not quite done just yet
now<00:01:22.560> we're<00:01:22.710> going<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.860> return<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.189> our

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
now we're going to return to our

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.230 
now we're going to return to our
question<00:01:24.229> we<00:01:25.229> count<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.100> number<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.549> decimal

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
question we count the number of decimal

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.929 
question we count the number of decimal
places<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.780> were<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.290> my<00:01:28.320> question<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.340> this

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
places that were in my question in this

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.480 
places that were in my question in this
question<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:30.750> had<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.470> decimal<00:01:31.920> place<00:01:32.159> I'm

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
question we had one decimal place I'm

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.649 
question we had one decimal place I'm
gonna<00:01:32.610> highlight<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.299> here

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
gonna highlight it here

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.069 
gonna highlight it here
we<00:01:34.320> had<00:01:34.530> one<00:01:35.009> decimal<00:01:35.759> place<00:01:36.000> which<00:01:36.810> means

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
we had one decimal place which means

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.550 
we had one decimal place which means
that<00:01:37.259> my<00:01:37.409> answer<00:01:37.950> must<00:01:38.549> have<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.750> decimal

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
that my answer must have one decimal

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.980 
that my answer must have one decimal
place<00:01:40.799> also<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.939> we<00:01:42.090> always<00:01:42.390> count<00:01:42.630> from

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
place also and we always count from

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.039 
place also and we always count from
right<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.710> left<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.970> counting<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.659> this

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
right to left so counting in this

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.200 
right to left so counting in this
direction<00:01:46.290> here<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.610> direction<00:01:47.820> here

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
direction here in this direction here

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.020 
direction here in this direction here
count<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> number<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.110> decimal<00:01:49.470> places<00:01:50.030> one

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
count the number of decimal places one

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.429 
count the number of decimal places one
so<00:01:51.869> I'm<00:01:51.990> gonna<00:01:52.079> put<00:01:52.290> my<00:01:52.409> decimal<00:01:52.710> point<00:01:53.220> there

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
so I'm gonna put my decimal point there

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.090 
so I'm gonna put my decimal point there
360<00:01:55.439> or<00:01:55.649> sorry

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100

360 or sorry
68<00:01:56.880> multiplied<00:01:57.570> by<00:01:57.750> 0.6<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.649> 40<00:01:59.640> point<00:02:00.060> 8<00:02:00.210> and

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
68 multiplied by 0.6 is 40 point 8 and

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.380 
68 multiplied by 0.6 is 40 point 8 and
check<00:02:00.899> out<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.140> calculator<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.829> like<00:02:02.390> okay

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
check out a calculator if you like okay

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.499 
check out a calculator if you like okay
let's<00:02:03.840> look<00:02:03.960> at<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.110> again<00:02:04.290> example<00:02:05.009> 2<00:02:05.509> we've

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
let's look at it again example 2 we've

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.790 
let's look at it again example 2 we've
got<00:02:06.719> 27<00:02:07.170> multiplied<00:02:07.890> by<00:02:08.099> 0.5<00:02:08.970> 8<00:02:09.500> once<00:02:10.500> again

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
got 27 multiplied by 0.5 8 once again

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.020 
got 27 multiplied by 0.5 8 once again
we're<00:02:10.979> going<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.220> set<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.430> out<00:02:11.610> using<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.180> grid

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
we're going to set it out using a grid

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.230 
we're going to set it out using a grid
very<00:02:13.630> very<00:02:13.990> similar<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.710> long<00:02:14.860> multiplication

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
very very similar to long multiplication

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
very very similar to long multiplication
so<00:02:16.240> I'm<00:02:16.480> gonna<00:02:16.600> split<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.930> 27<00:02:17.590> into<00:02:17.980> 20<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.260> 7

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
so I'm gonna split the 27 into 20 and 7

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.030 
so I'm gonna split the 27 into 20 and 7
and<00:02:20.410> split<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.870> 0.58<00:02:22.870> well<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.530> don't<00:02:23.860> like

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
and split the 0.58 well I don't like

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.850 
and split the 0.58 well I don't like
multiplying<00:02:24.580> by<00:02:24.840> 0.58<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.260> it's<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.470> lot<00:02:26.650> easier

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
multiplying by 0.58 so it's a lot easier

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.010 
multiplying by 0.58 so it's a lot easier
to<00:02:27.130> multiply<00:02:27.460> by<00:02:27.850> fifty<00:02:28.240> eight<00:02:28.390> first<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:28.930> I'm

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
to multiply by fifty eight first so I'm

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.340 
to multiply by fifty eight first so I'm
going<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.200> split<00:02:29.350> that<00:02:29.590> into<00:02:29.770> 50<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.640> eight<00:02:31.510> so

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
going to split that into 50 and eight so

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.590 
going to split that into 50 and eight so
let's<00:02:32.710> do<00:02:32.860> our<00:02:32.890> multiplication<00:02:33.160> now<00:02:33.820> so<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.480> do

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
let's do our multiplication now so I do

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.430 
let's do our multiplication now so I do
five<00:02:35.440> times<00:02:35.770> two<00:02:36.070> is<00:02:36.100> ten<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:38.050> then<00:02:38.200> we<00:02:38.290> got

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
five times two is ten and then we got

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.850 
five times two is ten and then we got
two<00:02:38.650> zeros<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:39.640> add<00:02:39.850> those<00:02:40.090> on<00:02:40.380> again<00:02:41.380> that's

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
two zeros so add those on again that's

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.920 
two zeros so add those on again that's
explain<00:02:42.340> why<00:02:42.640> I'm<00:02:42.760> adding<00:02:42.910> those<00:02:43.150> zeros<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.720> is

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
explain why I'm adding those zeros on is

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.630 
explain why I'm adding those zeros on is
explained<00:02:44.440> in<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.860> video<00:02:45.100> on<00:02:45.340> long

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
explained in the video on long

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.080 
explained in the video on long
multiplication<00:02:47.280> five<00:02:48.280> times<00:02:48.640> seven<00:02:48.850> is

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
multiplication five times seven is

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.800 
multiplication five times seven is
thirty-five<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:50.530> all<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:51.550> other<00:02:51.700> zero<00:02:52.030> and

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
thirty-five and all that other zero and

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.900 
thirty-five and all that other zero and
then<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.290> eight<00:02:53.800> times<00:02:54.520> two<00:02:54.940> is<00:02:55.120> sixteen

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
then you eight times two is sixteen

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.310 
then you eight times two is sixteen
adding<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.090> order<00:02:58.390> zero<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.930> account<00:02:59.260> for

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
adding that order zero to account for

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.670 
adding that order zero to account for
the<00:02:59.530> 20<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.130> then<00:03:00.940> 8<00:03:01.420> times<00:03:01.750> 7<00:03:02.350> is<00:03:02.620> 56<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:04.680> take

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
the 20 and then 8 times 7 is 56 so take

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.250 
the 20 and then 8 times 7 is 56 so take
all<00:03:05.920> four<00:03:06.400> numbers<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:06.970> green<00:03:07.240> and<00:03:07.450> add<00:03:08.020> them

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
all four numbers in green and add them

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.370 
all four numbers in green and add them
all<00:03:08.380> up<00:03:08.410> so<00:03:08.800> we're<00:03:09.280> gonna<00:03:09.400> do<00:03:09.550> 1,000<00:03:10.300> I'm<00:03:11.020> gonna

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
all up so we're gonna do 1,000 I'm gonna

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.070 
all up so we're gonna do 1,000 I'm gonna
add<00:03:12.090> 350<00:03:13.140> I'm<00:03:14.140> gonna<00:03:14.410> add<00:03:15.180> 160<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.840> I'm<00:03:16.959> gonna

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
add 350 I'm gonna add 160 and I'm gonna

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.610 
add 350 I'm gonna add 160 and I'm gonna
add<00:03:17.850> 56<00:03:19.890> so<00:03:20.890> adding<00:03:21.370> these<00:03:21.489> numbers<00:03:21.970> 0<00:03:22.570> 0<00:03:22.989> 0<00:03:23.410> and

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
add 56 so adding these numbers 0 0 0 and

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.360 
add 56 so adding these numbers 0 0 0 and
6<00:03:23.860> gives<00:03:24.250> us<00:03:24.430> 6<00:03:25.170> 0<00:03:26.170> &amp;<00:03:26.350> 5<00:03:26.530> is<00:03:26.739> 5<00:03:26.950> 5<00:03:27.820> &amp;<00:03:28.150> 6<00:03:28.510> is<00:03:28.750> 11<00:03:29.040> 11<00:03:30.040> +

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
6 gives us 6 0 &amp; 5 is 5 5 &amp; 6 is 11 11 +

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.520 
6 gives us 6 0 &amp; 5 is 5 5 &amp; 6 is 11 11 +
5<00:03:30.610> is<00:03:30.910> 16<00:03:31.690> so<00:03:32.410> put<00:03:32.590> down<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.980> 6<00:03:33.300> carry<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.510> 1<00:03:34.720> 1

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
5 is 16 so put down the 6 carry the 1 1

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.180 
5 is 16 so put down the 6 carry the 1 1
+<00:03:35.769> 0<00:03:35.800> is<00:03:36.400> 1<00:03:36.700> +<00:03:37.260> 3<00:03:38.260> gives<00:03:39.130> me<00:03:39.220> 4<00:03:39.610> +<00:03:40.330> 1<00:03:40.540> gives<00:03:41.170> me<00:03:41.620> 5

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
+ 0 is 1 + 3 gives me 4 + 1 gives me 5

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.940 
+ 0 is 1 + 3 gives me 4 + 1 gives me 5
so<00:03:42.760> put<00:03:42.940> down<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.239> 5<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:43.780> then<00:03:44.410> we<00:03:44.680> still<00:03:44.920> have

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
so put down the 5 and then we still have

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.259 
so put down the 5 and then we still have
that<00:03:45.310> warm<00:03:45.610> they're<00:03:45.850> almost<00:03:46.570> on<00:03:46.930> now<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:48.459> again

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
that warm they're almost on now so again

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.210 
that warm they're almost on now so again
count<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.810> number<00:03:50.019> of<00:03:50.050> decimal<00:03:50.680> places<00:03:50.920> that

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
count the number of decimal places that

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.030 
count the number of decimal places that
were<00:03:51.370> in<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.580> question<00:03:52.090> in<00:03:52.390> this<00:03:53.260> case<00:03:53.530> we<00:03:53.800> had

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
were in the question in this case we had

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.790 
were in the question in this case we had
two<00:03:54.459> decimal<00:03:54.940> places<00:03:55.060> 2<00:03:55.450> 5<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.019> 8<00:03:56.050> 2

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
two decimal places 2 5 and the 8 2

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.120 
two decimal places 2 5 and the 8 2
decimal<00:03:57.190> places<00:03:57.220> on<00:03:57.940> 2<00:03:58.209> so<00:03:58.870> my<00:03:59.110> answer<00:03:59.680> most

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
decimal places on 2 so my answer most

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.820 
decimal places on 2 so my answer most
have<00:04:00.489> 2<00:04:00.790> decimal<00:04:01.239> places<00:04:01.269> and<00:04:01.870> again<00:04:02.410> counting

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
have 2 decimal places and again counting

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.860 
have 2 decimal places and again counting
from<00:04:03.040> right<00:04:03.130> to<00:04:03.790> left<00:04:03.989> one<00:04:04.989> -<00:04:06.209> boom<00:04:07.239> that's

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
from right to left one - boom that's

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.050 
from right to left one - boom that's
where<00:04:08.110> we<00:04:08.200> put<00:04:08.380> our<00:04:08.440> decimal<00:04:08.890> place<00:04:08.920> so<00:04:09.310> 27

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
where we put our decimal place so 27

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.030 
where we put our decimal place so 27
multiplied<00:04:10.750> by<00:04:10.930> 0.5<00:04:11.500> 8<00:04:11.830> is<00:04:12.010> 15<00:04:12.790> point<00:04:13.120> six<00:04:13.390> six

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
multiplied by 0.5 8 is 15 point six six

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.789 
multiplied by 0.5 8 is 15 point six six
