00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:04.280
 Good day dear friends 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.620
 I welcome you to my channel way 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.259
 channel with you Rodion Kvasnikov and in this 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.789
 I will tell the video how to collect 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:13.219
 puzzle called pyramid 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:15.559
 Rubik's Cube Pyramid pretty 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.770
 easy puzzle going much 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.220
 lighter than rubik's cube 2 by 2 and much 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.400
 faster 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.960
 before starting assembly clarifies 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.740
 This puzzle would like to 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.080
 tell more about language form and 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.880
 so if you want to turn right 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.720
 side you take here such 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:40.160
 the triangle is this one corner here if you 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:44.390
 want to turn right on yourself r pro here 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.050
 yourself r-prime left of el left on 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.460
 myself 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:53.600
 r-bar is the same combination on top 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:56.210
 because of the ladies so well, well, that's the language 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.880
 now starting to clarify the build for 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.880
 just start to sort it out 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.290
 that's how she is you 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.479
 approximately disassembled 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.939
 forms and does not change as in a barrel of a rubik 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.479
 but only colors to begin with we must 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.890
 collect cross puzzle data that is 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:20.140
 what does he look like 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:23.460
 as follows: 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.940
 central so to speak all triangles 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.360
 something like a radiation sign if 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.750
 take a closer look 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.280
 but oh well, that's about the shape you 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.580
 they should at least something like this 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.130
 the figure must be assembled how to assemble it 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.050
 you have it more precisely you have disassembled 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.350
 your pyramid state 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.200
 also gather here this cross as it is 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.420
 put together to start you find all these 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.500
 central 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:59.530
 triangles which is next to 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:02:00.190
 angle so times 2 and 3 hence we 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.470
 we clamp 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.500
 dolls next to which she is not 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.509
 and look here they dock here 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.280
 this side 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.220
 form this country will be much 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.080
 easy to assemble a cross 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.970
 that is, we just logically reason 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.030
 here should put each of 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.280
 triangle here we put one already have 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.709
 that's what we have to flip over here we are 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.340
 the cross is collected further we unfold 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.510
 here are these corner elements to 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.450
 dock 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:37.180
 fill the yellow side 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.010
 corner elements of every color 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.060
 of color 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.090
 An example of this look, it has a color 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.709
 yellow blue 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.550
 hence we are looking for the blue face 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.819
 she blue wright as blue center so 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.769
 hence it is in the bottom 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:00.550
 planes for this we put it top 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:05.040
 we lower left that is, he should 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:08.170
 be here we omit the customize and 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.040
 we return well the same situation is 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:15.579
 Rubik's cubes 3 by 3 so here it is red 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.180
 color is yellow red it should be 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.459
 here 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.280
 let him down is the top layer 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:25.569
 then we lower it down push 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.209
 the top layer is customized return it here 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.239
 we form color investigators on 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.150
 the last color we have is green it 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.609
 there is a ved not a plane dropping down 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:41.439
 let down the upper plane 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:44.769
 customize and return here we have this 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:50.439
 the first layer formed we customize each 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:51.430
 from the flowers on the faces the next stage 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:56.730
 assembly 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:59.319
 This assembly of the latter is obtained 2 layers 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.799
 drag the intermediate layer here 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:06.760
 there are five different situations 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:09.400
 which I will now tell the most 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.969
 first build situation 2 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.209
 central layer so to speak the most 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:18.430
 simple when we have two triangles 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.100
 is out of place that is we 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.419
 they should just simply flip you 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.960
 is not in place just 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.620
 should turn the following formula 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.110
 so that these two 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:36.070
 the triangles looked at us right for 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:43.660
 itself left over right from under her left 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:50.100
 itself up to the left from the left-up itself 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:53.080
 right left 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.150
 next situation when we already have three 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.660
 the triangle is not on its own 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.540
 places 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.300
 each of these triangles that is 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.790
 pair forms have the same color 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.300
 here are two red 2 2 green and two 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.210
 blue 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.199
 we should simply simply deploy them 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.310
 to dock 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:14.350
 this part is well, so we see the center , we do not 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.740
 docked ie we need them 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.920
 deploy we look clockwise 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.780
 that kind of formula for clockwise reversal 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:28.180
 arrow 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:28.940
 right yourself up right to the right of 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.500
 myself 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:38.390
 up right to right up right 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:40.880
 right away the following situation 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.100
 identical except that we 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.130
 should expand these triangles already 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.800
 counterclockwise and so the formula for 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:53.990
 turn counterclockwise to the right 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:57.920
 from yourself up left to right up yourself 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:00.130
 left right of yourself up left of right 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:04.370
 to myself 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:07.280
 next 4 situation when we have again 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.510
 same three triangles are not on 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:14.080
 their places but each but two of them 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:16.730
 more or less form a layer so to speak 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.330
 take for example this triangle he 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:22.460
 has two colors red blue 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.590
 on the side where it is blue 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.790
 he forming such a strip hence 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.120
 we do not touch him 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:32.180
 here this triangle is blue 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.550
 green green it forms 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.980
 we do not touch his strip therefore 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:40.280
 we will touch this particular triangle 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:42.800
 which is green red and he 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.440
 does not form a pair that is, we will have it 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.800
 the main for this we have it 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.750
 so that was in the back look here 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.390
 he is a triangle he is different from everyone 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.380
 the remaining triangles in color that is 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.960
 all the rest throughout 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:06.050
 green and he is one red formula such 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:09.830
 left to yourself right to left from yourself 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:15.500
 right underneath up left to right of 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:19.940
 yourself right up right to yourself well and 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:21.710
 The last situation is similar when we have 

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.630
 given triangle which is different 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.600
 all other color is already in 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.580
 on the right side, that is, we look at this one 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.310
 the triangle he doesn't have 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.259
 colors that with 100 koalas would be one of 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.050
 layers therefore we have it 

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:38.360
 look back triangle is 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.439
 right formulas is the same only 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.139
 mirror image 

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:47.060
 and the opposite action so to speak 

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:53.319
 right over left over right by yourself 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:58.780
 left by itself up right by itself to the left 

00:07:53.319 --> 00:08:02.509
 up left left the well, that I 

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:06.080
 considered all cases that may be 

00:08:02.509 --> 00:08:08.690
 when building the Rubik's Pyramid, I hope 

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.909
 explained to you in more detail how her 

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.919
 collect subscribe to my channel 

00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:15.370
 put likes write comments to everyone 

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:15.370
 of good
