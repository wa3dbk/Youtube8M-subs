00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 so after a little warmup stands for 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.560
 me for the 55 on the program 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.380
 military press training weight like 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.980
 always, this shoulder back with 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.480
 the barbell before in the body at 5 x 5 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.580
 mode 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.330
 just at the time of the 55 right first time 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.050
 engage 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.160
 I blame the poor wrists 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:50.250
 of course already warmed up 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:52.379
 very important so I have to pump from 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.660
 say such a dish of potatoes 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.160
 Dinner on the eve one has all 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.960
 other point you have completely different 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.870
 feeling for the muscle now feels 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.010
 that's just subjective to me 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.760
 maybe a bit soft in the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.010
 musculature 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.240
 I do not have a proper internship pump 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.740
 it is not as the feeling that the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.770
 that the muscle is really the right one 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.689
 skin like a teacher spans that 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.640
 That's what I like about the point 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.220
 love what motivates me a pump too 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.610
 it now remains, of course, but from 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.619
 otherwise the performance of her five 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.270
 repetitions of psychological disadvantage 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.729
 objectively, it was the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.890
 Same performance as you feel 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.040
 today for my subjective feeling 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.720
 not so great habs already 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.460
 Just when you know what you say 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.020
 You can not forget that either 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.030
 100% porr ag more 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.130
 that's the same when you're in the class 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.540
 is going or a class work and you 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.090
 know you did not learn properly 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.909
 He never gets really good 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.740
 if you just write the notes 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.780
 Preparation did not do it right 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.020
 There you always go with psychological 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.159
 disadvantage pure and has less and less 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.210
 maybe even self-confidence 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.010
 maybe it is 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.990
 self-confidence which courage 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.940
 maybe it's self-confidence 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.830
 somehow I miss that a bit 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.900
 the point okay, that's not there 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.630
 where is the buddy from weisslingen 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.400
 rolls of sugar I miss so the 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.160
 Potatoes around a serving of potatoes 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.420
 I miss him rich but still me 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.950
 wants to not turn simply now 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.000
 the performance is the same i have that 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.770
 same weight on it I have the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.819
 same number of repetitions and me 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.739
 Be right now with the last sentence 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.880
 make the fifth set and there 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.930
 I will also confident I will 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.370
 to bring the same performance 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.630
 if that at some point on the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.250
 physical level really 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.900
 really affects your performance 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.390
 I can not say that but for the first time 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.830
 it so the two of her head if you 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.820
 The whole pack fast food is then 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.680
 you also have to change your metabolism 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.080
 That's why I want to encourage you here 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.370
 nice walk and very important to 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.410
 also the digestion the whole 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.730
 metabolism to stimulate again easily 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.769
 to reactivate 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.420
 I mean I remember a part of the 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.459
 to put on maybe one is 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.100
 Placebo effect that if you exactly 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.840
 know that what you have eaten though 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.550
 from the macro nutrients but just 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.080
 not right from micronutrients 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.750
 of course you have this mentally too 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.519
 this barrier in it makes you easy 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.750
 I'm okay 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.220
 Maybe I miss what the body 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.049
 comes for him certain period of time with it 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.459
 clearly I will not be the mega now 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.959
 bill for do not get the mega 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.630
 pack for the must have 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.709
 most extreme power losses to Qatar 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.070
 to eat fast food 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.290
 but it is so that you have certain 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.079
 doubt has and of course also balance 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.209
 mentally this barrier the placebo 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.860
 effect if you like that one 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.540
 I know I have everything in it 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.400
 can not get everything out too 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.500
 I wash myself two times at the moment 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.150
 just that day with clear water just that 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.680
 Just face this light 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.660
 fat film from my skin down 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.100
 i am not mister clearasil me now 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.840
 I now not superhot today 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.310
 never had but i can give you one 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.239
 show my back and you can do it 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.239
 judge for yourself 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:54.189
 a bit you can see what I want 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.189
 already say 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.610
 every now and then it can be me 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.470
 have a bit in the 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.409
 sun set but of course so clear 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.670
 a little something there it can happen 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:09.140
 that one title or another 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.359
 so i'm getting a bit 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.280
 but dream of healthy nutrition 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.650
 I dream that sounds weird 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.900
 sometimes massola diet or so in so 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.579
 one-sided things so at low carb that 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.470
 you start from his fat plate 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.510
 Sometimes you have to dream noodles in 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.430
 a low fat de that one of such a 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.479
 real big plate day victory 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.220
 dreamed or something 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.380
 I am currently so it sounds 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.600
 really bizarre that I just like that 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.840
 dream a beautiful colorful salad plate 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.150
 with tuna and so on and olives 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.340
 simply quite fresh homemade one 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.260
 delicious fresh dressing after art 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.370
 of a muscle maker that there was 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.530
 before not dreaming a bit 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.960
 but by the fact that she is not yet with 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.250
 Of course, little is what I'm doing 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.199
 just there is only a little rice 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.910
 and butter vegetables for you 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.520
 grandparents always have the feast on 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.169
 but now someone cooks it 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.970
 I do not have to do it myself anymore 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.830
 Of course it suits me very well 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.430
 so we are on the way again what 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:08.050
 to eat what is there today full 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:13.750
 power ahead we go into the meeting 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:21.610
 so now what beautiful faces small 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:23.419
 reindeer what loriots or duisburger 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:31.539
 can now judge it very hard 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:31.539
 crashed from the calories taken 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:38.020
 sounds relatively unappetizing one 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.070
 I have such a bad conscience as 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.170
 now all these things again 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.970
 I bought my money for that 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.770
 I spent what I have 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.840
 company support over my 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.400
 I could experiment all the time only 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.650
 I do not want to know drinking 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.490
 I suppose salt to me is always 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.140
 a bit difficult my 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.670
 micronutrients you can wear 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.140
 can see exactly how many proteins 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.370
 how much carbohydrates 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.500
 you can also get the fiber 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.480
 a bit stretch but the seats are there 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.070
 hiding awful lot there must 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.570
 just a start at the fries so 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.980
 to turn over a lot of salt 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.330
 I have the last days now 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.000
 always had that after me 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.930
 income I had such a fire 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.710
 Also do not know what's up 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:16.780
 flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.610
 yeast extracts, etc. is included as is 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.400
 of course, any amount possible and if 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:24.330
 then you started to get it 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.330
 of course already signs for it
