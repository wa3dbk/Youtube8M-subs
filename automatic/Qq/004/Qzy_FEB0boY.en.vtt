 Quantic dream fans can be happy 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.380

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.270
 player of the upcoming adventure souls 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.169
 with about ten hours of clenched story 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.329
 can count 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.250
 Quantic Dreams Gameplay Lead Designer 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.320
 coraline marshall, on the other hand, asserted 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.840
 some weeks already that the title one 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.500
 Playing time between 12 and 15 hours 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.480
 would offer 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.690
 depending on the decisions that the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.039
 player during the course of the game 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.219
 also confirmed cage that you 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:45.170

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.159
 percent the end of a video game yet 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.019
 the rousing story of heavy rain 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.819
 should have helped the players 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.370
 to bind to the screen 

00:00:55.819 --> 00:01:00.499
 Let's hope that beyond soul is 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.059
 heavy rain will be in no doubt at all 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:05.739

 also slowly the different special 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.960
 editions by the one would be there the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.300
 special edition which the break for 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.430
 mission pack contains that is nothing 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.130
 other than an ingame dlc with one 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.080
 bonus mission is on this mission 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.970

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.830
 Identities of these persons 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.330
 find out and then the 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.520
 reveal the public 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.320

 slide pictures to the collector's edition

 Unfortunately, hot stocks are not yet available 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.250
 in front 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.920
 however, we already know exactly what 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.100
 it will put silver gold and platinum in it 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.470

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.360
 reality cards ubisoft becomes typical 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.129
 So play with extras again 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.739
 complained that any help too late 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.700
 comes if the extras in the end 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.680
 be worthwhile 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.450
 We can finally do that 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.340
 convince yourself if word stocks 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.200
 finally in autumn this year in the 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.200
 shelves of the game dealers is coming 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.430
 Video games make stupid and demented 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.440
 Such statements will be made in the future 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.480
 have to think twice for one 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.190
 study recently at the unfortunately in the 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.500
 university could be carried out 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.350
 show that first person shooter 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.100
 actually positive for ours 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.680
 working memory 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.569
 this was a group of experienced 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.700
 Fps players with a group of people 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.100
 compared little or no 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.930
 experience with video games had both 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.580
 Groups were written consecutively 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.800
 presented and the people had to 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.709
 Decide if the displayed letter 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.880
 the same as the penultimate one was 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.040
 Surprisingly, it turned out 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.010
 that the video players on average 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.569
 better sections and task-related 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.180
 could process information better 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.010
 We would not have done the gambling 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.569
 have to prove it before now 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.970
 we only prove that video games 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.970
 not responsible for abuse 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.120
 the three are approaching the euphoria is rising 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.740
 and already there are the first damper for 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.599
 for example, half-life fans must 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.819
 probably still on half-life 3 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.800
 wait because developer world becomes at the 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.599
 e3 does not participate at all 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.580
 wave is not the only one 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.980
 Developer of these events 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.530
 this year uk games stayed away 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.300
 also from publisher take two 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.030
 Although locally, this is only in the 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.290
 small style and also nintendo fans 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.560
 be on the e3 this year 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.180
 be reasonably disappointed 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.190
 Nintendo will not be this year 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.349
 to hold their own press conference but 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.480
 the presentation of the new products the 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.090
 to the respective developers 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.400
 Well let's hope that the e3 this 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.420
 year despite these cancellations still a lot 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.150
 to have to offer 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.470
 we are curious 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.510
 that was it again with the 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.609
 news for today there are more news 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.140
 tomorrow from game inside from the studio 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.010
 and I wish you one more 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.010
 pleasant evening
