the<00:04:19.820> easiest<00:04:20.120> braid<00:04:20.510> it<00:04:20.660> took<00:04:20.840> me<00:04:20.959> a<00:04:20.989> while<00:04:21.170> as

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
the easiest braid it took me a while as

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.410

a bit but I do think that it's very
pretty<00:04:27.710> and<00:04:27.920> it<00:04:28.010> looks<00:04:28.250> very<00:04:28.400> special<00:04:28.940> not
