00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
out of that and I'm going to see if I

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.420 
out of that and I'm going to see if I
can<00:00:34.680> make<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.489> portal<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.710> we<00:00:37.710> get<00:00:37.829> out<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.040> Cree

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
can make a portal and we get out of Cree

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.470 
can make a portal and we get out of Cree
action<00:00:38.730> i'm<00:00:38.790> going<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.000> stay<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.120> creative

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
action i'm going to stay in creative

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.030 
action i'm going to stay in creative
mode<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.690> i<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.870> build<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.200> because<00:00:40.890> I'm

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
mode so i can build this because I'm

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.459 
mode so i can build this because I'm
never<00:00:41.340> good<00:00:41.610> at<00:00:41.700> building<00:00:42.050> nether<00:00:43.050> portals

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
never good at building nether portals

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.290 
never good at building nether portals
and<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.100> pretty<00:00:44.610> much<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> same<00:00:45.000> thing

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
and this is pretty much the same thing

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.750 
and this is pretty much the same thing
so<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.320> think<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.829> goes<00:00:46.950> something<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.430> that

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
so I think it goes something like that

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.020 
so I think it goes something like that
I'm<00:00:47.969> not<00:00:48.360> really<00:00:48.570> sure<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:50.010> yeah<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.910> think

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
I'm not really sure and yeah I think

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.510 
I'm not really sure and yeah I think
that<00:00:51.270> looks<00:00:51.360> right<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.440> let's<00:00:52.710> go<00:00:52.860> use<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> flint

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
that looks right so let's go use a flint

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.459 
that looks right so let's go use a flint
and<00:00:53.550> steel<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.059> you're<00:00:54.270> gonna<00:00:54.360> light<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.570> so

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
and steel and you're gonna light it so

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.029 
and steel and you're gonna light it so
you'll<00:00:55.739> get<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.250> cool<00:00:57.140> pig<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.559> don't<00:00:58.980> know

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
you'll get this cool pig I don't know

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.610 
you'll get this cool pig I don't know

wait for it to download the terrain and
here<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.400> go<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.600> here<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.049> see<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.439> are<00:01:10.470> in

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
here we go so here we can see we are in

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.120

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
the pork dimension and it has pig dirt

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.700 
the pork dimension and it has pig dirt
and<00:01:14.460> pig<00:01:14.760> grass<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.509> all<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.780> pig<00:01:16.170> stuff<00:01:16.500> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and pig grass and all that pig stuff and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.410 
and pig grass and all that pig stuff and
this<00:01:16.770> pigs<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.250> course<00:01:17.549> how<00:01:18.119> could<00:01:18.270> there<00:01:18.390> not

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
this pigs of course how could there not

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.429 
this pigs of course how could there not
be<00:01:18.540> pigs<00:01:18.979> so<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.369> found<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.689> pig<00:01:21.930> dirt<00:01:22.229> is

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
be pigs so I found that the pig dirt is

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.190 
be pigs so I found that the pig dirt is
actually<00:01:22.890> harder<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.340> get<00:01:23.909> then<00:01:24.299> regular<00:01:24.990> dirt

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
actually harder to get then regular dirt

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.109 
actually harder to get then regular dirt
which<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.920> kind<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.189> weird<00:01:26.340> but<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.970> really

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
which is kind of weird but it really

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.520 
which is kind of weird but it really
doesn't<00:01:27.330> serve<00:01:27.570> any<00:01:27.600> purpose<00:01:27.810> other<00:01:28.259> than<00:01:28.409> to

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
doesn't serve any purpose other than to

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.870 
doesn't serve any purpose other than to
be<00:01:28.710> dirt<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.159> could<00:01:29.280> build<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.549> house<00:01:29.700> with

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
be dirt and you could build a house with

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
be dirt and you could build a house with
it<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.090> your<00:01:30.210> brother<00:01:30.439> normal<00:01:31.439> world<00:01:31.619> not

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
it in your brother normal world not

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.640 
it in your brother normal world not
regular<00:01:32.640> world<00:01:32.790> normal<00:01:33.180> world<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.659> yeah<00:01:34.409> so

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
regular world normal world and yeah so
