00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.279
 hello everyone guys have climbed 90 ed 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.830
 here I am with this new video a 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.130
 core guys made on the map a 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.360
 magma as you can see with m 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.150
 Autumn 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.699
 let's say on the new map to say 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.930
 because by now it has come out more successful from 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:42.690
 more than a month on 9 month pink pro almost 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.129
 on xbox while i do n't know if i am on ps3 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.620
 Exit 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.460
 ok though guys after about one 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.820
 week return with video with a 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.420
 Video of curious bonfires I brought you yesterday 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.830
 unboxing the monitor and now let's say 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.379
 that I did for myself in the 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.059
 workstation with computer monitor 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.930
 playstation xbox 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.530
 in a nutshell I know everything then now 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.330
 we can can I make more videos more 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.840
 easily for the first I had to stay 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.289
 because before I had playstation 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.609
 xbox us near the computer and then 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.200
 I had to take it 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:23.880
 I have to put a key I saw I had to 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.560
 putting them in euros was a bit of a mess 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:32.270
 soft while now it is really very much 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.439
 so it's easy to make videos 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.790
 they will be more frequent 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.600
 now the words 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:44.330
 the greater at least one video if they can i 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.580
 two days so even better 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.030
 anyway, guys, let's start a little 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.520
 mention the gameplay as I have 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.510
 said under pato with the m autumn and vi 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.680
 I show the class as always 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.680
 sincerely m autumn 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.020
 I used it against accessories for 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.940
 two reasons why the first one that 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.320
 obviously doing a nuclear set like 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.090
 make a nuclear with that weapon 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.580
 obviously you have to put more accessories 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.220
 possible with that weapon and this me 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.650
 seems obvious and better accessories 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.660
 surely they are quick draw 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.400
 adjustable stock because there is both 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.020
 for example quick extraction because 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.310
 obviously they don't have assault rifles 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.480
 just how can I say an extraction 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.170
 fast then with quick extraction 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:42.000
 you aim faster with pleasure vi 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:45.209
 you will move very quickly targeted fund 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.310
 which doesn't happen without really going there 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:52.019
 move slowly and then the third one 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:58.049
 sorry third accessory and it is 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:59.850
 I certainly don't know about the small reflex 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.790
 sincerely well of the very 1 not 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.340
 like completely there are also 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.080
 people who may not even use 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.700
 the reflex viewfinder and use 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.970
 something else like handle ad 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.870
 example though as I don't like the 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.570
 Wine of 1 m and I prefer SLR 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.200
 I find this is pretty good though 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.970
 a weapon that is used mainly in alloy 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.530
 if for example you try to play in 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.510
 alloy 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.470
 most people if there 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.030
 are the smg that are the ones they use 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.920
 let's say the machine guns strange how 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.320
 scorpion ms mc 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:44.390
 here are the a rs that use land art o 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.390
 one or line in 94 mm or tom no 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.120
 now have as it is called method 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.070
 best tex because you don't like the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.240
 aim what is the example does not happen 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:56.730
 with the n 94 where even the 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.860
 adjustable serapide lime to be 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.580
 however a strong enough e 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.140
 so I have no problems with that weapon in 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.220
 glass with regards to specialties 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.050
 are the usual ones I use to do to do 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.300
 nuclear in general what I do 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.560
 I'm bringing the courses into the latest videos 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:20.220
 that I have facts that are anti-splinters 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:23.400
 light it doesn't need much because not 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.660
 I know, but I guarantee you split two worlds 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.080
 they'll be wondering why they don't mind 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:31.020
 ghost because anyway guys if you 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.910
 notice I use as rewards included 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.520
 white killings contracted with pisa 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:40.290
 so it wouldn't make sense to say 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:43.290
 waste a ghost slot because 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.050
 there is already a counterattack or then for 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:49.940
 this so then jackal steel e 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:53.160
 dexterity therefore a normal class 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.050
 rewards, however, the usual three 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.020
 guys anyway the video is over 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.460
 I arrived as young as 7,300 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.290
 I thank you all 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.900
 I also thank you for the face king 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.450
 he is helped to get to this 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.610
 this threshold of 7 thousand and 300 and nothing 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.810
 guys I greet you and you get the 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.810
