to<00:02:12.400> fly<00:02:12.550> this<00:02:12.940> is<00:02:13.090> where<00:02:13.269> I've<00:02:13.420> gathered<00:02:13.930> all

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
to fly this is where I've gathered all

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.350 
to fly this is where I've gathered all
my<00:02:14.110> crew<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:17.610> might<00:02:18.610> actually<00:02:18.819> think<00:02:19.030> that

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
my crew you might actually think that

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.729 
my crew you might actually think that
nursing<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:19.870> ballooning<00:02:20.170> are<00:02:20.319> two<00:02:20.470> very

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
nursing and ballooning are two very

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.650 
nursing and ballooning are two very
different<00:02:20.950> things<00:02:21.370> but<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.670> found<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.599> a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
different things but I found is a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.600 
different things but I found is a
similarity<00:02:23.230> between<00:02:23.560> them<00:02:23.920> because<00:02:24.310> when<00:02:24.459> I'm

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
similarity between them because when I'm

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.289 
similarity between them because when I'm
flying

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
flying

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.660 
flying
lives<00:02:26.049> are<00:02:26.379> hanging<00:02:26.860> in<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.040> balance<00:02:27.220> and

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
lives are hanging in the balance and

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.190 
lives are hanging in the balance and
they're<00:02:27.879> depending<00:02:28.030> upon<00:02:28.480> me<00:02:28.840> for<00:02:29.019> that

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
they're depending upon me for that

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.619 
they're depending upon me for that
positive<00:02:29.620> outcome<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.910> it's<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.209> similar

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
positive outcome and it's a similar

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.589 
positive outcome and it's a similar
situation<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:32.379> nursing<00:02:32.799> so<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.640> found<00:02:34.390> the

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
situation in nursing so I found the

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.720 
situation in nursing so I found the
connection<00:02:34.840> there<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.950> enjoy<00:02:36.250> both<00:02:36.489> so

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
connection there and I enjoy both so
