i'm<00:01:47.139> shooting<00:01:47.259> now<00:01:47.530> but<00:01:48.159> it<00:01:48.310> can<00:01:48.459> be<00:01:48.579> on<00:01:48.729> any

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
i'm shooting now but it can be on any

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.669 
i'm shooting now but it can be on any
ledge<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.509> it's<00:01:49.749> somewhere<00:01:50.109> where<00:01:50.380> you<00:01:50.530> can

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
ledge and it's somewhere where you can

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:51.840 
ledge and it's somewhere where you can
knife<00:01:50.889> it<00:01:51.100> and<00:01:51.280> then<00:01:51.429> it<00:01:51.520> will<00:01:51.609> fall<00:01:51.819> down

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
knife it and then it will fall down

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.519 
knife it and then it will fall down
below<00:01:52.299> and<00:01:52.509> the<00:01:52.630> person<00:01:52.929> below<00:01:53.049> can<00:01:53.319> catch<00:01:53.499> it

little bit further after the vodka part
it's<00:02:08.140> pretty<00:02:08.410> much<00:02:08.500> over<00:02:08.679> and<00:02:08.979> he's<00:02:09.099> going<00:02:09.250> to

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
is you have to get in order from top to

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.309 
is you have to get in order from top to
bottom<00:02:15.370> there's<00:02:16.300> going<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.569> be<00:02:16.630> little<00:02:16.959> dials

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
bottom there's going to be little dials

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.980 
bottom there's going to be little dials
on<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.560> wall<00:02:17.800> right<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.880> those<00:02:19.270> little<00:02:19.480> dials

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
on the wall right and those little dials

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.480 
on the wall right and those little dials
right<00:02:20.890> here<00:02:21.100> it's<00:02:21.340> going<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.550> be<00:02:21.610> too

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
right here it's going to be too

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.440 
right here it's going to be too
746<00:02:24.569> 2746<00:02:25.569> going<00:02:25.990> down<00:02:26.200> now<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:27.330> could<00:02:28.330> just

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
746 2746 going down now I could just

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.970 
746 2746 going down now I could just
tell<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:28.840> oh<00:02:29.020> you<00:02:29.080> can<00:02:29.380> hit<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.560> few<00:02:29.709> switches

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
tell you oh you can hit a few switches

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.830 
tell you oh you can hit a few switches
here<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.430> there<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.700> you'll<00:02:30.819> get<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.090> no<00:02:31.569> this

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
here and there and you'll get it no this

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.610 
here and there and you'll get it no this
is<00:02:32.430> really<00:02:33.430> really<00:02:33.760> difficult<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:35.470> way

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
is really really difficult and the way

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.930 
is really really difficult and the way
it<00:02:35.740> works<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.450> each<00:02:37.450> level<00:02:38.050> controls<00:02:39.040> the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
it works is that each level controls the

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.810 
it works is that each level controls the
one<00:02:40.360> level<00:02:40.780> above<00:02:41.020> it<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.620> below<00:02:42.070> it<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:42.700> the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
one level above it and below it so the

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.280 
one level above it and below it so the
bottom<00:02:43.090> level<00:02:43.270> controls<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.840> one<00:02:43.990> above<00:02:44.230> it

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
bottom level controls the one above it

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.430 
bottom level controls the one above it
the<00:02:44.590> two<00:02:45.459> middle<00:02:45.640> ones<00:02:45.760> each<00:02:46.150> going<00:02:47.050> to<00:02:47.140> go<00:02:47.200> 1<00:02:47.410> 2

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
the two middle ones each going to go 1 2

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.120 
the two middle ones each going to go 1 2
4<00:02:47.740> from<00:02:48.010> bottoms<00:02:48.489> one<00:02:48.790> top<00:02:49.380> 242<00:02:50.380> controls<00:02:50.890> one

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
4 from bottoms one top 242 controls one

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.949 
4 from bottoms one top 242 controls one
and<00:02:51.310> three<00:02:51.520> three<00:02:52.030> controls<00:02:52.420> two<00:02:52.600> and<00:02:52.750> four

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
and three three controls two and four

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.410 
and three three controls two and four
for<00:02:53.739> controls<00:02:54.190> three<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:54.760> one<00:02:54.910> controls<00:02:55.239> too

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
for controls three and one controls too

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.670 
for controls three and one controls too
if<00:02:55.630> that<00:02:55.780> made<00:02:55.959> sense<00:02:57.360> if<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.660> didn't<00:02:58.989> you'll

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
if that made sense if it didn't you'll

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.860 
if that made sense if it didn't you'll
hopefully<00:03:00.250> get<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:00.790> or<00:03:01.060> else<00:03:01.150> this<00:03:01.420> probably

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
hopefully get it or else this probably

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.479 
hopefully get it or else this probably
isn't<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.200> tutorial<00:03:02.739> to<00:03:02.920> try<00:03:03.070> to<00:03:03.130> be<00:03:03.250> doing

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
isn't the tutorial to try to be doing

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.729 
isn't the tutorial to try to be doing
because<00:03:03.640> this<00:03:03.820> is<00:03:03.940> really<00:03:04.150> complicated<00:03:04.739> these

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.729 
are next for radios you have to do in
the<00:03:09.100> exact<00:03:09.489> order<00:03:09.640> that<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:09.970> did<00:03:10.209> ending<00:03:11.050> or

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
the exact order that I did ending or

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.620 
the exact order that I did ending or
starting<00:03:12.220> with<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.430> one<00:03:12.610> in<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:13.120> captain's

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
starting with the one in the captain's

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.020 
starting with the one in the captain's
chamber<00:03:14.050> place<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.560> ending<00:03:15.280> with<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.489> one<00:03:15.790> in

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
chamber place and ending with the one in

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.590 
chamber place and ending with the one in
the<00:03:16.920> like<00:03:17.920> locked<00:03:18.310> chamber<00:03:19.120> where<00:03:19.330> they<00:03:19.480> are

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
the like locked chamber where they are

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.560 
the like locked chamber where they are
and<00:03:19.840> then<00:03:20.410> this<00:03:20.530> little<00:03:20.709> like<00:03:21.550> flashing<00:03:22.330> light

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
and then this little like flashing light

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.780 
and then this little like flashing light
will<00:03:22.810> be<00:03:22.959> signaling<00:03:23.769> it's<00:03:23.920> like<00:03:24.010> an<00:03:24.130> SOS<00:03:24.550> type

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
will be signaling it's like an SOS type

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.759 
will be signaling it's like an SOS type
signal<00:03:25.239> from<00:03:25.450> a<00:03:25.570> boat<00:03:25.780> but<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.290> will<00:03:26.410> not<00:03:26.560> see

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
signal from a boat but you will not see

the boat the next thing that you're
going<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.049> do<00:03:29.140> is<00:03:29.260> you're<00:03:29.350> going<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.530> go<00:03:29.620> up<00:03:29.709> to
