are trying out the full collection
sometimes<00:01:50.440> most<00:01:51.440> of<00:01:51.620> the<00:01:51.710> full<00:01:51.890> question<00:01:52.010> will

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
sometimes most of the full question will

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.510 
sometimes most of the full question will
become<00:01:52.640> part<00:01:52.880> of<00:01:52.940> their<00:01:53.090> permanent<00:01:53.980> and<00:01:54.980> with

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
become part of their permanent and with

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.010 
become part of their permanent and with
an<00:01:55.670> exception<00:01:56.150> of<00:01:56.240> one<00:01:56.360> or<00:01:56.480> two<00:01:56.570> colors<00:01:56.870> which

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
an exception of one or two colors which

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.500 
an exception of one or two colors which
will<00:01:57.140> just<00:01:57.290> be<00:01:57.500> limited<00:01:57.860> edition<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:58.760> I<00:01:59.060> think

that<00:01:59.870> these<00:02:00.080> are<00:02:00.290> permanent<00:02:01.960> because<00:02:02.960> they

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
that these are permanent because they

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.020 
that these are permanent because they
were<00:02:03.200> not<00:02:03.470> honest<00:02:03.680> way<00:02:03.860> there<00:02:04.040> in<00:02:04.250> target<00:02:04.640> with
