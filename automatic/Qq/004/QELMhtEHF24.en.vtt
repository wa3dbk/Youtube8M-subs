00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
it seems to be a awesome tweak in my

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.080 
it seems to be a awesome tweak in my
opinion<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:22.680> others<00:03:23.040> were<00:03:23.250> just<00:03:23.519> limited<00:03:24.060> to

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
opinion the others were just limited to

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.509 
opinion the others were just limited to
just<00:03:24.450> attaching<00:03:25.140> photos<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:26.040> stuff<00:03:26.310> like

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
just attaching photos and stuff like

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.430 
just attaching photos and stuff like
that<00:03:26.580> but<00:03:26.820> this<00:03:27.120> allows<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.810> attach<00:03:27.930> a

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
that but this allows you to attach a

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.370 
that but this allows you to attach a
number<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.519> stuff<00:03:29.880> from<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.600> number<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.019> places

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380
