storytelling sort of thing how does this

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.910 
storytelling sort of thing how does this
map<00:00:17.910> fit<00:00:18.270> into<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.690> halo<00:00:18.869> universe<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.800> what

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
map fit into the halo universe and what

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.590 
map fit into the halo universe and what
kind<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.189> story<00:00:20.460> did<00:00:20.640> they<00:00:20.760> tell<00:00:21.000> so

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
kind of story did they tell so

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.689 
kind of story did they tell so
definitely<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.949> past<00:00:23.220> when<00:00:23.550> we've<00:00:23.580> made

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
definitely in the past when we've made

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.210 
definitely in the past when we've made
map<00:00:24.090> packs<00:00:24.359> or<00:00:24.689> added<00:00:25.470> maps<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:25.980> halo

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
map packs or added maps to the halo

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.160 
map packs or added maps to the halo
universe<00:00:26.430> they<00:00:27.150> tend<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.539> be<00:00:27.750> like

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
universe they tend to be like

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.810 
universe they tend to be like
multiplayer<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.220> always<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> little<00:00:29.609> bit

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
multiplayer is always a little bit

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.400 
multiplayer is always a little bit
disconnected<00:00:30.210> from<00:00:30.510> campaign<00:00:30.990> fiction

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
disconnected from campaign fiction

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.290 
disconnected from campaign fiction
anyway<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.830> have<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> sort<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.910> multiplayer

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
anyway you have the sort of multiplayer

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.970 
anyway you have the sort of multiplayer
atmosphere<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.989> multiplayer<00:00:34.350> voice<00:00:34.680> guy

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
atmosphere in the multiplayer voice guy

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.130 
atmosphere in the multiplayer voice guy
and<00:00:35.640> sometimes<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.239> know<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.420> look<00:00:36.630> at<00:00:36.780> halo

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
and sometimes you know you look at halo

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.860 
and sometimes you know you look at halo
halo<00:00:38.070> reach<00:00:38.370> even<00:00:38.579> has<00:00:38.940> forge<00:00:39.329> world<00:00:39.570> which<00:00:39.840> is

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
halo reach even has forge world which is

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.350 
halo reach even has forge world which is
sat<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.350> halo<00:00:40.710> obviously<00:00:41.670> there's<00:00:41.850> no<00:00:41.910> halo

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
sat on a halo obviously there's no halo

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.119 
sat on a halo obviously there's no halo
and<00:00:42.510> reach<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.110> we<00:00:43.230> kind<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.500> disconnect<00:00:43.980> those

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
and reach so we kind of disconnect those

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.310 
and reach so we kind of disconnect those
ideas<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.390> map<00:00:45.570> pack<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:45.899> definitely

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
ideas with this map pack we definitely

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.350 
ideas with this map pack we definitely
wanted<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.620> grow<00:00:46.800> at<00:00:47.100> least<00:00:47.340> aesthetically<00:00:48.120> in

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
wanted to grow at least aesthetically in

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.630 
wanted to grow at least aesthetically in
the<00:00:48.780> reach<00:00:48.989> fiction<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.950> everything<00:00:50.309> happens

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the reach fiction so everything happens

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.430 
the reach fiction so everything happens
on<00:00:50.760> reach<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.329> always<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:52.140> kind<00:00:52.410> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
on reach and it's always it's kind of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.380 
on reach and it's always it's kind of
constant<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.340> background<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:53.969> literally

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
constant in the background and literally

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.209 
constant in the background and literally
in<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> case<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:54.989> condemned<00:00:55.620> which<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
in the case of condemned which is on a

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.000 
in the case of condemned which is on a
spacecraft<00:00:57.260> orbiting<00:00:58.260> above<00:00:58.559> reach<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.949> you

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
spacecraft orbiting above reach and you

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.560 
spacecraft orbiting above reach and you
can<00:00:59.129> see<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> planet<00:00:59.699> burning<00:01:00.090> beneath<00:01:00.359> you

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
can see the planet burning beneath you

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.479 
can see the planet burning beneath you
so<00:01:01.170> whether<00:01:01.649> whether<00:01:02.070> you're<00:01:02.309> playing

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
so whether whether you're playing

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.670 
so whether whether you're playing
oddball<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.059> chasing<00:01:03.629> after<00:01:03.780> skulls<00:01:04.260> or<00:01:04.500> not

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
oddball and chasing after skulls or not

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.109 
oddball and chasing after skulls or not
there's<00:01:04.920> always<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.220> constant<00:01:05.489> reminder<00:01:06.090> of

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
there's always this constant reminder of

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.310 
there's always this constant reminder of
the<00:01:06.240> fiction<00:01:06.689> from<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.080> campaign<00:01:08.070> space<00:01:09.320> so

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the fiction from the campaign space so

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.840 
the fiction from the campaign space so
how<00:01:10.470> would<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.680> say<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.400> sort<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
how would you say that the sort of the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.789 
how would you say that the sort of the
separation<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.630> Bungie<00:01:13.260> from<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> Halo

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
separation of Bungie from the Halo

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.800 
separation of Bungie from the Halo
franchise<00:01:14.070> has<00:01:14.580> been<00:01:14.729> how's<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.390> experience

been um it's been fairly smooth I mean
largely<00:01:19.020> because<00:01:19.320> bungees<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> great<00:01:19.979> bunch<00:01:20.189> of

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
largely because bungees a great bunch of

that part's been easy i mean the hard
parts<00:01:27.090> are<00:01:27.210> weird<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.750> boring<00:01:28.110> things

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
parts are weird little boring things

parts are weird little boring things
like<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.860> know<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.100> transfer<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.880> data<00:01:30.150> over

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
like you know the transfer of data over

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.560 
like you know the transfer of data over
servers<00:01:31.040> for<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.340> know<00:01:32.460> stats<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.450> stuff
