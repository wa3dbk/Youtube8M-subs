00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409 
is it to create a dream like a fact to

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.139 
is it to create a dream like a fact to
unsettle<00:06:16.680> the<00:06:16.830> viewer<00:06:17.039> through<00:06:17.189> deja<00:06:17.550> vu<00:06:17.729> all

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:20.009

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:22.649 
terms we get it two episodes of this got

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:23.899

the point across the third was

the point across the third was

essentially unnecessary and it's not

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
then things are up in the air but

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.489 
then things are up in the air but
otherwise<00:06:30.389> the<00:06:30.749> current<00:06:30.990> pattern<00:06:31.229> will<00:06:31.349> try

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.459 
and build into its big revelation but
then<00:06:33.509> you<00:06:33.629> have<00:06:33.719> to<00:06:33.839> ask<00:06:33.930> yourself<00:06:34.379> the

then you have to ask yourself the

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:35.540 
then you have to ask yourself the

dealing with the repetition and

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:39.439 
dealing with the repetition and

I<00:06:41.909> don't<00:06:42.449> think<00:06:42.689> I<00:06:42.749> can<00:06:42.930> take<00:06:43.110> that<00:06:43.259> chance

I don't think I can take that chance

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:46.760 
I don't think I can take that chance
this<00:06:44.909> might<00:06:45.509> be<00:06:45.689> the<00:06:45.810> only<00:06:45.839> anime<00:06:46.379> that<00:06:46.529> failed

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
this might be the only anime that failed

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.409 
this might be the only anime that failed

its style I think it'll turn out to be
at<00:07:03.870> least<00:07:03.990> a<00:07:04.169> decent<00:07:04.649> show<00:07:04.919> it<00:07:05.639> certainly<00:07:05.939> is

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:06.089 
at least a decent show it certainly is

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:07.489 
at least a decent show it certainly is
an<00:07:06.209> anime<00:07:06.539> with<00:07:06.689> some<00:07:06.809> degree<00:07:06.990> of<00:07:07.110> symbolic

00:07:07.489 --> 00:07:07.499 
an anime with some degree of symbolic

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:09.290 
an anime with some degree of symbolic
complexity<00:07:08.039> and<00:07:08.219> a<00:07:08.550> potential<00:07:08.999> for<00:07:09.120> a<00:07:09.149> great

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 
complexity and a potential for a great

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.540 
complexity and a potential for a great
deal<00:07:09.449> more<00:07:09.809> but<00:07:10.259> the<00:07:10.379> sheer<00:07:10.680> grinding<00:07:11.339> weights

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.550 
deal more but the sheer grinding weights

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.070 
deal more but the sheer grinding weights
being<00:07:11.789> presented<00:07:12.209> makes<00:07:12.719> it<00:07:12.839> a<00:07:12.899> lot<00:07:13.020> harder

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 
being presented makes it a lot harder

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.010 
being presented makes it a lot harder
for<00:07:13.409> me<00:07:13.499> to<00:07:13.589> recommend<00:07:13.800> it

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020 
for me to recommend it

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.630 
for me to recommend it
and<00:07:15.110> with<00:07:15.320> that<00:07:15.470> we<00:07:15.650> bring<00:07:15.890> the<00:07:16.040> winter<00:07:16.310> season

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:16.640 
and with that we bring the winter season

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.910 
and with that we bring the winter season
to<00:07:16.820> a<00:07:16.850> close<00:07:17.540> considering<00:07:18.380> I<00:07:18.440> expected<00:07:18.830> only

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:18.920 
to a close considering I expected only

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.770 
to a close considering I expected only
one<00:07:19.160> show<00:07:19.340> to<00:07:19.370> pass<00:07:19.610> at<00:07:19.790> the<00:07:19.880> start<00:07:20.150> it<00:07:20.510> turned

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:20.780 
one show to pass at the start it turned

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.020 
one show to pass at the start it turned
out<00:07:20.840> okay<00:07:21.140> we<00:07:21.770> even<00:07:21.890> had<00:07:22.010> a<00:07:22.040> few<00:07:22.130> curveballs
