00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
valid company and the stock price is

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.830 
valid company and the stock price is
already<00:00:41.640> reflected<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> fact<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.660> they're

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
already reflected the fact that they're

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.869 
already reflected the fact that they're
not<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> only<00:00:43.110> game<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.500> town<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.730> him<00:00:44.820> to

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
not the only game in town so for him to

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.880 
not the only game in town so for him to
come<00:00:45.059> out<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.239> public<00:00:45.840> TV<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.410> think<00:00:46.739> that's

kind<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.190> irresponsible<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:48.090> that's<00:00:48.239> him<00:00:48.480> as

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
kind of irresponsible but that's him as

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.600 
kind of irresponsible but that's him as

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
finally doing a refresh and hopefully

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.149

and let's go over that yeah so if we

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.219 
and let's go over that yeah so if we
take<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.030> look<00:01:21.180> at<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> macro<00:01:21.750> chart<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.200> will

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
take a look at the macro chart you will

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.440

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
that it is star intact better and there

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.160 
that it is star intact better and there
looks<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.329> there<00:01:51.659> could<00:01:51.689> be<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.930> strategic

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.050 
somewhere in August so we have
anticipation<00:02:14.250> sometimes<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.849> anticipation

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
anticipation sometimes the anticipation

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.449 
anticipation sometimes the anticipation
is<00:02:15.599> better<00:02:15.810> than<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.110> event<00:02:16.409> so<00:02:16.829> we<00:02:16.980> have<00:02:17.129> room

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
is better than the event so we have room

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.949 
is better than the event so we have room
between<00:02:17.670> now<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.239> then<00:02:18.329> so<00:02:18.540> if<00:02:18.599> we<00:02:18.719> look<00:02:18.750> at
