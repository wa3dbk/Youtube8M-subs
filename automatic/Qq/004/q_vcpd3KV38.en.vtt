a-flat<00:00:19.130> I'm<00:00:20.130> going<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.340> show<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.520> actually

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
a-flat I'm going to show you actually

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.270 
a-flat I'm going to show you actually
two<00:00:20.970> different<00:00:21.180> ways<00:00:21.360> to<00:00:21.840> do<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:24.050> the

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:25.280 
two different ways to do this the

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.250 
two different ways to do this the
regular<00:00:26.280> way<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.910> then<00:00:27.450> probably<00:00:27.840> an<00:00:27.900> easier

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
regular way and then probably an easier

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.200 
regular way and then probably an easier
way<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.590> sounds<00:00:28.860> equally<00:00:29.250> as<00:00:29.340> well<00:00:29.550> it's<00:00:30.120> not

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
way that sounds equally as well it's not

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.250 
way that sounds equally as well it's not
but<00:00:30.450> it's<00:00:30.600> about<00:00:30.920> ten<00:00:31.920> times<00:00:32.129> easier<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.940> do

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
but it's about ten times easier to do

00:00:33.260 --> 00:01:06.670 
but it's about ten times easier to do
first

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.980 

okay<00:01:08.560> this<00:01:09.560> first<00:01:11.290> this<00:01:12.290> first<00:01:12.350> version

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
okay this first this first version

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.950 
okay this first this first version
basically<00:01:14.990> is<00:01:15.290> three<00:01:15.560> cores

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.440

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
inverted a flat chord G b-flat e-flat

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.510 
inverted a flat chord G b-flat e-flat
and<00:01:30.729> then<00:01:30.939> a<00:01:31.149> flat<00:01:31.450> one<00:01:31.720> chord<00:01:32.020> a<00:01:32.259> flat<00:01:32.380> C<00:01:33.250> D

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
and then a flat one chord a flat C D

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:41.330 
and then a flat one chord a flat C D

five to one chord over a flat and I hit

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.500 
five to one chord over a flat and I hit
the<00:03:30.900> two<00:03:31.080> five<00:03:31.350> one<00:03:32.209> on<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:34.790> at<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.850> end<00:03:36.060> of

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510

now<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:02.980> second<00:04:03.580> version<00:04:03.730> that<00:04:05.910> that<00:04:06.910> is<00:04:08.550> much

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
now the second version that that is much

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:19.300 
now the second version that that is much
easier<00:04:09.580> to<00:04:10.030> play<00:04:10.150> I<00:04:10.540> think<00:04:11.110> still<00:04:11.530> sounds<00:04:11.920> good
