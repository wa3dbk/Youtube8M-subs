00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and here is the snow performance gauge

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.249 
and here is the snow performance gauge
and<00:01:54.770> these<00:01:55.770> are<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:57.060> fog<00:01:57.329> lamps<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.110> guess

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
and these are for the fog lamps I guess

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.219 
and these are for the fog lamps I guess
into<00:01:58.820> these<00:01:59.820> pillar<00:02:00.540> gauges<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.110> have

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
into these pillar gauges that we have

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.929 
into these pillar gauges that we have
right<00:02:01.380> now<00:02:01.439> are<00:02:01.619> currently<00:02:01.979> off<00:02:02.189> since<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
snow performance shows all that and got

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.610 
snow performance shows all that and got
a<00:02:09.229> custom<00:02:10.229> stereo

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
a custom stereo

00:02:11.620 --> 00:03:32.670 
a custom stereo
now<00:02:12.550> I'll<00:02:12.700> show<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:12.970> quick<00:02:13.180> startup

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
is fairly stock we've got the bank's

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.800 
is fairly stock we've got the bank's
twin<00:04:21.370> Ram<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.810> dig<00:04:23.139> manifold<00:04:24.419> then<00:04:25.419> we've<00:04:25.630> got

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
twin Ram and dig manifold then we've got

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:33.420 
twin Ram and dig manifold then we've got
a<00:04:26.080> Spectre<00:04:26.740> air<00:04:26.949> intake<00:04:29.340> over<00:04:30.340> here<00:04:32.009> we<00:04:33.009> can

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
a Spectre air intake over here we can

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.620 
a Spectre air intake over here we can
see<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:36.190> air<00:04:36.400> dog<00:04:36.699> right<00:04:37.060> there

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
see the air dog right there

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:44.070 
see the air dog right there
I<00:04:40.349> think<00:04:41.669> bigger<00:04:42.669> injectors<00:04:43.060> and<00:04:43.810> maybe<00:04:43.990> a

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
I think bigger injectors and maybe a

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:55.020 
I think bigger injectors and maybe a
twin<00:04:44.320> turbo<00:04:44.470> setup<00:04:45.370> is<00:04:45.610> coming<00:04:52.470> so<00:04:53.849> hope<00:04:54.849> you

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
twin turbo setup is coming so hope you

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.849 
twin turbo setup is coming so hope you
like<00:04:55.060> it<00:04:55.210> thanks<00:04:56.080> for<00:04:56.110> watching<00:04:56.289> and<00:04:57.190> like
