00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
notice that I'm breaking on a lot later

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.299

than I do in f1 2012 a feed for the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.260 
than I do in f1 2012 a feed for the
first<00:00:32.489> corner<00:00:32.730> which<00:00:32.850> you'll<00:00:33.000> see<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
first corner which you'll see on the

first corner which you'll see on the
next<00:00:33.420> lap<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.829> break<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.100> lot<00:00:35.430> later<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
next lap I can break a lot later and

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.090 
next lap I can break a lot later and
still<00:00:36.030> make<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.300> corner<00:00:36.570> which<00:00:37.530> has<00:00:37.710> been<00:00:37.920> one

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
still make the corner which has been one

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.530 
still make the corner which has been one
of<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.190> differences<00:00:38.460> between<00:00:38.610> real<00:00:39.270> life<00:00:39.390> and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
of the differences between real life and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.240 
of the differences between real life and
this<00:00:40.079> game<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.559> that's<00:00:40.710> good<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.980> see<00:00:41.100> that

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
this game so that's good to see that

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.040 
this game so that's good to see that
change<00:00:41.520> for<00:00:41.730> sure<00:00:41.760> see<00:00:42.660> they're<00:00:42.780> really

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
change for sure see they're really

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.619 
change for sure see they're really
chatting<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.500> corner<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.890> sticks<00:00:44.129> nicely

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
chatting in the corner it sticks nicely

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.490 
chatting in the corner it sticks nicely
that's<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.780> main<00:00:45.930> difference<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.230> notice<00:00:46.440> in

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
that's the main difference I notice in

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.290 
that's the main difference I notice in
the<00:00:46.559> handling<00:00:46.920> again<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.149> get<00:00:48.270> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
the handling again can really get a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.000 
the handling again can really get a
proper<00:00:48.570> feel<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:48.989> belt<00:00:49.230> using<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
proper feel for it belt using on the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.100 
proper feel for it belt using on the
home<00:00:50.190> setup<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.789> I've<00:00:51.480> developed<00:00:51.690> beer<00:00:51.989> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
home setup so I've developed beer to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.760 
home setup so I've developed beer to
play<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> game

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
play the game

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.500 
play the game
on<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.160> slightly<00:00:53.340> more<00:00:53.520> representative<00:00:54.180> set<00:00:54.390> up

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
on a slightly more representative set up

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.990 
on a slightly more representative set up
soon<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:55.289> course<00:00:55.469> DRS<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.579> only<00:00:56.670> use<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
soon of course DRS you can only use the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.580 
soon of course DRS you can only use the
DRS<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.109> specified<00:00:58.829> zones<00:01:00.289> which<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.440> good

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
DRS in the specified zones which is good

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.170 
DRS in the specified zones which is good
see<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:01.890> DRS<00:01:02.219> Cotton's<00:01:02.550> DRS<00:01:02.820> now<00:01:02.940> we're<00:01:03.059> going

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
see so DRS Cotton's DRS now we're going

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.820 
see so DRS Cotton's DRS now we're going
to<00:01:03.239> use<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.510> down<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.199> back<00:01:04.350> straight<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
to use it down that back straight and

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.929 
to use it down that back straight and
also<00:01:04.979> down<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> home<00:01:05.430> straight<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:05.820> that's

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
also down the home straight so that's

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.550 
also down the home straight so that's
quite<00:01:06.090> interesting<00:01:06.150> there<00:01:08.119> so<00:01:09.119> yes<00:01:09.869> I'm<00:01:10.350> also

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
quite interesting there so yes I'm also

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.429 
quite interesting there so yes I'm also
the<00:01:10.710> top<00:01:10.860> speed<00:01:11.189> look<00:01:11.369> at<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.930> 182<00:01:12.930> miles<00:01:13.229> an

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
the top speed look at that 182 miles an

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.420 
the top speed look at that 182 miles an
hour<00:01:13.560> then<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> straight<00:01:14.189> which<00:01:14.340> is

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
hour then the straight which is

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.770 
hour then the straight which is
absolutely<00:01:14.939> nothing<00:01:15.150> compared<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> old

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
absolutely nothing compared to the old

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.270 
absolutely nothing compared to the old
game<00:01:15.960> that's<00:01:16.770> something<00:01:17.009> else<00:01:17.159> it's

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
game that's something else it's

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.380 
game that's something else it's
definitely<00:01:17.610> been<00:01:17.700> fixed<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.060> know<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> didn't

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
definitely been fixed I know I didn't

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.550 
definitely been fixed I know I didn't
add<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> RS<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:19.049> let's<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.320> down<00:01:19.470> this

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
add the RS but let's see down this

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.469 
add the RS but let's see down this
straight<00:01:19.770> little<00:01:20.009> bit<00:01:20.130> curves<00:01:20.310> knee<00:01:20.460> exit<00:01:20.820> I'm

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
straight little bit curves knee exit I'm

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.140 
straight little bit curves knee exit I'm
using<00:01:21.659> TRS<00:01:22.049> down<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> straight<00:01:22.560> then<00:01:23.150> it's

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
using TRS down the straight then it's

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.580 
using TRS down the straight then it's
concourse<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.659> know<00:01:24.840> there<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.320> go<00:01:25.439> there

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
concourse and I know there we go there

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.350 
concourse and I know there we go there
goes<00:01:25.680> DRS<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.280> even<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.700> look<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.090> really

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
goes DRS and even so look not really

game I was a bit too lenient on the
chronic<00:02:32.980> cutting<00:02:33.190> so<00:02:33.280> let's<00:02:33.430> hope<00:02:33.580> we<00:02:33.700> see

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
chronic cutting so let's hope we see

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.550 
chronic cutting so let's hope we see
that<00:02:33.970> for<00:02:34.210> all<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.630> other<00:02:34.720> tracks<00:02:34.930> as<00:02:35.200> well

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
that for all the other tracks as well

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.290 
that for all the other tracks as well
the<00:02:36.310> mirrors<00:02:36.550> look<00:02:36.700> at<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.850> mirrors<00:02:37.060> they

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
the mirrors look at the mirrors they

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.150 
the mirrors look at the mirrors they

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
look improved to me you can see the rear

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.140 
look improved to me you can see the rear
of<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.250> car<00:02:39.430> which<00:02:39.520> I<00:02:39.580> don't<00:02:39.640> really<00:02:39.790> could<00:02:40.030> do

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
of the car which I don't really could do

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.960 
of the car which I don't really could do
before<00:02:40.390> but<00:02:40.480> still<00:02:40.570> 100%<00:02:41.020> but<00:02:41.670> look<00:02:42.670> better<00:02:42.850> to

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
before but still 100% but look better to

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.160 
before but still 100% but look better to
me<00:02:43.000> so<00:02:43.180> look<00:02:43.300> there<00:02:43.420> on<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.540> me<00:02:43.630> map<00:02:43.810> it's<00:02:44.080> a

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
me so look there on the me map it's a

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.560 
me so look there on the me map it's a
big<00:02:44.350> blue<00:02:44.560> dot<00:02:44.770> that's<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.340> detection<00:02:46.180> point

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570
