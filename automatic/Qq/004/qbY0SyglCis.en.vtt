00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
pisted when it's about 70 pounds of

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.650 
pisted when it's about 70 pounds of
pushing<00:00:27.779> force<00:00:28.080> no<00:00:28.769> kidding<00:00:32.270> so<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.300> have<00:00:33.510> my

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
pushing force no kidding so I have my

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.200 
pushing force no kidding so I have my
plc<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.320> there<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.770> I've<00:00:35.160> made<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> program

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
plc in there and I've made a program

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.540 
plc in there and I've made a program
called<00:00:36.480> three-on-three<00:00:37.469> off<00:00:38.270> it<00:00:40.340> just<00:00:41.340> does

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
called three-on-three off it just does

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.380 
called three-on-three off it just does
that<00:00:41.820> hundred<00:00:42.420> times<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.170> then<00:00:44.180> red<00:00:45.180> light

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
that hundred times and then red light

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.340 
that hundred times and then red light
turns<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:50.329> yeah<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.510> red<00:00:51.660> light<00:00:51.840> turns<00:00:52.079> on

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
turns on and yeah the red light turns on

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.479 
turns on and yeah the red light turns on
and<00:00:53.750> it<00:00:54.750> beeps<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.559> three<00:00:55.800> seconds<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.430> then

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and it beeps for three seconds and then

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.680 
and it beeps for three seconds and then
starts<00:00:56.820> over<00:00:58.430> so<00:00:59.430> we're<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.390> go<00:01:00.420> ahead

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
