00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
pieces of solid aluminum well after I

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.269 
pieces of solid aluminum well after I
got<00:00:24.269> done<00:00:24.420> with<00:00:24.480> them<00:00:24.720> they're<00:00:25.380> now<00:00:25.650> pieces<00:00:26.099> of

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279

got done with them they're now pieces of
Swiss<00:00:26.550> cheese<00:00:26.880> basically<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:28.320> can<00:00:28.470> see<00:00:28.680> I

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
Swiss cheese basically you can see I

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.140 
Swiss cheese basically you can see I
have<00:00:28.949> two<00:00:29.099> bolts<00:00:29.400> going<00:00:29.550> through<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.789> bottom

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
have two bolts going through the bottom

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.910 
have two bolts going through the bottom
to<00:00:30.359> hold<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> Mugen<00:00:30.869> head<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.170> well<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
to hold the Mugen head in well with the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.500 
to hold the Mugen head in well with the
all<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.399> other<00:00:32.579> holes<00:00:32.850> are<00:00:33.000> four<00:00:33.270> are

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
all the other holes are four are

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.010 
all the other holes are four are
actually<00:00:37.370> for<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.610> these<00:00:38.840> this<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.899> a

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
actually for one of these this is a

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.040 
actually for one of these this is a
humeral<00:00:40.559> 150<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.489> all<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> Q<00:00:42.390> scans<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
humeral 150 and all the Q scans and the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.540 
humeral 150 and all the Q scans and the
key<00:00:43.290> roles<00:00:44.329> have<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> same<00:00:46.370> things<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
key roles have the same things on the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.619 
key roles have the same things on the
bottom<00:00:47.730> because<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> bottom<00:00:48.539> of

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
bottom because see on the bottom of

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.389 
bottom because see on the bottom of
these<00:00:48.719> guys<00:00:48.960> there's<00:00:49.230> four<00:00:49.530> holes<00:00:51.050> so<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.140> can

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
these guys there's four holes so you can

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.410 
these guys there's four holes so you can
bolt<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.579> your<00:00:53.610> handles

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
bolt on your handles

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.660 
bolt on your handles
so<00:00:55.170> they<00:00:55.440> actually<00:00:55.739> uses<00:00:56.100> four<00:00:56.340> stands

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
so they actually uses four stands

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.920 
so they actually uses four stands
basically<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.219> got<00:00:59.910> some<00:01:00.120> metal<00:01:00.390> spacers

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
basically so I got some metal spacers

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.500 
basically so I got some metal spacers
and<00:01:01.520> the<00:01:02.520> spacers<00:01:02.910> weren't<00:01:03.120> quite<00:01:03.300> tall

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
and the spacers weren't quite tall

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.950 
and the spacers weren't quite tall
enough<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.899> fit<00:01:04.110> my<00:01:04.729> power<00:01:05.729> cable<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.390> XLR

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
enough to fit my power cable and XLR

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.310 
enough to fit my power cable and XLR
cords<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.770> what<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.040> did<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.299> drilled<00:01:09.780> holes

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
cords so what we did is we drilled holes

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.190 
cords so what we did is we drilled holes
through<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.220> can<00:01:11.430> plug<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.850> my<00:01:12.030> XLR<00:01:12.810> cords

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
through so I can plug in my XLR cords

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.920 
through so I can plug in my XLR cords
and<00:01:13.320> power<00:01:13.500> cords<00:01:13.970> into<00:01:14.970> right<00:01:15.630> through<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and power cords into right through the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.109 
and power cords into right through the
bottom<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:17.430> thing<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:17.909> had<00:01:18.000> to

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
bottom of this the thing is we had to

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.969 
bottom of this the thing is we had to
make<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.390> modification<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.470> power<00:01:19.650> cord<00:01:19.950> to

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
make a modification to the power cord to

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.260 
make a modification to the power cord to
basically<00:01:20.250> had<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.490> grind<00:01:20.700> off<00:01:20.880> some<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
basically had to grind off some of the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
basically had to grind off some of the
meat<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.590> power<00:01:22.770> cord<00:01:23.750> fits<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.080> there

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
meat so the power cord fits up in there

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:34.310 
meat so the power cord fits up in there
nice<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.830> easy<00:01:31.549> like<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.930> other<00:01:33.960> nice

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
thing about this is now all my cables

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.460 
thing about this is now all my cables
are<00:01:36.030> when<00:01:36.299> I'm<00:01:36.390> using<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.110> barrel

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
are when I'm using this this barrel

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.350 
are when I'm using this this barrel
scanners<00:01:37.829> or<00:01:37.950> regular<00:01:38.400> scanners<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.000> are

scanners or regular scanners that are
the<00:01:39.630> Q<00:01:39.840> series<00:01:40.610> when<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.640> run<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.090> cords<00:01:42.420> right

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the Q series when I run the cords right

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.590 
the Q series when I run the cords right
down<00:01:42.780> through<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.200> middle<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.920> truss

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
down through the middle of the truss

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.060 
down through the middle of the truss
they're<00:01:45.600> hidden<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.259> completely<00:01:46.740> hidden<00:01:46.829> so

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.359 
won't be able to see you need the cords
to<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.869> fixtures<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.530> that'll<00:01:59.159> also

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
to the fixtures and that'll also

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.249 
to the fixtures and that'll also
hopefully<00:02:00.119> work<00:02:00.360> with<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> moving<00:02:01.079> head

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
hopefully work with the moving head

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.350 
hopefully work with the moving head
because<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.799> can<00:02:01.920> see<00:02:02.090> for<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.180> moving

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
because as you can see for the moving

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.529 
because as you can see for the moving
head<00:02:03.719> there's<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.439> hole<00:02:04.740> right<00:02:06.710> back<00:02:07.710> there<00:02:08.539> and

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
head there's a hole right back there and

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.720 
head there's a hole right back there and
on<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.750> backside<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.229> these<00:02:10.500> guys<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.129> should

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
on the backside of these guys I should

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.400 
on the backside of these guys I should
be<00:02:11.849> able<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.030> hopefully<00:02:12.480> get<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.840> cable

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
be able to hopefully get the cable

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.780 
be able to hopefully get the cable
through<00:02:13.770> there<00:02:13.890> underneath<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.430> thing<00:02:14.640> and

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
through there underneath this thing and

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.670 
through there underneath this thing and
plug<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.090> right<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.960> keep<00:02:16.110> all<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.350> cables

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
plug it right in to keep all the cables

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.820 
plug it right in to keep all the cables
hidden<00:02:16.920> for<00:02:17.430> my<00:02:17.520> moving<00:02:17.760> heads<00:02:18.030> as<00:02:18.210> well<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:19.500> I

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
hidden for my moving heads as well so I

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.800 
hidden for my moving heads as well so I
would<00:02:20.070> have<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.670> scanner<00:02:21.000> on<00:02:21.240> top<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.690> this

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
would have the scanner on top of this

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.480 
would have the scanner on top of this
five<00:02:22.080> footer<00:02:22.380> but<00:02:22.650> it's<00:02:22.800> too<00:02:23.010> tall<00:02:23.250> with<00:02:23.460> the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
five footer but it's too tall with the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.370 
five footer but it's too tall with the
ceiling<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.300> have<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.870> need<00:02:24.990> about<00:02:25.200> an

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
ceiling that I have I need about an

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.410 
ceiling that I have I need about an
extra<00:02:25.620> two<00:02:25.980> inches<00:02:26.010> in<00:02:26.940> order<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.270> that

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
extra two inches in order for that

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.410 
extra two inches in order for that
scanner<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.960> fit<00:02:28.460> on<00:02:29.460> top<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:29.970> five<00:02:30.180> foot

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
scanner to fit on top of the five foot

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.480 
scanner to fit on top of the five foot
section<00:02:30.810> but<00:02:31.020> you'll<00:02:31.140> see<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.560> scanners<00:02:32.190> used

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
section but you'll see the scanners used

doing a gig log on that and you'll
notice<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:40.320> this<00:02:40.590> trussing<00:02:41.100> I'll<00:02:41.460> show<00:02:41.670> you

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
notice that this trussing I'll show you

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.160 
notice that this trussing I'll show you
how<00:02:41.880> these<00:02:42.000> connect<00:02:42.390> actually<00:02:42.630> for<00:02:42.960> those<00:02:43.050> of

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
how these connect actually for those of

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.460 
how these connect actually for those of
you<00:02:43.260> guys<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.440> have<00:02:43.650> no<00:02:43.830> idea<00:02:45.170> these<00:02:46.170> pieces

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
you guys that have no idea these pieces

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.930 
you guys that have no idea these pieces
come<00:02:46.860> with<00:02:46.890> each<00:02:47.250> section<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.760> truss<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:49.940> they

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
come with each section of truss and they

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.490 
come with each section of truss and they
slide<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.420> in<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.690> then<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:51.870> have<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.140> pound<00:02:52.350> a

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
slide it in and then you have to pound a

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.760 
slide it in and then you have to pound a
pin<00:02:52.710> in<00:02:53.240> to<00:02:54.240> secure<00:02:54.660> with<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.140> hammer<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.530> do

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
pin in to secure with a hammer you do

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.520 
pin in to secure with a hammer you do
need<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:55.980> hammer<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:57.720> use<00:02:57.840> this<00:02:58.050> stuff<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.440> it's

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
need a hammer to use this stuff and it's

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.460 
need a hammer to use this stuff and it's
quite<00:02:58.740> loud<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.760> my<00:03:00.300> suggestion<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.140> get<00:03:01.410> a

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
quite loud so my suggestion is to get a

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.650 
quite loud so my suggestion is to get a
hard<00:03:01.770> plastic<00:03:02.100> or<00:03:02.580> hard<00:03:02.790> rubber<00:03:03.120> very<00:03:03.450> hard

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
hard plastic or hard rubber very hard

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.440 
hard plastic or hard rubber very hard
rubber<00:03:03.870> hammer<00:03:04.610> hopefully<00:03:05.610> that'll<00:03:05.790> be<00:03:05.910> good

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
rubber hammer hopefully that'll be good

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.750 
rubber hammer hopefully that'll be good
enough<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:07.380> pound<00:03:07.590> these<00:03:07.770> in<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.070> out<00:03:08.160> because

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
enough to pound these in and out because

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.010 
enough to pound these in and out because
if<00:03:08.940> you're<00:03:09.060> setting<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.390> stuff<00:03:09.600> up<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.990> a

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
if you're setting the stuff up and a

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.390 
if you're setting the stuff up and a
wedding<00:03:10.440> while<00:03:10.770> they're<00:03:10.980> having<00:03:11.220> dinner

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
wedding while they're having dinner

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.650 
wedding while they're having dinner
hopefully<00:03:11.730> instead<00:03:12.000> of<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.150> before<00:03:12.450> but<00:03:12.480> if

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
hopefully instead of it before but if

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.730 
hopefully instead of it before but if
you're<00:03:12.780> doing<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:13.050> while<00:03:13.170> people<00:03:13.350> are<00:03:13.500> there

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
you're doing it while people are there

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.880 
you're doing it while people are there
it's<00:03:14.220> really<00:03:14.790> really<00:03:15.210> loud<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:15.990> but<00:03:16.590> anyways

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
it's really really loud so but anyways

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.830 
it's really really loud so but anyways
that's<00:03:17.490> how<00:03:17.820> I'm<00:03:17.910> gonna<00:03:18.000> be<00:03:18.120> able<00:03:18.330> to<00:03:18.450> do<00:03:18.690> it

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
that's how I'm gonna be able to do it

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.070 
that's how I'm gonna be able to do it
for<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:20.180> for<00:03:21.180> this<00:03:21.300> Saturday<00:03:21.690> I'm<00:03:21.750> gonna<00:03:21.930> use

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
for this for this Saturday I'm gonna use

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.540 
for this for this Saturday I'm gonna use
the<00:03:22.230> scanners<00:03:22.680> because<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:22.950> still<00:03:23.280> don't<00:03:23.340> have

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
the scanners because I still don't have

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.610 
the scanners because I still don't have
a<00:03:23.640> second<00:03:23.910> moving<00:03:24.120> head<00:03:24.300> of<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.570> this<00:03:25.320> truss

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
a second moving head of and this truss

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.860 
a second moving head of and this truss
was<00:03:26.010> kind<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.460> spendy<00:03:26.820> thing<00:03:27.030> but<00:03:27.210> I<00:03:27.420> should

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
was kind of a spendy thing but I should

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.360 
was kind of a spendy thing but I should
and<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.320> really<00:03:28.530> don't<00:03:28.620> need<00:03:28.770> two<00:03:28.950> moving<00:03:29.220> heads

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
and I really don't need two moving heads

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.970 
and I really don't need two moving heads
quite<00:03:29.580> yet<00:03:29.940> but<00:03:30.720> two<00:03:31.140> scanners<00:03:31.530> on<00:03:31.650> top<00:03:31.800> of<00:03:31.920> the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
quite yet but two scanners on top of the

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.770 
quite yet but two scanners on top of the
truss<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:33.710> one<00:03:34.710> part<00:03:35.490> 56<00:03:35.970> inside<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.660> each

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
truss to one part 56 inside of each

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.050 
truss to one part 56 inside of each
totem<00:03:37.320> and<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.400> don't<00:03:38.460> know<00:03:38.610> what<00:03:38.730> else<00:03:38.850> I'm

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
totem and I don't know what else I'm

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.240
