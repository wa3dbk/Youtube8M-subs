because<00:00:23.200> as<00:00:23.349> much<00:00:23.529> as<00:00:23.710> it<00:00:23.860> feels<00:00:24.399> like<00:00:24.730> we're

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939

talking about it it's kind of like we're

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.940 
talking about it it's kind of like we're
not<00:00:27.610> actually<00:00:27.880> talking<00:00:28.480> about<00:00:28.540> it<00:00:28.840> at<00:00:28.960> all<00:00:29.110> we

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
not actually talking about it at all we

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
talk about self-love we talk about body

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.049 
talk about self-love we talk about body
acceptance<00:00:32.370> sometimes<00:00:33.370> we<00:00:33.579> talk<00:00:33.730> about<00:00:33.790> the

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
acceptance sometimes we talk about the

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.569 
acceptance sometimes we talk about the
obstacles<00:00:34.780> that<00:00:34.929> we<00:00:35.019> come<00:00:35.199> up<00:00:35.350> against<00:00:35.620> but<00:00:36.370> we

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
obstacles that we come up against but we

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:37.979 
obstacles that we come up against but we
don't<00:00:36.760> really<00:00:36.910> talk<00:00:37.179> about<00:00:37.239> what<00:00:37.690> recovery

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
don't really talk about what recovery

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.740 
don't really talk about what recovery
looks<00:00:38.559> and<00:00:38.769> feels<00:00:39.309> like<00:00:39.550> and<00:00:40.390> I<00:00:40.480> think<00:00:40.539> that

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
looks and feels like and I think that

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.740 
looks and feels like and I think that
leaves<00:00:41.079> a<00:00:41.230> lot<00:00:41.440> of<00:00:41.469> people<00:00:41.859> confused<00:00:42.399> so<00:00:43.390> it

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
leaves a lot of people confused so it

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.840 
leaves a lot of people confused so it
makes<00:00:43.989> sense<00:00:44.170> that<00:00:44.890> one<00:00:45.070> of<00:00:45.160> the<00:00:45.219> most<00:00:45.429> common

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
makes sense that one of the most common

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.849 
makes sense that one of the most common
questions<00:00:46.269> I<00:00:46.390> get<00:00:46.449> from<00:00:46.839> folks<00:00:47.050> is<00:00:47.260> just<00:00:47.620> that

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
questions I get from folks is just that

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.819 
questions I get from folks is just that
how<00:00:48.730> do<00:00:48.789> I<00:00:48.940> know<00:00:49.030> when<00:00:49.269> I'm<00:00:49.390> recovered<00:00:49.870> or<00:00:50.260> some

how do I know when I'm recovered or some

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.250 
how do I know when I'm recovered or some
variation<00:00:51.160> of<00:00:51.579> I<00:00:51.760> did<00:00:52.239> such<00:00:52.660> and<00:00:52.839> such<00:00:52.960> a<00:00:52.989> thing

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
variation of I did such and such a thing

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.380 
variation of I did such and such a thing
is<00:00:53.469> that<00:00:53.620> a<00:00:53.649> relapse<00:00:54.129> or<00:00:54.399> is<00:00:54.670> this<00:00:54.999> your<00:00:55.149> normal

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
is exactly perfectly normal one what is

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.130 
is exactly perfectly normal one what is
eating<00:01:24.340> disorder<00:01:24.640> recovery<00:01:24.689> first<00:01:25.689> we<00:01:25.930> need

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
eating disorder recovery first we need

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.319 
eating disorder recovery first we need
to<00:01:26.469> come<00:01:26.740> up<00:01:26.770> with<00:01:26.950> a<00:01:27.009> little<00:01:27.250> definition<00:01:27.820> of

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
to come up with a little definition of

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:29.969 
to come up with a little definition of
what<00:01:28.450> we're<00:01:28.600> talking<00:01:28.810> about<00:01:29.110> when<00:01:29.469> we<00:01:29.710> say

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
what we're talking about when we say

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.450 
what we're talking about when we say
eating<00:01:30.549> disorder<00:01:31.060> recovery<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:32.710> me<00:01:32.860> I<00:01:33.100> think

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
eating disorder recovery for me I think

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.060 
eating disorder recovery for me I think
of<00:01:33.820> eating<00:01:34.270> disorders<00:01:34.810> in<00:01:35.020> terms<00:01:35.289> of<00:01:35.590> engaging

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
of eating disorders in terms of engaging

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.359 
of eating disorders in terms of engaging
in<00:01:36.280> behavior<00:01:36.729> versus<00:01:37.180> practicing<00:01:37.780> recovery

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
in behavior versus practicing recovery

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.010 
in behavior versus practicing recovery
similarly<00:01:39.369> to<00:01:39.520> how<00:01:39.640> I<00:01:39.670> think<00:01:39.850> of<00:01:40.090> alcoholism

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
similarly to how I think of alcoholism

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.260 
similarly to how I think of alcoholism
in<00:01:41.170> terms<00:01:41.530> of<00:01:41.799> drinking<00:01:42.280> versus<00:01:42.729> practicing

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
in terms of drinking versus practicing

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.020 
in terms of drinking versus practicing
sobriety<00:01:43.630> in<00:01:44.020> both<00:01:44.560> cases<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.369> root<00:01:45.549> problem

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
sobriety in both cases the root problem

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.270 
sobriety in both cases the root problem
an<00:01:46.180> eating<00:01:46.420> disorder<00:01:46.509> or<00:01:46.960> addiction<00:01:47.500> are<00:01:48.039> not

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
an eating disorder or addiction are not

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.279 
an eating disorder or addiction are not
choices<00:01:48.640> they're<00:01:49.570> results<00:01:49.990> of<00:01:50.049> brain

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289

like to rid ourselves of the notion of
full<00:05:44.030> recovery<00:05:44.570> because<00:05:45.050> it<00:05:45.199> feels<00:05:45.470> too<00:05:45.710> close

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
full recovery because it feels too close

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.189 
full recovery because it feels too close

stop actively thinking about your ex but
that<00:06:00.680> doesn't<00:06:01.280> mean<00:06:01.490> that<00:06:01.520> you<00:06:01.699> don't<00:06:01.789> feel

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
that doesn't mean that you don't feel

or<00:06:08.270> affected<00:06:08.720> you<00:06:09.130> eating<00:06:10.130> disorders<00:06:10.520> were

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
or affected you eating disorders were

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.060 
or affected you eating disorders were
like<00:06:10.820> that<00:06:11.139> you<00:06:12.139> can<00:06:12.320> move<00:06:12.470> past<00:06:12.500> them<00:06:13.039> and

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
like that you can move past them and

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.790 
like that you can move past them and
toward<00:06:13.520> a<00:06:13.729> healthier<00:06:14.180> happier<00:06:14.479> you<00:06:14.750> and<00:06:15.199> that

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
toward a healthier happier you and that

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.920 
toward a healthier happier you and that
movement<00:06:16.130> is<00:06:16.550> constant<00:06:17.389> because<00:06:17.599> you're

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
movement is constant because you're

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.810 
movement is constant because you're
always<00:06:18.139> growing<00:06:18.530> always<00:06:18.830> evolving<00:06:19.669> and

always growing always evolving and

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.390 
always growing always evolving and
that's<00:06:20.360> why<00:06:20.659> recovery<00:06:21.169> is<00:06:21.349> a<00:06:21.380> journey<00:06:21.830> and<00:06:22.220> not

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
that's why recovery is a journey and not

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.469 
that's why recovery is a journey and not
a<00:06:22.460> destination

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
a destination

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.320 
a destination
because<00:06:24.520> self-actualization<00:06:25.520> is<00:06:25.760> something

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
because self-actualization is something

because self-actualization is something
