00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.480
 video tutorial I will teach you those 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:29.010
 people who miss 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.550
 the start button 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.890
 in windows 8 but it's not in the button 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.190
 classic start but it's going to be a 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.350
 metro style so well then 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.960
 you should mainly download this this 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.180
 program that then 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.480
 the link is below in the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.790
 description and then let's go to that link 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.250
 and then if he wants to disappear to this 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.430
 well these two pictures I'm saying that 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.720
 Well, here we have, we do not have him 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.720
 the start button 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.510
 then in the taskbar and then here in 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.970
 the other is already telling us that here 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.960
 is the start button and so with a 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.180
 metro style and good then here because 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.830
 because they are the systems requirements 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.080
 Well it can be to have windows 8 and then 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.390
 here for what for then to be able 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.960
 download it let's put our 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.560
 our mail 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.560
 mine 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.820
 to 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.320
 and then once we put it on 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.430
 We are gonna give 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.430
 who to download 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.260
 here is saying that thank you so much more 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.860
 and then we 're going to give you here where 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.870
 says go let's see that here and then 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.420
 automatically here we will be 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:04.370
 downloading and then as you see it does not weigh 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.370
 we open it so much 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.540
 and it is like any program 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.360
 that we have to install what is called 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.750
 be 8 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.240
 and then if we want next here we go 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.810
 treat the licenses that we see here 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.810
 all 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.960
 the following and that well then here 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.570
 next and then here 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.960
 they see us this came out and then here at 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.930
 we have to finish and then as you can see 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.650
 necessarily restart our 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.330
 computers 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.980
 I know what to wear 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.010
 here we have our start button 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.170
 it is shining and all beautiful asia 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.860
 and so 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.260
 let's see how 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.150
 Here we give you a click and then here 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.150
 we get the metro style 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.600
 here are all the applications that 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:12.130
 we have and then here the applications that 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.130
 we have in this part 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.890
 here and also 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:28.310
 and because they realized that 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:32.240
 we can enter the start menu that then 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.400
 simply to go to be then we 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.600
 the grid comes out and all that now 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.600
 we get the start button 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.930
 so we already have the him 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:50.049
 not be retro style 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.049
 the start button 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.180
 Metro style and equipment also search 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.390
 applications like 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.010
 I'm going in 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:05.090
 Here we appear 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:07.190
 here also all this disappears 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.900
 and good 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:15.610
 but to uninstall it hours 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.610
 gentlemen and let's go control panel 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.229
 to uninstall a program 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:26.120
 and then here we see you do not have to look for it 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.330
 here they are because it seems to install more 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.120
 We will take care of uninstall control 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.420
 programs and problems 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.510
 uninstall 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.569
 and here we give the same thing next but 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.580
 about this 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:44.050
 and who is saying that he is going to remove 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.729
 All this 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.729
 and then in this case 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.340
 here he asks us to restart but he gives 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.010
 plus 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.850
 now yes in this case if we have to 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.550
 restart why then we remove the 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.750
 start button and so finally have 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.930
 also our 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.169
 the start menu that then where all 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.770
 the block and Paul and all that 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.419

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.259
 are for people who want to have 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:22.710
 where I start but not the classic but the 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:24.469
 metro style and good this has been all 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.449
