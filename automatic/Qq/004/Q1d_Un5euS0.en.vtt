00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Prepare the pin punch out of the box if there is one 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Collect the tip of the pin punch and keep it 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.674
 Take the pin punch and unscrew the handle to remove it from the main pedestal 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:49.719
 Collect the previously placed tip and screw it onto the available thread on the tip of the handle 

00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:59.068
 Recover the main base and screw the handle in 

00:01:00.084 --> 00:01:05.000
 Put the pin punch in, then take your watch with a metal strap and turn it over 

00:01:07.406 --> 00:01:10.500
 Arrows engraved on the links should be apparent (They indicate the direction of extraction of the pins) 

00:01:11.194 --> 00:01:15.000
 Unscrew slightly the pin-punch handle to leave the space available to the bracelet on the main base 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.612
 Place the bracelet, arrows toward you on the main base of the pin punch 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.721
 Check that the tip is in the axis of the small hole that receives the pin and then screw the handle by pressing on the bracelet 

00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:28.721
 Unscrew the handle to allow you to handle the bracelet 

00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:33.700
 Take the bracelet in your hand then catch the pin with your fingers 

00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:36.600
 Put it apart and separate the 2 separate parts of the watch band 

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:43.591
 Place the watch on the wristband to completely remove the link (we have just removed the clip from the clasp) 

00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:55.635
 And repeat the previous action (01:20) 

00:01:57.635 --> 00:02:02.343
 You have just fully detached a link! 

00:02:03.914 --> 00:02:12.213
 Recompose the link by reinserting the pin without force in the hole And keep the link carefully 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.206
 Gather the 2 loose parts of the bracelet together 

00:02:17.206 --> 00:02:38.396
 Reinstall the pin in the opposite direction of the arrows engraved on the underside of the bracelet Take care that the pin joins the 2 parts of the bracelet 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.234
 Place the bracelet on the edge in the groove on the pin punch. Check the pin insertion pin! 

00:02:51.234 --> 00:02:54.016
 Bring a small watchmaker's hammer or a small classic hammer 

00:02:55.243 --> 00:03:02.709
 Tap lightly and straight on the pin while holding the bracelet closed Your hammer must be no more than 2 cm above the pin 

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:10.645
