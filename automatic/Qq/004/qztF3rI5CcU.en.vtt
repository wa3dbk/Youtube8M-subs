00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.580
 friends let's take out the spark plugs 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:10.290
 let's see how it is and right now I'm going 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.990
 to teach the joints that are ruined 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.590
 that go on the bottom to take out the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.420
 tubes that are filled with oil 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.510
 true 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.350
 let's take out the spark plug number 1 if 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.350
 you see her 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.850
 the central electrode is well it looks 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.820
 rare by the washing of injectors the 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.060
 cinnamon color is very is in perfect 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.300
 state has not caused any problem 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.610
 we'll see 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.610
 how is the pottery 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.810
 it is good to know 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.780
 that if you see that there 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:56.760
 jumped the current is not right let's go 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.760
 to proceed to the next spark plug 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.670
 let's take out the spark plug number 2 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:12.250
 because I use this unarmed with a 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.710
 tip is that it is very easy to take 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.720
 well the spark plugs is 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.670
 unlikely that it will harm a 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.210
 rope and the hot ones are 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.670
 spark plugs and so we do not put our hands 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:29.480
 you in the central electrode is 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:33.140
 good has cinnamon color 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.120
 we have no apparent damage we are going to 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.680
 see the pottery 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.200
 if the spark plug has not jumped 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.390
 you can not see that it has shone through the city 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.140
 mica the stream 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:52.650
 be in good condition be normal wear 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.650
 the spark plug we go to number 3 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.460
 social number 3 let's get it out 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.290
 let's see always check the 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.020
 spark plugs because it certainly does not tell them 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.780
 hey it has been damaged it has not always been damaged 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.290
 ask is there any flaw in particular 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.310
 something in the tuning because like that 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.310
 we deliver the vehicle better
