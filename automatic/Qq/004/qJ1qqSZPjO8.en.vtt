00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.210
 hello you're here at the studio mac there 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.519
 shines announced alex grant side and the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.860
 police by and nothing to do that will do 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.400
 because what would be out of season 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.230
 because we have some 6 in the off 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.289
 season is a very good time for 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.800
 build a muscle bar including kevin 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.750
 bacon had warned us that replay 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.269
 fossil higueras of them take 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.190
 saved immigrants for example however the 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.989
 clear redhead strong enough for her this 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.000
 is not all workouts that's it 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.559
 will do we want to correct which you 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.750
 go see that a lot of exercises are 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.940
 unilateral in it's only a 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.520
 side in three parts correcting 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.950
 muscular asymmetries after having and 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.890
 we want to strengthen in strengthening 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.050
 also a lot at the trunk level 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.860
 trunk that is going to be an essential 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.100
 it's the basis if we imagine foundations 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.800
 of houses its foundation and sieves the pv 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.560
 the house on to progress in 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.630
 place the trunks after the shower 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.880
 to children it's a stable base on 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.350
 which we ends can 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.509
 retreat 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.220
 so today we will look together 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.349
 a few circuits that I have you 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.050
 prepared for runners to bedding a 

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:27.929
 do the hello I advise to do two 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.910
 to three times a week so a 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.970
 day of rest between each time for 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.010
 moment we risk strengthening and 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.140
 I suggest three sets of drawings 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.190
 repetitions we work by coming back on 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.020
 this base or three second minute series which 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.850
 is pretty much the equivalent so 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.300
 other things that we can think 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.690
 during their season the volume decreases 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.130
 drive in his short sale 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.890
 between two things you say 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.270
 flexibility trottine may have thought 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.230
 to do a yoga class that will you 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.780
 have a lot at the level of the 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.570
 performance and after injuries and 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.790
 with him did in the movement and in 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.399
 some are also what we do the 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.869
 retrospective of our season we want 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.930
 new goals for the next 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.430
 season that is said and finally it's 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.590
 mental that we can work on the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.030
 technique or a sport that is a bit 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.190
 faithful to remove all learn on 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.050
 history or such canton hoping waits 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.050
 so see if the exercises 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.970
 so the slit and serves form 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.040
 we will work blow at the level of a 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.390
 leg so one leg in the end she 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.489
 really treats why I have 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.050
 asymmetries so we will come to take each other 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.050
 a bit like this one I walk in front of 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.030
 I make a fantasia never raised 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.310
 the opposite corner like this compared to 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.040
 every three-four malaysia I come 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.900
 ride on arches and managers 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.200
 eat us like this one like a 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.670
 format as a gift level of dribbling 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.400
 technical for years without that 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.120
 this one by marriage 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.690
 we go up on the sunbed is actually 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.690
 a concept 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.110
 this is the torah we will finally lead despite 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.170
 his accomplices had created height of 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.810
 hips tomorrow night I'm going to pick myself up 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.180
 the assets in menopause and my 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.580
 leg that articulates in that same side of 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.770
 even hazan who on the ground I do not have to change the 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.980
 back leg we'll see when this one 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.020
 is never removed the elastic towards me 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.570
 following the gem according to the 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.700
 expectations these are felt too 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.420
 we want to bring back the shoulder blades to 100 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.730
 miles an hour 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.250
 so we really want the retraction on 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:49.980
 will take the elbow dam board cjb 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.540
 employment so very good exercise for 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.870
 also works stabilized at this 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.870
 balanced 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.580
 we will come ex place in full position 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.170
 of things in berlin as you can 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.120
 I see a rubber band around 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.470
 cottages to work the fact so 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.600
 classic means without loving it it's 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.820
 very important at the qos and 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.330
 industry level is also expecting 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.970
 musks can be strengthened as 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.400
 this one is made to me as we laughed 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.860
 board on the bench I will come 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.200
 drop off monday on the east coast I 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.420
 recalls my bed on the balan I lay 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.640
 the foot on their side and I bring it back on 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.830
 the bar and the forbidden future like that 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.130
 it then to the woman the child would 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.070
 level 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.150
 the screen stabilization but there is the 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.150
 level of this little manifesto 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.890
 action and extension of the equilibrium rate 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.290
 we'll take the pea like this 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.480
 and put it in a frog position 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.420
 their parents I 'm going to the best success 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.100
 but count celis st bo and I admire under 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.990
 coats by putting the ch is 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.940
 the attraction of the very short chords of 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.490
 each side like this here I hope we 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.950
 will have the 55- second mark at 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.080
 challenge the Hebrew is run by the same 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.940
 thing at the back extension and 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.990
 also to be at his game that was 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.990
 bad work on the back 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.270
 for the next valley of marne sa 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.400
 closes an exercise to fetch 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.350
 of effector you will fetch and we 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.300
 will fight the clothes that music 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.340
 seemed gone for a width of 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.290
 grove as the rotation in triathlon 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.390
 so I started when this one makes 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.550
 a podium at the games and which is the most 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.440
 wide that the position would you even 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.540
 wider than the shoulders the sea 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.120
 next December we are raised like 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.860
 answer each other and I bring back the money and I 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.810
 go to their advisers 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.760
 chances of their youth side to giant 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.500
 but the money on the account and I had 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.500
 my agent and I buzzer 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:59.199
 next step presto stabilization 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:01.120
 on the ball so it's a good exercise 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:03.069
 to work at the pectoral level 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.599
 shoulders again we have them 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:06.610
 looking for a girl born of audi who are 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:08.620

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:17.259
 that's it my daughter 1400 road ever 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:19.449
 take power like this but 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:21.580
 think inside positions 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:23.499
 probable and to our brothers like this one 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.779

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:33.270
 objects we bring hugo chavez 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:37.210
