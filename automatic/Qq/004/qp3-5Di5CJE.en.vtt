00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.560 
half slab which is on the top of a block
for<00:01:19.679> example<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:20.429> I<00:01:20.820> place<00:01:21.090> down<00:01:22.009> some<00:01:23.009> stone

for example if I place down some stone
like<00:01:24.570> one<00:01:25.229> two<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:26.039> you<00:01:26.280> place<00:01:26.579> it<00:01:26.609> on<00:01:27.119> level

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
like one two if you place it on level

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.590 
like one two if you place it on level
with<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.049> they<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:28.829> also<00:01:29.130> burn<00:01:29.520> as<00:01:29.789> well<00:01:30.119> but

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
with this they can also burn as well but

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.539 
with this they can also burn as well but
again<00:01:30.929> if<00:01:31.109> I<00:01:31.229> break<00:01:31.469> this<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.039> grab<00:01:32.189> into<00:01:32.399> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
again if I break this and grab into the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.270 
again if I break this and grab into the
half<00:01:32.759> slab<00:01:33.090> like<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.929> one<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.590> place<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.159> on

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
half slab like this one and place it on

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.880 
half slab like this one and place it on
level<00:01:35.429> with<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> bottom<00:01:35.850> one<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.289> they

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
level with the bottom one like this they

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.099 
level with the bottom one like this they
were<00:01:37.950> then<00:01:38.280> not<00:01:38.700> there<00:01:38.999> at<00:01:39.329> all<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.990> is

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
were then not there at all so it is

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:41.419 
were then not there at all so it is
really<00:01:40.380> something<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.859> if<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.219> want<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
really something that if you want to

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.069 
really something that if you want to
have<00:01:41.520> your<00:01:41.640> own<00:01:41.789> pet<00:01:42.030> zombie<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.539> can<00:01:42.749> do<00:01:42.929> that

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
have your own pet zombie you can do that

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.959 
have your own pet zombie you can do that
I<00:01:43.109> think<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.619> cool<00:01:43.829> feature<00:01:44.100> if<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.819> want

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
I think it's a cool feature if you want

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:46.520 
I think it's a cool feature if you want
to<00:01:45.030> keep<00:01:45.179> them<00:01:45.359> from<00:01:45.539> burning<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:46.109> daylight

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530

sure<00:01:51.179> to<00:01:51.329> do<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.719> one<00:01:51.899> I'm<00:01:52.020> pretty<00:01:52.139> sure<00:01:52.350> a

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
sure to do that one I'm pretty sure a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.629 
sure to do that one I'm pretty sure a
lot<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.590> people<00:01:52.740> don't<00:01:53.039> know<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.340> one

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:53.639 
lot of people don't know that one

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:55.639 
lot of people don't know that one
but<00:01:53.880> guess<00:01:54.030> what<00:01:54.270> now<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.719> do<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.229> moving<00:01:55.499> on

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
but guess what now you do so moving on

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.169 
but guess what now you do so moving on
from<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.950> one<00:01:56.159> we're<00:01:56.520> gonna<00:01:56.579> be<00:01:56.700> focusing<00:01:57.060> on

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
from that one we're gonna be focusing on

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.609 
from that one we're gonna be focusing on
something<00:01:57.450> which<00:01:57.780> I'm<00:01:57.929> pretty<00:01:58.079> sure<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.469> lot<00:01:58.499> of

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
something which I'm pretty sure a lot of

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.370 
something which I'm pretty sure a lot of
people<00:01:59.009> do<00:01:59.249> know<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.819> that<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.329> if<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.749> grab<00:02:01.109> a

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
people do know and that is if you grab a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.459 
people do know and that is if you grab a
minecart<00:02:02.069> you<00:02:02.729> grab<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.149> saddle<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:04.170> grab

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
minecart you grab a saddle and you grab

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.150 
minecart you grab a saddle and you grab
a<00:02:04.679> pig<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.369> place<00:02:06.240> them<00:02:06.509> inside<00:02:06.929> a<00:02:07.259> minecart

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
a pig and place them inside a minecart

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.669 
a pig and place them inside a minecart
like<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.789> as<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.840> see<00:02:09.899> they<00:02:10.110> go<00:02:10.289> round<00:02:10.440> on

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
like so as you can see they go round on

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.990 
like so as you can see they go round on
their<00:02:10.830> own<00:02:11.009> but<00:02:11.160> they<00:02:11.220> will<00:02:11.430> eventually<00:02:11.610> come

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
their own but they will eventually come

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.570 
their own but they will eventually come
to<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.420> stop<00:02:12.750> now<00:02:13.260> if<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.470> place<00:02:13.740> a<00:02:13.980> saddle<00:02:14.460> on

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
like so again you can't climb over this

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.060 
like so again you can't climb over this
fence<00:02:51.240> naturally<00:02:51.870> so<00:02:52.260> if<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.410> place<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.620> carpet

fence naturally so if you place a carpet
on<00:02:53.160> top<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.700> can<00:02:53.820> then<00:02:54.030> get<00:02:54.180> over<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.570> again

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
on top you can then get over it again

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.949 
on top you can then get over it again
never<00:02:55.920> fence<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.370> can't<00:02:56.610> get<00:02:56.760> over<00:02:57.060> with<00:02:57.690> a

carpet on top you can get over so I'm

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.770 
carpet on top you can get over so I'm
just<00:02:59.820> gonna<00:02:59.910> quickly<00:03:00.209> show<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.540> an<00:03:00.690> example

color would be let me just make some

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.440 
color would be let me just make some
space<00:03:31.170> here<00:03:31.500> like<00:03:32.100> one<00:03:32.630> two<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:34.940> three<00:03:35.940> you

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
space here like one two and three you

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.210 
space here like one two and three you
can<00:03:36.600> climb<00:03:36.750> over<00:03:36.989> them<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.320> get<00:03:37.440> inside<00:03:37.800> kill

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
can climb over them and get inside kill

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.650 
can climb over them and get inside kill
them<00:03:38.430> get<00:03:38.640> your<00:03:38.760> stuff<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.150> leave<00:03:39.360> without

them get your stuff and leave without
any<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:39.959> them<00:03:40.050> leaving<00:03:40.290> this<00:03:40.590> means<00:03:40.830> that<00:03:40.920> you

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
any of them leaving this means that you

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.910 
any of them leaving this means that you
don't<00:03:41.250> have<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.580> have<00:03:41.790> any<00:03:42.260> open<00:03:43.260> gates<00:03:43.500> at<00:03:43.739> all

still<00:04:42.029> grow<00:04:42.270> with<00:04:42.509> the<00:04:42.689> meal<00:04:43.020> so<00:04:43.199> if<00:04:43.259> I<00:04:43.319> grab

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:43.379 
still grow with the meal so if I grab

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:46.309 
still grow with the meal so if I grab
some<00:04:43.740> bone<00:04:44.009> meal<00:04:44.279> like<00:04:45.029> this<00:04:45.330> these<00:04:45.959> will<00:04:46.139> grow

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319 
some bone meal like this these will grow

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.079 
some bone meal like this these will grow
next<00:04:46.770> to<00:04:46.979> each<00:04:47.069> other<00:04:47.309> no<00:04:47.669> matter<00:04:47.759> how<00:04:47.999> many

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:48.089 
next to each other no matter how many

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:49.820 
next to each other no matter how many
times<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:48.509> do<00:04:48.809> it<00:04:48.959> they<00:04:49.110> will<00:04:49.259> grow<00:04:49.409> next<00:04:49.619> to

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
times you do it they will grow next to

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.249 
times you do it they will grow next to
each<00:04:49.949> other<00:04:50.189> while<00:04:50.969> the<00:04:51.089> other<00:04:51.270> type<00:04:51.659> of<00:04:51.689> em

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
each other while the other type of em

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.790 
each other while the other type of em
trees<00:04:52.679> such<00:04:53.039> as<00:04:53.279> spruce<00:04:53.719> such<00:04:54.719> as<00:04:54.990> bears<00:04:55.499> and

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
trees such as spruce such as bears and

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.769 
trees such as spruce such as bears and
others<00:04:56.129> you<00:04:56.610> can<00:04:56.729> only<00:04:56.909> grow<00:04:57.149> it<00:04:57.360> grow<00:04:57.509> one<00:04:57.689> at

00:04:57.769 --> 00:04:57.779 
others you can only grow it grow one at

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:59.059 
others you can only grow it grow one at
a<00:04:57.839> time<00:04:58.020> if<00:04:58.169> you<00:04:58.229> constantly<00:04:58.679> try<00:04:58.889> and<00:04:58.919> grow

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
a time if you constantly try and grow

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:00.559 
a time if you constantly try and grow
this<00:04:59.219> one<00:04:59.429> it<00:04:59.580> will<00:04:59.729> not<00:04:59.939> grow<00:05:00.149> they<00:05:00.360> need<00:05:00.509> to

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
this one it will not grow they need to

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:02.600 
this one it will not grow they need to
have<00:05:00.659> a<00:05:00.719> space<00:05:01.050> of<00:05:01.289> two<00:05:01.529> which<00:05:02.009> means<00:05:02.249> I<00:05:02.459> can

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
have a space of two which means I can

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.299 
have a space of two which means I can
only<00:05:02.729> place<00:05:02.969> this<00:05:03.240> one<00:05:03.599> sorry<00:05:04.259> this<00:05:04.499> one<00:05:04.769> here

00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:05.309 
only place this one sorry this one here

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:07.129 
only place this one sorry this one here
and<00:05:05.610> then<00:05:06.179> they<00:05:06.269> can<00:05:06.300> then<00:05:06.599> grow<00:05:06.779> so<00:05:06.839> you<00:05:06.959> have

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
and then they can then grow so you have

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.159 
and then they can then grow so you have
to<00:05:07.259> have<00:05:07.349> a<00:05:07.439> gap<00:05:07.769> of<00:05:07.949> two<00:05:08.159> is<00:05:08.219> the<00:05:08.339> same<00:05:08.580> for

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
to have a gap of two is the same for

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.049 
to have a gap of two is the same for
spruce<00:05:10.169> and<00:05:10.469> all<00:05:10.679> the<00:05:10.769> types<00:05:10.979> of<00:05:11.129> wool<00:05:11.339> at<00:05:11.729> wood

00:05:12.049 --> 00:05:12.059 
spruce and all the types of wool at wood

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:14.239 
spruce and all the types of wool at wood
as<00:05:12.330> well<00:05:12.749> and<00:05:13.199> now<00:05:13.379> moving<00:05:13.589> on<00:05:13.740> to<00:05:13.919> this<00:05:14.039> one

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:14.249 
as well and now moving on to this one

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:15.769 
as well and now moving on to this one
this<00:05:14.399> is<00:05:14.550> a<00:05:14.580> really<00:05:14.909> cool<00:05:15.029> feature<00:05:15.269> that<00:05:15.419> I<00:05:15.569> had

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:15.779 
this is a really cool feature that I had

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:18.529 
this is a really cool feature that I had
to<00:05:15.959> check<00:05:16.499> out<00:05:16.679> for<00:05:16.860> myself<00:05:17.309> and<00:05:17.550> that<00:05:17.879> is<00:05:18.149> if

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
to check out for myself and that is if

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.389 
to check out for myself and that is if
you<00:05:18.719> grab<00:05:19.019> a<00:05:19.259> bucket<00:05:19.649> of<00:05:19.769> lava<00:05:20.009> in<00:05:20.309> the

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:20.399 
you grab a bucket of lava in the

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:25.219 
you grab a bucket of lava in the
overworld<00:05:21.029> and<00:05:21.300> place<00:05:21.839> it<00:05:22.080> down<00:05:23.149> say<00:05:24.149> here<00:05:24.509> the

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
overworld and place it down say here the

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:26.899 
overworld and place it down say here the
actual<00:05:25.499> lava<00:05:25.740> will<00:05:26.039> only<00:05:26.219> go<00:05:26.519> three<00:05:26.879> blocks

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
actual lava will only go three blocks

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.759 
actual lava will only go three blocks
now<00:05:27.689> we're<00:05:27.809> going<00:05:27.899> to<00:05:27.959> have<00:05:28.139> to<00:05:28.259> go<00:05:28.379> to<00:05:28.439> the<00:05:28.589> end

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:28.769 
now we're going to have to go to the end

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:30.379 
now we're going to have to go to the end
for<00:05:28.979> this<00:05:29.099> one<00:05:29.249> as<00:05:29.399> you<00:05:29.550> can<00:05:29.610> see<00:05:29.729> if<00:05:29.999> I<00:05:30.089> grab

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
for this one as you can see if I grab

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.499 
for this one as you can see if I grab
some<00:05:30.689> stone<00:05:31.050> it<00:05:31.379> will<00:05:31.709> only<00:05:31.889> go<00:05:32.249> one<00:05:32.879> two<00:05:33.479> and

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:33.509 
some stone it will only go one two and

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.170 
some stone it will only go one two and
three<00:05:34.079> one<00:05:34.619> two<00:05:35.099> three<00:05:35.129> from<00:05:35.759> the<00:05:35.909> source

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
three one two three from the source

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.350 
three one two three from the source
block<00:05:36.449> now<00:05:37.019> if<00:05:37.110> we<00:05:37.259> go<00:05:37.559> in<00:05:38.129> to<00:05:38.819> the<00:05:38.939> nether<00:05:39.149> I'm

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
block now if we go in to the nether I'm

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.850 
block now if we go in to the nether I'm
going<00:05:39.509> to<00:05:39.569> show<00:05:39.749> you<00:05:39.809> that<00:05:40.139> the<00:05:40.319> actual<00:05:40.619> nether

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
going to show you that the actual nether

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.889 
going to show you that the actual nether
if<00:05:41.219> you<00:05:41.339> place<00:05:41.519> it<00:05:41.669> down<00:05:41.699> on<00:05:41.849> netherrack<00:05:42.389> they

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:42.899 
if you place it down on netherrack they

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:45.980 
if you place it down on netherrack they
will<00:05:43.079> go<00:05:43.319> a<00:05:43.349> distance<00:05:44.039> of<00:05:44.339> seven<00:05:44.879> now<00:05:45.689> if<00:05:45.869> you

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
will go a distance of seven now if you

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.239 
will go a distance of seven now if you
place<00:05:46.199> down<00:05:46.379> their<00:05:46.559> rack<00:05:46.740> in<00:05:46.889> the<00:05:46.979> overworld

00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:47.249 
place down their rack in the overworld

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:48.949 
place down their rack in the overworld
it<00:05:47.459> still<00:05:47.669> only<00:05:47.879> goes<00:05:48.119> three<00:05:48.509> so<00:05:48.689> this<00:05:48.839> is<00:05:48.930> a

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:48.959 
it still only goes three so this is a

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:50.480 
it still only goes three so this is a
really<00:05:49.229> unique<00:05:49.499> one<00:05:49.889> that<00:05:50.039> I<00:05:50.099> thought<00:05:50.369> a<00:05:50.399> lot

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
really unique one that I thought a lot

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.639 
really unique one that I thought a lot
of<00:05:50.610> people<00:05:50.909> should<00:05:51.089> know<00:05:51.360> so<00:05:51.569> this<00:05:51.809> is<00:05:51.959> why<00:05:52.110> you

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:52.649 
of people should know so this is why you

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:54.619 
of people should know so this is why you
have<00:05:52.919> to<00:05:52.949> be<00:05:53.189> careful<00:05:53.579> be<00:05:53.999> careful<00:05:54.029> in<00:05:54.539> the

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:54.629 
have to be careful be careful in the

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:56.420 
have to be careful be careful in the
nether<00:05:54.839> because<00:05:55.199> it<00:05:55.319> is<00:05:55.439> dangerous<00:05:55.919> and<00:05:56.099> it

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
nether because it is dangerous and it

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.699 
nether because it is dangerous and it
causes<00:05:56.789> trouble<00:05:56.939> so<00:05:57.300> let's<00:05:57.449> make<00:05:57.629> a<00:05:57.659> big<00:05:58.409> gap

00:05:58.699 --> 00:05:58.709 
causes trouble so let's make a big gap

00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:00.949 
causes trouble so let's make a big gap
let's<00:05:59.009> try<00:05:59.219> and<00:05:59.339> find<00:05:59.550> someplace<00:05:59.819> to<00:06:00.029> go<00:06:00.419> that

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:00.959 
let's try and find someplace to go that

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:02.779 
let's try and find someplace to go that
we<00:06:01.079> can<00:06:01.259> go<00:06:01.469> so<00:06:01.740> if<00:06:01.860> we<00:06:01.979> break<00:06:02.189> some<00:06:02.610> of<00:06:02.639> these

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
we can go so if we break some of these

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:06.109 
we can go so if we break some of these
let's<00:06:03.599> just<00:06:03.749> do<00:06:03.899> this<00:06:04.550> we're<00:06:05.550> next<00:06:05.699> to<00:06:05.819> a<00:06:05.879> guy

00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:06.119 
let's just do this we're next to a guy

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:08.569 
let's just do this we're next to a guy
who<00:06:06.179> is<00:06:06.419> loud<00:06:06.629> as<00:06:06.929> hell<00:06:07.110> place<00:06:08.039> these<00:06:08.279> down<00:06:08.550> so

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:08.579 
who is loud as hell place these down so

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:11.389 
who is loud as hell place these down so
if<00:06:08.879> we<00:06:08.939> place<00:06:09.149> down<00:06:09.389> I<00:06:10.019> place<00:06:10.679> it<00:06:10.800> about<00:06:10.979> here

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:11.399 
if we place down I place it about here

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:13.489 
if we place down I place it about here
watch<00:06:12.059> how<00:06:12.300> many<00:06:12.360> blocks<00:06:12.689> in<00:06:12.990> the<00:06:13.110> distance

00:06:13.489 --> 00:06:13.499 
watch how many blocks in the distance

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:15.559 
watch how many blocks in the distance
that<00:06:13.679> this<00:06:13.919> does<00:06:14.159> go<00:06:14.399> it<00:06:14.610> goes<00:06:14.789> more<00:06:15.149> and<00:06:15.479> more

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:15.569 
that this does go it goes more and more

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:17.779 
that this does go it goes more and more
and<00:06:16.259> more<00:06:16.319> and<00:06:16.740> more<00:06:16.949> compared<00:06:17.459> to<00:06:17.579> what<00:06:17.699> we

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:17.789 
and more and more compared to what we

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:19.969 
and more and more compared to what we
did<00:06:17.969> in<00:06:18.029> the<00:06:18.269> other<00:06:18.329> world<00:06:18.589> so<00:06:19.589> as<00:06:19.679> you<00:06:19.800> can<00:06:19.919> see

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
did in the other world so as you can see

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.869 
did in the other world so as you can see
there<00:06:20.339> we've<00:06:20.789> gone<00:06:21.059> one<00:06:21.539> two<00:06:22.169> three<00:06:22.889> four<00:06:23.339> five

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:23.879 
there we've gone one two three four five

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:26.209 
there we've gone one two three four five
six<00:06:24.449> and<00:06:24.779> again<00:06:24.839> it<00:06:25.139> should<00:06:25.319> go<00:06:25.439> one<00:06:25.649> more<00:06:25.889> here

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:26.219 
six and again it should go one more here

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.949 
six and again it should go one more here
seven<00:06:26.849> and<00:06:26.999> it<00:06:27.089> won't<00:06:27.209> go<00:06:27.300> any<00:06:27.479> further<00:06:27.539> that

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:27.959 
seven and it won't go any further that

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:30.319 
seven and it won't go any further that
is<00:06:28.199> exactly<00:06:28.679> the<00:06:28.860> same<00:06:29.069> all<00:06:29.519> around<00:06:29.759> so<00:06:30.209> this

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:30.329 
is exactly the same all around so this

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:31.549 
is exactly the same all around so this
is<00:06:30.449> why<00:06:30.569> you<00:06:30.629> have<00:06:30.869> to<00:06:30.990> be<00:06:31.079> careful<00:06:31.409> with<00:06:31.499> a

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:31.559 
is why you have to be careful with a

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:33.709 
is why you have to be careful with a
bucket<00:06:31.860> of<00:06:31.979> lava<00:06:32.159> or<00:06:32.519> any<00:06:32.729> type<00:06:32.999> of<00:06:33.029> lava<00:06:33.389> in

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:33.719 
bucket of lava or any type of lava in

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:35.659 
bucket of lava or any type of lava in
the<00:06:33.779> Nerva<00:06:34.289> if<00:06:34.499> you<00:06:34.559> can<00:06:34.709> see<00:06:34.800> coming<00:06:35.069> down<00:06:35.189> get

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:35.669 
the Nerva if you can see coming down get

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:36.679 
the Nerva if you can see coming down get
away<00:06:35.879> from<00:06:35.939> it<00:06:36.209> because<00:06:36.269> it<00:06:36.479> will

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:36.689 
away from it because it will

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:38.929 
away from it because it will
spread<00:06:36.959> by<00:06:37.409> a<00:06:37.439> distance<00:06:38.159> of<00:06:38.339> seven<00:06:38.669> so<00:06:38.789> yeah

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:38.939 
spread by a distance of seven so yeah

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:40.129 
spread by a distance of seven so yeah
there's<00:06:39.149> some<00:06:39.299> fun<00:06:39.479> facts<00:06:39.749> that<00:06:39.899> you<00:06:39.989> probably
