a cup of flour what we just made is a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.070 
a cup of flour what we just made is a
homogeneous<00:01:38.280> mixture<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:39.270> means<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.840> you

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
homogeneous mixture this means that you

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.170 
homogeneous mixture this means that you
cannot<00:01:40.470> see<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> difference<00:01:41.280> between<00:01:41.460> all

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
cannot see the difference between all

cannot see the difference between all
the<00:01:42.330> elements<00:01:42.570> inside<00:01:44.210> now<00:01:45.290> makes<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.710> with

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the elements inside now makes the a with

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.590 
the elements inside now makes the a with
the<00:01:47.370> milk<00:01:52.670> it's<00:01:53.670> only<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.880> very<00:01:54.090> little<00:01:54.300> bit<00:01:54.510> of

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the milk it's only a very little bit of

the milk it's only a very little bit of

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.700 

this<00:02:01.340> is<00:02:01.549> a<00:02:01.670> heterogeneous<00:02:01.940> mixture<00:02:02.840> this<00:02:03.560> is

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
this is a heterogeneous mixture this is

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.080 
this is a heterogeneous mixture this is
because<00:02:04.010> we<00:02:04.250> can<00:02:04.369> see<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.640> difference

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
because we can see the difference

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.330 
because we can see the difference
between<00:02:05.270> two<00:02:05.720> elements<00:02:06.380> or<00:02:06.530> compounds<00:02:07.220> inside

between two elements or compounds inside

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.710 
between two elements or compounds inside
but<00:02:10.340> once<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:10.670> mix<00:02:10.850> it<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.390> becomes

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
but once you mix it it becomes

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.320 
but once you mix it it becomes
homogeneous<00:02:12.319> mixture<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:13.610> just<00:02:13.910> can't<00:02:14.120> see

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
homogeneous mixture you just can't see

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.920 
homogeneous mixture you just can't see
the<00:02:14.450> difference<00:02:14.750> between<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.140> two<00:02:15.290> officers

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
the difference between the two officers

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.010 
the difference between the two officers
now<00:02:17.930> take<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.130> chicken<00:02:19.569> dip<00:02:20.569> it<00:02:20.720> in<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.840> egg

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
now take the chicken dip it in the egg

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:33.040 
now take the chicken dip it in the egg
and<00:02:22.510> dip<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.660> in<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.780> breading

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.250 

before<00:02:33.770> you<00:02:33.860> start<00:02:34.000> set<00:02:35.000> your<00:02:35.120> stove<00:02:35.480> to

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
before you start set your stove to

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.660 
before you start set your stove to
medium<00:02:36.530> high<00:02:36.890> temperature<00:02:37.810> add<00:02:38.810> oil<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:40.250> the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
medium high temperature add oil to the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.950 
medium high temperature add oil to the
pan

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:59.580 

let's<00:02:47.920> fry<00:02:48.280> some<00:02:48.970> chicken

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.119 

candido<00:03:02.170> an<00:03:03.170> important<00:03:03.739> thing<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:04.010> remember

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
candido an important thing to remember

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.789 
candido an important thing to remember
is<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.819> while<00:03:05.569> you<00:03:05.720> are<00:03:05.840> frying<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.769> chicken

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
is that while you are frying the chicken

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.360 
is that while you are frying the chicken
the<00:03:07.790> chicken<00:03:08.239> will<00:03:08.450> be<00:03:08.480> undergoing<00:03:09.370> chemical

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
the chicken will be undergoing chemical

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.610 
the chicken will be undergoing chemical
and<00:03:10.549> physical<00:03:10.970> changes<00:03:11.599> but<00:03:12.200> we<00:03:12.290> will<00:03:12.409> talk

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
and physical changes but we will talk

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.220 
and physical changes but we will talk
about<00:03:12.739> those<00:03:12.950> later<00:03:16.690> now<00:03:17.690> let's<00:03:17.959> talk<00:03:18.170> about

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
about those later now let's talk about

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.940 
about those later now let's talk about
