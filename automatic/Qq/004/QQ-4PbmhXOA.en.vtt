00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.460
 hello dear is already craft Thursday but 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.070
 before I wanted to tell you to create a 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.110
 instagram where will be uploading a 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.120
 little bit of photos of everything that goes to 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.360
 go by and we can meet a little 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.280
 plus 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.760
 and also so that you can send me 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.500
 photos out there and so on so I leave you 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.080
 in the links in the description of 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.210
 video and what I want to show you today is 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.510
 to make a porfa card that opens 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.700
 in 360 degrees and it's super easy to do 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.880
 and you can customize it for any 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.880
 occasion and the materials you consider them 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.060
 super easy so let's see how it 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.060
 make 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.300
 we will use four 18- card 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.300
 centimeters x 15 centimeters 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:24.690
 a card of 10 centimeters x 10 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:26.720
 centimeters ruler pencil scissors and 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.720
 glue 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.060
 we will take one of the cards of 18 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.280
 centimeters by 15 and we will double it by 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.490
 half of the longest side 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.189
 then we will open 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.189
 and we will begin to decorate with more 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.690
 like it and in this case I'm using a 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.330
 pair of cuts 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.880
 and paste a piece of cardboard to put together 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.340
 a little bit for it they just take a land 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.200
 and double it in half 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.360
 then I act them a single pass on the sides 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.140
 and now I'm hitting it at an angle 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.140
 90 degrees 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.860
 If you want to learn a little more about 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.950
 pop up tv with the description of the video 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.490
 a couple of videos that can help you and 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.040
 Well then I asked for a couple of cuts to 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.860
 make the balloons and ready 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.230
 I finished my first card then 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.290
 we will do the same with the other three that 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.320
 we are missing them we will fold them in half and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.720
 we will begin to decorate as you can see 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.700
 use everything you have at hand and 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.690
 it already depends for the occasion when the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.300
 go to give 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.990
 and as here you can apply the technique 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.440
 of pop 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.280
 or just paste a couple of cuts or 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.280
 write something 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.439
 and when you have ready the four 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.290
 cards we will take the card of 10 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:56.260
 centimeters by 10 centimeters and we will do 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.770
 marks from the edge inwards of 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.900
 half centimeter 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.900
 this we will do in all the edges 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.080
 you must have eight marks in the end what 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.860
 we will say these marks with those on your side 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.860
 contrary 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:17.549
 and there should be a contour of half 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.590
 centimeter now we will join the end 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.049
 upper left with the end 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.530
 lower right that should remain a 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.530
 diagonal line 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.950
 then we will cut the corners of this 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.190
 way 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.580
 and then by the diagonal line that passes 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.580
 In the center 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.430
 and we will double by the lines that we 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:45.110
 these are the flaps and 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.110
 last you will fold in this way 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.390
 now this will be for the floor you choose 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.010
 If you want to put it or not 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.410
 as you see, you just have to paste the 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.410
 flaps at the ends of the card 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.500
 and when you put this piece you can generate 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:11.900
 maps like the ones I'm doing 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.650
 and when you have everything ready when we give 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:18.140
 fame on one of the outer faces and 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.100
 we will stick the next card and so 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.100
 up to the end 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.069
 and do not forget to decorate the cover 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.180
 and as you saw it is super easy to do and 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.820
 You can customize it for any 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.680
 kind of occasion now you have to create it to 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.060
 you and send me photos with the networks 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.040

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.200
