00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.429 
and now I found it I'm so here's a
standard<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.780> I'll<00:01:30.900> go<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.259> quickly

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
standard one and I'll go and quickly

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.010 
standard one and I'll go and quickly
show<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.890> guys<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.520> actually<00:01:33.020> 2600

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
show you guys this is actually 2600

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.440 
show you guys this is actually 2600
milliamps<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.530> half<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.220> size<00:01:35.460> then<00:01:36.270> your

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
milliamps so half the size then your

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.660 
milliamps so half the size then your
raft<00:01:36.689> power<00:01:36.990> which<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.409> five<00:01:37.740> thousand<00:01:38.430> two

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
raft power which is five thousand two

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.969 
raft power which is five thousand two
hundred<00:01:38.700> milliamps<00:01:39.420> right<00:01:39.869> there<00:01:40.110> um<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.890> you

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
hundred milliamps right there um so you

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.100 
hundred milliamps right there um so you
do<00:01:41.130> get<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> little<00:01:41.759> bit<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.270> get<00:01:42.390> double<00:01:42.840> than

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
do get a little bit you get double than

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.410 
do get a little bit you get double than
your<00:01:43.290> usual<00:01:43.500> Samsung<00:01:43.950> battery<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.149> know<00:01:45.240> so

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
your usual Samsung battery you know so

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.639 
your usual Samsung battery you know so
that's<00:01:45.570> really<00:01:45.750> great<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.049> get<00:01:46.259> double<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
that's really great you get double the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.399 
that's really great you get double the
battery<00:01:46.770> life<00:01:47.070> um<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:48.000> should<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.990> hope

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
battery life um so this should it I hope

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.139 
battery life um so this should it I hope
it<00:01:49.619> does<00:01:49.799> last<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.460> entire<00:01:50.880> day

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
it does last you the entire day

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.440 
it does last you the entire day
ah<00:01:52.500> undoubtedly<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.369> mean<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.299> doesn't

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
ah undoubtedly I mean if it doesn't

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.350 
ah undoubtedly I mean if it doesn't
then<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.810> use<00:01:55.079> your<00:01:55.259> phone<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> lot<00:01:56.360> you're

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
then you use your phone a lot you're

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.719 
then you use your phone a lot you're
using<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> max<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:59.189> there<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.490> um

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
using that to the max so there it is um

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.459 
using that to the max so there it is um
let's<00:01:59.969> go<00:02:00.149> ahead<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:00.750> quickly<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> size

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
let's go ahead and do quickly to a size

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.800 
let's go ahead and do quickly to a size
comparison<00:02:01.680> um<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.790> can<00:02:02.909> see<00:02:03.119> um<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.630> is

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
comparison um so you can see um it is

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.859 
comparison um so you can see um it is
basically<00:02:04.140> double<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:05.130> width<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.750> as

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
basically double the width of it so as

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.229 
basically double the width of it so as
you<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.049> see<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.560> got<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.770> part<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:09.090> is

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
you can see you got that part it is

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.869 
you can see you got that part it is
basically<00:02:09.810> as<00:02:10.140> twice<00:02:10.800> as<00:02:10.830> thick<00:02:11.009> than<00:02:11.730> your

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
basically as twice as thick than your

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.820 
basically as twice as thick than your
usual<00:02:12.060> Samsung<00:02:12.540> stack<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.290> battery

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
usual Samsung stack of battery

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.140 
usual Samsung stack of battery
is<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.400> obvious<00:02:14.550> going<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.880> be<00:02:14.940> wearing

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
is it is obvious going to be wearing

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.240 
is it is obvious going to be wearing

um so as you can see it does bring quite
a<00:02:40.440> bit<00:02:40.650> thickness<00:02:41.130> but<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.910> benefit<00:02:42.330> of

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
a bit thickness but the benefit of

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.870 
a bit thickness but the benefit of
course<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.990> going<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.200> be<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.830> can<00:02:43.890> get<00:02:44.220> double

course is going to be you can get double

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.040 
course is going to be you can get double
the<00:02:44.910> battery<00:02:45.270> life<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.660> you're<00:02:45.750> sent

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
camera since it is curved you can go

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.850 
camera since it is curved you can go
ahead<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:15.720> slide<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.020> all<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.410> want<00:03:16.440> it's

tired of that so I really wish they give
you<00:03:35.970> an<00:03:36.060> option<00:03:36.390> for<00:03:36.570> maybe<00:03:36.750> something<00:03:36.989> matte

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
you an option for maybe something matte

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.800 
you an option for maybe something matte
or<00:03:37.680> something<00:03:38.250> just<00:03:38.370> less<00:03:38.700> glossy<00:03:39.090> but<00:03:39.600> of

or something just less glossy but of

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.560 
or something just less glossy but of
course<00:03:40.080> they<00:03:40.230> didn't<00:03:40.590> so<00:03:41.519> I<00:03:41.550> guess<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.450> know

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
course they didn't so I guess you know

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.000 
course they didn't so I guess you know
you<00:03:42.630> can<00:03:42.810> still<00:03:42.959> bear<00:03:43.110> with<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.320> as<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.890> you

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
you can still bear with it as the you

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.540 
know the Samsung back cover is classy as
well<00:03:45.840> so<00:03:46.019> kind<00:03:46.260> of<00:03:46.320> does<00:03:46.440> match<00:03:46.620> with<00:03:46.830> it<00:03:47.010> but<00:03:47.519> I

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
well so kind of does match with it but I

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.770
