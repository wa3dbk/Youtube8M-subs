00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
now I actually have a lot of these at my

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.450 
now I actually have a lot of these at my
house<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.689> well<00:01:15.960> because<00:01:16.740> I've<00:01:16.890> been<00:01:17.040> doing<00:01:17.220> it

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
house as well because I've been doing it

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.550 
house as well because I've been doing it
for<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:18.180> don't<00:01:18.360> know<00:01:18.509> about<00:01:18.630> 10<00:01:18.990> years<00:01:19.259> now<00:01:19.530> I

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
for I don't know about 10 years now I

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.740 
for I don't know about 10 years now I
learned<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.070> do<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.430> maybe<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.180> little<00:01:21.450> longer

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
learned to do this maybe a little longer

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.600 
learned to do this maybe a little longer
and<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.710> learned<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.490> by

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and I learned to do it just by

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.550 
and I learned to do it just by
practicing<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.330> just<00:01:24.509> took<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.689> shrub<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.320> my

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
practicing I just took a shrub in my

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.770 
practicing I just took a shrub in my
yard<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.100> started<00:01:26.700> pruning<00:01:27.119> away<00:01:27.210> all<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
yard I started pruning away all the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.140 
yard I started pruning away all the
branches<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.790> particularly<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.820> look<00:01:30.000> for

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
branches and particularly I look for

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.060 
branches and particularly I look for
those<00:01:30.270> ones<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.659> had<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.020> very<00:01:31.380> interesting

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
those ones that had the very interesting

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.660 
those ones that had the very interesting
trunk

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
trunk

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.880 
trunk
structure<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.020> really<00:01:34.200> came<00:01:34.470> out<00:01:34.530> nice

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
structure and it really came out nice

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.890 
structure and it really came out nice
and<00:01:34.920> I've<00:01:35.280> got<00:01:35.430> some<00:01:35.610> huge<00:01:36.090> ones<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.750> some

lot<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.360> learned<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.869> all<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.079> my<00:01:40.200> own

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
lot and I learned to do it all on my own

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.889

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
and they are spectacular and they really

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.859 
and they are spectacular and they really
do<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> great<00:01:50.100> job<00:01:50.430> but<00:01:50.700> they're<00:01:50.909> not<00:01:51.180> cheap<00:01:51.600> I

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
do a great job but they're not cheap I

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.899 
do a great job but they're not cheap I
think<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.500> typical<00:01:52.950> plant<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.610> could

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
think a typical plant like this could

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.300 
think a typical plant like this could
run<00:01:54.119> about<00:01:54.600> twelve<00:01:55.020> thousand<00:01:55.649> dollars<00:01:55.710> these

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
run about twelve thousand dollars these

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.149 
run about twelve thousand dollars these
are<00:01:56.460> not<00:01:56.759> inexpensive

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
are not inexpensive

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.609 
are not inexpensive
but<00:01:58.369> they<00:01:58.520> are<00:01:58.759> beautiful<00:01:59.539> and<00:01:59.810> I've<00:02:00.380> never

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
but they are beautiful and I've never

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.739 
but they are beautiful and I've never
bought<00:02:00.890> one<00:02:00.950> I've<00:02:01.579> actually<00:02:01.609> just<00:02:02.030> pruned<00:02:02.539> my

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:02.749 
bought one I've actually just pruned my

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:05.260 
bought one I've actually just pruned my
existing<00:02:03.319> trees<00:02:03.619> that<00:02:03.920> are<00:02:04.039> in<00:02:04.280> my<00:02:04.520> garden<00:02:05.030> to

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
existing trees that are in my garden to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.289 
existing trees that are in my garden to
look<00:02:05.479> like<00:02:05.719> prunes<00:02:06.049> eyes<00:02:06.289> I<00:02:07.000> love<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.119> ones

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
look like prunes eyes I love the ones

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.449 
look like prunes eyes I love the ones
that<00:02:08.539> slope<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.319> I<00:02:09.410> love<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.769> ones<00:02:09.950> that<00:02:10.160> drop

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
that slope and I love the ones that drop

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.070 
that slope and I love the ones that drop
over<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.879> edge<00:02:11.060> you<00:02:13.569> know<00:02:14.569> when<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.780> went<00:02:14.959> to

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
over the edge you know when I went to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.650 
over the edge you know when I went to
China<00:02:15.319> while<00:02:15.739> back<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.069> went<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.670> bull's-eye

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
China while back I went to a bull's-eye

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.270 
China while back I went to a bull's-eye
garden<00:02:17.989> they<00:02:18.080> call<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.349> puddin<00:02:18.650> science<00:02:19.040> I

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
garden they call it puddin science I

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.420 
garden they call it puddin science I
know<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.879> I<00:02:20.650> just<00:02:21.650> took<00:02:22.010> some<00:02:22.069> photographs

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
know and I just took some photographs

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.070 
know and I just took some photographs
and<00:02:22.970> post<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.330> up<00:02:23.450> in<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.629> Internet<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.019> I

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
and post it up in the Internet and I

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.780 
and post it up in the Internet and I
think<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.620> video<00:02:24.860> has<00:02:25.220> like<00:02:25.400> thirty

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
think that video has like thirty

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.580 
think that video has like thirty
thousand<00:02:26.480> views<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:26.959> did<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.230> just<00:02:27.440> on<00:02:27.560> a

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
thousand views and I did it just on a

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.410 
thousand views and I did it just on a
whim<00:02:27.920> just<00:02:28.310> because<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.730> thought<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.090> was<00:02:29.180> cool

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
whim just because I thought it was cool

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.030 
whim just because I thought it was cool
I<00:02:29.450> didn't<00:02:29.780> realize<00:02:30.080> there's<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.349> big<00:02:30.590> community

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
I didn't realize there's a big community

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.860 
I didn't realize there's a big community
out<00:02:31.069> there<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.340> really<00:02:31.579> loves<00:02:31.970> these<00:02:32.239> so<00:02:32.510> I

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
out there that really loves these so I

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.720 
out there that really loves these so I
figured<00:02:33.319> I'd<00:02:33.410> produce<00:02:33.739> another<00:02:34.040> one<00:02:34.250> based<00:02:34.489> on

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
figured I'd produce another one based on

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.069 
figured I'd produce another one based on
what<00:02:35.360> warehouse<00:02:35.599> where<00:02:35.959> that's<00:02:36.079> going<00:02:36.410> on

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
what warehouse where that's going on

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.690 
what warehouse where that's going on

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
branches in China a lot of times I'll

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.509 
branches in China a lot of times I'll
hang<00:02:50.420> wire<00:02:50.750> on<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.109> branches<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.829> little

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
hang wire on the branches and little

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.089 
hang wire on the branches and little
weights<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.629> they<00:02:53.720> also<00:02:53.900> wrap<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:54.620> branches

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
weights and they also wrap the branches

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.819 
weights and they also wrap the branches
with<00:02:55.280> aluminum<00:02:55.790> wire<00:02:56.060> which<00:02:56.840> allows<00:02:57.170> them<00:02:57.560> to

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
with aluminum wire which allows them to

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.470 
with aluminum wire which allows them to
actually<00:02:58.099> form<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.030> shape<00:02:59.299> so<00:03:00.230> there<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:00.500> go

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
actually form and shape so there you go

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.900 
actually form and shape so there you go
down<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.840> Pacific<00:03:03.019> Northwest<00:03:03.829> or<00:03:04.220> up<00:03:04.639> to
