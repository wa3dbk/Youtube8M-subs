real nice crisp paint lines so you can
see<00:01:51.930> here<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.530> we've<00:01:52.740> formed<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.159> little<00:01:53.399> roof

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
see here that we've formed a little roof

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.460 
see here that we've formed a little roof
that's<00:01:54.000> sticking<00:01:54.270> out<00:01:54.509> into<00:01:54.750> space<00:01:55.170> that's

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
that's sticking out into space that's

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.649 
that's sticking out into space that's
why<00:01:55.649> we're<00:01:55.829> using<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.250> two-inch<00:01:56.700> tape<00:01:57.119> so

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
why we're using the two-inch tape so

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.300 
why we're using the two-inch tape so
this'll<00:01:57.899> act<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> little<00:01:58.680> tin<00:01:58.979> roof

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
this'll act like a little tin roof

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.039 
this'll act like a little tin roof
that'll<00:01:59.759> protect<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.270> base<00:02:00.479> from<00:02:00.750> getting

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
that'll protect the base from getting

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.990 
that'll protect the base from getting
splatters<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.860> that's<00:02:02.430> why<00:02:02.670> we're<00:02:02.850> doing

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
splatters on it that's why we're doing

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.109 
splatters on it that's why we're doing
that<00:02:04.159> okay<00:02:05.159> now<00:02:05.310> we're<00:02:05.460> going<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.610> finish<00:02:05.850> up
