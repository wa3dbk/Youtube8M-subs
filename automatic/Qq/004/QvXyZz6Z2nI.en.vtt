00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you move it around and do all that kind

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.499 
you move it around and do all that kind
of<00:01:22.259> stuff<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.860> um<00:01:23.119> makes<00:01:24.119> your<00:01:24.270> curls

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
tighter and makes them last longer I

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.340 
tighter and makes them last longer I
