00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.389 

okay<00:00:01.110> so<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.439> is<00:00:01.530> just<00:00:01.650> a<00:00:01.800> little<00:00:02.010> tutorial

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
okay so this is just a little tutorial

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.090 
okay so this is just a little tutorial
on<00:00:02.820> game<00:00:03.510> maker<00:00:03.720> studios<00:00:04.140> new<00:00:04.319> physics<00:00:04.740> engine

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
on game maker studios new physics engine

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.639 
on game maker studios new physics engine
so<00:00:06.060> as<00:00:06.210> you<00:00:06.359> can<00:00:06.480> see<00:00:06.720> so<00:00:06.930> far<00:00:06.960> I've<00:00:07.350> already

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
so as you can see so far I've already

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.650 
so as you can see so far I've already
loaded<00:00:07.950> in<00:00:08.099> three<00:00:08.370> sprites<00:00:08.730> but<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:09.540> is

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
loaded in three sprites but that is

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.240 
loaded in three sprites but that is
about<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:10.139> this<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.650> because<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.219> a

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
about it this is because this is a

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.580 
about it this is because this is a
basics<00:00:11.730> tutorial<00:00:11.960> so<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.259> will<00:00:13.380> just<00:00:13.469> help

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
basics tutorial so this will just help

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.560 
basics tutorial so this will just help
you<00:00:13.769> get<00:00:14.099> started<00:00:14.340> on<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:15.150> new<00:00:15.269> physics

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
you get started on the new physics

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.300 
you get started on the new physics
engine<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.410> here<00:00:16.920> we<00:00:17.010> go

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
engine so here we go

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.000 
engine so here we go
let's<00:00:18.300> start<00:00:18.510> by<00:00:18.690> creating<00:00:18.750> an<00:00:19.199> object<00:00:19.560> we

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
let's start by creating an object we

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.870 
let's start by creating an object we
will<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:20.970> be<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.150> new<00:00:21.900> ball<00:00:22.199> object<00:00:22.880> so

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
will have it be the new ball object so

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.380 
will have it be the new ball object so
I'm<00:00:24.060> gonna<00:00:24.240> tie<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.109> its<00:00:25.260> sprite<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.980> then

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
I'm gonna tie it to its sprite and then

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.810 
I'm gonna tie it to its sprite and then
give<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.539> name<00:00:27.980> object<00:00:28.980> ball<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:29.580> it's

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
give it a name object ball it's it's

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.240 
give it a name object ball it's it's
nice<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.210> stick<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.480> object<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:30.929> front

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
nice to stick the object in front

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.549 
nice to stick the object in front
especially<00:00:32.250> when<00:00:32.579> coding<00:00:32.820> afterwards<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.410> now

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
especially when coding afterwards so now

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.190 
especially when coding afterwards so now
to<00:00:34.620> add<00:00:34.829> physics<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:36.300> need<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.660> check

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
to add physics to it we need to check

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.000 
to add physics to it we need to check
this<00:00:37.350> little<00:00:37.610> uses<00:00:38.610> physics<00:00:39.300> button<00:00:40.050> down

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
this little uses physics button down

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.549 
this little uses physics button down
here<00:00:41.040> right<00:00:41.610> next<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.000> okay<00:00:42.270> button<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.350> as

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
here right next to the okay button so as

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.440 
here right next to the okay button so as
soon<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.890> check<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.309> physics<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.300> now

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
soon as I check that physics is now

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.520 
soon as I check that physics is now
enabled<00:00:45.690> for<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.739> object<00:00:47.450> so<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:49.110> important

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
enabled for this object so the important

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.549 
enabled for this object so the important
parts<00:00:49.829> are<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.879> different<00:00:51.360> options<00:00:51.559> here

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
parts are the different options here

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.069 
parts are the different options here
obviously<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.239> collision<00:00:54.480> mask<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
obviously so the collision mask is the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.770 
obviously so the collision mask is the
first<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.590> most<00:00:55.680> important<00:00:56.219> part<00:00:56.600> we<00:00:57.600> have

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
first and most important part we have

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.889 
first and most important part we have
here<00:00:58.020> circle<00:00:58.559> box<00:00:59.070> shape<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.149> options<00:01:00.660> I'm

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
here circle box shape in the options I'm

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.959 
here circle box shape in the options I'm
gonna<00:01:01.739> go<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:01.980> circle<00:01:02.340> cuz<00:01:02.489> obviously<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.879> is

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
gonna go with circle cuz obviously it is

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.179 
gonna go with circle cuz obviously it is
a<00:01:03.000> circle<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.600> can<00:01:04.379> modify<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> collision

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
a circle I can modify the collision

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.210 
a circle I can modify the collision
shape<00:01:05.720> very<00:01:06.720> important<00:01:07.049> button<00:01:07.260> there<00:01:07.439> so

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
shape very important button there so

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.940 
shape very important button there so
what<00:01:08.430> happens<00:01:08.729> now<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.299> as<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.350> see<00:01:10.650> we

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
what happens now is as we can see we

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.410 
what happens now is as we can see we
have<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.640> little<00:01:12.290> circle<00:01:13.369> over<00:01:14.369> here<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:15.240> this

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
have a little circle over here that this

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.539 
have a little circle over here that this
is<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.659> collision<00:01:15.960> mask<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.460> is

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
is the collision mask so I have to do is

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.480 
is the collision mask so I have to do is
grab<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.270> move<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.990> over<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.310> center

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
grab that and move it over to the center

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.609 
grab that and move it over to the center
of<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.670> ball<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.090> as<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.110> see<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.439> it's

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
of the ball so as you can see it's it's

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.100 
of the ball so as you can see it's it's
aligned<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.490> if<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.090> wanted<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.479> change<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.960> I

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
aligned there if I wanted to change it I

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.530 
aligned there if I wanted to change it I
could<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.450> would

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
could just do that and then it would

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.649 
could just do that and then it would
instantly<00:01:27.960> change<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:30.090> different<00:01:30.240> size

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
instantly change it to different size

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.440 
instantly change it to different size
but<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.500> will<00:01:31.650> work<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:31.829> perfectly

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
but this this will work just perfectly

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.100 
but this this will work just perfectly
so<00:01:33.450> yeah<00:01:34.280> there<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.400> have<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.479> ball<00:01:36.750> now

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
so yeah there we have it the ball now

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.819 
so yeah there we have it the ball now
has<00:01:37.350> physics<00:01:37.820> next<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.119> density<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.710> how

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
has physics next is density this is how

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.100 
has physics next is density this is how
heavy<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.310> if<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:42.030> set<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.509> zero<00:01:42.780> it

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
heavy it is if you set this to zero it

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.690 
heavy it is if you set this to zero it
will<00:01:43.229> be<00:01:43.320> static<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:43.950> I'm<00:01:44.280> gonna<00:01:44.430> leave<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.640> at

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
will be static but I'm gonna leave it at

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.730 
will be static but I'm gonna leave it at
1.5<00:01:45.149> which<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.509> default<00:01:45.689> I'm<00:01:46.320> gonna<00:01:46.530> leave<00:01:46.649> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
1.5 which is default I'm gonna leave the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.499 
1.5 which is default I'm gonna leave the
defaults<00:01:47.159> for<00:01:47.310> all<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.579> these<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.119> collision

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
defaults for all of these the collision

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.590 
defaults for all of these the collision
group<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:49.250> States<00:01:50.250> which<00:01:51.000> collision<00:01:51.450> group

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
group is States which collision group

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.910 
group is States which collision group
it'll<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:51.990> obviously<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.860> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
it'll be and obviously so if it's in a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.870 
it'll be and obviously so if it's in a
different<00:01:53.100> collision<00:01:53.520> group<00:01:53.700> than<00:01:53.850> a

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
different collision group than a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.300 
different collision group than a
different<00:01:54.210> object<00:01:54.470> then<00:01:55.470> they<00:01:55.950> won't<00:01:56.130> touch

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
different object then they won't touch

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.459 
different object then they won't touch
each<00:01:56.460> other<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:57.509> they<00:01:57.689> they<00:01:57.899> won't<00:01:58.079> have<00:01:58.259> any

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
each other like they they won't have any

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.510 
each other like they they won't have any
interaction<00:01:58.979> with<00:01:59.009> each<00:01:59.159> other

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.850 
interaction with each other
linear<00:02:00.360> dampening<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:00.990> angular<00:02:01.290> dampening

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
linear dampening and angular dampening

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.670 
linear dampening and angular dampening
this<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.880> how<00:02:03.060> fast<00:02:03.899> it'll<00:02:04.290> slow<00:02:04.530> over

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
this is just how fast it'll slow over

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.740 
this is just how fast it'll slow over
time<00:02:05.040> if<00:02:05.280> it's<00:02:05.520> moving<00:02:05.790> straight<00:02:06.210> forward<00:02:06.600> and

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
time if it's moving straight forward and

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.749 
time if it's moving straight forward and
there's<00:02:07.170> nothing<00:02:07.500> else<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.710> affect<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.099> it's

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
there's nothing else to affect it it's

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.510 
there's nothing else to affect it it's
as<00:02:09.030> if<00:02:09.239> it's<00:02:09.479> hitting<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.289> air<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.370> will

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
as if it's hitting the air so this will

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.000 
as if it's hitting the air so this will
slow<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.700> down<00:02:11.790> over<00:02:12.120> time<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.709> that's<00:02:13.709> about

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
slow it down over time and that's about

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.250 
slow it down over time and that's about
that's<00:02:14.220> all<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.340> want<00:02:14.580> for<00:02:14.879> object-ball<00:02:15.629> so<00:02:15.959> far

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
that's all I want for object-ball so far

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.679 
that's all I want for object-ball so far
I'm<00:02:16.500> just<00:02:16.560> gonna<00:02:17.280> quickly<00:02:17.519> repeat<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.239> steps

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
I'm just gonna quickly repeat that steps

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.429 
I'm just gonna quickly repeat that steps
those<00:02:19.500> steps<00:02:19.920> pretty<00:02:20.220> much<00:02:20.340> for<00:02:20.579> the<00:02:20.670> next<00:02:20.790> one

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:21.439 
those steps pretty much for the next one

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:26.089 
those steps pretty much for the next one
object<00:02:22.439> box<00:02:24.650> there<00:02:25.650> we<00:02:25.739> go

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
object box there we go

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.550 
object box there we go
named<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.790> object<00:02:26.909> box<00:02:27.299> once<00:02:27.930> again<00:02:28.230> uses

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
named it object box once again uses

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.140 
named it object box once again uses
physics<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.129> this<00:02:29.489> time<00:02:29.670> I'm<00:02:29.760> gonna<00:02:29.849> use<00:02:29.939> the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
physics and this time I'm gonna use the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.780 
physics and this time I'm gonna use the
box<00:02:30.420> shape<00:02:30.810> not<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.319> circle<00:02:31.709> for<00:02:32.489> obvious

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
box shape not the circle for obvious

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.899 
box shape not the circle for obvious
reasons<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.680> modify<00:02:34.680> collision<00:02:35.040> shape<00:02:35.250> I'm

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
reasons and modify collision shape I'm

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.289 
reasons and modify collision shape I'm
just<00:02:36.120> gonna<00:02:36.299> move<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.750> over<00:02:36.840> there<00:02:38.120> perfect

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
just gonna move it over there perfect

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.569 
just gonna move it over there perfect
we<00:02:39.540> now<00:02:39.659> have<00:02:39.840> box<00:02:40.909> already<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:43.140> I'll<00:02:43.950> hit<00:02:44.250> OK

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
we now have box already so I'll hit OK

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.640 
we now have box already so I'll hit OK
with<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:45.030> one<00:02:45.180> as<00:02:45.359> well<00:02:45.390> now<00:02:46.230> for<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.500> last

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
with that one as well now for the last

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.630 
with that one as well now for the last
one<00:02:46.859> it's<00:02:47.489> gonna<00:02:47.670> be<00:02:47.849> a<00:02:47.879> wall<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:49.650> it's<00:02:50.069> add<00:02:50.310> an

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
one it's gonna be a wall so it's add an

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.710 
one it's gonna be a wall so it's add an
object<00:02:51.349> let's<00:02:52.349> add<00:02:52.650> our<00:02:53.010> SPR<00:02:53.879> wall<00:02:54.950> okay<00:02:56.720> and

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
object let's add our SPR wall okay and

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.430 
object let's add our SPR wall okay and
then<00:02:58.109> once<00:02:58.290> again<00:02:58.409> gonna<00:02:58.829> name<00:02:59.129> it<00:03:00.260> okay

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
then once again gonna name it okay

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.089 
then once again gonna name it okay
so<00:03:02.159> what<00:03:02.549> we<00:03:03.000> do<00:03:03.180> now<00:03:03.480> is<00:03:03.840> same<00:03:04.560> as<00:03:04.709> before

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
so what we do now is same as before

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.089 
so what we do now is same as before
except<00:03:05.519> for<00:03:05.639> instead<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:06.090> using<00:03:06.290> box<00:03:07.290> as<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:07.950> did

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
except for instead of using box as I did

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.160 
except for instead of using box as I did
on<00:03:08.159> the<00:03:08.250> other<00:03:08.310> one<00:03:08.430> I'm<00:03:08.790> gonna<00:03:09.090> use<00:03:09.180> shape<00:03:09.659> not

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
on the other one I'm gonna use shape not

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.020 
on the other one I'm gonna use shape not
because<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.590> couldn't<00:03:10.980> use<00:03:11.129> box<00:03:11.459> but<00:03:11.730> because<00:03:11.940> I

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
because I couldn't use box but because I

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.780 
because I couldn't use box but because I
kind<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.239> want<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.450> show<00:03:12.599> you<00:03:12.659> how<00:03:12.870> shape<00:03:13.200> works

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
kind of want to show you how shape works

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
kind of want to show you how shape works
so<00:03:14.790> here's<00:03:15.060> how<00:03:15.209> it<00:03:15.329> goes

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
so here's how it goes

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.750 
so here's how it goes
you<00:03:16.260> start<00:03:16.620> off<00:03:17.720> here<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:19.280> then<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.609> just

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
you start off here and then you just

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.580 
you start off here and then you just
have<00:03:20.849> to<00:03:20.940> click<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:23.430> create<00:03:24.120> your<00:03:24.359> shape<00:03:24.560> so<00:03:25.560> I

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
have to click to create your shape so I

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.550 
have to click to create your shape so I
could<00:03:25.949> do<00:03:26.549> this<00:03:26.790> if<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.180> wanted<00:03:27.449> to<00:03:27.660> but<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.319> don't

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
could do this if I wanted to but I don't

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.470 
could do this if I wanted to but I don't
want<00:03:28.859> to<00:03:30.109> so<00:03:31.760> I'm<00:03:32.760> going<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:32.970> delete<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.419> one

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
want to so I'm going to delete that one

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.280 
want to so I'm going to delete that one
there<00:03:33.930> we<00:03:34.019> go

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
there we go

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.050 
there we go
so<00:03:34.470> it's<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.889> perfect<00:03:35.040> box<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:35.579> you<00:03:35.639> can<00:03:35.910> use

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
so it's a perfect box so you can use

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.599 
so it's a perfect box so you can use
this<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:37.230> make<00:03:37.500> different<00:03:38.010> shapes<00:03:38.160> if<00:03:38.489> you're

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
this to make different shapes if you're

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.670 
this to make different shapes if you're
using<00:03:38.819> a<00:03:39.000> different<00:03:39.120> sprite<00:03:39.569> on<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.840> box<00:03:40.230> or<00:03:40.590> a

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
using a different sprite on a box or a

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.819 
using a different sprite on a box or a
circle<00:03:41.250> but<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.329> must<00:03:42.660> note<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.500> can't

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
circle but you must note that it can't

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.860 
circle but you must note that it can't
be<00:03:43.980> concave<00:03:44.400> it<00:03:45.180> has<00:03:45.359> to<00:03:45.510> be<00:03:45.599> convex<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:47.870> yeah

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
be concave it has to be convex and yeah

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.449 
be concave it has to be convex and yeah
otherwise<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.530> just<00:03:49.680> won't<00:03:49.859> work<00:03:50.129> with<00:03:50.340> this

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
otherwise it just won't work with this

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.490 
otherwise it just won't work with this
engine<00:03:50.819> you<00:03:51.000> can't<00:03:51.389> have<00:03:51.599> it<00:03:51.720> concave<00:03:52.169> it'll

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
engine you can't have it concave it'll

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.330 
engine you can't have it concave it'll
give<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:52.829> a<00:03:52.859> warning<00:03:53.250> if<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.459> do<00:03:53.870> so<00:03:55.340> anyway

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
give you a warning if you do so anyway

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.460 
give you a warning if you do so anyway
and<00:03:56.609> then<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.449> only<00:03:57.750> difference<00:03:58.260> with<00:03:58.349> this

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
and then the only difference with this

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.080 
and then the only difference with this
one<00:03:58.530> is<00:03:58.799> I<00:03:59.010> don't<00:03:59.069> want<00:03:59.310> it<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.489> hit<00:03:59.609> any<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.879> it

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
one is I don't want it to hit any of it

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.849 
one is I don't want it to hit any of it
anything<00:04:00.419> else<00:04:00.599> I<00:04:00.750> don't<00:04:00.780> want<00:04:01.019> it<00:04:01.079> to<00:04:01.199> react

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
anything else I don't want it to react

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.439 
anything else I don't want it to react
to<00:04:02.010> gravity<00:04:02.370> or<00:04:02.400> anything<00:04:02.730> so<00:04:03.120> I'm<00:04:03.180> gonna<00:04:03.239> just

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
to gravity or anything so I'm gonna just

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.890 
to gravity or anything so I'm gonna just
set<00:04:03.599> it<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.810> zero<00:04:04.049> so<00:04:04.919> it<00:04:05.340> won't<00:04:05.549> won't<00:04:06.060> fall

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
set it to zero so it won't won't fall

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.240 
set it to zero so it won't won't fall
and<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.290> won't<00:04:07.409> bounce<00:04:07.620> away<00:04:07.949> from<00:04:08.129> other

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
and it won't bounce away from other

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.629 
and it won't bounce away from other
objects<00:04:08.639> okay<00:04:09.510> done<00:04:10.079> with<00:04:10.229> that<00:04:10.379> one<00:04:10.500> so<00:04:11.400> now

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
objects okay done with that one so now

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.449 
objects okay done with that one so now
let's<00:04:12.120> bring<00:04:12.269> back<00:04:12.540> up<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:12.810> ball<00:04:13.459> because

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
let's bring back up the ball because

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.460 
let's bring back up the ball because
right<00:04:14.970> away<00:04:15.239> they<00:04:15.569> won't<00:04:15.750> actually<00:04:16.260> hit<00:04:16.380> each

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
right away they won't actually hit each

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.729 
right away they won't actually hit each
other<00:04:17.449> they<00:04:18.449> just<00:04:18.630> they<00:04:18.750> just<00:04:18.930> won't<00:04:19.049> so<00:04:19.620> what

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
other they just they just won't so what

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.060 
other they just they just won't so what
you<00:04:19.829> need<00:04:19.979> to<00:04:20.070> do<00:04:20.250> is<00:04:20.519> add<00:04:21.000> collision<00:04:21.449> event

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
you need to do is add collision event

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.510 
you need to do is add collision event
within<00:04:23.070> other<00:04:23.430> objects<00:04:24.200> say<00:04:25.200> box

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
within other objects say box

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.939 
within other objects say box
and<00:04:26.810> you<00:04:27.810> need<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.020> stick<00:04:28.289> anything<00:04:28.440> here

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
and you need to stick anything here

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.200 
and you need to stick anything here
because<00:04:29.069> if<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.370> don't<00:04:29.520> stick<00:04:29.729> anything<00:04:29.880> in

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
because if you don't stick anything in

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.240 
because if you don't stick anything in
the<00:04:30.330> actions<00:04:30.720> event<00:04:31.020> it'll<00:04:31.590> remove<00:04:31.919> the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
the actions event it'll remove the

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.540 
the actions event it'll remove the
object<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:33.389> collision<00:04:33.690> event<00:04:33.930> so<00:04:34.710> you<00:04:35.220> need

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
object the collision event so you need

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.189 
object the collision event so you need
to<00:04:35.639> stick<00:04:35.789> something<00:04:35.970> in<00:04:36.090> action<00:04:36.449> but<00:04:36.900> since<00:04:37.080> I

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
to stick something in action but since I

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.659 
to stick something in action but since I
don't<00:04:37.259> really<00:04:37.680> care<00:04:37.979> for<00:04:38.009> it<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.340> do<00:04:38.460> anything

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
don't really care for it to do anything

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.779 
don't really care for it to do anything
I'm<00:04:39.060> just<00:04:39.210> gonna<00:04:39.449> stick<00:04:39.660> in<00:04:39.810> here<00:04:40.050> a<00:04:40.340> note<00:04:41.340> that

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
I'm just gonna stick in here a note that

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.180 
I'm just gonna stick in here a note that
says<00:04:42.000> null<00:04:42.380> so<00:04:43.380> that<00:04:43.560> won't<00:04:43.740> do<00:04:43.889> anything

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
says null so that won't do anything

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.070 
says null so that won't do anything
it'll<00:04:44.729> just<00:04:44.910> keep<00:04:45.120> this<00:04:45.930> action<00:04:46.830> here<00:04:47.130> so<00:04:48.090> with

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
it'll just keep this action here so with

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.020 
it'll just keep this action here so with
this<00:04:49.319> here<00:04:49.620> this<00:04:49.860> tells<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.340> collision<00:04:50.759> the

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
this here this tells the collision the

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.480 
this here this tells the collision the
physics<00:04:51.660> engine<00:04:51.870> that<00:04:52.560> I<00:04:52.590> do<00:04:52.740> want<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.220> be<00:04:53.400> able

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
physics engine that I do want to be able

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.850 
physics engine that I do want to be able
to<00:04:53.669> hit<00:04:53.970> this<00:04:54.210> object<00:04:54.419> so<00:04:55.259> this<00:04:55.380> gives<00:04:55.590> you<00:04:55.710> an

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
to hit this object so this gives you an

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.529 
to hit this object so this gives you an
amazing<00:04:56.130> amount<00:04:56.550> of<00:04:56.580> control<00:04:57.030> over<00:04:57.210> which

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
amazing amount of control over which

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.379 
amazing amount of control over which
objects<00:04:58.050> can<00:04:58.319> hit<00:04:58.590> which<00:04:58.800> objects<00:04:59.389> it's

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
objects can hit which objects it's

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.230 
objects can hit which objects it's
really<00:05:00.960> nice<00:05:01.220> so<00:05:02.220> I'm<00:05:02.460> also<00:05:02.610> gonna<00:05:02.849> want<00:05:03.120> to

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
really nice so I'm also gonna want to

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.140 
really nice so I'm also gonna want to
have<00:05:03.360> it<00:05:03.840> hit<00:05:04.440> myself<00:05:04.830> so<00:05:05.400> other<00:05:05.639> versions<00:05:06.060> of

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
have it hit myself so other versions of

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.029 
have it hit myself so other versions of
myself<00:05:06.330> I<00:05:06.659> want<00:05:06.840> it<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:07.080> hit<00:05:07.229> that<00:05:07.409> as<00:05:07.650> well<00:05:07.860> and

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
myself I want it to hit that as well and

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.240 
myself I want it to hit that as well and
obviously<00:05:08.970> also<00:05:09.659> the<00:05:09.930> wall<00:05:10.319> I<00:05:10.620> mean<00:05:10.919> I<00:05:10.979> want<00:05:11.159> it

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
obviously also the wall I mean I want it

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.790 
obviously also the wall I mean I want it
to<00:05:11.310> hit<00:05:11.460> those<00:05:11.610> two<00:05:12.289> so<00:05:13.289> now<00:05:13.440> we're<00:05:13.650> done<00:05:13.740> with

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
to hit those two so now we're done with

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.550 
to hit those two so now we're done with
that<00:05:14.039> object<00:05:14.430> and<00:05:14.659> the<00:05:15.659> box<00:05:15.900> I'll<00:05:16.229> just

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
that object and the box I'll just

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.490 
that object and the box I'll just
quickly<00:05:16.979> repeat<00:05:17.430> those<00:05:17.610> steps<00:05:18.349> lesion<00:05:19.349> with

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
quickly repeat those steps lesion with

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.450 
quickly repeat those steps lesion with
fall<00:05:21.889> collision<00:05:22.889> with<00:05:23.069> box<00:05:23.780> and<00:05:25.460> collision

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
fall collision with box and collision

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.270 
fall collision with box and collision
with<00:05:26.639> wall<00:05:26.909> okay<00:05:27.509> now<00:05:28.259> I<00:05:28.289> know<00:05:28.409> I'm<00:05:29.039> not<00:05:29.159> gonna

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
with wall okay now I know I'm not gonna

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.649 
with wall okay now I know I'm not gonna
stake<00:05:29.490> anything<00:05:29.789> in<00:05:29.880> a<00:05:29.940> wall<00:05:30.120> because<00:05:30.300> once

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:30.659 
stake anything in a wall because once

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:32.540 
stake anything in a wall because once
again<00:05:30.780> I<00:05:30.930> don't<00:05:30.990> want<00:05:31.199> the<00:05:31.259> wall<00:05:31.409> to<00:05:31.500> move<00:05:31.680> so

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
again I don't want the wall to move so

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.959 
again I don't want the wall to move so
here<00:05:32.699> we<00:05:32.789> go<00:05:32.930> they<00:05:33.930> will<00:05:34.169> all<00:05:34.349> bounce<00:05:34.800> on<00:05:35.190> roll

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:35.969 
here we go they will all bounce on roll

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.659 
here we go they will all bounce on roll
and<00:05:36.150> stuff<00:05:36.389> off<00:05:36.539> of<00:05:36.570> each<00:05:36.780> other<00:05:36.930> so<00:05:37.139> now<00:05:37.770> we<00:05:38.550> go

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
and stuff off of each other so now we go

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.580 
and stuff off of each other so now we go
to<00:05:38.729> the<00:05:38.909> room<00:05:39.090> now<00:05:39.719> this<00:05:39.900> is<00:05:40.020> an<00:05:40.139> important

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
to the room now this is an important

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.140 
to the room now this is an important
part<00:05:40.770> that<00:05:40.949> most<00:05:41.099> people<00:05:41.400> will<00:05:41.610> overlook<00:05:42.000> in

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
part that most people will overlook in

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.709 
part that most people will overlook in
the<00:05:42.210> beginning<00:05:42.710> um<00:05:44.090> well<00:05:45.090> first<00:05:45.180> obviously<00:05:45.599> we

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:45.719 
the beginning um well first obviously we

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:49.640 
the beginning um well first obviously we
gonna<00:05:45.870> that's<00:05:46.650> quickly<00:05:48.020> stick<00:05:49.020> some<00:05:49.229> objects

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
gonna that's quickly stick some objects

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.390 
gonna that's quickly stick some objects
in<00:05:49.740> our<00:05:49.860> room

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
in our room

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.779 
in our room
start<00:05:51.300> with<00:05:51.389> object<00:05:51.750> wall<00:05:54.020> there<00:05:55.020> we<00:05:55.199> go<00:05:55.789> we

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
start with object wall there we go we

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.890 
start with object wall there we go we
got<00:05:56.940> ourselves<00:05:57.060> some<00:05:57.680> boundaries<00:05:59.419> okay<00:06:00.419> and

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
got ourselves some boundaries okay and

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.459 
got ourselves some boundaries okay and
now<00:06:01.469> we<00:06:01.530> stick<00:06:02.130> in<00:06:02.419> some<00:06:03.419> balls<00:06:03.750> maybe<00:06:04.199> I'll

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:04.469 
now we stick in some balls maybe I'll

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:07.670 
now we stick in some balls maybe I'll
stick<00:06:04.620> one<00:06:04.800> there<00:06:05.009> there<00:06:05.569> there<00:06:06.569> there<00:06:06.930> and

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
stick one there there there there and

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.779 
stick one there there there there and
it's<00:06:08.430> boxes<00:06:09.060> maybe<00:06:09.300> they're<00:06:09.659> there<00:06:10.789> they're

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:11.789 
it's boxes maybe they're there they're

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:14.059 
it's boxes maybe they're there they're
right<00:06:12.750> there<00:06:12.960> with<00:06:13.259> that<00:06:13.349> we'll<00:06:13.740> see<00:06:13.860> how<00:06:13.919> that

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:14.069 
right there with that we'll see how that

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:14.450 
right there with that we'll see how that
works

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
works

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.719 
works
okay<00:06:15.270> now<00:06:16.199> the<00:06:16.259> part<00:06:16.800> that<00:06:17.130> will<00:06:17.250> actually

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
okay now the part that will actually

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:18.920 
okay now the part that will actually
start<00:06:17.940> the<00:06:18.060> physics<00:06:18.330> rolling<00:06:18.630> because<00:06:18.719> if<00:06:18.870> I

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
start the physics rolling because if I

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.600 
start the physics rolling because if I
started<00:06:19.229> it<00:06:19.319> right<00:06:19.440> now<00:06:19.560> these<00:06:19.919> objects<00:06:20.400> would

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
started it right now these objects would

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.399 
started it right now these objects would
not<00:06:20.789> move<00:06:20.940> at<00:06:21.060> all<00:06:21.180> this<00:06:21.840> is<00:06:22.020> because<00:06:22.139> they're

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:22.409 
not move at all this is because they're

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:25.939 
not move at all this is because they're
not<00:06:22.620> acted<00:06:23.039> upon<00:06:23.099> by<00:06:23.280> gravity<00:06:23.880> currently<00:06:24.949> so

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 
not acted upon by gravity currently so

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:28.249 
not acted upon by gravity currently so
all<00:06:26.310> we<00:06:26.430> have<00:06:26.550> to<00:06:26.610> do<00:06:26.819> because<00:06:27.120> it<00:06:27.630> the<00:06:28.050> the

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:28.259 
all we have to do because it the the

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:30.709 
all we have to do because it the the
physics<00:06:28.530> engine<00:06:28.710> needs<00:06:29.069> a<00:06:29.250> physics<00:06:29.610> world<00:06:29.969> so

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:30.719 
physics engine needs a physics world so

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:32.540 
physics engine needs a physics world so
you<00:06:30.810> could<00:06:31.020> create<00:06:31.229> this<00:06:31.349> with<00:06:31.500> code<00:06:31.800> or<00:06:32.310> you

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
you could create this with code or you

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.060 
you could create this with code or you
can<00:06:32.699> go<00:06:32.849> into<00:06:32.969> the<00:06:33.150> room<00:06:33.360> and<00:06:33.630> go<00:06:34.560> room<00:06:34.949> and

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
can go into the room and go room and

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.730 
can go into the room and go room and
physics<00:06:35.370> world<00:06:35.580> and<00:06:35.880> check<00:06:36.089> that<00:06:36.270> box<00:06:36.449> so<00:06:37.289> this

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
physics world and check that box so this

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.860 
physics world and check that box so this
will<00:06:37.860> let<00:06:38.010> the<00:06:38.159> room<00:06:38.400> take<00:06:38.909> control<00:06:39.330> of<00:06:39.690> the

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
will let the room take control of the

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.680 
will let the room take control of the
physics<00:06:40.170> properties<00:06:40.440> of<00:06:40.950> the<00:06:41.070> world<00:06:41.510> so<00:06:42.510> it's

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
physics properties of the world so it's

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.860 
physics properties of the world so it's
defaulted<00:06:43.200> to<00:06:43.290> 10<00:06:43.590> gravity<00:06:44.130> in<00:06:44.220> the<00:06:44.310> y-axis

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
defaulted to 10 gravity in the y-axis

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.140 
defaulted to 10 gravity in the y-axis
which<00:06:45.870> will<00:06:45.990> make<00:06:46.140> them<00:06:46.230> all<00:06:46.380> go<00:06:46.530> down<00:06:46.770> and

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
which will make them all go down and

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.330 
which will make them all go down and
picks<00:06:48.150> us<00:06:48.270> to<00:06:48.390> meter<00:06:48.570> ratio<00:06:49.080> I'll<00:06:49.950> just<00:06:50.160> leave

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
picks us to meter ratio I'll just leave

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.660 
picks us to meter ratio I'll just leave
this<00:06:50.490> at<00:06:50.640> the<00:06:50.670> default<00:06:51.140> so<00:06:52.140> now<00:06:52.350> all<00:06:52.740> done

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:53.670 
this at the default so now all done

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.860 
this at the default so now all done
I<00:06:53.900> am<00:06:54.900> literally<00:06:55.310> already<00:06:56.310> made<00:06:56.850> off<00:06:57.120> entire

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
I am literally already made off entire

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.720 
I am literally already made off entire
physics<00:06:58.350> engine<00:06:58.650> with<00:06:59.040> the<00:06:59.070> new<00:06:59.340> game<00:06:59.580> maker

00:06:59.720 --> 00:06:59.730 
physics engine with the new game maker

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.930 
physics engine with the new game maker
studio<00:07:00.530> so<00:07:01.530> let's<00:07:01.740> quickly<00:07:02.130> test<00:07:02.460> it<00:07:02.610> out<00:07:02.700> and

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
studio so let's quickly test it out and

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:08.950 
studio so let's quickly test it out and
see<00:07:03.000> what<00:07:03.330> we<00:07:03.420> created<00:07:06.530> there<00:07:07.530> we<00:07:07.710> go

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
see what we created there we go

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:15.920 
see what we created there we go
physics<00:07:10.490> nice<00:07:12.320> so<00:07:13.400> you<00:07:14.400> may<00:07:14.550> notice<00:07:14.760> the<00:07:15.750> balls

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
physics nice so you may notice the balls

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.920 
physics nice so you may notice the balls
kind<00:07:16.320> of<00:07:16.410> fell<00:07:16.650> this<00:07:17.100> one<00:07:17.310> still<00:07:18.000> rolling<00:07:18.390> for

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:18.930 
kind of fell this one still rolling for

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.480 
kind of fell this one still rolling for
some<00:07:19.050> reason<00:07:19.320> so<00:07:19.830> it's<00:07:19.950> not<00:07:20.040> the<00:07:20.190> best

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490 
some reason so it's not the best

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.820 
some reason so it's not the best
collision<00:07:20.850> system<00:07:21.120> I've<00:07:21.390> ever<00:07:21.420> seen<00:07:21.870> but<00:07:22.650> it's

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830 
collision system I've ever seen but it's

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.650 
collision system I've ever seen but it's
really<00:07:23.100> fast<00:07:23.490> and<00:07:23.760> really<00:07:23.820> easy<00:07:24.300> to<00:07:24.480> work<00:07:24.600> with

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:24.660 
really fast and really easy to work with

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.620 
really fast and really easy to work with
so<00:07:25.410> I'm<00:07:25.710> definitely<00:07:26.520> happy<00:07:26.940> with<00:07:26.970> it<00:07:27.210> it<00:07:27.570> is

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.630 
so I'm definitely happy with it it is

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.030 
so I'm definitely happy with it it is
much<00:07:27.900> more<00:07:28.050> powerful<00:07:28.260> than<00:07:28.590> I<00:07:28.680> showed<00:07:28.890> you

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:29.040 
much more powerful than I showed you

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.010 
much more powerful than I showed you
here<00:07:29.250> but<00:07:29.640> this<00:07:29.760> is<00:07:29.880> the<00:07:29.970> basics<00:07:30.360> of<00:07:30.480> it<00:07:30.570> I'll

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 
here but this is the basics of it I'll

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.630 
here but this is the basics of it I'll
do<00:07:31.260> a<00:07:31.290> more<00:07:31.500> advanced<00:07:31.860> tutorial<00:07:32.250> later<00:07:32.430> on

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:32.640 
do a more advanced tutorial later on

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.230 
do a more advanced tutorial later on
when<00:07:33.060> I<00:07:33.390> get<00:07:34.140> more<00:07:34.320> advanced<00:07:34.860> in<00:07:34.980> it<00:07:35.100> so<00:07:35.970> anyway

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 
when I get more advanced in it so anyway

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.160 
when I get more advanced in it so anyway
I<00:07:36.480> hope<00:07:36.870> you<00:07:37.050> like<00:07:37.200> this<00:07:37.350> tutorial<00:07:37.410> and

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:39.170 
I hope you like this tutorial and
