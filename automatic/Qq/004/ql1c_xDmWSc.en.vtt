got Johnny Vogel's written all over it
and<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:51.090> probably<00:00:51.329> fair<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.809> good<00:00:51.989> light

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
and it's probably fair in good light

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.810 
and it's probably fair in good light
when<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.860> look<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.219> cup<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.699> those

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
when you you look on that cup and those

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.670 
when you you look on that cup and those
last<00:00:54.149> three<00:00:54.270> Victorian<00:00:54.899> title<00:00:55.230> holders<00:00:55.559> are

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
last three Victorian title holders are

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.889 
last three Victorian title holders are
like<00:00:55.860> Merck<00:00:56.070> aadmi<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.210> John<00:00:57.539> that

like Merck aadmi and and John that
that's<00:00:58.649> like<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> really<00:00:59.100> true<00:00:59.340> indication<00:00:59.730> I

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
that's like a really true indication I

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.459 
that's like a really true indication I
guess<00:01:00.120> over<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> past<00:01:00.690> three<00:01:00.930> years<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.260> you

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
guess over the past three years we you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.569 
guess over the past three years we you
know<00:01:01.590> with<00:01:01.770> it's<00:01:01.920> fair<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.129> say<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.460> probably

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
know with it's fair to say we probably

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.189 
know with it's fair to say we probably
been<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.000> three<00:01:03.149> strongest<00:01:03.539> cars<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
been to three strongest cars in the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.590 
been to three strongest cars in the
state<00:01:04.439> over<00:01:04.619> at<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:04.979> time<00:01:05.299> that's<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.479> sure

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
state over at that time that's for sure

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.359

looking<00:04:41.729> for<00:04:41.880> a<00:04:41.910> start<00:04:42.180> not<00:04:42.270> laughs<00:04:42.630> nickens

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
looking for a start not laughs nickens

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.870 
looking for a start not laughs nickens
right<00:04:43.560> off<00:04:43.740> so<00:04:43.949> I<00:04:43.979> can<00:04:44.160> get<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.669> feel<00:04:44.850> the

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
right off so I can get the feel the

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.090 
right off so I can get the feel the
track<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.539> get<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.139> feel<00:04:46.289> how<00:04:46.470> fast<00:04:46.770> it<00:04:46.979> is

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
track and get the feel how fast it is

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.719 
track and get the feel how fast it is
it's<00:04:47.849> big<00:04:48.000> track<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.570> um<00:04:49.280> well<00:04:50.280> I<00:04:50.340> think<00:04:50.490> about

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
it's big track and um well I think about

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.730 
it's big track and um well I think about
it<00:04:50.970> it's<00:04:51.180> a<00:04:51.360> bit<00:04:51.660> like<00:04:51.810> bun<00:04:52.080> rieu<00:04:52.289> but<00:04:52.530> it's

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
it it's a bit like bun rieu but it's

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.589 
it it's a bit like bun rieu but it's
sort<00:04:53.280> of<00:04:53.370> smaller<00:04:53.700> in<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.000> Straits<00:04:54.330> and

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
sort of smaller in the Straits and

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:58.070 
sort of smaller in the Straits and
better<00:04:55.260> there's<00:04:55.919> waters<00:04:56.820> bunbury<00:04:57.330> but<00:04:57.539> I'm<00:04:57.720> I

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
better there's waters bunbury but I'm I

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.469 
better there's waters bunbury but I'm I
will<00:04:58.740> see<00:04:58.889> here<00:04:58.979> we<00:04:59.070> go<00:04:59.220> that's<00:04:59.940> for<00:05:00.090> sure<00:05:00.210> now

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
will see here we go that's for sure now

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.750 
will see here we go that's for sure now
so<00:05:01.050> it's<00:05:01.169> a<00:05:01.560> case<00:05:01.740> of<00:05:01.770> resetting<00:05:02.310> your<00:05:02.370> goals

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
so it's a case of resetting your goals

to feature win you have to reassess

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.909 
to feature win you have to reassess
those<00:05:15.750> goals<00:05:15.990> in<00:05:16.139> the<00:05:16.229> lead-up<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.530> heartland
