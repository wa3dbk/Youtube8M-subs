what's going on pills Paul here again I
got<00:00:12.670> another<00:00:12.820> amplifier<00:00:13.059> from<00:00:13.330> you<00:00:13.450> know<00:00:13.510> this

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:13.870 
got another amplifier from you know this

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
like a local security deal agent it just

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
like a local security deal agent it just
comes<00:02:27.070> off<00:02:27.190> at<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.489> door

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
comes off at the door

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.060 
comes off at the door
well<00:02:28.540> screw<00:02:28.840> right<00:02:29.019> there<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.800> can<00:02:29.920> see

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
well screw right there you can see

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.789 
well screw right there you can see
little<00:02:30.640> black<00:02:30.730> screw<00:02:31.320> that's<00:02:32.320> what<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.620> is

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
little black screw that's what that is

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.460 
little black screw that's what that is
if<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.070> wondering<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:34.000> know<00:02:34.060> we<00:02:34.299> got<00:02:34.420> 13<00:02:34.750> 1/2

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
if you wondering you know we got 13 1/2

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.759 
if you wondering you know we got 13 1/2
inches<00:02:35.799> this<00:02:35.950> way<00:02:36.989> from<00:02:37.989> side<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.290> side

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
inches this way from side to side

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.590 
inches this way from side to side
we<00:02:39.310> got<00:02:39.579> looks<00:02:39.940> like<00:02:41.100> pretty<00:02:42.100> close<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.790> 8<00:02:43.390> and

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
we got looks like pretty close to 8 and

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.110 
we got looks like pretty close to 8 and
a<00:02:43.630> half<00:02:43.660> inches<00:02:44.260> this<00:02:44.739> way<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:45.040> we<00:02:45.310> get<00:02:45.489> eight

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
a half inches this way so we get eight

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.390 
a half inches this way so we get eight
and<00:02:46.390> half<00:02:46.480> this<00:02:46.630> way<00:02:46.840> 13<00:02:47.530> half<00:02:47.739> this<00:02:47.890> way<00:02:48.130> and

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
and half this way 13 half this way and

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.370 
and half this way 13 half this way and
the<00:02:48.610> height<00:02:49.590> hard<00:02:51.209> looks<00:02:52.209> like<00:02:52.420> about<00:02:52.930> two<00:02:53.320> and

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
the height hard looks like about two and

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.320 
the height hard looks like about two and
a<00:02:53.440> quarter

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
a quarter

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.270 
a quarter
all<00:02:55.930> right<00:02:56.110> so<00:02:56.290> we've<00:02:56.410> got<00:02:56.500> 13<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.950> half<00:02:57.040> this

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
all right so we've got 13 a half this

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.240 
all right so we've got 13 a half this
way<00:02:57.490> 8<00:02:57.820> and<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.180> half<00:02:58.210> this<00:02:58.540> way<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.100> two<00:03:00.100> and<00:03:00.220> a

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
way 8 and a half this way and two and a

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.620 
way 8 and a half this way and two and a
quarter<00:03:00.430> from<00:03:00.850> Heidi<00:03:01.150> could<00:03:01.360> be<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.480> little

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
quarter from Heidi could be a little

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.000 
quarter from Heidi could be a little
taller<00:03:01.810> but<00:03:02.170> it's<00:03:02.350> on<00:03:02.500> that's<00:03:02.620> pretty<00:03:02.860> close

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
taller but it's on that's pretty close

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.900 
taller but it's on that's pretty close
to<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.220> so<00:03:03.520> it's<00:03:03.970> not<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:05.230> term<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.650> be<00:03:05.910> the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
to that so it's not to term to be the

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.520 
to that so it's not to term to be the
prime<00:03:07.120> about<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.600> right<00:03:07.810> size<00:03:08.050> but<00:03:08.320> a<00:03:08.380> little

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
prime about the right size but a little

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.680 
prime about the right size but a little
bit<00:03:08.910> probably<00:03:09.910> with<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.150> right<00:03:10.270> size<00:03:10.510> of

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
bit probably with the right size of

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.110 
bit probably with the right size of
rough<00:03:10.810> stamps<00:03:11.170> so<00:03:11.950> anyway<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:12.370> guess<00:03:12.820> I'm<00:03:12.940> sorry

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
rough stamps so anyway I guess I'm sorry

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.400 
rough stamps so anyway I guess I'm sorry
for<00:03:13.270> instance<00:03:13.630> that's<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.990> end<00:03:14.140> that<00:03:14.290> we're

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
for instance that's the end that we're

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.230 
for instance that's the end that we're
on<00:03:14.530> I<00:03:14.860> wanna<00:03:15.580> see<00:03:15.670> if<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:15.790> can<00:03:15.910> zoom<00:03:15.970> in<00:03:16.150> a<00:03:16.180> little

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
on I wanna see if I can zoom in a little

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.700 
on I wanna see if I can zoom in a little
closer<00:03:16.510> so<00:03:16.720> you<00:03:16.840> can<00:03:16.900> see<00:03:17.020> what<00:03:17.290> I<00:03:17.320> still<00:03:17.530> do

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
closer so you can see what I still do

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:34.920 
closer so you can see what I still do
dad's<00:03:17.920> before

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.460 

all<00:03:35.470> right<00:03:35.650> I<00:03:35.680> got<00:03:35.890> a<00:03:35.920> zendo<00:03:36.340> closer<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:37.470> as

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
all right I got a zendo closer and as

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.869 
all right I got a zendo closer and as
you<00:03:38.620> can<00:03:38.709> see<00:03:38.860> there<00:03:39.040> are<00:03:39.099> plenty<00:03:39.129> of<00:03:39.400> inlet

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
you can see there are plenty of inlet

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.899 
you can see there are plenty of inlet
ventilation<00:03:40.450> has<00:03:40.599> to<00:03:40.780> keep<00:03:40.900> all<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.519> heat<00:03:42.519> you

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
ventilation has to keep all the heat you

let<00:05:13.840> us<00:05:13.960> see<00:05:14.199> we<00:05:14.500> got<00:05:14.650> a<00:05:14.919> power<00:05:15.220> ground

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
let us see we got a power ground

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.939 
let us see we got a power ground

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
when you get ground here you get powered

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.399 
when you get ground here you get powered
here<00:05:23.560> when<00:05:23.740> this<00:05:23.889> one<00:05:24.099> a<00:05:24.130> lot<00:05:24.810> powers<00:05:25.810> up<00:05:26.080> is

here when this one a lot powers up is

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.770 
here when this one a lot powers up is
amp<00:05:26.800> comes<00:05:26.979> on<00:05:27.190> so<00:05:27.610> it's<00:05:27.729> like<00:05:28.000> a<00:05:28.030> switch<00:05:28.539> power

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780
