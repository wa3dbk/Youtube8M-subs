coming

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
coming

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.690 
coming
I<00:03:19.319> absolutely<00:03:19.799> believe<00:03:20.069> you<00:03:20.310> have<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.519> be

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
I absolutely believe you have to be

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.620 
I absolutely believe you have to be
cleaner<00:03:21.230> yeah

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.900 

so<00:03:25.590> for<00:03:26.010> being<00:03:26.450> cut<00:03:27.450> dirty<00:03:27.750> walk<00:03:28.319> thing<00:03:28.910> this

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
so for being cut dirty walk thing this

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.280 
so for being cut dirty walk thing this
is<00:03:30.090> sort<00:03:30.329> of<00:03:30.389> goes<00:03:30.630> against<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.109> conventional

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
is sort of goes against the conventional

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.500 
is sort of goes against the conventional
approach<00:03:31.880> usually<00:03:32.880> when<00:03:33.000> people<00:03:33.269> are<00:03:33.329> trying

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
approach usually when people are trying

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.020 
approach usually when people are trying
to<00:03:33.630> put<00:03:33.780> on<00:03:33.930> muscle<00:03:36.049> they're<00:03:37.049> downing<00:03:37.380> pizza

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
to put on muscle they're downing pizza

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.720 
to put on muscle they're downing pizza

ice cream anything but then the health
market<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.299> was<00:03:42.420> talking<00:03:42.690> about<00:03:42.720> when<00:03:42.989> you

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
market that I was talking about when you

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.660

the<00:03:54.510> top<00:03:54.690> losen<00:03:54.989> is<00:03:55.109> basically<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.709> chemical

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
the top losen is basically the chemical

these processes take

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.780 
these processes take
in<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.290> form<00:04:02.530> of<00:04:02.620> calories<00:04:03.040> so<00:04:03.250> what<00:04:03.640> we're

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
in the form of calories so what we're

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.090 
in the form of calories so what we're
really<00:04:03.820> concerned<00:04:04.120> about<00:04:04.450> as<00:04:04.810> far<00:04:05.050> as<00:04:05.260> losing

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
really concerned about as far as losing

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.720 
really concerned about as far as losing
body<00:04:06.250> fat<00:04:06.400> is<00:04:07.360> always<00:04:07.810> how<00:04:08.140> we<00:04:08.200> can<00:04:08.730> increase

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
body fat is always how we can increase

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.150 
body fat is always how we can increase
that<00:04:10.060> metabolic<00:04:10.330> rate<00:04:10.720> or<00:04:10.950> boost<00:04:11.950> our

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
that metabolic rate or boost our

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.100 
that metabolic rate or boost our
metabolic<00:04:12.430> furnance<00:04:13.030> basically<00:04:13.510> and<00:04:13.840> there

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
metabolic furnance basically and there

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.199 
metabolic furnance basically and there
are<00:04:14.170> a<00:04:14.200> few<00:04:14.350> things<00:04:14.620> that<00:04:14.890> will<00:04:15.090> affect<00:04:16.090> our

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
are a few things that will affect our

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.160 
are a few things that will affect our
metabolism

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170

okay<00:04:17.590> what<00:04:17.739> I'm<00:04:17.830> talking<00:04:18.160> about<00:04:18.190> is<00:04:18.549> done

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
okay what I'm talking about is done

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.080 
okay what I'm talking about is done
hormones<00:04:20.140> that<00:04:20.680> are<00:04:20.739> naturally<00:04:21.489> produced<00:04:21.850> in

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
hormones that are naturally produced in

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.700 
hormones that are naturally produced in
your<00:04:22.240> body<00:04:22.450> your<00:04:22.840> natural<00:04:23.200> your<00:04:23.290> own<00:04:23.440> natural

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
your body your natural your own natural

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.210 
your body your natural your own natural
hormone<00:04:24.250> production<00:04:24.600> now<00:04:25.650> small<00:04:26.650> change<00:04:27.100> of

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
hormone production now small change of

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.650 
hormone production now small change of
hormones<00:04:27.490> are<00:04:27.610> very<00:04:27.760> powerful<00:04:28.210> things<00:04:28.450> so

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
hormones are very powerful things so

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.390 
hormones are very powerful things so
small<00:04:29.080> changes<00:04:29.560> in<00:04:29.620> your<00:04:29.800> hormones<00:04:30.220> can

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
small changes in your hormones can

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.660 
small changes in your hormones can
affect<00:04:30.460> big<00:04:31.000> changes<00:04:31.390> in<00:04:31.510> your<00:04:31.630> body<00:04:32.670> and

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
that's why even if you can insulate

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.260 
that's why even if you can insulate
certain<00:04:35.800> things<00:04:35.980> during<00:04:36.130> your<00:04:36.460> when<00:04:37.000> you<00:04:37.090> need

weight<00:04:37.600> training<00:04:37.930> and<00:04:38.140> less<00:04:38.320> stuff<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:39.180> cause

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
weight training and less stuff to cause

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.430 
weight training and less stuff to cause
changes<00:04:40.540> in<00:04:40.690> your<00:04:40.780> natural<00:04:41.170> hormone

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
changes in your natural hormone

changes in your natural hormone
production<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:42.460> can<00:04:42.640> cause<00:04:42.820> over<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.450> long

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
tonight to see get an idea of what we

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.990 
tonight to see get an idea of what we
can<00:04:59.050> do<00:04:59.200> to<00:04:59.350> manipulate<00:04:59.440> these<00:04:59.920> hormones<00:05:00.340> the

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
can do to manipulate these hormones the

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.850 
can do to manipulate these hormones the
two<00:05:01.180> that<00:05:01.360> we're<00:05:01.720> gonna<00:05:01.840> talk<00:05:02.470> about<00:05:02.770> our

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
two that we're gonna talk about our

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:14.040 
two that we're gonna talk about our
hormone<00:05:06.360> and<00:05:09.780> insulin<00:05:11.520> all<00:05:12.520> right<00:05:12.750> so<00:05:13.750> an

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
hormone and insulin all right so an

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.909 
hormone and insulin all right so an
interesting<00:05:14.290> thing<00:05:14.530> to<00:05:14.770> know<00:05:15.100> about<00:05:16.919> insulin

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
interesting thing to know about insulin

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:26.220 
interesting thing to know about insulin
and<00:05:20.130> growth<00:05:21.130> hormone<00:05:22.710> is<00:05:23.710> that<00:05:24.990> insulin<00:05:25.990> has<00:05:26.169> a

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
and growth hormone is that insulin has a

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.030 
and growth hormone is that insulin has a
little<00:05:26.650> bit<00:05:26.770> of<00:05:26.830> a<00:05:28.470> suppressing<00:05:29.470> or<00:05:29.650> limiting

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
little bit of a suppressing or limiting

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.030 
little bit of a suppressing or limiting
effect<00:05:30.370> on<00:05:30.580> your<00:05:30.730> growth<00:05:30.880> hormone<00:05:30.910> production

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
effect on your growth hormone production

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.440 
effect on your growth hormone production
after<00:05:33.040> eating<00:05:33.190> a<00:05:33.340> high<00:05:33.490> sugar<00:05:33.550> diet<00:05:33.850> and<00:05:34.360> your

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
after eating a high sugar diet and your

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.570 
after eating a high sugar diet and your
insulin<00:05:34.840> levels<00:05:35.200> are<00:05:35.320> slowly<00:05:36.120> rising<00:05:38.580> that's

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
insulin levels are slowly rising that's

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.140 
insulin levels are slowly rising that's
going<00:05:39.880> to<00:05:39.970> slightly<00:05:40.930> inhibit<00:05:41.650> the<00:05:42.580> release<00:05:42.730> or

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
going to slightly inhibit the release or

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.150 
going to slightly inhibit the release or
production<00:05:43.480> of<00:05:43.870> your<00:05:44.140> goal<00:05:44.440> hormone<00:05:44.830> levels

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
production of your goal hormone levels

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.870 
production of your goal hormone levels
which<00:05:45.340> will<00:05:45.550> be<00:05:45.700> dropped<00:05:46.630> down<00:05:47.370> so<00:05:48.370> that's

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
which will be dropped down so that's

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.810 
which will be dropped down so that's
another<00:05:49.210> reason<00:05:49.450> why<00:05:49.720> we<00:05:49.930> might<00:05:50.080> want<00:05:50.320> to<00:05:50.410> have

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.220 

that's<00:05:55.060> the<00:05:55.210> pumped<00:05:55.600> up<00:05:55.750> in<00:05:55.930> our<00:05:56.050> body

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
that's the pumped up in our body

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.530 
that's the pumped up in our body
interview<00:05:56.620> cases<00:05:57.070> so<00:05:57.550> that<00:05:57.580> we<00:05:57.850> can<00:05:58.000> optimize

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
interview cases so that we can optimize

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.780 
interview cases so that we can optimize
the<00:05:58.840> pulses<00:05:59.650> are<00:05:59.830> the<00:05:59.950> effect<00:06:00.250> of<00:06:00.430> their<00:06:00.610> goal

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
the pulses are the effect of their goal

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.330 
the pulses are the effect of their goal
