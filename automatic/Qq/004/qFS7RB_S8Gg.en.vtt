hey<00:00:05.279> guys<00:00:05.460> I'm<00:00:05.819> Erin<00:00:06.060> Edgar<00:00:06.300> and<00:00:06.479> this<00:00:06.990> is

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
hey guys I'm Erin Edgar and this is

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.260 
hey guys I'm Erin Edgar and this is
gonna<00:00:07.500> be<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.710> continuation<00:00:08.129> on<00:00:08.549> displacement

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.270 
gonna be a continuation on displacement

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.820 
gonna be a continuation on displacement
from<00:00:09.660> last<00:00:09.840> week<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.379> week<00:00:10.620> we're<00:00:10.770> gonna

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
from last week this week we're gonna

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:25.990 
from last week this week we're gonna
take<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.100> look<00:00:11.250> at<00:00:11.370> sixteenth<00:00:11.820> no<00:00:11.910> displacement

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.550 

moving<00:00:27.000> things<00:00:27.180> over<00:00:27.449> by<00:00:27.599> half<00:00:27.960> as<00:00:28.170> much<00:00:28.320> time

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
moving things over by half as much time

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.500 
moving things over by half as much time
as<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:29.099> were<00:00:29.250> previously<00:00:29.580> which<00:00:30.090> makes<00:00:30.300> them

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
as we were previously which makes them

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.470 
as we were previously which makes them
drastically<00:00:31.289> harder<00:00:31.940> in<00:00:32.940> fact<00:00:33.269> when<00:00:33.449> we

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
drastically harder in fact when we

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.840 
drastically harder in fact when we
displace<00:00:33.780> most<00:00:34.379> of<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.590> time<00:00:34.830> it<00:00:35.460> ends<00:00:35.790> up

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
displace most of the time it ends up

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.710 
displace most of the time it ends up
where<00:00:36.000> we're<00:00:36.120> not<00:00:36.210> actually<00:00:36.269> playing

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
where we're not actually playing

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.119 
where we're not actually playing
anything<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.769> pulse

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
anything on the pulse

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.630 
anything on the pulse
so<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.239> really<00:00:39.839> involves<00:00:40.739> some<00:00:41.129> extra<00:00:41.460> work

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
so that really involves some extra work

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.369 
so that really involves some extra work
and<00:00:41.790> getting<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.089> to<00:00:42.239> feel<00:00:42.420> right<00:00:42.659> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
and getting this to feel right the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.380 
and getting this to feel right the
entire<00:00:43.470> purpose<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.370> video<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.729> to<00:00:45.269> get

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
you being able to feel them and

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.469 
you being able to feel them and
internalize<00:00:47.280> them<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.150> can<00:00:48.180> apply

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:48.479 
internalize them so that you can apply

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:50.780 
internalize them so that you can apply
them<00:00:48.629> musically<00:00:49.339> alright<00:00:50.339> so<00:00:50.460> one<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
them musically alright so one of the

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.000 
them musically alright so one of the
most<00:00:50.970> important<00:00:51.540> things<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:52.290> this<00:00:52.530> subject

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
most important things with this subject

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.100 
most important things with this subject
is<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.790> be<00:00:53.909> able<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.119> hear<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.839> rhythms

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
is to be able to hear the rhythms

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.920 
is to be able to hear the rhythms
effectively<00:00:55.850> now<00:00:56.850> one<00:00:57.150> of<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.299> easiest<00:00:57.659> ways

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
effectively now one of the easiest ways

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.479 
effectively now one of the easiest ways
to<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.229> that<00:00:58.409> happening<00:00:58.830> is<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.250> play<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
to get that happening is to play the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.640 
to get that happening is to play the
beats<00:00:59.790> but<00:01:00.119> without<00:01:00.659> displacing<00:01:01.170> your<00:01:01.350> right

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
beats but without displacing your right

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:31.850 
beats but without displacing your right
hand<00:01:29.540> so<00:01:30.540> after<00:01:30.900> you've<00:01:31.080> played<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.410> beat

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
hand so after you've played that beat

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.170 
hand so after you've played that beat
enough<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.490> can<00:01:32.640> make<00:01:32.760> it<00:01:32.880> feel<00:01:33.150> good

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
enough that you can make it feel good

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.420 
enough that you can make it feel good

on<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.290> metronome<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:45.160> gives<00:02:45.459> them<00:02:45.610> something

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
on a metronome this gives them something

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.220 
on a metronome this gives them something
to<00:02:46.030> listen<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.570> it's<00:02:46.810> still<00:02:47.019> gonna<00:02:47.140> be

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
to listen to it's still gonna be

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.540 
to listen to it's still gonna be
probably<00:02:47.500> really<00:02:47.920> tough<00:02:48.130> for<00:02:48.310> people<00:02:48.430> to

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
probably really tough for people to

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.360 
probably really tough for people to
follow<00:02:48.910> but<00:02:49.780> they're<00:02:50.680> not<00:02:50.800> gonna<00:02:50.950> just<00:02:51.190> think

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
follow but they're not gonna just think

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.800 
follow but they're not gonna just think
you<00:02:51.459> screwed<00:02:51.700> up<00:02:51.940> because<00:02:52.180> if<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.480> don't<00:02:52.660> have

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
you screwed up because if you don't have

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.690 
you screwed up because if you don't have
that<00:02:52.959> reference<00:02:53.800> point<00:02:53.860> there<00:02:54.250> it's<00:02:54.459> just

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
that reference point there it's just

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.310 
that reference point there it's just
gonna<00:02:54.790> sound<00:02:55.000> like<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.269> screwed<00:02:55.450> up<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.840> then

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
gonna sound like you screwed up and then

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.380 
gonna sound like you screwed up and then
screwed<00:02:56.560> up<00:02:56.650> again<00:02:56.890> when<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.130> go<00:02:57.220> back<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:57.820> not

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
screwed up again when you go back so not

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:25.920 
screwed up again when you go back so not
a<00:02:58.420> good<00:02:58.630> thing<00:02:58.870> work<00:02:59.200> on<00:02:59.320> it<00:02:59.410> both<00:02:59.620> ways<00:03:24.930> after

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
a good thing work on it both ways after

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.270 
a good thing work on it both ways after
you're<00:03:26.049> comfortable<00:03:26.140> with<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:26.680> then<00:03:27.130> it's

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
you're comfortable with that then it's

00:03:27.280 --> 00:04:21.980 
you're comfortable with that then it's
time<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.459> take<00:03:27.850> it<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.120> drum<00:03:28.299> set

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:21.990 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.150 

so<00:04:22.990> now<00:04:23.110> that<00:04:23.200> you've<00:04:23.320> got<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.530> happening

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
so now that you've got that happening

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.770 
so now that you've got that happening
you're<00:04:24.520> well<00:04:24.760> on<00:04:24.790> your<00:04:24.970> way<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.270> making<00:04:25.600> this

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
you're well on your way to making this

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.530 
you're well on your way to making this
sound<00:04:25.990> good<00:04:26.290> the<00:04:27.040> next<00:04:27.190> step<00:04:27.490> is<00:04:28.090> moving<00:04:28.450> your

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
sound good the next step is moving your

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.300 
sound good the next step is moving your
right<00:04:28.720> hand<00:04:29.020> over<00:04:29.230> this<00:04:29.890> is<00:04:30.040> where<00:04:30.160> it<00:04:30.220> gets

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
right hand over this is where it gets

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.890 
right hand over this is where it gets
really<00:04:30.520> tough<00:04:30.790> so<00:04:31.180> make<00:04:31.450> sure<00:04:31.540> you<00:04:31.630> take<00:04:31.780> it

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
really tough so make sure you take it

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.330 
really tough so make sure you take it
really<00:04:32.200> slow<00:04:32.440> and<00:04:32.830> count<00:04:33.160> out<00:04:33.310> loud

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
really slow and count out loud

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.460 
really slow and count out loud
throughout<00:04:34.060> this<00:04:34.330> let's<00:04:34.630> try<00:04:34.870> just<00:04:35.320> the

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
throughout this let's try just the

00:04:35.470 --> 00:05:18.000 
throughout this let's try just the
displacement<00:05:16.320> all<00:05:17.320> right<00:05:17.470> now<00:05:17.740> that<00:05:17.890> we've

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
displacement all right now that we've

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.070 
displacement all right now that we've
come<00:05:18.190> this<00:05:18.220> far<00:05:18.400> this<00:05:19.000> last<00:05:19.420> piece<00:05:19.810> of<00:05:19.840> the

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
come this far this last piece of the

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.810 
come this far this last piece of the
puzzle<00:05:20.410> is<00:05:20.560> probably<00:05:21.130> going<00:05:21.340> to<00:05:21.430> be<00:05:21.550> kind<00:05:21.760> of

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
puzzle is probably going to be kind of

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.100 
puzzle is probably going to be kind of
difficult<00:05:22.060> because<00:05:22.420> now<00:05:22.510> we're<00:05:22.780> gonna<00:05:22.900> have

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
difficult because now we're gonna have

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.690 
difficult because now we're gonna have
to<00:05:23.230> hear<00:05:23.560> it<00:05:23.710> a<00:05:23.740> little<00:05:24.130> bit<00:05:24.280> more<00:05:24.490> and<00:05:24.550> it's

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
to hear it a little bit more and it's

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.060 
to hear it a little bit more and it's
gonna<00:05:24.820> be<00:05:25.000> louder<00:05:25.240> for<00:05:25.570> us<00:05:25.920> make<00:05:26.920> sure<00:05:26.950> you

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
gonna be louder for us make sure you

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.190 
gonna be louder for us make sure you
take<00:05:27.310> your<00:05:27.460> time<00:05:27.670> and<00:05:28.090> start<00:05:28.360> slower<00:05:28.810> than<00:05:29.110> you

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
take your time and start slower than you

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.900 
take your time and start slower than you
end<00:05:29.380> it<00:05:29.500> off<00:05:29.620> with<00:05:29.860> this<00:05:29.950> last<00:05:30.190> example<00:05:30.400> let's

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
end it off with this last example let's

00:05:30.910 --> 00:06:37.170 
end it off with this last example let's
put<00:05:31.480> it<00:05:31.570> on<00:05:31.630> the<00:05:31.690> drum<00:05:31.900> set

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.700 

we<00:06:38.180> can<00:06:38.330> of<00:06:38.420> course<00:06:38.450> displace<00:06:39.020> to<00:06:39.320> and<00:06:39.530> from

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
we can of course displace to and from

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.470 
we can of course displace to and from
any<00:06:39.980> point<00:06:40.310> in<00:06:40.460> the<00:06:40.550> meter<00:06:40.760> starting<00:06:41.360> or
