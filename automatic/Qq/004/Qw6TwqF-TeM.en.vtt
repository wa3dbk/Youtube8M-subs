00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
they're gonna collected yes you know

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.900 
they're gonna collected yes you know
sooo<00:03:06.570> bad<00:03:06.780> now<00:03:07.470> let<00:03:08.130> me<00:03:08.160> ask<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.460> this<00:03:08.490> when<00:03:08.790> it

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
sooo bad now let me ask you this when it

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
sooo bad now let me ask you this when it
comes<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.240> making<00:03:09.810> some<00:03:09.990> of<00:03:10.080> those<00:03:10.170> parts<00:03:11.930> what

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
comes to making some of those parts what

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.840 
comes to making some of those parts what
do<00:03:12.990> you<00:03:13.050> find<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.440> perfect<00:03:13.710> original<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.730> go

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
do you find a perfect original and go

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.280 
do you find a perfect original and go
backwards<00:03:15.360> or<00:03:15.540> how<00:03:15.660> does<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.900> work<00:03:16.050> absolutely

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
backwards or how does it work absolutely

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.530 
backwards or how does it work absolutely
of<00:03:16.920> night<00:03:17.130> night<00:03:17.400> when<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:17.670> look<00:03:17.970> for<00:03:18.180> parts<00:03:18.420> i

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
of night night when I look for parts i

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.830 
of night night when I look for parts i
look<00:03:18.750> for<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.080> word<00:03:19.260> nos<00:03:19.830> on<00:03:20.070> everything<00:03:20.520> and

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
look for the word nos on everything and

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.050 
look for the word nos on everything and
no<00:03:21.840> matter<00:03:22.020> what<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.260> costs<00:03:22.560> will<00:03:23.100> buy<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.310> Wow

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
no matter what it costs will buy it Wow

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.150 
no matter what it costs will buy it Wow
and<00:03:24.420> then<00:03:25.050> we'll<00:03:25.200> reverse<00:03:25.320> engineer<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:25.980> from

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
and then we'll reverse engineer it from

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.040 
and then we'll reverse engineer it from
there<00:03:26.370> sometimes<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.180> get<00:03:27.270> lucky<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:27.720> you

there sometimes you get lucky and you

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.530 
there sometimes you get lucky and you

get prints with the General Motors lines

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.390 
get prints with the General Motors lines
we've<00:03:30.720> been<00:03:30.840> lucky<00:03:30.990> to<00:03:31.170> get<00:03:31.260> some<00:03:31.440> prints<00:03:31.740> and

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
we've been lucky to get some prints and

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.740 
we've been lucky to get some prints and
we've<00:03:32.670> been<00:03:32.820> very<00:03:32.850> lucky<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.480> get<00:03:33.570> some

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
we've been very lucky to get some

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.690 
we've been very lucky to get some
original<00:03:34.110> tooling<00:03:34.440> mm-hmm<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.310> in<00:03:35.520> some

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
original tooling mm-hmm and in some

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.400 
original tooling mm-hmm and in some
cases<00:03:35.940> original<00:03:36.480> Tony's<00:03:36.750> in<00:03:36.810> great<00:03:37.020> shape<00:03:37.050> in

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
cases original Tony's in great shape in

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.860 
cases original Tony's in great shape in
some<00:03:37.590> cases<00:03:37.800> we<00:03:38.520> opted<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.880> retool<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:39.360> because

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
some cases we opted to retool it because

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.490 
some cases we opted to retool it because
the<00:03:40.530> penalties<00:03:40.890> just<00:03:41.130> shocked<00:03:41.750> well<00:03:42.750> it's<00:03:43.260> a

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
the penalties just shocked well it's a

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.520 
the penalties just shocked well it's a
commitment<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.820> quality<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.300> is<00:03:45.530> what

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
commitment to the quality that is what

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.720 
commitment to the quality that is what
makes<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.860> so<00:03:47.010> nice<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.340> work<00:03:47.459> with<00:03:47.520> these

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
makes it so nice to work with these

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.040 
makes it so nice to work with these
parts<00:03:48.120> because<00:03:48.390> people<00:03:48.660> don't<00:03:48.720> realize

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
parts because people don't realize

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.550 
parts because people don't realize
sometimes<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:50.790> part<00:03:51.060> cost<00:03:51.300> isn't<00:03:51.840> just<00:03:52.410> the

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
sometimes the part cost isn't just the

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.070 
sometimes the part cost isn't just the
price<00:03:53.459> of<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.670> cut<00:03:53.850> out<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.150> part<00:03:54.450> it's

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
price of the cut out of the part it's

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.010 
price of the cut out of the part it's
however<00:03:55.620> much<00:03:55.770> time<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.220> takes<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.810> rework<00:03:57.810> it

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
however much time it takes to rework it

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.170 
however much time it takes to rework it
or<00:03:58.170> make<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.320> fit<00:03:58.650> or<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:59.340> lot<00:03:59.790> of<00:03:59.880> times<00:04:00.030> make
