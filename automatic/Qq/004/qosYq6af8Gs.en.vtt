00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
scouring rush as well and it's you know

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.510 
scouring rush as well and it's you know
this<00:00:50.420> has<00:00:50.600> 60<00:00:51.140> about<00:00:51.530> roughly<00:00:51.860> sixty<00:00:52.340> percent

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
this has 60 about roughly sixty percent

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
this has 60 about roughly sixty percent
silica<00:00:53.150> and<00:00:53.780> I<00:00:54.050> think<00:00:54.260> about<00:00:54.470> 15<00:00:54.890> percent

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
silica and I think about 15 percent

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.790 
silica and I think about 15 percent
calcium<00:00:56.540> so<00:00:56.989> that's<00:00:57.140> what<00:00:57.290> gives<00:00:57.530> it<00:00:57.680> it's

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
calcium so that's what gives it it's

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.170 
calcium so that's what gives it it's
real<00:00:58.270> that<00:00:59.270> that<00:01:00.579> how<00:01:01.579> would<00:01:01.640> you<00:01:01.850> say<00:01:02.030> that

real that that how would you say that

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.229 
real that that how would you say that
slick<00:01:02.510> how<00:01:02.960> would<00:01:03.140> it's<00:01:03.410> kind<00:01:03.649> of<00:01:03.680> the<00:01:03.800> real

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
slick how would it's kind of the real

slick how would it's kind of the real
you<00:01:05.239> know<00:01:05.360> because<00:01:05.600> of<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:05.750> silica<00:01:06.140> content

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
you know because of the silica content

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:13.660 
you know because of the silica content
oh<00:01:11.350> yes<00:01:12.350> that's<00:01:12.590> no<00:01:13.040> that's<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:13.370> scouring

an enzyme firemen ease that that

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.780 
an enzyme firemen ease that that
destroys<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.600> vitamin<00:01:48.170> b1<00:01:48.560> or<00:01:48.799> depletes<00:01:49.640> it

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
in the body but it's easily reversible

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.460 
in the body but it's easily reversible
by<00:01:52.340> taking<00:01:52.700> vitamin<00:01:53.119> you<00:01:53.180> want<00:01:53.299> one<00:01:53.570> but<00:01:53.840> you

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
by taking vitamin you want one but you

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.929 
by taking vitamin you want one but you
would<00:01:54.650> really<00:01:54.860> want<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.130> eat<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.369> was<00:01:55.520> really

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
would really want to eat it was really

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:56.260 
would really want to eat it was really
bitter

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
bitter

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.820 
bitter
but<00:01:56.990> as<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:57.590> know<00:01:57.619> drying<00:01:58.010> it<00:01:58.189> out<00:01:58.310> it<00:01:58.549> gets<00:01:59.830> so

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
but as you know drying it out it gets so

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.499 
but as you know drying it out it gets so
but<00:02:01.250> this<00:02:01.369> is<00:02:01.549> really<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.880> one<00:02:01.970> you<00:02:02.150> wanted<00:02:02.390> to

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
but this is really the one you wanted to

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.380 
but this is really the one you wanted to
spit<00:02:02.750> some<00:02:03.560> brands<00:02:04.369> what's<00:02:04.790> that<00:02:04.939> one<00:02:05.090> brand

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
spit some brands what's that one brand

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.210 
spit some brands what's that one brand

they're<00:02:13.849> actually<00:02:14.209> saying<00:02:14.419> this<00:02:14.540> is<00:02:14.689> a<00:02:14.719> little

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
they're actually saying this is a little

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.539 
they're actually saying this is a little
bit<00:02:15.019> superior<00:02:15.379> because<00:02:16.040> it's<00:02:16.189> picked<00:02:16.430> in

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
bit superior because it's picked in

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.429 
bit superior because it's picked in
spring<00:02:16.819> time<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.269> it's<00:02:17.359> because<00:02:17.779> throughout

the year develops
a<00:02:19.379> few<00:02:19.739> qualities<00:02:20.219> that<00:02:20.400> sometimes<00:02:21.260> things

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
a few qualities that sometimes things

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.660 
a few qualities that sometimes things
that<00:02:22.499> may<00:02:22.620> irritate<00:02:22.829> the<00:02:23.189> kidneys<00:02:23.549> and

that may irritate the kidneys and
what-have-you<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:26.359> but<00:02:27.359> this<00:02:27.480> was<00:02:27.629> used

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
what-have-you and but this was used

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.140 
what-have-you and but this was used
fully<00:02:28.889> for<00:02:29.249> so<00:02:29.370> many<00:02:29.489> things<00:02:29.760> Native

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150

Americans<00:02:30.569> pruiting<00:02:30.900> they're<00:02:31.049> in<00:02:31.439> their

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
Americans pruiting they're in their

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.539 
Americans pruiting they're in their
moccasins<00:02:32.219> and<00:02:32.579> or<00:02:33.209> used<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:34.099> that<00:02:35.099> way<00:02:35.340> for

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
moccasins and or used it that way for

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.259 
moccasins and or used it that way for
cramps<00:02:35.879> as<00:02:36.359> a<00:02:36.389> foot<00:02:36.719> deodorizer<00:02:38.180> which<00:02:39.180> you

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
cramps as a foot deodorizer which you

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.569 
cramps as a foot deodorizer which you
can<00:02:39.420> see<00:02:39.629> with<00:02:39.810> having<00:02:40.200> silicon<00:02:40.620> calcium<00:02:40.829> that

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
can see with having silicon calcium that

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.699 
can see with having silicon calcium that
really<00:02:41.849> does<00:02:42.060> make<00:02:42.239> sense<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.840> use<00:02:43.439> it<00:02:43.469> for

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
really does make sense to use it for

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.750 
really does make sense to use it for
that<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:46.200> they<00:02:46.290> used<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.620> in<00:02:46.739> some<00:02:46.950> types<00:02:47.639> of

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
that and they used it in some types of

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.809 
that and they used it in some types of
horse<00:02:48.000> medicine<00:02:48.260> but<00:02:49.260> it's<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.159> very<00:02:50.489> good

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
horse medicine but it's a very good

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.690 
horse medicine but it's a very good

actually so any basically anything that
if<00:02:56.609> you<00:02:56.730> look<00:02:56.849> up<00:02:56.969> silica<00:02:57.449> uses<00:02:58.139> of<00:02:58.290> silica

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
if you look up silica uses of silica

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.979 
if you look up silica uses of silica
healthy<00:02:59.069> uses<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.489> silica<00:02:59.879> anything<00:03:00.810> that

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
healthy uses of silica anything that

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.349 
healthy uses of silica anything that
that<00:03:01.349> you<00:03:01.469> see<00:03:01.680> there<00:03:01.919> this<00:03:02.790> would<00:03:03.000> would<00:03:03.299> be
