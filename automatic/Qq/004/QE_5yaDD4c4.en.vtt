these Rangers Michael is going to use to

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.799 
these Rangers Michael is going to use to
deploy<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.789> hollow<00:00:54.059> field<00:00:54.449> he's<00:00:54.660> gonna

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
deploy the hollow field he's gonna

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.990 
deploy the hollow field he's gonna
deploy<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> hollow<00:00:55.559> field<00:00:55.890> right<00:00:56.280> there<00:00:56.309> and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
deploy the hollow field right there and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.990 
deploy the hollow field right there and
the<00:00:57.870> banshees<00:00:58.530> are<00:00:59.160> gonna<00:00:59.370> go<00:00:59.730> into<00:00:59.940> that

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the banshees are gonna go into that

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.130 
the banshees are gonna go into that
field<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.920> won't<00:01:02.190> be<00:01:02.340> able<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.609> see<00:01:02.820> them<00:01:03.140> any

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
field so I won't be able to see them any

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.789 
field so I won't be able to see them any
detector<00:01:04.949> unit<00:01:05.250> should<00:01:05.400> be<00:01:05.460> able<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:06.799> ruin

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
detector unit should be able to ruin

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.800 
detector unit should be able to ruin
this<00:01:07.979> strategy<00:01:08.549> but<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.240> Tier<00:01:09.479> one<00:01:09.510> it's

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
this strategy but in Tier one it's

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.480 
this strategy but in Tier one it's
particularly<00:01:10.560> effective<00:01:10.920> because<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.189> don't

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
particularly effective because you don't

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.969 
particularly effective because you don't
have<00:01:11.640> detector<00:01:12.119> units<00:01:12.420> yet<00:01:12.600> I'm<00:01:13.260> gonna<00:01:13.680> see

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
have detector units yet I'm gonna see

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.249 
have detector units yet I'm gonna see
just<00:01:14.670> these<00:01:14.909> units<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> wharf

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
just these units here just the wharf

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.990 
just these units here just the wharf
spider<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.890> guardian<00:01:17.250> squad<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.820> I'm

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
spider and the guardian squad and I'm

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.249 
spider and the guardian squad and I'm
gonna<00:01:18.150> think<00:01:18.450> well<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.630> take<00:01:19.020> these<00:01:19.200> guys

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
gonna think well I can take these guys

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.070 
gonna think well I can take these guys
out<00:01:19.740> no<00:01:19.920> problem<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.030> I'm<00:01:21.210> gonna<00:01:21.360> advance<00:01:21.810> up

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
out no problem so I'm gonna advance up

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.780 
out no problem so I'm gonna advance up
to<00:01:22.110> here

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
to here

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.510 
to here
the<00:01:24.090> banshees<00:01:24.750> are<00:01:25.229> gonna<00:01:25.860> wait<00:01:26.100> till<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.340> get

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the banshees are gonna wait till I get

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.830 
the banshees are gonna wait till I get
there<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:26.970> then<00:01:27.180> they're<00:01:27.360> gonna<00:01:27.420> come

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
there and then they're gonna come

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.580 
there and then they're gonna come
through<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.740> hollow<00:01:29.640> field<00:01:30.060> right<00:01:30.689> there<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
through the hollow field right there and

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.080 
through the hollow field right there and
I'm<00:01:31.710> gonna<00:01:31.829> actually<00:01:32.220> pause<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.909> can

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
I'm gonna actually pause this so I can

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.609 
I'm gonna actually pause this so I can
switch<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.479> my<00:01:33.780> point<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.229> view<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.560> you

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
switch it to my point of view so you

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.010 
switch it to my point of view so you
guys<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:35.009> see<00:01:35.189> what's<00:01:35.460> going<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.909> or<00:01:36.659> see<00:01:36.869> what

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
guys can see what's going on or see what

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.679 
guys can see what's going on or see what
I<00:01:37.049> see<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.590> see<00:01:37.799> how<00:01:38.009> effective<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.540> be

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
I see to see how effective this can be

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.789 
I see to see how effective this can be
so<00:01:40.259> here<00:01:40.409> we<00:01:40.470> go

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
so here we go

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.399 
so here we go
we'll<00:01:41.759> go<00:01:41.880> full<00:01:42.150> speed<00:01:42.299> all<00:01:42.689> right<00:01:42.840> I'm<00:01:43.049> coming

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
we'll go full speed all right I'm coming

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.850 
we'll go full speed all right I'm coming

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
up and as you can see the banshees

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.730 
up and as you can see the banshees
disappear<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.670> see<00:01:47.909> them<00:01:48.470> normally<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.560> won't

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
disappear I see them normally you won't

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.980 
disappear I see them normally you won't
see<00:01:49.979> them<00:01:50.159> like<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.549> but<00:01:50.880> they'll<00:01:51.540> appear

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
see them like that but they'll appear

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.380 
see them like that but they'll appear
here

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
here

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.530 
here
and<00:01:53.950> it<00:01:54.950> happened<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:55.550> quickly<00:01:55.820> that<00:01:55.970> I<00:01:56.180> can't

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
and it happened so quickly that I can't

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.320 
and it happened so quickly that I can't
retrieve<00:01:56.870> my<00:01:57.020> tactical<00:01:57.560> block<00:01:58.780> this<00:01:59.780> is

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
retrieve my tactical block this is

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.610 
retrieve my tactical block this is
extremely<00:02:02.330> effective<00:02:02.630> against<00:02:03.140> tactical

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
extremely effective against tactical

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.530 
extremely effective against tactical

Tier<00:02:05.720> one<00:02:05.750> when<00:02:06.080> they<00:02:06.170> don't<00:02:06.380> have<00:02:06.500> the

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
Tier one when they don't have the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.880 
Tier one when they don't have the
sergeant<00:02:07.190> they're<00:02:07.940> just<00:02:08.240> not<00:02:08.509> melee<00:02:09.170> oriented

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
sergeant they're just not melee oriented

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.120 
sergeant they're just not melee oriented
so<00:02:10.330> if<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.540> can<00:02:11.780> get<00:02:11.960> your<00:02:12.080> banshees<00:02:12.620> up<00:02:12.800> close

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
so if you can get your banshees up close

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.010 
so if you can get your banshees up close
you're<00:02:13.610> gonna<00:02:13.730> do<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.940> lot<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.210> damage<00:02:14.450> if<00:02:14.780> you

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
you're gonna do a lot of damage if you

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.340 
you're gonna do a lot of damage if you
have<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:16.180> aspect<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.360> banshee<00:02:17.900> ability

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
have the aspect of banshee ability

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.840 
have the aspect of banshee ability
that's<00:02:18.620> even<00:02:18.920> better<00:02:19.100> because<00:02:19.310> once<00:02:19.640> they

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
that's even better because once they

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.940 
that's even better because once they
retreat<00:02:20.210> you<00:02:20.330> can<00:02:20.510> fleet<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.810> foot<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.410> stay

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
retreat you can fleet a foot and stay

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.770 
retreat you can fleet a foot and stay
with<00:02:22.190> them<00:02:22.430> for<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.700> longer<00:02:23.240> period<00:02:23.540> of<00:02:23.720> time

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
with them for a longer period of time

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.900 
with them for a longer period of time
dealing<00:02:24.680> more<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:25.190> more<00:02:25.340> damage<00:02:25.640> as<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.870> go

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
dealing more and more damage as you go

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.630 
dealing more and more damage as you go
so<00:02:28.910> in<00:02:29.390> Tier<00:02:29.840> one<00:02:29.870> if<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.440> can<00:02:30.620> use<00:02:31.400> this

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
so in Tier one if you can use this

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.620 
so in Tier one if you can use this
effectively<00:02:32.709> it's<00:02:34.630> particularly

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
effectively it's particularly

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.170 
effectively it's particularly
devastating<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.980> those<00:02:37.220> players<00:02:37.580> that<00:02:38.030> you

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
devastating to those players that you

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.580 
devastating to those players that you
just<00:02:38.330> hate<00:02:38.510> playing<00:02:38.810> against<00:02:39.230> because<00:02:39.410> all

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
just hate playing against because all

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.920 
just hate playing against because all
they<00:02:39.740> do<00:02:39.800> is<00:02:40.100> just<00:02:40.340> spam<00:02:40.640> tactical<00:02:41.300> Marines<00:02:41.630> or

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
they do is just spam tactical Marines or

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.370 
they do is just spam tactical Marines or
shoot<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.650> boys<00:02:42.830> or<00:02:43.160> whatever<00:02:43.690> it's<00:02:44.690> effective

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
shoot a boys or whatever it's effective

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.490 
shoot a boys or whatever it's effective
later<00:02:45.680> on<00:02:45.950> in<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.459> later<00:02:46.670> tiers<00:02:47.030> as<00:02:47.240> well

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
later on in the later tiers as well

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.620 
later on in the later tiers as well
although<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.680> don't<00:02:48.830> like<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:49.490> as<00:02:49.580> much<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:50.450> I'm

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
although I don't like it as much and I'm

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.520 
although I don't like it as much and I'm
not<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.380> elder<00:02:51.740> player<00:02:52.070> really<00:02:52.459> my<00:02:53.000> key<00:02:53.270> is

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
not the elder player really my key is

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.380 
not the elder player really my key is
but<00:02:54.530> it's<00:02:54.890> good<00:02:55.160> at<00:02:55.340> concealing<00:02:55.970> how<00:02:56.240> many

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
but it's good at concealing how many

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.840 
but it's good at concealing how many
units<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.930> have<00:02:57.110> so<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.800> enemy<00:02:58.220> doesn't<00:02:58.700> know

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
units you have so the enemy doesn't know

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.270 
units you have so the enemy doesn't know
your<00:02:59.420> exact<00:02:59.810> numbers<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.709> he's<00:03:00.800> not<00:03:01.010> sure<00:03:01.160> if

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
your exact numbers and he's not sure if

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.330 
your exact numbers and he's not sure if
he<00:03:01.370> wants<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.670> attack<00:03:01.790> or<00:03:02.680> if<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.950> use<00:03:04.160> it

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
he wants to attack or if you use it

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.150 
he wants to attack or if you use it
right<00:03:04.550> it's<00:03:05.360> good<00:03:05.720> at<00:03:05.959> any<00:03:06.410> point<00:03:06.800> in<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:06.950> game

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
right it's good at any point in the game

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160 
right it's good at any point in the game
but<00:03:07.550> I<00:03:07.610> think<00:03:07.700> it's<00:03:08.060> harder<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.510> use<00:03:08.540> in<00:03:09.080> the

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
but I think it's harder to use in the

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.100 
but I think it's harder to use in the
later<00:03:09.380> stages<00:03:09.800> just<00:03:10.630> because<00:03:11.630> of<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.840> massive

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
later stages just because of the massive

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.810 
later stages just because of the massive
number<00:03:12.650> of<00:03:12.769> units<00:03:13.070> that<00:03:13.130> you<00:03:13.340> have<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.610> worry

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
number of units that you have to worry

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.920 
number of units that you have to worry
about<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.450> there's<00:03:14.630> a<00:03:14.720> lot<00:03:14.900> of

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
about and there's a lot of

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.630 
about and there's a lot of
micromanagement<00:03:15.650> involved<00:03:16.160> making<00:03:16.340> sure

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
micromanagement involved making sure

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.330 
micromanagement involved making sure
that<00:03:16.820> you<00:03:16.970> have<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.620> correct<00:03:18.620> units<00:03:19.070> in<00:03:19.250> the

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
that you have the correct units in the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.080 
that you have the correct units in the
hollow<00:03:19.550> field<00:03:19.940> so<00:03:21.250> again<00:03:22.250> this<00:03:22.459> strategy<00:03:22.970> is

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
hollow field so again this strategy is

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.729 
hollow field so again this strategy is
called<00:03:23.330> hollow<00:03:23.720> she's<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:26.230> there<00:03:27.230> is<00:03:27.350> a<00:03:27.380> build

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
called hollow she's and there is a build

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.259 
called hollow she's and there is a build
order<00:03:28.250> for<00:03:28.550> it

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
order for it

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.060 
order for it
I'll<00:03:29.540> put<00:03:29.989> that<00:03:30.110> up<00:03:30.170> for<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:30.590> guys<00:03:30.800> in<00:03:31.040> the

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
I'll put that up for you guys in the

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.910 
I'll put that up for you guys in the
description<00:03:32.019> we<00:03:33.019> didn't<00:03:33.350> use<00:03:33.500> that<00:03:33.530> build

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
description we didn't use that build

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.040 
description we didn't use that build
order<00:03:34.310> obviously<00:03:34.940> we<00:03:35.120> just<00:03:35.360> built<00:03:35.570> some<00:03:35.720> units

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
order obviously we just built some units

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.090 
order obviously we just built some units
and<00:03:36.290> set<00:03:36.530> up<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.769> strategy<00:03:37.780> so<00:03:38.860> again<00:03:39.860> you'll

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
and set up the strategy so again you'll

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.400 
and set up the strategy so again you'll
need<00:03:40.310> rangers<00:03:41.140> upgraded<00:03:42.140> with<00:03:42.290> the

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
need rangers upgraded with the

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.259 
need rangers upgraded with the
Pathfinder<00:03:43.070> gear<00:03:43.310> so<00:03:43.489> that<00:03:43.610> they<00:03:43.730> can<00:03:43.940> use<00:03:44.090> the

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
Pathfinder gear so that they can use the

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.810 
Pathfinder gear so that they can use the
hollow<00:03:44.510> field<00:03:44.930> you'll<00:03:45.739> need<00:03:45.950> banshees<00:03:46.580> you

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
hollow field you'll need banshees you

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.810 
hollow field you'll need banshees you
don't<00:03:47.060> need<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:48.050> aspect<00:03:48.560> of<00:03:48.680> banshee<00:03:49.190> but<00:03:49.700> it

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
don't need the aspect of banshee but it

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.780 
don't need the aspect of banshee but it
is<00:03:49.970> nice<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.209> have<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:51.280> that's<00:03:52.280> pretty<00:03:52.640> much

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
it again it's called hollow she's and

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.270 
it again it's called hollow she's and
the<00:03:56.120> main<00:03:56.570> ability<00:03:57.080> you<00:03:57.200> need<00:03:57.380> is<00:03:57.680> hollow
