alright<00:02:00.800> guys<00:02:00.920> so<00:02:01.040> parts<00:02:01.850> of<00:02:01.910> it<00:02:02.060> get<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.210> little

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
alright guys so parts of it get a little

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.990 
alright guys so parts of it get a little
dry<00:02:02.800> just<00:02:03.800> like<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.100> outer<00:02:04.460> edges<00:02:04.730> of<00:02:04.880> the

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
dry just like the outer edges of the

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.150 
dry just like the outer edges of the
pasta<00:02:05.360> here's<00:02:05.930> another<00:02:06.140> little<00:02:06.350> dry<00:02:06.680> one<00:02:06.890> so<00:02:07.130> I

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
pasta here's another little dry one so I

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.480 
pasta here's another little dry one so I
mean<00:02:08.140> they're<00:02:09.140> kind<00:02:09.380> of<00:02:09.440> unavoidable<00:02:09.890> when

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
mean they're kind of unavoidable when

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.400 
mean they're kind of unavoidable when
you're<00:02:10.670> baking<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:11.120> like<00:02:11.870> this<00:02:12.020> unless<00:02:12.290> you

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
you're baking it like this unless you

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.520 
you're baking it like this unless you
completely<00:02:12.890> cover<00:02:13.190> it<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:14.380> there<00:02:15.380> definitely

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
completely cover it so there definitely

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.650 
completely cover it so there definitely
are<00:02:15.770> some<00:02:15.800> dry<00:02:16.100> spots<00:02:16.370> but<00:02:16.580> it's<00:02:17.270> no<00:02:17.480> big<00:02:17.630> deal

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
are some dry spots but it's no big deal

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.470 
are some dry spots but it's no big deal
in<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.800> grand<00:02:19.040> scheme<00:02:19.190> of<00:02:19.340> things<00:02:19.490> I'd<00:02:20.270> say

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480
