00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.410 
here is miles and Merc inside this cool
photon<00:00:30.740> spaceship<00:00:31.740> right<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.730> they<00:00:32.820> can<00:00:32.940> fly

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
photon spaceship right so they can fly

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.990 
photon spaceship right so they can fly
away<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:35.270> push<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.420> button<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.640> they<00:00:38.640> fly

away you push the button and they fly
and<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.570> know<00:00:39.690> what<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.020> would<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.200> pretty

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
and you know what that would be pretty

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.660 
and you know what that would be pretty
cool<00:00:40.620> by<00:00:40.770> itself<00:00:40.800> right<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.399> push<00:00:41.550> the

up to but you know what's even cooler
we've<00:01:00.420> got<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.750> remote<00:01:01.199> control<00:01:01.620> now<00:01:02.160> watch

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
we've got this remote control now watch

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.860 
we've got this remote control now watch
what<00:01:02.520> happens<00:01:02.969> when<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.390> push<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.719> button

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
what happens when we push this button

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.840 
what happens when we push this button
right<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.159> kind<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.369> get<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> little

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
right here so I kind of get it a little

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.280 
right here so I kind of get it a little
bit<00:01:06.090> further<00:01:06.330> away<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:07.110> push<00:01:08.720> it<00:01:09.720> lights<00:01:10.020> up

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
bit further away and push it lights up

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.719 
bit further away and push it lights up
but<00:01:11.220> that's<00:01:11.490> not<00:01:11.729> all<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:11.939> does<00:01:12.119> know<00:01:13.729> he's

but that's not all it does know he's

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.070 
but that's not all it does know he's
starting<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.119> spin<00:01:15.509> what's<00:01:16.080> he<00:01:16.229> doing

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
starting to spin what's he doing

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.440 
starting to spin what's he doing
they're<00:01:18.650> gonna<00:01:18.800> launch<00:01:19.040> off<00:01:19.370> into<00:01:19.670> space<00:01:19.790> whoa

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
they're gonna launch off into space whoa

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.010 
they're gonna launch off into space whoa
look<00:01:21.170> at<00:01:21.260> that

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
look at that

button right here and up they go so
first<00:01:39.860> they<00:01:40.070> light<00:01:40.280> up<00:01:40.310> then<00:01:40.820> he<00:01:40.940> slowly

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
first they light up then he slowly

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.290 
first they light up then he slowly
starts<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.800> rise<00:01:43.870> then<00:01:44.870> they<00:01:45.020> start<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:45.410> spin

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
starts to rise then they start to spin

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.970 
starts to rise then they start to spin
and<00:01:47.300> you<00:01:47.450> know<00:01:49.660> but<00:01:50.660> this<00:01:50.780> toy<00:01:50.990> does<00:01:51.500> even<00:01:51.770> more

and you know but this toy does even more
cool<00:01:52.250> things<00:01:53.500> well<00:01:54.500> in<00:01:54.680> miles<00:01:54.980> and<00:01:55.340> Merc<00:01:56.060> are

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
cool things well in miles and Merc are

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.030 
cool things well in miles and Merc are
on<00:01:56.390> a<00:01:56.420> strange<00:01:56.780> planet<00:01:56.900> they<00:01:57.560> need<00:01:57.800> to<00:01:57.860> be<00:01:57.980> able

on a strange planet they need to be able

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.470 
on a strange planet they need to be able
to<00:01:58.190> drive<00:01:58.400> around<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.000> we<00:01:59.090> can<00:01:59.210> use<00:01:59.360> this

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
to drive around so we can use this

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.660 
to drive around so we can use this
remote<00:01:59.660> control<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:02.440> they're<00:02:03.440> able<00:02:03.680> to<00:02:03.980> drive

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.100 
this now this part comes with batteries
but<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.880> remote-control<00:02:53.480> needs<00:02:53.780> two

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
but the remote-control needs two

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.050 
but the remote-control needs two
doublea's<00:02:54.770> so<00:02:55.220> make<00:02:55.370> sure<00:02:55.400> you<00:02:55.580> get<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:56.030> have

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060
