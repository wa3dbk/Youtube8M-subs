00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
we need it but I think this one's

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.080 
of s30v steel which i think is a very
nice<00:01:50.840> steel<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:52.700> not<00:01:53.700> too<00:01:54.060> brittle<00:01:54.689> but

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
nice steel it's not too brittle but

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.200 
nice steel it's not too brittle but
holds<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.149> edge<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> very<00:01:58.380> long<00:01:58.530> time<00:01:58.590> I

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210
