00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.660 

the<00:00:00.420> idea<00:00:00.750> of<00:00:00.810> pushing<00:00:01.230> down<00:00:01.610> to<00:00:02.929> to<00:00:03.929> prevent<00:00:04.380> a

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:04.670 
the idea of pushing down to to prevent a

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.249 
the idea of pushing down to to prevent a
force<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:05.940> this<00:00:06.210> direction<00:00:06.270> think<00:00:06.930> about<00:00:07.109> this

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
force in this direction think about this

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.950 
force in this direction think about this
you<00:00:07.440> got<00:00:07.620> 90<00:00:07.950> degrees<00:00:08.309> between<00:00:09.090> pushing<00:00:09.540> down

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
you got 90 degrees between pushing down

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.930 
you got 90 degrees between pushing down
and<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.679> force<00:00:10.889> you're<00:00:11.099> trying<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.580> resist

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
and the force you're trying to resist

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.480 
and the force you're trying to resist
whereas<00:00:12.840> by<00:00:13.170> pushing<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.740> opposite<00:00:14.219> side

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
whereas by pushing on the opposite side

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.029 
whereas by pushing on the opposite side
the<00:00:15.150> forces<00:00:15.630> are<00:00:15.780> now<00:00:15.960> parallel<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.890> each

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
the forces are now parallel to each

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.529 
the forces are now parallel to each
other<00:00:17.480> if<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.869> were<00:00:19.550> to<00:00:20.550> put<00:00:21.080> this<00:00:22.080> surface<00:00:23.010> here

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
other if I were to put this surface here

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.080 
other if I were to put this surface here
leather<00:00:24.539> or<00:00:24.810> suede<00:00:25.500> as<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.250> case<00:00:26.460> may<00:00:26.670> be<00:00:26.699> and

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
leather or suede as the case may be and

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.320 
leather or suede as the case may be and
you<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:28.050> leather<00:00:28.380> glove<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.789> your<00:00:30.090> hand

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
you have a leather glove on in your hand

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.510 
you have a leather glove on in your hand
we<00:00:30.990> can<00:00:31.230> suddenly<00:00:31.470> see<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.130> that's<00:00:32.250> going<00:00:32.369> to

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
we can suddenly see that that's going to

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.790 
we can suddenly see that that's going to
be<00:00:32.669> kind<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.059> slippery<00:00:33.510> right<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.110> can<00:00:34.469> easily

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
be kind of slippery right I can easily

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.650 
be kind of slippery right I can easily
push<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.460> thing<00:00:35.700> out<00:00:35.910> from<00:00:36.120> underneath<00:00:36.450> no

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
push that thing out from underneath no

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.330 
push that thing out from underneath no
matter<00:00:36.840> how<00:00:37.290> hard<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.649> push<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:38.129> would<00:00:38.219> be

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
matter how hard you push it would be

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.490 
matter how hard you push it would be
pretty<00:00:38.550> easy<00:00:38.730> for<00:00:38.879> me<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.149> do<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.570> but<00:00:40.350> look

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
pretty easy for me to do that but look

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.330 
pretty easy for me to do that but look
at<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.739> for<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.980> second<00:00:42.469> if<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.680> wrap<00:00:44.040> this

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
at this for a second if I wrap this

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.310 
at this for a second if I wrap this
around<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.149> steering<00:00:45.600> wheel<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:47.030> I<00:00:48.079> do<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
around the steering wheel and I do the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.049 
around the steering wheel and I do the
same<00:00:49.770> ridiculous<00:00:50.309> 90<00:00:50.940> degrees<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.710> force

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
same ridiculous 90 degrees of force

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.939 
same ridiculous 90 degrees of force
comparison<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.449> do<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.410> order<00:00:55.649> if

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
comparison here to do that in order if

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.770 
comparison here to do that in order if
it's<00:00:56.160> wrapped<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.640> way<00:00:56.760> around<00:00:56.850> that

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
it's wrapped all the way around that

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.470 
it's wrapped all the way around that
pushing<00:00:58.320> down<00:00:58.559> now<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> squeezing<00:01:01.100> okay<00:01:02.480> so

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
pushing down now is a squeezing okay so

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.390 
pushing down now is a squeezing okay so
what<00:01:03.780> you're<00:01:03.930> doing<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.470> you're<00:01:04.710> relying<00:01:05.129> on

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
what you're doing is you're relying on

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.880 
what you're doing is you're relying on
just<00:01:06.000> purely<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.750> friction<00:01:07.380> between<00:01:07.409> your

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
just purely the friction between your

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.950 
just purely the friction between your
hand<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> glove<00:01:08.700> or<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> should<00:01:09.810> say

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
hand and the glove or you I should say

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.240 
hand and the glove or you I should say
your<00:01:10.140> glove<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.619> steering<00:01:10.920> wheel<00:01:11.070> in

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
your glove and the steering wheel in

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.450 
your glove and the steering wheel in
order<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:12.000> turn<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.479> because<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.920> relaxed

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
order to turn it because if you relaxed

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.780 
order to turn it because if you relaxed
your<00:01:14.610> grip<00:01:15.770> your<00:01:16.770> hand<00:01:16.830> would<00:01:17.159> slide<00:01:17.430> across

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
your grip your hand would slide across

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.969 
your grip your hand would slide across
it<00:01:18.799> okay<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:21.090> as<00:01:21.420> ridiculous<00:01:21.900> as<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.200> seems<00:01:22.619> to

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
it okay so as ridiculous as it seems to

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.670 
it okay so as ridiculous as it seems to
to<00:01:23.549> push<00:01:24.030> down<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.750> surface<00:01:25.140> here<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.560> me

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
to push down on the surface here for me

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.100 
to push down on the surface here for me
to<00:01:25.830> prevent<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.369> from<00:01:26.610> sliding<00:01:27.020> for<00:01:28.020> you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
to prevent that from sliding for you

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.960 
to prevent that from sliding for you
trying<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.470> prevent<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.829> from<00:01:28.979> sliding<00:01:29.250> that

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
trying to prevent that from sliding that

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.090 
trying to prevent that from sliding that
would<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.420> same<00:01:30.659> as<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.960> squeezing<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
would be the same as you squeezing the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.330 
would be the same as you squeezing the
steering<00:01:32.490> wheel<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.850> order<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.240> turn<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.689> it

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
steering wheel in order to turn it it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.679 
steering wheel in order to turn it it
seems<00:01:35.340> ridiculous<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.240> case<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
seems ridiculous in the case of the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.039 
seems ridiculous in the case of the
brick<00:01:37.130> but<00:01:38.130> yet<00:01:38.400> for<00:01:38.640> some<00:01:39.210> reason<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.840> doesn't

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
brick but yet for some reason it doesn't

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.800 
brick but yet for some reason it doesn't
seem<00:01:40.560> ridiculous<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:42.329> case<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
seem ridiculous in the case of the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.350 
seem ridiculous in the case of the
steering<00:01:43.200> wheel<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.700> it<00:01:44.700> has<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.149> do<00:01:45.329> with

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
steering wheel and it has to do with

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.719 
steering wheel and it has to do with
what's<00:01:45.780> called<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.140> paradigm<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.950> it

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
what's called the paradigm and it

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.200 
what's called the paradigm and it
happens<00:01:48.119> since<00:01:48.780> birth<00:01:49.490> since<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.670> moment<00:01:50.939> you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
happens since birth since the moment you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.480 
happens since birth since the moment you
came<00:01:51.420> out<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> womb<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.409> mama<00:01:53.159> came<00:01:53.460> up

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
came out of the womb and mama came up

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.230 
came out of the womb and mama came up
and<00:01:53.850> put<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> bottle<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.720> your<00:01:54.780> mouth<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:56.240> you

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
and put a bottle in your mouth and you

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.300 
and put a bottle in your mouth and you
that<00:01:57.360> bottle<00:01:57.570> she<00:01:58.170> put<00:01:58.380> your<00:01:58.530> hand<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.219> and

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that bottle she put your hand on it and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.010 
that bottle she put your hand on it and
you<00:01:59.939> grab<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:01.259> falls<00:02:01.619> out<00:02:02.750> mama<00:02:03.750> then

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
you grab it and it falls out mama then

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.350 
you grab it and it falls out mama then
picks<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.619> bottle<00:02:05.219> she<00:02:05.610> puts<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.000> back<00:02:06.180> in

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
picks up the bottle she puts it back in

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.210
