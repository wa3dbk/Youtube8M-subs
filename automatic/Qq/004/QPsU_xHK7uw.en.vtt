00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.540
 very good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.950
 new video of your week in gta 5 in the 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.560
 that we bring new new topics 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.080
 questions new things to analyze that 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.029
 correct with regard to videos 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.000
 before and let's start right away 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:30.429
 because there are five themes 5 themes 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.429
 specials without further we begin 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:54.790
 as a first issue we have a correction 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.700
 to a failure that was in the video analysis 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.010
 of grand theft auto 5 and is that right in 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.460
 this moment we see smoke on the water 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:07.540
 that in the analysis in we are going to be 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.369
 it was about a default album and it's not 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.190
 an album but a song the famous 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.710
 group song and probably this 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.680
 be a nod to the group and to the 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.990
 song by rockstar 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.720
 Second, we wanted to analyze the 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.790
 crosshead that comes out when we inflict damage 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.580
 about someone but yes it is true that 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.830
 it happens when we hurt him but 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.010
 when we simply kill him and what 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.620
 we analyze thoroughly in this way because 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.720
 apart from that with the sniper it does not appear 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.210
 crosshead when no infiltrates 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.900
 damage as you can see between frames 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.670
 frame does not come out the crosshead but yes that 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:51.220
 happens with the gun just when the 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.140
 michael does not hurt the cross is red 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.979
 although in the past it 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.350
 we could appreciate is a gray species 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.570
 slightly with some opacity what 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.930
 makes the blood that comes out of the 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.940
 person who kills dye lightly 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.509
 The crosshead is red but the crosshead is 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.390
 gray and as we can see there appears the 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.640
 cross when he kills the uncle of the center the 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.440
 let's go back to see with this other guy 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.550
 As you can see here, it is clear that it is 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.940
 Gray 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.360
 and we're going to see it finally 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.880
 very camouflaged when shooting at the head 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.370
 of this other of this other man there 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.640
 to the right of the building and that's just 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.190
 appears above the head but very 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.750
 camouflaged but it is there with 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.200
 what would we have with sneijder 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.500
 apparently does not go crosshead but yes 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.060
 that he's going to see her with weapons that do not have 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.730
 enlargement that does not have zoom seems to be 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.890
 we also bring a great curiosity that 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.690
 happens right at this time when the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.260
 newspaper if you see we have turned around 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.860
 and extending it good conditions 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.230
 we can appreciate the phrase aliens rise to 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.900
 sing that is something like the aliens are 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.600
 they ate an icon we would be 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.240
 basically like this and this is just image 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.860
 the same newspaper with the same owner 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.980
 we could find it in grand theft 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.800
 auto 4 right in this image 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.980
 and we can appreciate that in this image and 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.110
 in the image of the trailer are exactly 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.330
 the same newspaper one with more color than 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.360
 the other but the same owner the same 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.280
 the same newspaper the daily cloud and the 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.220
 same image should I say too 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.200
 although it is not perfectly appreciated as 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.629
 last topic we analyze what are the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.010
 life bars the bars that appear 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.340
 in the indicators that appear below 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.810
 of the map that are basically the green 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.940
 would be the life bar as in 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.250
 grand theft auto 4 the blue would be the 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.440
 armor again matches grand 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.420
 theft auto 4 and the yellow one in this case 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.810
 it would be a novelty and it's about the 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.129
 special ability of each of the 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.780
 protagonists that we could also see 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.959
 when it appears in the selector 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.790
 character on the right right here 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.060
 we could see that the special appears 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.819
 above the character selector in the 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.410
 top but we will also have a 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.530
 shortcut a shortcut a 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.450
 direct indicator easier on own 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.549
 bar we can see that the variability is 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.190
 he spends to maikel from a moment to 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.350
 another probably because they cut us 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.570
 the scene in which you use your skill 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.100
 well up here this chapter of your 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.020
 week in gta 5 I hope that I have 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.060
 liked do not forget to be attentive 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.590
 to the next episode that will bring more 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.790
 nothing more 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.790
 until the next goodbye 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.230
 do not 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.340
 to this 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.220
 before
