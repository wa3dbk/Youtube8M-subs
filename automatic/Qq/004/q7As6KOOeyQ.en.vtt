Ashton built using a parkzone t28 trojan
starting<00:00:17.560> off<00:00:17.650> with<00:00:17.830> the<00:00:17.950> canopy<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:20.230> try<00:00:20.890> to

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
starting off with the canopy I try to

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.200 
starting off with the canopy I try to
make<00:00:21.130> a<00:00:21.189> zero<00:00:21.550> canopy<00:00:22.060> and<00:00:23.730> first<00:00:24.730> what<00:00:24.970> I<00:00:25.000> did

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
make a zero canopy and first what I did

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.790 
make a zero canopy and first what I did
was<00:00:25.419> I<00:00:25.570> took<00:00:25.599> the<00:00:26.220> original<00:00:28.590> parks<00:00:29.590> Dylan

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
was I took the original parks Dylan

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
was I took the original parks Dylan
canopy<00:00:30.539> use<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:31.720> front<00:00:31.960> half<00:00:32.169> of<00:00:32.349> it<00:00:32.699> but<00:00:33.699> then

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
canopy use the front half of it but then

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.869 
canopy use the front half of it but then
cut<00:00:34.090> off<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.510> back<00:00:34.720> half<00:00:35.290> of<00:00:35.470> it<00:00:35.650> and<00:00:35.860> kind<00:00:36.790> of

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
cut off the back half of it and kind of

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:38.759 
cut off the back half of it and kind of
molded<00:00:37.210> it<00:00:37.330> and<00:00:37.570> cut<00:00:37.839> and<00:00:38.019> clipped<00:00:38.320> and<00:00:38.559> taped

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
molded it and cut and clipped and taped

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:44.119 
molded it and cut and clipped and taped
it<00:00:38.980> so<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:40.300> has<00:00:40.449> a<00:00:40.480> different<00:00:40.870> profile<00:00:41.260> to<00:00:41.500> it<00:00:41.559> I

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.610 

also<00:00:45.129> moved<00:00:45.549> the<00:00:45.909> canopy<00:00:46.540> backwards<00:00:47.140> on<00:00:47.409> the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
also moved the canopy backwards on the

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.060 
also moved the canopy backwards on the
foam<00:00:48.330> platform<00:00:49.330> there<00:00:49.650> to<00:00:50.650> give<00:00:50.799> the<00:00:50.920> little

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
foam platform there to give the little

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.270 
foam platform there to give the little
space<00:00:51.369> in<00:00:51.549> front<00:00:51.670> of<00:00:51.790> the<00:00:51.909> canopy<00:00:52.979> so<00:00:53.979> it's<00:00:54.129> not

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
space in front of the canopy so it's not

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.320 
space in front of the canopy so it's not
right<00:00:54.580> up<00:00:54.699> to<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:54.909> to<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:55.570> edge<00:00:55.720> there<00:00:57.330> that

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
right up to the to the edge there that

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.820 
right up to the to the edge there that
moves<00:00:58.540> the<00:00:58.629> canopy<00:00:58.989> back<00:00:59.140> on<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.409> fuselage

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
moves the canopy back on the fuselage

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.240 
moves the canopy back on the fuselage
making<00:01:00.190> more<00:01:00.400> for<00:01:00.790> a<00:01:00.820> more<00:01:00.970> realistic<00:01:01.269> look

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
making more for a more realistic look

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.370 
making more for a more realistic look
and<00:01:03.900> like<00:01:04.900> my<00:01:05.379> fog<00:01:05.650> wolf<00:01:05.920> kit<00:01:06.270> I've<00:01:07.270> cut<00:01:08.229> off

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
and like my fog wolf kit I've cut off

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.730 
and like my fog wolf kit I've cut off
the<00:01:08.530> material<00:01:09.070> from<00:01:09.310> just<00:01:09.670> behind<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.119> cow<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
the material from just behind the cow to

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.240 
the material from just behind the cow to
before<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.280> canopy<00:01:12.939> opening<00:01:13.240> and<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:15.070> is

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
before the canopy opening and this is

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.889 
before the canopy opening and this is
about<00:01:15.430> as<00:01:15.580> much<00:01:15.759> materials<00:01:16.359> I've<00:01:16.539> cut<00:01:16.780> off

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
about as much materials I've cut off

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.679 
about as much materials I've cut off
right<00:01:17.140> here<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:21.189> this<00:01:21.729> definitely<00:01:22.000> makes<00:01:22.539> the

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
right here and this definitely makes the

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.039 
right here and this definitely makes the
zero<00:01:23.159> look<00:01:24.159> more<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.609> scale<00:01:24.939> like<00:01:25.509> the<00:01:25.689> like

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
zero look more to scale like the like

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.160 
zero look more to scale like the like

section I cut up the original t28 wing

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.320 
section I cut up the original t28 wing
pretty<00:03:07.690> good<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.370> then<00:03:09.370> this<00:03:09.610> rear<00:03:10.030> half

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
pretty good and then this rear half

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.220 
pretty good and then this rear half
right<00:03:10.720> here<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:12.160> rudder<00:03:12.730> half<00:03:12.990> was<00:03:13.990> made<00:03:14.200> out

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
right here the rudder half was made out

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.790 
right here the rudder half was made out
of<00:03:14.380> bolsa<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.810> same<00:03:16.810> thing<00:03:16.840> underneath<00:03:17.500> the

rudder<00:03:18.040> half<00:03:18.310> I've<00:03:19.350> extended<00:03:20.350> it<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:22.540> keep<00:03:22.690> it

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
rudder half I've extended it to keep it

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.590 
rudder half I've extended it to keep it
to<00:03:22.990> scale<00:03:23.230> looks<00:03:23.530> as<00:03:23.680> well<00:03:24.060> now<00:03:25.060> all<00:03:25.270> of<00:03:25.450> this

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
to scale looks as well now all of this

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.380

a<00:03:31.300> little<00:03:31.630> tail<00:03:31.840> heavy<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:34.600> pretty<00:03:34.870> much

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
a little tail heavy so you pretty much

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.660 
a little tail heavy so you pretty much
have<00:03:35.320> to<00:03:35.350> move<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.650> battery<00:03:36.130> compartment<00:03:36.220> as
