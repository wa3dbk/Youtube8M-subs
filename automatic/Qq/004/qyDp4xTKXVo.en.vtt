00:00:02.789 --> 00:00:04.860
SCOTT: "Age of Ultron" introduces
a few new characters

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.299
from the comics into the
Marvel Cinematic Universe.

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:09.229
Other than the titular
character of Ultron,

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:11.464
the two that seem to be
getting the most attention

00:00:11.464 --> 00:00:13.069
are the brother/sister duo Quicksilver

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:14.390
and Scarlet Witch.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.340
A big inconsistency in the comics is who

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.314
their father is,

00:00:17.314 --> 00:00:19.569
which has changed on
more than one occasion,

00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:21.337
one being very recently.

00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:24.000
It's needlessly complicated,
to say the least,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.991
but let's try to unravel it all.

00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:30.991
[MUSIC]

00:00:31.652 --> 00:00:33.236
Welcome to Comic Misconceptions.

00:00:33.236 --> 00:00:34.850
I'm Scott, and a few weeks ago

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.638
I uploaded a video very similar

00:00:36.638 --> 00:00:38.040
to what you are watching right now,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.010
but I got some of the info wrong

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.941
and excluded some notable details,

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:45.005
so I took it down and now am
repurposing it for this week.

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.946
Basically, it's the first
official NerdSync Retcon.

00:00:48.946 --> 00:00:50.388
Positive re-framing.

00:00:50.388 --> 00:00:52.482
Speaking of retcons, there
have been quite a few

00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:54.411
of them regarding who the
parents of Scarlet Witch

00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:55.428
and Quicksilver are.

00:00:55.428 --> 00:00:57.072
The first one that I
want to talk to you about

00:00:57.072 --> 00:00:59.927
is the story of a Golden
Age hero named Whizzer.

00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:03.624
This guy has one of the most
incredible origin stories,

00:01:03.624 --> 00:01:06.549
and I mean that in the most
literal sense of the word.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.866
Robert Frank was bitten
by a snake as a kid.

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.731
His scientist father tried to
give him a blood transfusion,

00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:12.970
but instead of human blood,

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.677
he was given the blood of a mongoose

00:01:14.677 --> 00:01:15.834
because they were out in the wild

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:17.378
and had nothing else.

00:01:17.378 --> 00:01:19.167
Bob is miraculously revived,

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:21.178
but for no real explained reason,

00:01:21.178 --> 00:01:23.088
his father just drops dead.

00:01:23.088 --> 00:01:24.631
Probably because every good hero

00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:27.294
needs at least one
deceased or missing parent.

00:01:27.294 --> 00:01:29.468
The mongoose blood now
coursing through his body

00:01:29.468 --> 00:01:32.006
grants Bob the speed of a mongoose.

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:34.851
Bob declares, "If I'm as fast a mongoose,

00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:38.021
"I'm faster than any
human being in the world."

00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:39.442
He then chooses to fight crime

00:01:39.442 --> 00:01:40.764
under the guise of Whizzer

00:01:40.764 --> 00:01:42.633
because that's what fast things do,

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:44.258
they whiz by ya.

00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:46.289
Later, that origin was expanded upon

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.545
to really be that the
mongoose blood kick started

00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:51.105
his latent mutant ability of super speed.

00:01:51.105 --> 00:01:52.995
As I said, for a while
Whizzer was considered

00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:55.047
the father of Scarlet
Witch and Quicksilver,

00:01:55.047 --> 00:01:57.160
AKA Wanda and Pietro Maximoff.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.440
When Wanda first meets Whizzer in

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.918
Giant-Size Avengers Number One from 1974,

00:02:00.918 --> 00:02:02.259
she notices that his speed is very

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.641
reminiscent of her brother's.

00:02:03.641 --> 00:02:05.449
After some prying, Whizzer tells the story

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:07.358
of how he and his pregnant wife, Madeline,

00:02:07.358 --> 00:02:08.436
another Golden Age hero

00:02:08.436 --> 00:02:10.061
who went by the name of Miss America,

00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:12.174
came to a place named Wundagore

00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:13.413
where she gave birth to twins

00:02:13.413 --> 00:02:15.302
named Pietro and Wanda.

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:17.213
After Madeline died a few days later,

00:02:17.213 --> 00:02:19.265
Whizzer fled, leaving his newborn children

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:22.353
to be raised by an
anthropomorphic cow named Bova

00:02:22.353 --> 00:02:24.099
who was created by a
genetic scientist named

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.258
the High Evolutionary

00:02:25.258 --> 00:02:27.330
before they ran away,
becoming nomadic orphans.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.570
It's confusing.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.951
Just roll with it.

00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:33.324
A few years later in Avengers
number 186 from 1979,

00:02:33.324 --> 00:02:36.575
we see an altered story that
takes away the idea of Whizzer

00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:38.708
as the father and
replaces it with the more

00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:40.556
familiar Magneto story.

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:42.629
A woman by the name of Magda Eisenhardt

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:43.808
came to Wundagore alone,

00:02:43.808 --> 00:02:45.941
trying to escape her husband, Magneto,

00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:47.241
and to make sure that her children

00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:48.420
would never meet him

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.491
and become corrupted by his madness.

00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:52.767
Magda delivered her
children, Wanda and Pietro,

00:02:52.767 --> 00:02:54.819
but fearful that Magneto would find her

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.114
and torture her for
information about the kids,

00:02:57.114 --> 00:02:59.471
Magda fled to the wilderness alone,

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:01.279
where she presumably died.

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:03.625
Enter Whizzer and his wife Madeline.

00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:05.656
They too had come to
Wundagore to have a child

00:03:05.656 --> 00:03:07.608
because apparently it's the place to be

00:03:07.608 --> 00:03:09.130
when you're about to give birth.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.285
Unfortunately, their child is stillborn

00:03:11.285 --> 00:03:13.093
and Madeline dies due to complications

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:14.657
of the childbirth.

00:03:14.657 --> 00:03:17.157
Bova offers to give Whizzer
the two infant twins,

00:03:17.157 --> 00:03:20.203
Wanda and Pietro, as
some sort of compensation

00:03:20.203 --> 00:03:22.866
and maybe bring some
joy back into his life,

00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:24.896
but the grief was too much,

00:03:24.896 --> 00:03:27.965
and Whizzer did what
he does best, and ran.

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:30.789
Wanda and Pietro were then
taken to a tribe of gypsies

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:33.430
where they were raised by
Django and Marya Maximoff

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.747
who had recently lost
their own two children.

00:03:35.747 --> 00:03:37.413
Scarlet Witch and
Quicksilver would grow up

00:03:37.413 --> 00:03:38.896
and eventually flee the gypsy camp

00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:40.602
and travel around Europe as nomads

00:03:40.602 --> 00:03:41.984
where they would meet Magneto

00:03:41.984 --> 00:03:44.869
after he saved them from a
group of hostile villagers.

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:46.493
Neither Magneto or the twins

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:48.038
knew at the time that they were related.

00:03:48.038 --> 00:03:50.374
In fact, Magneto had
believed that the children

00:03:50.374 --> 00:03:52.407
his wife gave birth to must have died

00:03:52.407 --> 00:03:54.376
soon after she ran away.

00:03:54.376 --> 00:03:56.551
Magneto even investigated the situation

00:03:56.551 --> 00:03:57.566
just to make sure.

00:03:57.566 --> 00:03:59.477
He went to Wundagore, found Bova,

00:03:59.477 --> 00:04:01.305
and calmly inferred about the children

00:04:01.305 --> 00:04:02.402
his wife gave birth to.

00:04:02.402 --> 00:04:05.349
When Bova says that his
children are indeed alive,

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.740
Magneto essentially tortures
her for their names.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.850
When Bova reveals that
they are Wanda and Pietro,

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.329
everything suddenly clicks with Magneto,

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:15.832
and he sets off to find them,

00:04:15.832 --> 00:04:18.899
creating this nice, yet
complicated family moment

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:19.875
between them all.

00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:22.841
As for poor Whizzer, well
he had some health issues

00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:24.650
and suffered a few heart
attacks in his time.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.112
His last one was fatal,

00:04:26.112 --> 00:04:28.021
and he died forever believing that he was

00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:29.952
the father of Quicksilver
and Scarlet Witch

00:04:29.952 --> 00:04:32.167
out of some delusion or false memory

00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:33.691
that he had created to cope with the loss

00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:34.950
of his wife and child.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.392
The idea of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch

00:04:36.392 --> 00:04:38.668
being children of Magneto
was the status quo

00:04:38.668 --> 00:04:40.680
for a very long time until the recent

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.748
AXIS event that changed everything again.

00:04:43.748 --> 00:04:45.169
There's a lot going on in this story,

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.059
so I'll just tell you
what you need to know

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:48.359
for this specific topic.

00:04:48.359 --> 00:04:50.879
Scarlet Witch feels betrayed
by Magneto and Quicksilver,

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.073
so she casts a spell to
strike down her family.

00:04:53.073 --> 00:04:54.047
Quicksilver goes down,

00:04:54.047 --> 00:04:55.673
but Magneto stays up,

00:04:55.673 --> 00:04:57.787
indicating that there isn't any real

00:04:57.787 --> 00:04:59.209
blood connection between them.

00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:01.281
He is not their father.

00:05:01.281 --> 00:05:03.028
The Uncanny Avengers title right now

00:05:03.028 --> 00:05:04.715
is still going through the apparent

00:05:04.715 --> 00:05:06.645
real origin of the twins,

00:05:06.645 --> 00:05:09.202
and perhaps I'll make a
tie in video to this one

00:05:09.202 --> 00:05:10.949
when that whole story wraps up.

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:12.492
I've read a bunch of theories

00:05:12.492 --> 00:05:14.322
online so far that are all over the place,

00:05:14.322 --> 00:05:16.272
but I think I'll just
wait until the comics

00:05:16.272 --> 00:05:17.572
give us the official answer

00:05:17.572 --> 00:05:18.792
and make a video about that.

00:05:18.792 --> 00:05:19.889
Something I do wanna mention

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.433
that I think is very likely

00:05:21.433 --> 00:05:22.449
is that they're changing up

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:24.216
Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver's origins

00:05:24.216 --> 00:05:27.162
solely because of the
Marvel Cinematic Universe.

00:05:27.162 --> 00:05:30.169
Since FOX has the movie
rights to the X-Men franchise

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.526
and Magneto, and mutants in general,

00:05:32.526 --> 00:05:34.436
the MCU likely has to find a way

00:05:34.436 --> 00:05:37.036
around calling the twins mutants.

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:38.743
What I think is probable is that Marvel

00:05:38.743 --> 00:05:40.592
wants to redo their comic book origins

00:05:40.592 --> 00:05:42.969
to be more like whatever
they reveal them to be

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:44.350
in the "Age of Ultron" movie.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.894
That way people won't get mad

00:05:45.894 --> 00:05:47.722
when the movie says
Magneto isn't their father

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:50.202
because hey, it's comic accurate now,

00:05:50.202 --> 00:05:51.258
so take that!

00:05:51.258 --> 00:05:52.599
But something I think is notable

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.082
is that the Marvel Ultimate Universe,

00:05:54.082 --> 00:05:56.072
specifically Ultimates Three Issue Three,

00:05:56.072 --> 00:05:57.658
tells a story that might imply

00:05:57.658 --> 00:05:59.485
Wolverine is actually their father,

00:05:59.485 --> 00:06:01.864
well specifically Wolverine only thinks

00:06:01.864 --> 00:06:03.387
Wanda could be his daughter,

00:06:03.387 --> 00:06:05.927
but Pietro could still be Magneto's son.

00:06:05.927 --> 00:06:07.471
Wolverine was travelling
through the mountains

00:06:07.471 --> 00:06:09.604
when he came upon Wundagore

00:06:09.604 --> 00:06:12.468
where he was found by a woman named Magda.

00:06:12.468 --> 00:06:13.220
She took him in,

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.480
they got a little cozy,

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.370
but then Magneto comes home

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.503
and sends Wolverine on his way.

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:19.296
So, it's up in the air

00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:20.575
who their real father is.

00:06:20.575 --> 00:06:24.415
Wanda and Pietro also have
an interesting relationship

00:06:24.415 --> 00:06:25.391
in the Ultimate comics,

00:06:25.391 --> 00:06:27.382
but we're not gonna touch on that.

00:06:27.382 --> 00:06:28.296
What do you guys think?

00:06:28.296 --> 00:06:29.595
Which father do you like better

00:06:29.595 --> 00:06:31.445
for Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch?

00:06:31.445 --> 00:06:34.838
Magneto, Whizzer, possibly Wolverine,

00:06:34.838 --> 00:06:37.581
whoever it will be in
the future of the comics?

00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:38.758
And what do you think "Age of Ultron"

00:06:38.758 --> 00:06:39.673
is going to do?

00:06:39.673 --> 00:06:41.705
Also, just a reminder that this video

00:06:41.705 --> 00:06:43.878
did come out before "Age of Ultron"

00:06:43.878 --> 00:06:45.444
for all those watching in the future

00:06:45.444 --> 00:06:47.313
and wondering why I didn't talk about it.

Speaking of Avengers,

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:50.767
this video was part of
NerdSync Avenger's month.

00:06:50.767 --> 00:06:52.047
We're doing a whole month of Avengers

00:06:52.047 --> 00:06:53.386
and Marvel episodes in preparation

00:06:53.386 --> 00:06:54.302
for "Age of Ultron".

00:06:54.302 --> 00:06:55.460
We've got a few more to come

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.004
that I'm pretty excited about,

00:06:57.004 --> 00:06:59.340

big sexy subscribe button

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.269

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:02.835
Once again, I am Scott.

00:07:02.835 --> 00:07:04.684

00:07:07.772 --> 00:07:10.413

you knew about comics.
