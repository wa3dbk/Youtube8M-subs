00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
able to talk to her for me because the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.390 
able to talk to her for me because the
basic<00:00:59.579> move<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.879> need<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:01.910> triangle<00:01:02.910> so

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
basic move you need for the triangle so

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.320 
basic move you need for the triangle so
step<00:01:05.400> two<00:01:06.290> once<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.470> want<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
step two once you want you to do the a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.140 
step two once you want you to do the a
for<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.780> Charlie<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.700> catch<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.119> your

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
for the Charlie a catch it in your

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.440 
for the Charlie a catch it in your
finger<00:01:12.689> just<00:01:12.900> as<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:14.549> releases<00:01:14.880> from<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.210> stop

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
finger just as it releases from a stop

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.679 
finger just as it releases from a stop
so<00:01:15.630> when<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.530> bring<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.860> over<00:01:17.299> let<00:01:18.299> drop<00:01:18.540> on
