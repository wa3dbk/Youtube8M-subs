00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.670
 Hello dear colleagues lovers 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.610
 sports games 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.410
 betfair he is at football matches so 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.360
 coincided that the new year begins with 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.280
 announcement of the new strategy which 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.000
 called bets against draws and in 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.539
 first half 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.430
 appeared on not scheduled when was 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.890
 noticed that in this market on 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.650
 certain boy overweight 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.290
 which give us the coefficient is 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.960
 lower than in reality in other words 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.890
 do we need the outcome of matches are more often 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.809
 what is expected well so rarely but happens with 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.520
 the other side thought that if 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.850
 use dagon on coefficients 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.980
 a little more than two enterprises 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.230
 the proposed approach will be with us 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.200
 the advantage is these basic ones 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.460
 features you see on their page 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.790
 conditionally 3 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.890
 and the first one is that strategy versus 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.109
 draws in the first half is played soft 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.280
 dagon 

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:09.049
 betting odds 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.450
 against its initial value 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.789
 correspond to a probability of about 55 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.029
 percent that we can increase by 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:19.399
 5 10 percent other than this is shown 

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:22.009
 variant of the so-called block game 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.709
 in pursuit which drastically reduces approximately in 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.529
 3 times bet size hello recipe 

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:29.479
 costs in a series of games and therefore 

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:32.090
 allows you to have a smaller 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.509
 the size of the game bank in general plays with 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.159
 less risk and that 's probably the most 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.439
 the main thing is this strategy 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.959
 proposed with the other who on this 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.729
 Channel announced but called two 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:46.700
 rates in the first half a little precast 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.590
