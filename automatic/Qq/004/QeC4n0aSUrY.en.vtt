00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.710 
it gives me about the same length but
the<00:03:12.190> thing<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.579> love<00:03:12.940> about<00:03:12.970> that<00:03:13.450> one

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
the thing that I love about that one

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.020 
the thing that I love about that one
that<00:03:13.930> this<00:03:14.200> one<00:03:14.440> does<00:03:14.650> not<00:03:14.920> have<00:03:14.980> is<00:03:15.730> that<00:03:15.879> it

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
that this one does not have is that it

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.360 
that this one does not have is that it
also<00:03:16.260> volumizes<00:03:17.260> so<00:03:17.860> don't<00:03:18.040> know<00:03:18.129> if<00:03:18.280> you

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
also volumizes so don't know if you

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.699 
also volumizes so don't know if you
could<00:03:18.519> tell<00:03:18.760> in<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.030> close-up<00:03:19.269> but<00:03:20.079> my

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
could tell in the close-up but my

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.470 
could tell in the close-up but my
eyelashes<00:03:21.280> actually<00:03:21.760> do<00:03:22.060> not<00:03:22.180> look<00:03:22.450> very

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
eyelashes actually do not look very

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.050 
eyelashes actually do not look very
volumize<00:03:23.319> dat<00:03:23.650> all<00:03:23.829> I'll<00:03:24.190> do<00:03:24.549> another<00:03:24.760> quick

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
volumize dat all I'll do another quick

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:34.309 
volumize dat all I'll do another quick
close-up

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.940 

I<00:03:34.379> just<00:03:35.099> don't<00:03:35.310> feel<00:03:35.489> like<00:03:35.519> this<00:03:36.269> is<00:03:36.329> very

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
I just don't feel like this is very

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.199 
I just don't feel like this is very
volumizing<00:03:37.950> which<00:03:38.609> is<00:03:38.760> something<00:03:38.939> that<00:03:39.180> I

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
volumizing which is something that I

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.720 
volumizing which is something that I
definitely<00:03:39.810> like<00:03:40.139> in<00:03:40.379> a<00:03:40.469> mascara<00:03:40.920> because<00:03:41.370> my

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
definitely like in a mascara because my

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.360 
definitely like in a mascara because my
lash<00:03:41.939> is<00:03:42.120> already<00:03:42.450> long<00:03:42.659> I<00:03:43.109> could<00:03:43.980> see<00:03:44.159> how

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
lash is already long I could see how

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.819 
lash is already long I could see how
this<00:03:44.609> though<00:03:44.909> would<00:03:45.180> be<00:03:45.209> probably<00:03:46.109> a<00:03:46.319> great

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
this though would be probably a great

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.349 
this though would be probably a great
product<00:03:47.159> for<00:03:47.400> someone<00:03:47.849> that<00:03:47.999> doesn't<00:03:48.209> have

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
product for someone that doesn't have

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.390 
product for someone that doesn't have
long<00:03:48.629> lashes<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:49.319> really<00:03:49.379> really<00:03:49.859> once<00:03:50.159> long

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
long lashes and really really once long

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.459 
long lashes and really really once long
lash<00:03:50.639> I<00:03:50.819> do<00:03:50.879> like<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.269> formula<00:03:51.840> this<00:03:52.200> one<00:03:52.349> is

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:52.469 
lash I do like the formula this one is

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:55.640 
lash I do like the formula this one is
just<00:03:52.560> kind<00:03:52.680> of<00:03:52.920> thick<00:03:53.900> formula<00:03:54.900> on<00:03:55.079> this<00:03:55.290> I

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
just kind of thick formula on this I

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.319 
just kind of thick formula on this I
feel<00:03:56.159> like<00:03:56.310> this<00:03:56.519> one<00:03:56.700> is<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.939> little<00:03:57.209> more

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
feel like this one is a little more

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.890 
feel like this one is a little more
manageable<00:03:57.569> and<00:03:58.319> workable<00:03:59.129> and<00:03:59.459> I<00:04:00.120> usually

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
manageable and workable and I usually

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.050 
manageable and workable and I usually
only<00:04:01.019> do<00:04:01.260> one<00:04:01.530> layer<00:04:01.799> of<00:04:02.219> mascara<00:04:02.609> but<00:04:02.879> I<00:04:02.939> know

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
only do one layer of mascara but I know

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.809 
only do one layer of mascara but I know
some<00:04:03.419> people<00:04:03.629> do<00:04:03.930> two<00:04:04.379> coats<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.919> mascara<00:04:05.099> so

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
some people do two coats of mascara so

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.240 
some people do two coats of mascara so
the<00:04:06.599> thinness<00:04:06.900> of<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.260> formula<00:04:07.739> might<00:04:08.010> help

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
the thinness of the formula might help

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.409 
the thinness of the formula might help
with<00:04:08.310> that<00:04:08.459> I'll<00:04:08.730> show<00:04:08.879> you<00:04:08.939> the<00:04:09.120> cover

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
of the wand see how this one when you

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.089 
of the wand see how this one when you
turn<00:04:38.190> it<00:04:38.370> kind<00:04:38.580> of<00:04:38.669> goes<00:04:39.120> flat<00:04:39.860> like<00:04:40.860> that<00:04:40.889> and

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
turn it kind of goes flat like that and

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.070 
turn it kind of goes flat like that and
the<00:04:41.610> bristles<00:04:41.789> are<00:04:42.090> a<00:04:42.120> lot<00:04:42.300> smaller<00:04:42.509> honestly

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080

I<00:04:43.139> couldn't<00:04:43.380> tell<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:43.800> what<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.550> purpose<00:04:44.880> of

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
I couldn't tell you what the purpose of

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.029 
I couldn't tell you what the purpose of
the<00:04:45.180> two<00:04:45.330> different<00:04:45.750> shapes<00:04:46.139> of<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.500> ones<00:04:46.710> are

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
the two different shapes of the ones are

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.360 
the two different shapes of the ones are
anything<00:04:47.370> like<00:04:47.639> that<00:04:47.669> but<00:04:48.630> if<00:04:48.960> you<00:04:49.380> know<00:04:49.590> there

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
anything like that but if you know there

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.700 
anything like that but if you know there
is<00:04:50.699> a<00:04:50.729> good<00:04:51.030> comparison<00:04:51.419> to<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.289> lash<00:04:52.470> blast

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
is a good comparison to the lash blast

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.129 
is a good comparison to the lash blast

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
mascara overall I would say that the

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.890

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
mascara has an entirely way to long name

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.189 
mascara has an entirely way to long name
but<00:05:04.289> I<00:05:04.620> really<00:05:05.280> do<00:05:05.370> like<00:05:05.550> this<00:05:05.729> mascara<00:05:06.300> it<00:05:07.139> is

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
but I really do like this mascara it is

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.990 
but I really do like this mascara it is
very<00:05:07.560> lengthening<00:05:08.130> for<00:05:08.490> any<00:05:08.699> type<00:05:08.970> of

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
very lengthening for any type of

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.450 
very lengthening for any type of
eyelashes<00:05:09.720> well<00:05:10.710> I<00:05:10.740> shouldn't<00:05:11.039> say<00:05:11.220> that<00:05:11.250> I

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
eyelashes well I shouldn't say that I

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.210 
eyelashes well I shouldn't say that I
don't<00:05:11.789> have<00:05:11.970> short<00:05:12.180> eyelashes<00:05:12.690> so<00:05:13.070> if<00:05:14.070> you

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
don't have short eyelashes so if you

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.710 
don't have short eyelashes so if you
have<00:05:14.340> short<00:05:14.580> eyelashes<00:05:15.090> and<00:05:15.300> you<00:05:15.360> try<00:05:15.539> this

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
have short eyelashes and you try this

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.659 
have short eyelashes and you try this
