00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:21.080
 shooting range question but still obviously forces 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:26.009
 team of course it is no longer 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:29.279
 I can play anyway 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:33.960
 say that the winning team of the opponent 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.110
 from the kind of logical that we tried 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.110
 play 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.190
 opposition tortured their organization 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.850
 pernik she is just a team of santorina to 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.750
 the village talk is why quite simply 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.720
 jumped in the first half 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.960
 at times we have turned out and our 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.559
 actions that we wanted on our 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.590
 the finds were of danger such as a 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.800
 such a rival 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.920
 almost all of each so that 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.860
 came to 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.740
 completely grain chihuah but dangerously blind 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.000
 held very good bozhovich very 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:19.619
 exactly and right in the country what he is trying 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.619
 rank first in our zone 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.300
 decent exit 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.300
 with dignity 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:40.630
 I would like a fig from I think that 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.800
 in fact already almost issued a ticket 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.320
 plan for me all for more 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:51.740
 or to the plan besieged my formula when 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.900
 officially want the championship when 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.910
 we will leave there 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:01.030
 thank you well prematurely. 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.030
 and plan one we are preparing to know the following 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:12.470
 What do you think today is your opponent? 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:15.140
 turned out to be a team and we feared for 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.810
 the result of this match was feared why 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.660
 because the team is a good result 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.890
 good show balanced 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.890
 team in all lines 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.909
 always playing for results by 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.099
 the result 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.140
 analysis to render what the team typed 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.200
 equally sheet spectacle at home and away 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.349
 18 18 each 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.510
 and misses little to figure yep 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:47.280
 legends of missed balls 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.760
 and if I take the team has not suffered a 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:56.470
 what devastating defeats but not the land 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:59.909
 beat all the time does not know one ball if 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:05.769
 scores is the result and not 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:08.950
 let's say it guards this result and we 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.940
 feared this game team worthy 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.740
 resistance 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.600
 it turned out, but let's say a little bit here 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.860
 objectively if you take it in the organization 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.380
 and performance file 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.350
 a little more but leveled 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.850
 due to the fact that the quality of the field is 0 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.890
 enduring let's say not some 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.950
 see here on your team I do not know 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.950
 what is good enough and 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.849
 a game 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.800
 salvation tired we tried because I 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.080
 even asked the guys to massage 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.870
 installation that does not depart from his game 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.230
 no matter how difficult the combination 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.830
 combine naturally harder 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:54.880
 a little bit not to depart the game due 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:58.569
 which hour due to the rapid transition to 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.640
 attack due to speed do 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.940
 the result is fairly organized 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.240
 played defense and if you analyze 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:11.890
 feat for practically there was no 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:13.840
 last added time is out 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.350
 on the left side positionally everything has gone 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.860
 a little bit 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.870
 extreme foot protector or quiet as well 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:24.820
 in principle, they have such a kind of light 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:27.430
 tasks they set if to take and even in 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:31.320
 This field is our beauty, in principle 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.670
 probably after the 1st half has already been 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.100
 should have removed all questions to 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:44.530
 the winner because it is gnawing 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:47.860
 the moment created was still on the sap 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:53.830
 moment would any one on one 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:55.110
 any head revyakina at standard 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.390
 position 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:01.120
 the goal areas were not clogged therefore 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.720
 the danger was that some one 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.120
 random moment we assign member 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.370
 standard position 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.669
 nullify team game efforts not 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:19.030
 I will tell the blessing that again from the street great 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:26.400
 played it undoubted foul it will end 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:26.400
 take these guys to thank for the fact that 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.690
 this result will be and 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:40.210
 let's say a knife on this field is not a good one 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:43.510
 thanks again good gift thank you 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.270
 taking the opportunity of your land like 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.150
 would congratulate 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.190
 roll the veteran of the great patriotic 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.990
 of war 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.740
 wish on such a lot left 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.750
 wish health and life to all residents 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.580
 areas and cities with a great holiday 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.540
 seven decades of victory 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.540
 thank
