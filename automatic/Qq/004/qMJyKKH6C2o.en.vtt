00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
airtime for it being up in the air this

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.630 
airtime for it being up in the air this
ball<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:37.860> going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.130> go<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.460> hoop

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
ball is not going to go in the hoop

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.640 
ball is not going to go in the hoop
it'll<00:01:39.270> bounce<00:01:39.450> off<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.780> some<00:01:40.079> things<00:01:40.320> and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
it'll bounce off of some things and

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.920 
it'll bounce off of some things and
there<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.400> have<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.180> idea<00:01:42.509> though<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.899> to

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930
