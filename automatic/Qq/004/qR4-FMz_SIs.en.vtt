they go and like we I don't know I guess

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.800 
they go and like we I don't know I guess
we<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:13.290> kind<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:14.420> lollies<00:01:15.420> led<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
we just kind of like lollies led to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.870 
we just kind of like lollies led to
easily<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.710> I'm<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:16.979> trying<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.460> keep<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
easily so I'm just trying to keep the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.710 
easily so I'm just trying to keep the
temper<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:19.140> they<00:01:19.909> took<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.970> tick<00:01:21.479> already

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
temper and they took a tick already

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.090 
temper and they took a tick already
processing<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> authors<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:22.830> after

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
processing the authors and then after

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.219 
processing the authors and then after
that<00:01:23.220> demolish<00:01:24.090> doesn't<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> hard<00:01:24.630> point<00:01:24.810> quite

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
that demolish doesn't a hard point quite

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.899 
that demolish doesn't a hard point quite
everything<00:01:25.560> we've<00:01:25.830> got<00:01:25.979> 30<00:01:26.130> points<00:01:26.580> which<00:01:26.729> is

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
everything we've got 30 points which is

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.610 
everything we've got 30 points which is
never<00:01:27.060> happened<00:01:27.450> before

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
never happened before

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.930 
never happened before
and<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:30.660> last<00:01:30.870> game<00:01:31.080> got<00:01:32.070> proposal<00:01:32.580> agonism

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
and the last game got proposal agonism

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.990 
and the last game got proposal agonism
por<00:01:33.510> favor<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> length<00:01:34.020> which<00:01:34.260> is<00:01:34.290> giftable

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
por favor the length which is giftable

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.060 
por favor the length which is giftable
okay<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.060> that's<00:01:36.420> secured<00:01:36.930> top<00:01:37.230> six<00:01:37.530> view<00:01:37.770> and

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
okay so that's secured top six view and

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.710 
okay so that's secured top six view and
the<00:01:39.000> next<00:01:39.240> game<00:01:39.510> gets<00:01:39.780> TCN<00:01:40.640> how<00:01:41.640> unity<00:01:42.450> looking

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the next game gets TCN how unity looking

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.060 
the next game gets TCN how unity looking
forward<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.230> arranging<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
forward to it you arranging the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.890 
forward to it you arranging the
opportunity<00:01:44.520> yeah<00:01:44.880> I'm<00:01:45.060> definitely<00:01:45.240> sites<00:01:45.660> by

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
opportunity yeah I'm definitely sites by

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.160 
opportunity yeah I'm definitely sites by
tiziano<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:47.480> they've<00:01:48.480> obviously<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.990> kind

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
tiziano and they've obviously just kind

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.470 
tiziano and they've obviously just kind
of<00:01:49.200> pull<00:01:49.380> offs<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.250> as<00:01:50.400> you<00:01:50.610> have<00:01:51.300> there

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
of pull offs and so as you have there

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.970 
of pull offs and so as you have there
was<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> good<00:01:51.780> time<00:01:51.870> to<00:01:51.930> play<00:01:52.230> a<00:01:52.260> sound<00:01:52.620> and<00:01:52.800> it's

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
was a good time to play a sound and it's

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.720 
was a good time to play a sound and it's
now<00:01:53.210> it's<00:01:54.210> going<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.480> have<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> little<00:01:54.780> bit<00:01:54.900> a

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
now it's going to have a little bit a

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.130 
now it's going to have a little bit a
rectum<00:01:56.730> not<00:01:56.940> a<00:01:56.970> reputation<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.690> i<00:01:57.750> think<00:01:58.020> i

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
rectum not a reputation but i think i

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.140 
rectum not a reputation but i think i
think<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.410> they<00:01:58.560> lose<00:01:58.740> if<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.060> lose<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
think that they lose if you lose the

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.170 
think that they lose if you lose the
plot<00:02:00.440> so<00:02:01.440> was<00:02:02.100> there<00:02:02.190> we<00:02:02.340> connected<00:02:02.760> elephant
