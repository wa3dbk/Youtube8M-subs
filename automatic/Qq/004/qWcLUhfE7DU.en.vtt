00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.560 
preventative if you're not organic you
can<00:01:29.510> use<00:01:29.660> something<00:01:29.960> called<00:01:29.990> eye<00:01:30.320> vein<00:01:31.570> that

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
can use something called eye vein that

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.600 
can use something called eye vein that
will<00:01:32.870> you<00:01:33.380> know<00:01:33.409> is<00:01:33.620> quite<00:01:33.830> effective<00:01:34.250> but

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
will you know is quite effective but

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.370 
will you know is quite effective but
again<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:35.390> really<00:01:35.750> have<00:01:35.840> got<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.020> be<00:01:36.140> doing

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
again you really have got to be doing

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.810 
again you really have got to be doing
this<00:01:36.500> in<00:01:36.680> a<00:01:36.770> preventative<00:01:37.220> manner<00:01:37.550> so<00:01:37.760> if

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
this in a preventative manner so if

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.430 
this in a preventative manner so if
you're<00:01:38.030> not<00:01:38.150> already<00:01:38.210> spraying<00:01:38.960> against

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
you're not already spraying against

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.570 
you're not already spraying against
blight<00:01:39.650> now<00:01:40.280> is<00:01:40.580> a<00:01:40.640> good<00:01:40.880> time<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:41.870> start<00:01:42.580> and

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
blight now is a good time to start and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.120 
blight now is a good time to start and
if<00:01:43.909> your<00:01:44.210> part<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.140> Soil<00:01:45.380> Association<00:01:45.650> they

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
if your part the Soil Association they

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.500 
if your part the Soil Association they
say<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.370> should<00:01:46.490> only<00:01:46.610> spray<00:01:46.880> three<00:01:47.150> times<00:01:47.390> a

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
say you should only spray three times a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.719 
say you should only spray three times a
year<00:01:47.540> but<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:48.590> be<00:01:48.710> brutally<00:01:49.040> honest<00:01:49.310> I<00:01:49.400> tend<00:01:49.670> to

year but to be brutally honest I tend to

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.660 
year but to be brutally honest I tend to
spray<00:01:50.000> every<00:01:50.180> 21<00:01:50.570> days<00:01:50.720> because<00:01:51.409> I<00:01:51.560> tend<00:01:52.520> to

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
spray every 21 days because I tend to

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.100 
spray every 21 days because I tend to
sort<00:01:52.940> of<00:01:53.090> think<00:01:53.330> it's<00:01:53.450> more<00:01:53.600> important<00:01:53.930> to<00:01:54.020> get

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
sort of think it's more important to get

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.890 
sort of think it's more important to get
a<00:01:54.170> crop<00:01:54.470> than<00:01:54.710> not<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:56.479> other<00:01:56.630> thing<00:01:56.810> I

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
a crop than not and the other thing I

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.180 
a crop than not and the other thing I
want<00:01:57.050> to<00:01:57.110> talk<00:01:57.260> about<00:01:57.409> today<00:01:57.800> is<00:01:57.979> that

want to talk about today is that

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.830 
want to talk about today is that

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.450 
although it might seem daft at this part
of<00:01:59.930> the<00:01:59.990> season<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:00.590> know<00:02:00.620> the<00:02:00.860> tomatoes<00:02:01.310> are

case<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:17.770> what<00:02:18.770> I've<00:02:19.069> done<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.700> could<00:02:20.090> do

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
case and what I've done is I could do

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.760 
case and what I've done is I could do
with<00:02:20.360> an<00:02:20.450> extra<00:02:20.810> couple<00:02:20.989> of<00:02:21.110> plants<00:02:21.380> so<00:02:21.620> we've

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
with an extra couple of plants so we've

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.920 
with an extra couple of plants so we've
deliberately<00:02:22.310> left<00:02:22.790> this<00:02:23.239> side<00:02:23.569> chute

deliberately left this side chute
growing<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.470> as<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:24.709> can<00:02:24.860> see<00:02:24.920> it's<00:02:25.640> really

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
growing and as you can see it's really

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.690 
growing and as you can see it's really
vigorous<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.630> it's<00:02:26.720> grown<00:02:27.310> nearly<00:02:28.310> as<00:02:28.520> much

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
vigorous and it's grown nearly as much

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.570 
vigorous and it's grown nearly as much
as<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:28.940> plant<00:02:29.180> itself<00:02:29.569> in<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.349> last<00:02:30.560> week<00:02:30.920> and

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580

as the plant itself in the last week and
what<00:02:31.730> we're<00:02:31.880> going<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.060> do<00:02:32.270> is<00:02:33.310> literally<00:02:34.310> take

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
what we're going to do is literally take

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.490 
what we're going to do is literally take
this<00:02:34.970> off<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.420> same<00:02:35.660> as<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:35.989> would<00:02:36.110> normally

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
this off the same as you would normally

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.280 
this off the same as you would normally
take<00:02:36.980> off<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.250> side<00:02:37.580> shoot<00:02:37.880> but<00:02:38.660> rather<00:02:38.930> than

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
take off a side shoot but rather than

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.860 
take off a side shoot but rather than
throwing<00:02:39.680> this<00:02:39.980> away<00:02:40.180> what<00:02:41.180> I'm<00:02:41.330> now<00:02:41.540> going<00:02:41.780> to

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
throwing this away what I'm now going to

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.949 
throwing this away what I'm now going to
do<00:02:42.080> is<00:02:42.620> literally<00:02:43.190> just<00:02:43.220> pop<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:43.730> into<00:02:44.660> a

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
do is literally just pop that into a

do is literally just pop that into a
bottle<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.130> water<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.700> know<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.819> normal<00:02:47.420> sort

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
bottle of water you know a normal sort

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.940 
bottle of water you know a normal sort
of<00:02:47.810> size<00:02:48.739> what<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.340> would<00:02:49.670> call<00:02:49.940> bottle<00:02:50.480> of

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
of size what I would call bottle of

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.100 
of size what I would call bottle of
fizzy<00:02:51.950> drink<00:02:52.310> with<00:02:52.610> some<00:02:52.819> watering<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.569> in

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
fizzy drink with some watering and in

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.960 
fizzy drink with some watering and in
five<00:02:54.380> or<00:02:54.530> six<00:02:54.560> days<00:02:54.890> you'll<00:02:55.220> find<00:02:55.519> that<00:02:55.760> a

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
five or six days you'll find that a

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.390 
five or six days you'll find that a
multitude<00:02:56.959> of<00:02:57.260> roots<00:02:57.560> will<00:02:57.860> come<00:02:58.130> from<00:02:58.310> the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
multitude of roots will come from the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.490 
multitude of roots will come from the
bottom<00:02:58.549> of<00:02:58.730> here<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.269> we'll<00:02:59.510> create<00:02:59.720> a<00:03:00.110> new

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
bottom of here and we'll create a new

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.710 
bottom of here and we'll create a new
plant<00:03:00.920> now<00:03:01.519> you're<00:03:02.150> not<00:03:02.269> going<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.510> get<00:03:02.630> as

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
plant now you're not going to get as

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.289 
plant now you're not going to get as
much<00:03:02.870> crop<00:03:03.590> off<00:03:03.769> this<00:03:03.980> plant<00:03:04.310> as<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.610> ones

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
much crop off this plant as the ones

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.000 
much crop off this plant as the ones
that<00:03:05.510> are<00:03:05.599> in<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.810> ground<00:03:06.080> but<00:03:06.500> you<00:03:06.680> might<00:03:06.830> get

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
that are in the ground but you might get

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.710 
that are in the ground but you might get
a<00:03:07.069> late<00:03:07.340> crop<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:07.849> it<00:03:07.940> might<00:03:08.090> be<00:03:08.120> worth<00:03:08.390> you

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
a late crop and it might be worth you

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.870 
a late crop and it might be worth you
know<00:03:08.799> producing<00:03:09.799> a<00:03:09.890> few<00:03:10.069> plants<00:03:10.549> for<00:03:10.730> those

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
know producing a few plants for those

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.600 
know producing a few plants for those
spaces<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:11.810> may<00:03:11.989> have<00:03:12.290> in<00:03:13.010> your<00:03:13.069> sort<00:03:13.519> of

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
spaces that you may have in your sort of

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.610 
spaces that you may have in your sort of
green<00:03:14.150> house<00:03:14.390> or<00:03:14.660> in<00:03:14.780> your<00:03:14.810> polytunnel<00:03:15.349> and

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
green house or in your polytunnel and

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.259 
green house or in your polytunnel and
the<00:03:16.280> other<00:03:16.459> thing<00:03:16.640> we're<00:03:16.760> going<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:16.940> do<00:03:17.120> with

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
the other thing we're going to do with

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.850 
the other thing we're going to do with
this<00:03:17.420> is<00:03:17.599> show<00:03:17.780> your<00:03:17.959> method<00:03:18.319> where<00:03:18.500> once

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
this is show your method where once

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
this is show your method where once
we've<00:03:19.040> got<00:03:19.190> those<00:03:19.310> roots<00:03:19.549> we're<00:03:19.760> actually

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
we've got those roots we're actually

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.479 
we've got those roots we're actually
going<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.180> lie<00:03:20.390> on<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:21.320> ground<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:22.220> it's<00:03:22.370> going

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
going to lie on the ground so it's going

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.000 
going to lie on the ground so it's going
to<00:03:22.549> grow<00:03:22.790> along<00:03:22.940> in<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.780> trench<00:03:24.079> and<00:03:24.320> then<00:03:24.739> at

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
to grow along in a trench and then at

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.250 
to grow along in a trench and then at
the<00:03:25.160> end<00:03:25.239> this<00:03:26.239> believe<00:03:26.720> it<00:03:26.780> or<00:03:26.900> not<00:03:27.019> will

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
the end this believe it or not will

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.920 
the end this believe it or not will
curve<00:03:27.709> up<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.190> start<00:03:28.579> to<00:03:28.730> grow<00:03:28.910> up<00:03:29.090> so<00:03:29.750> that

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
curve up and start to grow up so that

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.590 
curve up and start to grow up so that
will<00:03:30.049> have<00:03:30.350> massive<00:03:31.100> root<00:03:31.549> system<00:03:31.579> on<00:03:32.239> this

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
will have massive root system on this

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.319 
will have massive root system on this
plant<00:03:32.930> you<00:03:33.200> can<00:03:34.040> do<00:03:34.220> this<00:03:34.430> with<00:03:34.609> any<00:03:34.760> tomatoes

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
plant you can do this with any tomatoes

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.599 
plant you can do this with any tomatoes
but<00:03:35.900> with<00:03:36.079> light<00:03:36.290> Tomatoes<00:03:36.829> it<00:03:37.010> seems<00:03:37.250> to<00:03:37.400> sort

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
but with light Tomatoes it seems to sort

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:38.710 
but with light Tomatoes it seems to sort
of<00:03:37.640> give<00:03:37.790> them<00:03:37.910> a<00:03:38.030> bit<00:03:38.180> more<00:03:38.209> vigor

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
of give them a bit more vigor

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.630 
of give them a bit more vigor
so<00:03:39.170> we'll<00:03:39.319> take<00:03:39.530> two<00:03:39.769> or<00:03:39.890> three<00:03:39.920> of<00:03:40.130> these<00:03:40.400> and

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
so we'll take two or three of these and

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.930 
so we'll take two or three of these and
we'll<00:03:40.850> pop<00:03:41.239> them<00:03:41.450> into<00:03:41.630> a<00:03:42.489> like<00:03:43.489> so<00:03:43.640> a<00:03:43.670> bottle

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
we'll pop them into a like so a bottle

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.400 
we'll pop them into a like so a bottle
of<00:03:44.030> water<00:03:44.239> in<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.720> couple<00:03:44.959> of<00:03:45.019> which<00:03:45.170> we'll<00:03:45.380> be
