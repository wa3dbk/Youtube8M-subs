00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
video so let's go through the procedure

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.790 
video so let's go through the procedure
you<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.820> download<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.990> files<00:00:31.320> given<00:00:31.710> in

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
you have to download the files given in

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.590 
you have to download the files given in
the<00:00:31.920> description<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.580> extract<00:00:33.180> them<00:00:33.390> in

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the description and extract them in

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.870 
the description and extract them in
extracting<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.380> will<00:00:34.590> get<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.010> ODE<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.460> odeon

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
extracting you will get the ODE in odeon

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.480 
extracting you will get the ODE in odeon
file<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.330> will<00:00:36.540> get<00:00:36.780> an<00:00:37.320> option<00:00:37.890> called<00:00:37.920> odin

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490 
file you will get an option called odin

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.140 
file you will get an option called odin
dot<00:00:39.060> exe<00:00:39.330> so<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.080> to<00:00:40.640> click<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.880> that<00:00:42.090> and

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
dot exe so you have to click on that and

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.900 
dot exe so you have to click on that and
you<00:00:42.720> will<00:00:42.870> get<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.260> an<00:00:43.710> ordeal<00:00:44.190> like<00:00:44.220> this<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
you will get on an ordeal like this and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.270 
you will get on an ordeal like this and
although<00:00:45.510> another<00:00:46.140> one<00:00:46.380> you<00:00:46.560> have<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.710> extract

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
although another one you have to extract

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.110 
although another one you have to extract
it<00:00:47.490> and<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.940> will<00:00:48.090> get<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:49.080> single<00:00:50.040> file<00:00:50.280> which

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
it and you will get a single file which

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.920 
it and you will get a single file which
is<00:00:51.150> on<00:00:52.160> which<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.340> named<00:00:53.730> as<00:00:54.000> CF<00:00:54.540> auto

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
is on which is named as CF auto

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.060 
is on which is named as CF auto
cf-auto-root<00:00:59.210> like<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.420> somewhat<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.620> let

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
cf-auto-root like this somewhat so let

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.290 
cf-auto-root like this somewhat so let
us<00:01:02.100> go<00:01:02.220> through<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.460> procedure<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.150> have

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
us go through the procedure you have

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.660 
us go through the procedure you have
first<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:03.930> will<00:01:04.080> locate<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.890> files<00:01:05.129> click<00:01:05.519> on

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
first we will locate the files click on

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.620 
first we will locate the files click on
PDA<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:07.130> locate<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.340> downloaded<00:01:09.210> file<00:01:09.420> in

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
PDA and locate the downloaded file in

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.480 
PDA and locate the downloaded file in
the<00:01:09.780> next<00:01:10.050> opening<00:01:10.410> so<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.710> will<00:01:10.920> be<00:01:10.950> easy<00:01:11.340> to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the next opening so it will be easy to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.420 
the next opening so it will be easy to
find<00:01:11.810> select<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.100> file<00:01:14.100> which<00:01:14.400> is

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
find select the file which is

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.470 
find select the file which is
cf-auto-root<00:01:16.100> you<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.280> say<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:18.060> model

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
cf-auto-root you can say the model

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.750 
cf-auto-root you can say the model
number<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.810> also<00:01:19.290> displayed<00:01:19.800> over<00:01:20.100> there<00:01:20.340> so

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
number is also displayed over there so

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.400 
number is also displayed over there so
you<00:01:20.820> have<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.120> just<00:01:21.300> double<00:01:21.600> click<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:21.960> so

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
you have to just double click on it so

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.410 
you have to just double click on it so
it<00:01:22.530> will<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:23.660> located<00:01:24.660> in<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.800> odin<00:01:26.220> now<00:01:27.210> it's

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
it will be located in the odin now it's

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.990 
it will be located in the odin now it's
