and so on they like it too okay so the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.689 
and so on they like it too okay so the
fish<00:00:43.199> on<00:00:43.379> bottom<00:00:43.799> one<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> best<00:00:44.280> rigs<00:00:44.519> to

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
fish on bottom one of the best rigs to

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.369 
fish on bottom one of the best rigs to
use<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.089> actually<00:00:45.389> called<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.749> sliding<00:00:46.170> sinker

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
use is actually called a sliding sinker

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.649 
use is actually called a sliding sinker
rig<00:00:46.709> and<00:00:47.459> the<00:00:47.789> reason<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.179> called<00:00:48.209> a<00:00:48.420> sliding

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 
rig and the reason it's called a sliding

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.449 
rig and the reason it's called a sliding
sinker<00:00:48.929> rig<00:00:49.199> is<00:00:49.409> pretty<00:00:49.649> obvious<00:00:49.829> I've<00:00:50.280> got<00:00:50.429> a

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:50.459 
sinker rig is pretty obvious I've got a

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:53.329 
sinker rig is pretty obvious I've got a
bell<00:00:50.850> sinker<00:00:51.589> actually<00:00:52.589> it's<00:00:52.709> an<00:00:52.769> egg<00:00:52.920> sinker

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
bell sinker actually it's an egg sinker

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.069 
bell sinker actually it's an egg sinker
you<00:00:53.940> could<00:00:54.089> use<00:00:54.209> a<00:00:54.239> bell<00:00:54.449> sinker<00:00:54.749> without<00:00:55.019> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
you could use a bell sinker without the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.779 
you could use a bell sinker without the
center<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.679> you<00:00:56.069> put<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.339> line<00:00:56.489> through<00:00:56.519> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
center and you put the line through it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.099 
center and you put the line through it
so<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.030> slides<00:00:57.239> up<00:00:57.389> and<00:00:57.510> down<00:00:57.629> you'll<00:00:57.959> notice

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
so it slides up and down you'll notice

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.809 
so it slides up and down you'll notice
that<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.440> use<00:00:58.589> the<00:00:58.739> little<00:00:58.920> bead<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.670> could

00:00:59.809 --> 00:00:59.819 
that I use the little bead you could

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:01.250 
that I use the little bead you could
even<00:00:59.940> put<00:01:00.119> a<00:01:00.149> pink<00:01:00.389> bead<00:01:00.569> there<00:01:00.809> if<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.989> wanted

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
even put a pink bead there if you wanted

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.139 
even put a pink bead there if you wanted
to<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.979> bead<00:01:02.159> is<00:01:02.279> there<00:01:02.459> so<00:01:02.609> when<00:01:02.729> the<00:01:02.819> sinker

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
to the bead is there so when the sinker

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.119 
to the bead is there so when the sinker
hits<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.510> swivel<00:01:03.869> boom<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.619> doesn't<00:01:04.979> wreck

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
hits the swivel boom it doesn't wreck

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.429 
hits the swivel boom it doesn't wreck
the<00:01:05.250> line<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:06.149> like<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.299> cushion<00:01:06.750> then<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.320> have

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the line it's like a cushion then I have

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.139 
the line it's like a cushion then I have
a<00:01:07.469> swivel<00:01:07.829> that's<00:01:08.430> right<00:01:08.640> there<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
a swivel that's right there and to the

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.649 
a swivel that's right there and to the
swivel<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:10.229> my<00:01:10.409> leader<00:01:10.680> with<00:01:11.159> my<00:01:11.369> hook

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
swivel I have my leader with my hook

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.849 
swivel I have my leader with my hook
believe<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.780> or<00:01:12.869> not<00:01:12.960> actually<00:01:13.469> used<00:01:13.680> this

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:13.859 
believe it or not actually used this

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:15.529 
believe it or not actually used this

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
you cast this out it hits the bottom

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.859 
you cast this out it hits the bottom
okay<00:01:20.579> so<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.969> is<00:01:21.179> my<00:01:21.329> hand<00:01:21.539> is<00:01:21.689> now<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
okay so this is my hand is now the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.520 
okay so this is my hand is now the
bottom<00:01:22.289> this<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.130> laying<00:01:23.399> on<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.670> bottom<00:01:24.000> and

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
bottom this is laying on the bottom and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.499 
bottom this is laying on the bottom and
you<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.560> bait<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.130> here<00:01:26.460> when<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> fish<00:01:27.179> grabs

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
you have bait on here when a fish grabs

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.300 
you have bait on here when a fish grabs
the<00:01:27.719> bait<00:01:27.899> and<00:01:28.049> starts<00:01:28.320> eating<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.890> swims

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the bait and starts eating it and swims

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.830 
the bait and starts eating it and swims
away<00:01:29.490> look<00:01:29.820> what<00:01:29.969> happens<00:01:30.359> to<00:01:30.509> about<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
away look what happens to about the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.230 
away look what happens to about the
sinker<00:01:31.229> he<00:01:31.890> pulls<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.460> line<00:01:32.670> through<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
sinker he pulls the line through the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.109 
sinker he pulls the line through the
sinker<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.560> no<00:01:34.770> matter<00:01:34.979> how<00:01:35.249> big<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.670> sinker

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
sinker so no matter how big the sinker

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.270 
sinker so no matter how big the sinker
is<00:01:36.270> he<00:01:36.479> doesn't<00:01:36.810> feel<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.200> but<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.829> see<00:01:38.189> on

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
is he doesn't feel it but you see on

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.830 
is he doesn't feel it but you see on
your<00:01:38.429> rod<00:01:38.640> tip<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:39.090> there's<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.299> fish<00:01:39.570> biting
