00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
three carbons that are behind it and I

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.019 
three carbons that are behind it and I
don't<00:00:28.470> see<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.160> need<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.609> all<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.970> I

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
don't see you need to have all that I

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.209 
don't see you need to have all that I
don't<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.570> don't<00:00:30.630> see<00:00:31.410> any<00:00:31.560> any<00:00:31.830> need<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.009> do

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.830 
don't I don't see any any need to do
that<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.550> what<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.700> do<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.940> always<00:00:33.390> split<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.750> in

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
that so what I do is always split it in

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.170 
that so what I do is always split it in
half<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.590> i<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:34.800> two<00:00:35.040> separate<00:00:35.610> order<00:00:35.850> forms

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
half so i have two separate order forms

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.000 
half so i have two separate order forms
and<00:00:37.050> then<00:00:38.600> what<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.629> do<00:00:39.750> with<00:00:40.290> my<00:00:40.320> order<00:00:40.800> form

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
and then what I do with my order form

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.920 
and then what I do with my order form
says<00:00:41.219> I'll<00:00:41.760> give<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> customer<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.660> back

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
I'll keep the front copy because it's

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.350 
I'll keep the front copy because it's
always<00:00:47.039> clearer<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.550> easier<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.969> read<00:00:48.120> and

her credit card here I've never had an
issue<00:06:04.000> that<00:06:04.240> before<00:06:04.780> I<00:06:04.810> don't<00:06:05.170> know<00:06:05.350> what

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
issue that before I don't know what

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.790 
issue that before I don't know what
signature<00:06:06.400> does<00:06:06.730> that's<00:06:07.420> just<00:06:07.660> my<00:06:10.800> stupidity

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
signature does that's just my stupidity

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.620 
signature does that's just my stupidity
of<00:06:12.190> not<00:06:12.370> knowing<00:06:12.520> why<00:06:12.760> I<00:06:12.790> should<00:06:13.180> have<00:06:13.360> that

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
of not knowing why I should have that

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.030 
of not knowing why I should have that
but<00:06:13.870> maybe<00:06:14.080> you<00:06:14.230> should<00:06:14.380> keep<00:06:14.470> a<00:06:14.530> copy<00:06:14.740> that

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
but maybe you should keep a copy that

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.030 
but maybe you should keep a copy that
one<00:06:15.220> and<00:06:16.060> then<00:06:16.510> I<00:06:16.600> always<00:06:16.900> give<00:06:17.170> like<00:06:17.860> I<00:06:17.980> said

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
one and then I always give like I said

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.210 
one and then I always give like I said
the<00:06:18.340> back<00:06:18.900> the<00:06:19.900> carbon<00:06:20.320> to<00:06:20.560> the<00:06:20.590> customer<00:06:21.160> and

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
the back the carbon to the customer and

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.530 
the back the carbon to the customer and
then<00:06:21.340> I<00:06:21.430> keep<00:06:21.640> the<00:06:21.760> original<00:06:22.120> because<00:06:22.330> it's

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
then I keep the original because it's

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.340 
then I keep the original because it's
most<00:06:23.140> likely<00:06:23.230> more<00:06:23.680> legible<00:06:25.110> that's<00:06:26.110> all<00:06:26.320> I

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350
