00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
that has been discussed for many years

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.429 
that has been discussed for many years
in<00:01:28.409> literature<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.280> filming<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.329> an<00:01:30.630> after

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
in literature and filming and an after

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.700 
in literature and filming and an after
so<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> basic<00:01:32.640> rule<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.570> game<00:01:33.750> was<00:01:34.350> quite

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
so the basic rule of the game was quite

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.460 
so the basic rule of the game was quite
the<00:01:34.820> well<00:01:35.820> framed<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.470> course<00:01:37.500> inside<00:01:38.490> of

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
the well framed but of course inside of

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.190 
the well framed but of course inside of
filling<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.920> boxes<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.579> course<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:43.049> had

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
filling up the boxes of course you had

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.230 
filling up the boxes of course you had
to<00:01:43.350> make<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.500> selection<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.759> selection

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
to make a selection and the selection

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.840 
to make a selection and the selection
was<00:01:45.509> first<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.500> all<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:47.009> find<00:01:47.220> artists<00:01:47.700> who

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
was first of all to find artists who

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.740 
was first of all to find artists who
were<00:01:48.030> able<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.869> tell<00:01:49.409> us<00:01:49.439> stories<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.750> artists

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
were able to tell us stories and artists

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.649 
were able to tell us stories and artists
that<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.290> thought<00:01:52.590> had<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.549> new<00:01:54.270> kind<00:01:54.479> of

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
that I thought had a new kind of

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.670 
that I thought had a new kind of
originality<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.250> way<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.790> telling<00:01:57.329> us

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
originality in the way of telling us

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.980 
originality in the way of telling us
formalizing<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.710> stories<00:01:59.159> so<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.299> fact<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
formalizing the stories so in fact the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.429 
formalizing the stories so in fact the
subjectivity<00:02:01.530> comes<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.640> very<00:02:03.509> small<00:02:03.659> level

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
subjectivity comes on a very small level

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:19.770 
subjectivity comes on a very small level
of<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.700> selection

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.090 

but<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.890> think<00:02:21.520> what<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:22.150> probably<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.890> most

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
but I think what it is probably the most

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.040 
but I think what it is probably the most
new<00:02:24.940> in<00:02:25.300> this<00:02:26.730> Biennale<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:28.090> this<00:02:28.720> young

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
new in this Biennale is this young
