00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
me it's got that Yale let me see if I

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.889 
me it's got that Yale let me see if I
can<00:00:44.010> get<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> light<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.850> little<00:00:45.660> hole

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
can get the light on it a little hole

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.610 
can get the light on it a little hole
that<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.739> am<00:00:47.570> clear<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.719> paint<00:00:48.930> off<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.140> and

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
that I am clear the paint off of and

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.069 
that I am clear the paint off of and
stuck<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> camera<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.550> there<00:00:50.760> basically<00:00:51.329> and

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
stuck the camera in there basically and

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.930 
stuck the camera in there basically and
that's<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> front<00:00:53.039> facing<00:00:53.370> camera<00:00:53.670> had<00:00:53.789> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
that's the front facing camera had to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.400 
that's the front facing camera had to
adjust<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> focus<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.780> bit<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.050> get<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.199> right

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
adjust the focus a bit to get it right

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.920 
adjust the focus a bit to get it right
but<00:00:55.620> it's<00:00:56.219> pretty<00:00:56.399> good<00:00:56.670> considering<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.239> 0.3

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
but it's pretty good considering a 0.3

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.229 
but it's pretty good considering a 0.3
megapixel<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.620> I'm<00:00:58.739> kind<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.699> wondering<00:00:59.879> if

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
megapixel is I'm kind of wondering if

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.979 
megapixel is I'm kind of wondering if
this<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.710> proper<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.730> aspect<00:01:03.570> ratio<00:01:03.930> I

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
this is the proper like aspect ratio I

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.149 
this is the proper like aspect ratio I
noticed<00:01:04.320> one<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.559> other<00:01:04.680> mirror<00:01:04.949> apps

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
noticed one of the other mirror apps

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.250 
noticed one of the other mirror apps
kind<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.549> cropped<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:06.869> thinking<00:01:07.229> maybe

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
kind of cropped it so I'm thinking maybe

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.039 
kind of cropped it so I'm thinking maybe
this<00:01:08.100> one<00:01:08.310> does<00:01:08.460> too<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:09.210> might<00:01:09.750> make<00:01:09.930> my

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
this one does too and I might make my

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.840 
this one does too and I might make my
own<00:01:10.080> software<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.070> test<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.430> out<00:01:11.490> since

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
own software just to test it out since

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.410 
own software just to test it out since
I'm<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.090> DAB<00:01:12.270> anyway<00:01:13.729> and<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.939> still<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
I'm a DAB anyway and I still have the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.969 
I'm a DAB anyway and I still have the
back<00:01:15.600> camera<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.470> one's<00:01:16.650> kind<00:01:16.890> of

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
back camera but that one's kind of

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.300 
back camera but that one's kind of
messed<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.640> I'll<00:01:17.729> show<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.920> can

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
messed up and I'll show you so you can

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.060 
messed up and I'll show you so you can
see<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:21.240> can't<00:01:21.509> actually<00:01:21.689> see<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.770> not<00:01:22.860> so

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
see you can't actually see it's not so

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.530 
see you can't actually see it's not so
bad<00:01:23.220> but<00:01:23.490> there's<00:01:23.700> banding<00:01:26.090> you<00:01:27.090> can't<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.479> it

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
bad but there's banding you can't see it

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.990 
bad but there's banding you can't see it
at<00:01:27.600> all<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:27.990> camera<00:01:28.229> too<00:01:28.590> bad<00:01:28.770> i<00:01:29.040> think

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
at all on this camera too bad i think

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.670 
at all on this camera too bad i think
when<00:01:30.119> i<00:01:30.210> go<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.360> video<00:01:30.600> camera<00:01:31.049> mode<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.500> more

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
when i go to video camera mode it's more

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:40.880 
when i go to video camera mode it's more

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
still can't see it there you can see

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.870 
still can't see it there you can see
some<00:01:44.060> yeah<00:01:45.060> there's<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.810> banding<00:01:46.880> evil

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
some yeah there's the banding evil

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.149 
some yeah there's the banding evil
banding<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:49.229> there's<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.530> lot<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.680> binding<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
banding so there's a lot of binding the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.859 
banding so there's a lot of binding the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
free screen from flickr is quite a bit

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.050 
free screen from flickr is quite a bit
yeah<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.079> can<00:01:52.290> see<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.439> flickering<00:01:52.820> it's<00:01:53.820> not

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
yeah you can see it flickering it's not

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.490 
yeah you can see it flickering it's not
just<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.390> bad<00:01:54.509> webcam<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.079> screen<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.350> actually

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
just a bad webcam the screen is actually

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.130 
just a bad webcam the screen is actually
flickering<00:01:56.070> which<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.340> pretty<00:01:56.460> messed<00:01:56.759> up

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
flickering which is pretty messed up

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.480 
flickering which is pretty messed up
hopefully<00:01:58.140> it'll<00:01:58.380> get<00:01:58.530> sorted<00:01:58.740> out<00:01:58.979> over<00:01:59.219> to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
hopefully it'll get sorted out over to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.219 
hopefully it'll get sorted out over to
software<00:01:59.790> issue<00:01:59.969> not<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.270> hardware<00:02:00.540> issue<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
software issue not a hardware issue and

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.550 
software issue not a hardware issue and
