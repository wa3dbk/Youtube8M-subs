00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
so I'd be careful of him there is so

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.120 
so I'd be careful of him there is so
he's<00:03:06.450> got<00:03:06.630> quite<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.930> lot<00:03:07.109> of<00:03:07.170> health<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.980> was

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
he's got quite a lot of health it was

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.590 
he's got quite a lot of health it was
set<00:03:08.310> me<00:03:08.400> on<00:03:08.430> fire<00:03:08.519> of<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:08.910> sword<00:03:09.209> I'll<00:03:09.420> show

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
set me on fire of that sword I'll show

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.880 
set me on fire of that sword I'll show
you<00:03:09.660> know<00:03:10.820> they<00:03:11.820> get

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
you know they get

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.630 
you know they get
die<00:03:14.140> so<00:03:15.140> he<00:03:15.380> does<00:03:15.590> actually<00:03:15.800> drop<00:03:16.190> his<00:03:16.340> sword

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
die so he does actually drop his sword

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.290 
die so he does actually drop his sword
sometimes<00:03:18.190> sooner<00:03:19.190> here's<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.550> giant<00:03:20.000> he's<00:03:20.270> a

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
sometimes sooner here's the giant he's a

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.090 
sometimes sooner here's the giant he's a
giant<00:03:21.140> because<00:03:21.290> he's<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.680> giant<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.180> he<00:03:24.100> looks

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
giant because he's a giant and he looks

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.400 
giant because he's a giant and he looks
like<00:03:25.310> this<00:03:25.490> I<00:03:25.700> think<00:03:25.970> he's<00:03:26.120> harmless<00:03:26.540> if<00:03:27.080> you

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
like this I think he's harmless if you

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.560 
like this I think he's harmless if you
don't<00:03:27.620> hit<00:03:27.800> him<00:03:27.890> first<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:28.459> here's<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.270> sword

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
don't hit him first and here's the sword

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.400 
don't hit him first and here's the sword
of<00:03:29.780> that<00:03:29.990> um<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:31.370> guy<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:31.910> killed<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.720> min<00:03:33.080> ago

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
of that um that guy I killed a min ago

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.980 
of that um that guy I killed a min ago
and<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.190> last<00:03:34.400> mob<00:03:34.670> so<00:03:35.300> he<00:03:35.420> actually<00:03:35.600> sets

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
and the last mob so he actually sets

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:42.640 
and the last mob so he actually sets
them<00:03:36.110> on<00:03:36.200> fire<00:03:36.310> like<00:03:37.310> that<00:03:41.020> so<00:03:42.020> this<00:03:42.170> is<00:03:42.350> the

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
them on fire like that so this is the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.370 
them on fire like that so this is the
the<00:03:43.640> reason<00:03:43.819> these<00:03:44.450> know<00:03:44.600> coming<00:03:44.930> if<00:03:45.200> he's

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
the reason these know coming if he's

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.460 
the reason these know coming if he's
stuck<00:03:45.620> on<00:03:45.739> this<00:03:49.300> but<00:03:50.300> they<00:03:50.420> do<00:03:50.480> go<00:03:50.810> for<00:03:50.959> you<00:03:51.080> so

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
stuck on this but they do go for you so

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.300 
stuck on this but they do go for you so
it<00:03:51.769> took<00:03:51.950> a<00:03:52.010> load<00:03:52.310> of<00:03:52.459> damage<00:03:52.760> then<00:03:53.000> and<00:03:54.310> every

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
it took a load of damage then and every

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.330 
it took a load of damage then and every
time<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:56.380> hitting<00:03:57.380> me<00:03:57.470> gets<00:03:57.650> more<00:03:57.920> he<00:03:58.160> gets

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
time you hitting me gets more he gets

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.509 
time you hitting me gets more he gets
faster<00:03:58.880> and<00:03:58.910> it's<00:03:59.450> more<00:04:00.350> powerful<00:04:00.530> so

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
faster and it's more powerful so

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.210 
faster and it's more powerful so
eventually<00:04:01.790> kill<00:04:02.150> him<00:04:02.269> here<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:03.590> takes<00:04:03.890> a<00:04:04.010> load

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
eventually kill him here it takes a load

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.780 
eventually kill him here it takes a load
of<00:04:04.370> damage<00:04:05.500> he's<00:04:06.500> pretty<00:04:06.680> hard<00:04:06.920> to<00:04:07.070> kill<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:07.760> I

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
of damage he's pretty hard to kill so I

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.759 
of damage he's pretty hard to kill so I
adds<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.360> kill<00:04:08.630> you<00:04:08.810> kill<00:04:09.019> em<00:04:09.200> you<00:04:09.230> get<00:04:10.220> a<00:04:10.250> bone

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
adds a kill you kill em you get a bone

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.270 
adds a kill you kill em you get a bone
so<00:04:12.769> with<00:04:12.890> this<00:04:12.920> bone<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.700> vampire<00:04:13.910> blood

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
so with this bone and the vampire blood

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.190 
so with this bone and the vampire blood
you<00:04:16.280> can<00:04:16.519> oh<00:04:16.760> yeah<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.329> vampire<00:04:17.660> blood<00:04:17.870> also

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
you can oh yeah the vampire blood also

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.750 
you can oh yeah the vampire blood also
turns<00:04:18.410> to<00:04:18.650> red<00:04:18.799> stones<00:04:19.130> there's<00:04:19.430> another<00:04:19.640> way

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
turns to red stones there's another way

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.480 
turns to red stones there's another way
game<00:04:19.970> redstone<00:04:20.479> instead<00:04:21.229> of<00:04:21.350> mining<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.280> all

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
game redstone instead of mining the all

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.060 
game redstone instead of mining the all
so<00:04:23.360> put<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.810> bone<00:04:23.990> next<00:04:24.350> to<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.680> it<00:04:24.950> gives

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
so put a bone next to it and it gives

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.270
