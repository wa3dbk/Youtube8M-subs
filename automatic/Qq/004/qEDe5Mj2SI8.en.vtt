cameras stop to kind of capture it

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.720 
cameras stop to kind of capture it
sometimes<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:35.070> they<00:00:35.159> use<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.339> lenticular

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
sometimes but they use a lenticular

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.489 
sometimes but they use a lenticular
technology<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.600> kind<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.839> give<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.079> 3d

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:37.499 
technology to kind of give it a 3d

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.690 
an attack value for 50 and attacks hi we
would<00:02:51.590> compare<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.709> total<00:02:53.069> defense<00:02:53.340> versus

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
would compare the total defense versus

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.850 
would compare the total defense versus
the<00:02:53.819> attack<00:02:54.090> we<00:02:54.269> see<00:02:54.450> 600<00:02:55.079> is<00:02:55.410> greater<00:02:55.739> than

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
the attack we see 600 is greater than

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.740 
the attack we see 600 is greater than
400<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.519> attack<00:02:56.790> would<00:02:56.970> not<00:02:57.090> affect<00:02:57.540> him

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
400 so the attack would not affect him

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.300 
400 so the attack would not affect him
at<00:02:57.840> all<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.319> simply<00:02:58.680> just<00:02:58.920> fall<00:02:59.130> off<00:02:59.160> the

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
at all and simply just fall off the

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.440 
at all and simply just fall off the

character a term breakdown essentially

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.789 
character a term breakdown essentially
works<00:03:03.630> as<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.959> decide<00:03:04.170> who<00:03:04.380> gets<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.650> go<00:03:04.680> first

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
works as you decide who gets to go first

level<00:03:28.859> at<00:03:28.950> three<00:03:29.310> now<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.850> maximum<00:03:30.389> the<00:03:30.480> game

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
level at three now the maximum the game

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.500 
level at three now the maximum the game
is<00:03:30.750> 20<00:03:31.139> you<00:03:31.350> can't<00:03:31.560> go<00:03:31.650> any<00:03:31.829> further<00:03:31.980> than<00:03:32.510> 20

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
is 20 you can't go any further than 20

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.270 
is 20 you can't go any further than 20
the<00:03:33.959> eastern<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.650> gain<00:03:34.889> a<00:03:34.920> chiro

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
the eastern you gain a chiro

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.430 
the eastern you gain a chiro
automatically<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.660> there's<00:03:36.810> cards<00:03:37.139> that<00:03:37.260> can

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
automatically and there's cards that can

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.170 
automatically and there's cards that can
boost<00:03:37.620> that<00:03:37.799> beyond<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.370> but<00:03:38.760> each<00:03:38.850> turn<00:03:39.030> you

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
boost that beyond that but each turn you

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.270 
boost that beyond that but each turn you
normally<00:03:39.480> gain<00:03:39.630> one<00:03:39.840> Cairo<00:03:40.079> and<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:40.829> recharge

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
normally gain one Cairo and you recharge

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.150 
normally gain one Cairo and you recharge
up<00:03:41.519> to<00:03:41.760> that<00:03:41.940> level<00:03:42.180> so<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:43.739> first<00:03:43.980> turn

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
up to that level so the first turn

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.559 
up to that level so the first turn
you're<00:03:44.310> going<00:03:44.579> to<00:03:44.639> have<00:03:44.760> four<00:03:45.000> so<00:03:45.269> most<00:03:45.540> of

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
you're going to have four so most of

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.030 
you're going to have four so most of
these<00:03:45.660> attacks<00:03:45.840> in<00:03:46.200> this<00:03:46.290> opening<00:03:46.680> hand<00:03:46.889> we

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
these attacks in this opening hand we

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.650 
these attacks in this opening hand we
could<00:03:47.220> play<00:03:47.400> so<00:03:47.850> for<00:03:47.970> example<00:03:48.000> let's<00:03:48.359> say<00:03:48.540> this

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
could play so for example let's say this

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.569 
could play so for example let's say this
is<00:03:48.720> our<00:03:48.930> opponents<00:03:49.319> plane<00:03:49.500> area<00:03:49.739> I<00:03:50.040> could<00:03:50.430> play

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
is our opponents plane area I could play

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.910 
is our opponents plane area I could play
this<00:03:50.760> electric<00:03:51.120> crush<00:03:51.389> on<00:03:51.690> let's<00:03:52.530> say<00:03:52.650> we<00:03:52.769> play

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
this electric crush on let's say we play

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.340 
this electric crush on let's say we play
on<00:03:53.100> princess<00:03:53.519> tiara<00:03:53.819> princess<00:03:54.450> dr<00:03:54.900> has<00:03:55.319> a

defense in green and blue but not
agreeing<00:03:57.660> in<00:03:57.750> red<00:03:57.930> but<00:03:58.139> nothing<00:03:58.380> in<00:03:58.470> blue<00:03:58.709> so

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
agreeing in red but nothing in blue so

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.949

we are played this attack on her and we

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.960 
we are played this attack on her and we
see<00:04:01.109> that<00:04:01.139> it<00:04:01.349> covers<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.739> topmost<00:04:02.609> part<00:04:02.849> of

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
see that it covers the topmost part of

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.080 
see that it covers the topmost part of
her<00:04:03.030> attack<00:04:03.359> and<00:04:03.739> it<00:04:04.739> says<00:04:05.099> if<00:04:05.280> this<00:04:05.430> attack

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
her attack and it says if this attack

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.879 
her attack and it says if this attack
hits<00:04:06.540> an<00:04:06.780> opponent<00:04:07.290> has<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.410> discard<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.859> card

this<00:04:30.030> power<00:04:30.270> is<00:04:30.419> 350<00:04:31.020> or<00:04:31.139> less<00:04:31.289> as<00:04:31.650> we<00:04:31.830> see<00:04:31.979> here

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
this power is 350 or less as we see here

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:33.950 
this power is 350 or less as we see here
electric<00:04:32.580> crush<00:04:32.789> unfortunately<00:04:33.300> it's<00:04:33.389> 450<00:04:33.810> so

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
electric crush unfortunately it's 450 so

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.600 
electric crush unfortunately it's 450 so
this<00:04:34.080> attack<00:04:34.319> couldn't<00:04:34.650> affect<00:04:34.919> it<00:04:35.099> but<00:04:35.460> for

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
this attack couldn't affect it but for

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.209 
this attack couldn't affect it but for
weaker<00:04:35.879> attacks<00:04:36.180> we<00:04:36.330> definitely<00:04:36.750> could<00:04:37.219> you

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:38.219 
weaker attacks we definitely could you

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:39.679 
weaker attacks we definitely could you
have<00:04:38.310> some<00:04:38.490> other<00:04:38.580> examples<00:04:38.849> of<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.300> tax<00:04:39.509> here

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:39.689 
have some other examples of the tax here

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:41.990 
have some other examples of the tax here
such<00:04:40.259> as<00:04:40.379> borealis<00:04:40.889> blast<00:04:41.129> is<00:04:41.490> a<00:04:41.550> really<00:04:41.849> good

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
such as borealis blast is a really good

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.760 
such as borealis blast is a really good
attack<00:04:42.270> because<00:04:42.569> it<00:04:42.659> only<00:04:42.780> costs<00:04:43.050> three<00:04:43.319> it

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
attack because it only costs three it

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.010 
attack because it only costs three it
has<00:04:43.919> a<00:04:43.949> high<00:04:44.250> attack<00:04:44.580> its<00:04:45.060> powers<00:04:45.389> 350<00:04:45.900> which

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
has a high attack its powers 350 which

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.480 
has a high attack its powers 350 which
is<00:04:46.139> pretty<00:04:46.319> decent<00:04:46.530> I<00:04:46.830> mean<00:04:46.949> I<00:04:47.009> guess<00:04:47.039> by<00:04:47.280> most

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
is pretty decent I mean I guess by most

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.279 
is pretty decent I mean I guess by most
defenses<00:04:48.000> but<00:04:48.389> the<00:04:48.509> greatest<00:04:48.840> part<00:04:49.080> about<00:04:49.139> it

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
defenses but the greatest part about it

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.170 
defenses but the greatest part about it
is<00:04:49.500> when<00:04:50.009> you<00:04:50.099> play<00:04:50.310> it<00:04:50.400> on<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.610> card<00:04:50.879> what<00:04:51.090> it

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
is when you play it on the card what it

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.610 
is when you play it on the card what it
does<00:04:51.300> is<00:04:51.479> it<00:04:51.509> changes<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.080> Carter<00:04:52.349> underneath

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
does is it changes the Carter underneath

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.129 
does is it changes the Carter underneath
it<00:04:52.800> will<00:04:53.129> notice<00:04:53.490> that<00:04:53.669> the<00:04:53.849> the<00:04:54.810> defensive

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
it will notice that the the defensive

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.869 
it will notice that the the defensive
attributes<00:04:55.800> are<00:04:55.919> now<00:04:56.009> blocked<00:04:56.310> off<00:04:56.610> by<00:04:56.639> the

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:56.879 
attributes are now blocked off by the

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.279 
attributes are now blocked off by the
art<00:04:57.090> on<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.330> card<00:04:57.539> and<00:04:57.659> that's<00:04:57.810> purposely

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
art on the card and that's purposely

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.260 
art on the card and that's purposely
intense<00:04:58.590> 'full<00:04:58.800> to<00:04:59.340> actually<00:04:59.789> knock<00:05:00.030> out<00:05:00.240> that

intense 'full to actually knock out that
person's<00:05:00.750> defense<00:05:01.110> so<00:05:01.440> now<00:05:01.530> if<00:05:01.650> you<00:05:01.740> had<00:05:01.830> some

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.010 
opponent's text on the bottom it's still
relevant<00:05:13.830> but<00:05:14.400> there<00:05:15.120> are<00:05:15.150> cards<00:05:15.569> for<00:05:15.750> example

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
relevant but there are cards for example

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.420 
relevant but there are cards for example
that<00:05:16.110> new<00:05:16.229> cover<00:05:16.469> that<00:05:16.680> text<00:05:17.039> up<00:05:17.129> and<00:05:17.279> if<00:05:17.340> it

that new cover that text up and if it

that new cover that text up and if it
does<00:05:17.580> it<00:05:17.789> negates<00:05:18.060> that<00:05:18.150> opponents<00:05:18.629> ability

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
does it negates that opponents ability

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.110 
does it negates that opponents ability
or<00:05:19.349> it<00:05:19.529> could<00:05:19.710> negate<00:05:20.009> a<00:05:20.189> monsters<00:05:20.729> ability

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
or it could negate a monsters ability

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.360 
or it could negate a monsters ability
which<00:05:21.240> is<00:05:21.360> very<00:05:21.539> cute<00:05:21.870> so<00:05:22.860> eventually<00:05:22.979> the

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
which is very cute so eventually the

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.200 
which is very cute so eventually the
whole<00:05:23.490> point<00:05:23.639> of<00:05:23.759> the<00:05:23.849> game<00:05:23.879> is<00:05:23.969> to<00:05:24.120> play

whole point of the game is to play

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.149 
whole point of the game is to play
enough<00:05:24.509> attacks<00:05:24.840> to<00:05:25.409> get<00:05:25.560> enough<00:05:25.800> momentum

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
enough attacks to get enough momentum

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.830 
enough attacks to get enough momentum
built<00:05:26.639> up<00:05:26.819> to<00:05:27.150> eventually<00:05:27.479> knock<00:05:27.629> out<00:05:27.810> all

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840
