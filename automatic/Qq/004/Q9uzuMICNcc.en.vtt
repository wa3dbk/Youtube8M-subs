00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.330
 what wave band here again the f 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.859
 Commenting on this new tutorial 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.469
 decoration for your houses 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.389
 xbox 360 edition and pc or the version that 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.240
 you want to play and well this time 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.519
 I bring a small one small tutorial 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.320
 about a lamp that look great in 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:21.359
 their houses in this case I have this 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.939
 little house here in what would be a 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.279
 Snowy biome is a bit set in 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.900
 that language so good what kind of 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.359
 lamp I will make is going to be with a 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.759
 lamp these reddish stone 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.380
 that are achieved in the cne of the stone 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.160
 to bright and after turns with 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.800
 rest to a lamp like these and good 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.570
 in this case I already have a space like this 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.000
 assigned to you this up here 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.500
 Now what I'm going to do is turn it on 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.390
 is here clearly is not going to 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.300
 being able to see from below is going to look like this 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.430
 this way and can you help me to say 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.490
 illuminate the ceiling so that they do not appear 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.590
 enemies in that area once that's done 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.930
 Now what is going to be placed 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.750
 ladders in this way remember 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.120
 this lamp I created it 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.620
 what would be the series of magical terrain 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.480
 that by the way if you have not seen her you 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.610
 I recommend that you see it once done 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.170
 this so that it is a bit better so you 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.110
 you can leave it and it's super good 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.390
 pretty and everything but I like to place 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.310
 slabs in this way so that it remains 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.070
 same level as what would be the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.020
 stairs going a little more level and 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.240
 a little more amazing nothing but 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.910
 you can clearly see how we have a mantra 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.160
 that has thousands and thousands of books of 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.350
 lighting so here we have some of 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.540
 them but it looks pretty good from this 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.149
 way nothing more than as I say them then 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.399
 there are thousands of lighting ebooks these 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.280
 you can remove them in different ways 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.740
 let's remove this from here to see if it 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.899
 can remove good so it stays but of 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.119
 that way they serve is super good and you 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.890
 You are eliminating the bucs or little by little 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.220
 they remove but it looks pretty good 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.050
 so a little modern super pretty like that 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.030
 as for luxurious houses in this case I 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.220
 I have a house of chiquitita I have 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.920
 here some torches but in the same way 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.200
 they illuminate quite well and do not 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.820
 we are going to remove them but in the same way 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.229
 so it illuminated so that they do not appear 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.420
 enemies for today but 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.640
 they light up pretty well look at 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.920
 the whole area but in the same way 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.140
 placed some small torches to the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.239
 side to make it look a little better 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.819
 the video but good, this is the 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.530
 decoration is something short but all 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.980
 the decorations that I have raised position 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.810
 a bit like that for a short duration because 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.549
 does not require much explanation to 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.920
 amazon as tutorials for you to see 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.450
 how they are built and nothing else I hope that 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.579
 they liked that they have passed 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.110
 super good and if you can share the 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.750
 video with your friends who like 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.970
 decorate have your houses well done then 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.190
