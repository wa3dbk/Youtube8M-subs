00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:11.909
 thermostat is set to 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:14.299
 wall in the most convenient place so 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.170
 so as not to interfere with the arrangement of furniture 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.320
 but any comfortable height but not less

 high humidity in the bathroom 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.920
 rooms in the sauna pool should 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.939
 install outside of such premises 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.879

 thermostat installation site 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.820
 need to bring power 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.890
 at the same time suppress the conductor power 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.650
 ruler must comply in 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.120
 current heating floor 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.960
 preparing the floor surface for 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.920
 montage 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.540
 to remove debris 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.120
 need to hold ipo room cloche 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.250
 brush 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.510
 then you need to process 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.690
 floor primer 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.450
 to improve surface contact 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.909
 young on a sand screed 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.670
 further marking of places where 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.770
 floor heating devices are not required 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.479
 for example, under stationary 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.670
 aging beach plumbing and so 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.580
 Further 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.240
 besides how to take into account 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.170
 approaches from the walls of at least five 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.950
 centimeters 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.610
 as well as the fact that it is heating 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.020
 cable must be on 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.479
 a distance of at least ten centimeters from 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.509
 other heating 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.100
 devices for example from old men and pipes 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.150
 central heating 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.920
 laying insulation and 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.130
 mounting fixture 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.810
 lay and heat insulation on 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.619
 floor surfaces if heat loss through 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:42.229
 learn 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.180
 they are minimal 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.730
 for example under the room is 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.610
 heated room 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.400
 then laying insulating 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.359
 material of small thickness 3 4 millimeters 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:53.389
 can be produced only on the square 

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:56.039
 heating if the base is cold 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.529
 should pick up insulation 

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:59.000
 corresponding 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.170
 soft strength to lay across 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.270
 room space 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.329
 heat insulation fixing can 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.829
 produce to any tick material not 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.110
 violating integrity 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.359
 heat insulation structures 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:12.799
 for heating layout 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.969
 cable fasten cut off mounting 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.909
 tapes with a step of 0 5 one meter 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.760
 tape can be made 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.319
 in various ways not providing 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.299
 connection with the base for example using 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.739
 cable and screws with the condition of preservation 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.120

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:31.839
 installation of heating 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:34.049
 sections before installation 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.899
 heating sections need 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:37.789
 figure out the laying step given 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:39.189
 final adjustments 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.720
 heated area 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.280
 it is calculated by the formula valid 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.780

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:58.799
 heating sections secure on 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:02:59.380
 floors 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.490
 from this place start layout 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.619
 sections 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:04.719
 cables should be laid evenly without 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.809
 crossing strictly observe 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:08.899
 constant laying step within 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:11.109
 the entire heated area 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.209
 delayed convergence is not allowed 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.539
 cable turns at a distance of less than 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:17.329
 eight centimeters 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.109
 fix the ends of the five cables bending

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.680
 be about five centimeters across 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.149
 the perimeter of the heated area 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:37.709
 coupling and end sleeves sections 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.609
 must be 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.409
 mounting ends of the heating 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:42.110

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.220
 stacking single core sections complied with those 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.450
 same rules as the two housing but when 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.040
 layout planning follows 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.630
 consider pieces thermostat 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.820
 both mounting ends are connected 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.239
 sections 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.110
 to avoid 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.860
 and mechanical damage 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.270
 heating sections its installation 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.630
 should be carried in shoes with soft

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:08.329
 This sensor mounting method is used. 

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:09.729
 in order to be able to 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.879
 need to replace the sensor is not 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.099

 Minute the mains voltage and 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:35.789
 check performance 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.860
 the system should light up the LED 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.769
 on the front panel of the thermostat and 

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:42.759
 start on the sin section 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.279
 turn off the power again 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.709
 in accordance with the warranty 

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:48.599
 write a scheme with requirements

 in a different quantity 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:12.089
 fill the screed wall thickness 

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:14.839
 for floor heating should be 3 5 

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:15.839
 centimeters 

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:18.389
 if under the warm floor fit and warm

 or sound insulation thicker than five 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:23.259
 centimeters then in this case the thickness of the screed 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:24.899
 must be at least three 

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:27.309

 indicated by mix manufacturer 

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:34.259
 usually for cement sand mortar 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:36.379
 it's 28 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:38.680
 after complete drying 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.270
