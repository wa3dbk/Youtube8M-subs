later is pretty good and easy to use

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.210 
later is pretty good and easy to use
because<00:00:43.210> as<00:00:43.629> you<00:00:43.900> will<00:00:44.140> see<00:00:44.470> we<00:00:44.739> can<00:00:44.979> get<00:00:45.190> very

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
because as you will see we can get very

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.270 
because as you will see we can get very
cool<00:00:45.820> result<00:00:46.239> only<00:00:46.540> you<00:00:46.930> one<00:00:47.170> minute<00:00:47.440> so<00:00:48.100> the

cool result only you one minute so the

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.549 
cool result only you one minute so the
cost<00:00:48.519> is<00:00:48.760> very<00:00:48.850> low<00:00:49.089> the<00:00:49.809> first<00:00:49.960> step<00:00:50.229> is<00:00:50.409> to

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
cost is very low the first step is to

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.560 
cost is very low the first step is to
cut<00:00:50.769> out<00:00:50.799> the<00:00:51.339> length<00:00:51.519> of<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:52.089> bladder
