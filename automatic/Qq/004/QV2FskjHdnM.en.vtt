00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.639
 It was just a normal day until 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.639
 I found out about 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:28.620
 and now what do I need a gift 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.450
 urgent for her father 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.470
 so since we do not have much time 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.540
 you get a paper bag or a pencil 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.960
 Adhesive tape scram book or paper 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.970
 any other paper scissors and a button 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.680
 and the first thing we're going to do is double 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.690
 the top of our bag 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.580
 because no shirt has on the neck 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.470
 that cut in tyc salt so since 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.559
 let's have a super straight line let's go 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.239
 to cut this now if we are going to use 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.489
 our scrapbook paper and we're going to 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.050
 flip to where it has nothing of 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.390
 little pictures and what we are going to do is 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.580
 divide a third of the bag and 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.989
 that's going to be the part where I'm going to go 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.300
 in our tie that is in the part 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.800
 central since we have more or less the 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.660
 space that we are going to use we are going to 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.370
 make the super simple forms of a 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.800
 tie just following these 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.560
 instructions are two diagonal lines 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.420
 then two down and finally a 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.610
 piquito at the end 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.409
 now let's cut our tie 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.299
 super super good and now if we're going to 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.759
 position in the center of our bag 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.070
 leaving three fingers of space towards 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.100
 up and we're going to stick it with any 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.259
 type of glue 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.670
 now let's make some cuts to the 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.460
 sides of where we have our 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.960
 tie and since we have those two 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.150
 cuts from both sides we are going to 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.009
 fold them inward leaving their 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.930
 Top tips stuck to our 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.340
 tie now let's use a little 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.560
 of adhesive tape and we're going to do it 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.060
 churrito later we are going to put pegaditos 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.159
 where is our tie to be able 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.810
 Adhere the necks of our shirt 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.000
 finally with a little bit of glue 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.130
 liquid I'm going to put the button only on the 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.930
 corner of the neck on one side and this 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.149
 way is going to plug a little bit what is 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.280
 the ribbon díaz and ready we have the 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.929
 first part that is the wrap now 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.090
 for our second part of the gift 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.789
 we need a porcelain cup a 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.830
 down of one color and another of another and 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.020
 many letter prints 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.610
 and the first thing we're going to do is with 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.080
 our letter prints put together a 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.450
 the one that you want and that they have to 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.920
 see obviously with your dad after 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.920
 that we have this we are going to start 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.330
 stick them as you want in the cup and 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.310
 have your armed phrase complete in your 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.350
 cup let's start painting them 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.940
 first of all I have to leave you in 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.330
 clear that the markers have to be a 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.980
 force strength to waterproof and I am 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.040
 super super sure you've seen 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.740
 that of the services and the cups and all 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.600
 this technique but what differentiates this 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.760
 is that it is not simply painting it but 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.410
 make a stencil or a mold and then 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.610
 when we remove our letters to see 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.650
 amazing 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.480
 you can combine the color that you 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.110
 prefer was your favorite color 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.450
 father 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.459
 many colors as you prefer 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.470
 or even make much more traces 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.959
 large and leaving us completely in 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.550
 the area of ​​our letters and in the end what 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.620
 only thing that we are going to do is take off with 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.870
 very careful all our 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.530
 stamps I use a cutter to 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.020
 make it much easier 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.459
 if you have any problem with that of 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.990
 some place has run alone 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.110
 you need a little bit of acetone 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.690
 cotonete and you can perfect it 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.520
 completely to finalize finally 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.640
 with our process we are going to put 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.890
 our cup for 35 minutes at 175 degrees 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.300
 to our furnace we wait for it to 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.970
 cool a little bit so that we do not 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.970
 burn when we grab him and now if 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.510
 we're already going with the last part and 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.200
 we are going to need a sheet of cardboard 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:47.590
 paintings of many colors a dish a 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.870
 little dishwashing detergent and 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.250
 water and what we are going to do is put a 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.890
 little bit of the painting that we 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.390
 choose on our plate after 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.850
 we will place more or less the same 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.000
 amount of soap to wash dishes and 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.040
 finally a good water we are going to 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.130
 stir all this until it's done 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.930
 basically as a soapy solution and 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.390
 then we will start doing 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.340
 bubbles first stirring and then 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.810
 blowing with our straw 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.880
 now let's put our sheet of 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.000
 cardboard on the container and they are going to 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.609
 burst solitates 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.049
 if for some reason they did not burst 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.820
 all to your sheet was not too much 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.250
 stained what we're going to do is take 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.430
 our cloak and blowing directly on 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.310
 the time I decided to put a base because 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.080
 if I was not going to mess all my bottom but 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.480
 basically this is what we are going to do 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.340
 with all the paint colors the 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.200
 same mix but with different zones 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.840
 finally let's write a little message 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.280
 nice on our card and it's done and 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.960
 now yes since we have all our 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.180
 gifts we will start packing them 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.580
 I decided to put the card in the cup and 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.070
 then add some chocolates this 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.660
 I'm going to put in our bag and ready 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.440
 there is our gift for the day of the 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.030
 father 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.310
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.360

 they think it's me, it can be useful 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.440
 someone can share it in 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.150
 any of your social networks and 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.740
 surely surely this video if you 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.290
 can help a lot of people because I 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.240
 I know it's a difficult mega to find a 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.530
 gift for dad then share it 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.030
 in all your social networks 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.670
 also remember that it helps me a lot 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.560
 very much giving little fingers up to this 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.910
 video if you like all or most of 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.220
 videos of that channel I recommend that you 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.990
 subscribe here below there is a red button 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.540
 that and subscribe and if you can not find it 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.920
 I leave here a nicer button 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.570
 where you can also explain already 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.910
 starting from which you bite is there you go to 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.620
 be subscribed this channel and 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.240
 practically I will warn you god a 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.040
 video so it's going to be very difficult to 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.380
 you miss I hope you liked a 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.200
 heap a lot lots of video and 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.940
 I remember that obviously is not the most 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.620
 important in the world that is a gift 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.390
 but you want a lot had peace and 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.830
 much like your grandfather and now if you 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.930
 you can give the gift, it's fine 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.260
 because neither is father that the 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.690
 grandparents are left without a gift 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.810
 the important thing is that you tell your dad 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:05.120
 when you want it on this day and now yes 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.120

 then find challenges such as the 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.200
 because I do not understand my partner among others 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.380
 things so do not miss it and I have 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.510

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.310
