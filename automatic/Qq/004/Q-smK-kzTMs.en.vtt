of<00:01:57.630> like<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.960> barrier<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.680> get<00:01:58.860> from

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
of like the barrier that you get from

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.069 
of like the barrier that you get from
Vaseline<00:01:59.610> but<00:01:59.640> it's<00:02:00.000> not<00:02:00.149> greasy<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.780> that

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
Vaseline but it's not greasy like that

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.160 
Vaseline but it's not greasy like that
and<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.920> kind<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.369> creates<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.750> barrier

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
and so it kind of creates that barrier

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.870 
and so it kind of creates that barrier
and<00:02:04.439> sort<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.680> moisturizes<00:02:05.430> underneath

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
and sort of moisturizes underneath

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.419 
and sort of moisturizes underneath
that's<00:02:06.600> why<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:07.020> great<00:02:07.290> also<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.069> use<00:02:08.099> it

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
that's why it's great also if you use it

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.430 
that's why it's great also if you use it
