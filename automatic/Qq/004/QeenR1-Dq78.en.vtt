00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.610
 greetings invoker is my name is sky 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.850
 show and today I welcome you to a 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.740
 guide about the twisted forest mode 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.870
 of the game of the twisted forest tends 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.790
 to play with a goal of 2 lanes and a 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.920
 jungle although we can also see 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.769
 players who prefer a double lane 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.689
 and a single lane the map is much more 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:23.599
 small that the crack and can be forced 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.849
 objectives very easily unlike 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.009
 the crack the early game is too 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.699
 important and you can almost define a 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:34.070
 departure in 10 or 15 minutes the forest 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.140
 twisted is completely symmetrical what 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.750
 which means that we do not have a goal 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.910
 important near the bottom rail that 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.580
 we have to take care with two people 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.010
 participating in that lower lane to 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.130
 lack of a dragon a red improvement a 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.710
 better blue we have altars these altars 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.780
 are very important goals is very 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.300
 common that team battles happen 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.489
 fighting for them each altar grants 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.610
 three extra gold each time you kill 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.739
 to a subject and also gives you 10% 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.749
 of the year of attack and power of ability 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.159
 every time an altar is captured 

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:09.439
 can be captured again 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.390
 90 seconds so think well on 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:15.020
 take that risk and do not let the 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.659
 enemy team invades them 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.819
 [Music] 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.700
 in the middle of the map there is a relic 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:25.380
 that by taking it will restore manna and life and 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.380
 it reappears every 90 seconds 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.520
 in the absence of a male we have a spider 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.830
 giant that was called soul is a 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.890
 rather precious goal that tends 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.810
 to kill in the middle or late game if 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.350
 is eliminated will award everyone in the 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.290
 190 gold team 30% speed of 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.170
 attack 20% cooling reduction 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.660
 and increased life regeneration and more 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.850
 now they know the basics about the 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.250
 Twisted Treeline is not nothing but 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.560
 go and try it for yourselves as 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.729
 I always search and see each other in the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.729
 fields of justice
