00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.050
 serious nature jewelry to have a 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.040
 plant like this at home is difficult 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.670
 no, it's not difficult cultivation is a 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.280
 even quite simple cultivation is the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.110
 person needs to like plant né 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.930
 need to especially like 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.800
 orchid and know a little about it 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.780
 her and to know how to cultivate what is the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.520
 What do we have to do all day? 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.780
 to have a beautiful plant like that that 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.260
 fertilization with regular frequency and 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.950
 rules the proper brightness a good 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.590
 and has orchids that you can 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.820
 cultivate and hit the orchid spot 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.820
 inside the house right? 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.080
 we do we need to leave it here 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.850
 People are watching, have a little sun. 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.430
 or we already have to leave a little 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.590
 further away the phalaenopsis in 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.560
 so it can not be placed 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.080
 in the direct sun she quite likes 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.680
 quality in a very clear environment 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.409
 but without catching the direct sun because these 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.409
 leaves resent too much ne 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.649
 and it's also the flowers they can burn 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.200
 the flower petals I think they are even 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.509
 the more resistant the sheet is 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:58.600
 because the damaged sheet does not 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:02:00.190
 can make photos science shows to 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.130
 people here we are seeing a little 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.560
 music here when you are decorating 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.780
 watering the plant I look at where the 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.850
 leafy sauce 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.239
 especially with our winter is a 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:17.530
 very strict winter, she does not tolerate 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:20.950
 that within the fresh soft water is vita 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.560
 in fact it's right in the middle is the plant 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.160
 here, then try to wet yourself more 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.480
 around and always the roots deny 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.670
 You're welcome. 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.280
 sometimes it gets its roots but here 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.890
 roots are the roots the roots of them 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.370
 are well aerial is a typical plant 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.040
 Then you have to watering the 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.810
 roots have a small plate underneath leave 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.769
 water on the plate does not 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.170
 The water is in silverware never, then. 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.079
 can get wet from soaking because 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:57.370
 there is a myth that one can not 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:59.709
 put is water in orchid and this is not 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.340
 truth can get wet 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.660
 but never let up is the accumulated water 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.480
 so we always take a look 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.670
 there on that substrate where it is 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.780
 to understand that you need water 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.130
 or not exactly 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.040
 do not forget that the orchids 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.250
 also need fertilizers are two 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.560
 organic and organic chemical normally 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.530
 should be given every two months and the 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.889
 chemist once a week another tip is 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.490
 wet with rain or filtered water 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:31.630
 Forget the tap water she has. 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.630
 too much aluminum and chlorine 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.890
 we came to know the greenhouse of his 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.209
 orchid to get an idea and look 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.640
 only those orchids that are here 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:47.480
 little ones they'll take about 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.430
 six years to get bigger and give 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.599
 flowers like those plants that people 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.610
 saw there in there 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:56.269
 celia tells us a curiosity 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.640
 we said it is a jewel of nature 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.860
 so it's worth a lot of people 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.099
 knows you have the commercial values 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.950
 how much does an orchid plant cost in 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:09.280
 in general the average price average price 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.829
 varies around 50 reais 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.470

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.070
 orchid pay fortunes sometimes have to 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.130
 Be careful you have to be passing. 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:37.160
 insecticide using this products 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:40.880
 appropriate to deal with this 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.169
 plant is always the observation of the 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.870
 plant to see what it is 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.870
 requiring adequate fertilization 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.919
