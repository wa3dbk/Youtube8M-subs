I've<00:00:07.740> cut<00:00:08.730> out<00:00:08.940> my<00:00:09.240> petals<00:00:09.660> using<00:00:10.280> my<00:00:11.280> cricut

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
I've cut out my petals using my cricut

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.249 
I've cut out my petals using my cricut
and<00:00:11.790> shortcuts<00:00:12.179> allah<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.660> these<00:00:12.990> are<00:00:13.170> the

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
and shortcuts allah and these are the

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.039 
and shortcuts allah and these are the
shapes<00:00:14.089> so<00:00:15.089> i'm<00:00:15.179> just<00:00:15.269> going<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.599> start<00:00:15.900> with

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
shapes so i'm just going to start with

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.240 
shapes so i'm just going to start with
the<00:00:16.109> center<00:00:16.830> petals<00:00:18.140> I'm<00:00:19.140> taking<00:00:19.590> glue<00:00:19.949> dots

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
the center petals I'm taking glue dots

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.769 
the center petals I'm taking glue dots
at<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.910> suggestion<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.830> reader<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:24.150> one<00:00:24.750> of

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
at the suggestion of a reader in one of

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.710 
at the suggestion of a reader in one of
their<00:00:25.019> comments<00:00:25.590> instead<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.130> using<00:00:26.310> glue<00:00:26.820> so

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
their comments instead of using glue so

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.599 
their comments instead of using glue so
i<00:00:27.779> put<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> glue<00:00:28.260> jaw<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.680> one<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.220> petals

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
i put a glue jaw on one of the petals

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.440 
i put a glue jaw on one of the petals
and<00:00:30.029> then<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.260> start<00:00:31.470> folding<00:00:31.800> up<00:00:32.189> each<00:00:32.910> of

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
and then I just start folding up each of

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.530 
and then I just start folding up each of
the<00:00:33.600> other<00:00:33.780> petals<00:00:34.790> I'm<00:00:35.790> forming<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.510> shape

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
the other petals I'm forming the shape

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:48.010 
the other petals I'm forming the shape
of<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.050> globe<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.629> keep<00:00:45.930> attaching<00:00:46.320> these

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
of a globe so keep attaching these

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.939 
of a globe so keep attaching these
attach<00:00:49.020> them<00:00:49.289> until<00:00:49.770> they're<00:00:50.570> in<00:00:51.590> a<00:00:52.590> full

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
attach them until they're in a full

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.150 
attach them until they're in a full
circle<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:56.629> I<00:00:57.629> actually<00:00:57.780> had<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.170> use<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.829> glue

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
circle and I actually had to use to glue

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.650 
circle and I actually had to use to glue
dots<00:01:01.219> to<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.370> enough<00:01:02.609> space<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.210> all<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
dots to have enough space for all of the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.719 
dots to have enough space for all of the
tips<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.170> these<00:01:04.500> petals<00:01:07.100> so<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.220> forms<00:01:08.610> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
tips of these petals so it just forms a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:17.090 
tips of these petals so it just forms a
little<00:01:08.939> globe<00:01:14.060> oops<00:01:15.680> now<00:01:16.680> I'm<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.979> take

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
little globe oops now I'm going to take

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.980 
little globe oops now I'm going to take
a<00:01:17.159> dot<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.460> glue<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.270> son<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.810> globe

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
a dot of glue to the son of the globe

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.260 
a dot of glue to the son of the globe
and<00:01:19.140> put<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> red<00:01:19.890> rhinestone<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.939> that's

and put on a red rhinestone and that's

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.520 
and put on a red rhinestone and that's
the<00:01:21.450> center<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.560> flower<00:01:23.840> now<00:01:24.840> for<00:01:25.350> the

middle<00:01:25.920> pedal<00:01:26.159> layers<00:01:26.580> I'm<00:01:27.240> going<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.049> dust

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
middle pedal layers I'm going to dust

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.390 
middle pedal layers I'm going to dust
them<00:01:28.500> with<00:01:28.560> yellow<00:01:29.369> ink<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:30.740> put<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> picture<00:01:32.159> of

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.460 
them with yellow ink I put a picture of
a<00:01:32.520> chrysanthemum<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.570> my<00:01:33.780> blog<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
a chrysanthemum on my blog and the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.819 
a chrysanthemum on my blog and the
flower<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.280> yellow<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.180> cream<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.869> red<00:01:37.049> so

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
flower is yellow and cream and red so

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.730 
flower is yellow and cream and red so
I'm<00:01:37.950> trying<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.369> emulate<00:01:38.640> those<00:01:38.970> same<00:01:39.270> colors

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
I'm trying to emulate those same colors

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.670 
I'm trying to emulate those same colors
so<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.770> smear<00:01:41.520> yellow<00:01:41.820> ink<00:01:42.030> across<00:01:42.479> almost<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680

so I smear yellow ink across almost the
whole<00:01:43.890> petal<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:45.950> both<00:01:46.950> petal<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:49.430> then<00:01:50.430> just

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
whole petal of both petal and then just

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.800 
whole petal of both petal and then just
the<00:01:50.909> tips<00:01:51.210> with<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> bit<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:51.990> red<00:01:52.649> ink<00:01:53.720> so<00:01:54.720> you

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
the tips with a bit of red ink so you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.060

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
okay now for the bottom of the petal is

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.660 
okay now for the bottom of the petal is
a<00:02:19.540> slightly<00:02:19.960> larger<00:02:20.260> shape<00:02:20.710> and<00:02:21.220> i'm<00:02:21.460> just

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670

I'm<00:02:32.140> going<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.560> curl<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.220> petals<00:02:33.750> downwards

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
I'm going to curl the petals downwards

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.790 
way that you crawl ribbon for gifts but
you<00:02:42.220> can<00:02:42.370> also<00:02:42.520> use<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:42.820> bone<00:02:43.120> folder<00:02:43.150> if<00:02:44.050> you

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
you can also use a bone folder if you

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.070 
you can also use a bone folder if you
want<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.100> be<00:02:45.190> more<00:02:45.370> careful<00:02:45.670> or<00:02:46.270> if<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:46.870> have<00:02:47.020> a

child who's doing this project and now
i'm<00:02:50.620> taking<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:51.550> two<00:02:51.790> middle<00:02:52.510> petals<00:02:53.110> and

over<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:57.010> petal<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.850> ink<00:02:58.060> is<00:02:58.300> down

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
over the petal so that the ink is down

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.470 
over the petal so that the ink is down
weird<00:02:59.800> facing<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.670> curled<00:03:01.420> those<00:03:03.420> putting<00:03:04.420> a
