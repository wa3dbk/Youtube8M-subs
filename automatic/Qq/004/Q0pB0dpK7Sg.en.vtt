00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.240
 hey how are you guys this tactic on 2 bosses 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.240
 butcher's high hammer 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.839
 I want to immediately say that the mechanics 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.949
 this boss is not difficult for those who believed 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:24.240
 in times of lich king 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:27.480
 she can remind you of the way to the lion 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.750
 a share of all damage will receive tanks with 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.170
 we will start the butcher 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.350
 Keep 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.350
 center pad bosses and passive 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.079
 ability heavy hand its essence 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.280
 is that the butcher is dealing damage 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.340
 current tank 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.090
 does the same damage to the target 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.120
 which is 5 meters away from it if 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.449
 no such purpose the boss will inflict exactly 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.520
 the same blow to the first tank, that is, it 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.410
 will take place 100 percent damage 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.530
 200 percent of this can not be allowed and 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.350
 the poet 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.930
 two tanks will have to stand very close 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.790
 each other in almost the same model 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.200
 to share damage another ability 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.119
 called butcher's knife will 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.229
 impose on the tank and its spectrum 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.159
 currents inflicting intermittent damage 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:25.229
 the effect stacks but it can be avoided 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.619
 also the boss will use young for 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.159
 meat is a physical attack which 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.299
 deals great damage and hangs up a debuff 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.909
 increasing damage from the following 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.159
 meat hammer applications by 50 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.040
 percent of this attack 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.549
 impossible to dodge as well as 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.430
 parry it as soon as the battle begins and 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.890
 the first tank will get 2 stacks debuff from 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.100
 hammer for meat the second tank should 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.310
 pick up the boss on yourself and as soon as u 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.070
 first he drops stacks again but 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.100
 Luntik boss will continue until 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.390
 the end of the fight is worth noting that far 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.420
 run away from the butcher 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.869
 tank fail you can ask 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.470
 why all because of the ability butcher 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.080
 beak which attracts CURRENT 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.840
 the goal is probably all you need to know 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.930
 tank, it's time to talk about 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.620
 the boss's key ability she wears 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.860
 title 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.650
 butcher chooses a dissecting blow 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.590
 the largest group of players in the world zone and 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.500
 hits them causing physical damage which 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.380
 divided between these goals are those players 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.260
 who came under this blow will get 1 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.300
 stack debuffed bleeding wounds which 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.390
 also deals physical damage 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.210
 for fifteen seconds is important to know 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.080
 that by typing 5 stacks of such a debuff you 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.490
 instantly die no spells 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.790
 including the woman from the paladin 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.390
 and other protective abilities you do not 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.270
 will save 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.150
 so mile zone should competently 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.910
 positioned namely split 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.560
 into two groups that will stand by 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.260
 different sides of the butcher 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.610
 where the best orientation on the floor can be 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.530
 put marks on the left and right leg 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.650
 accordingly but that 's not all 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.459
 as I said, the blow will be delivered 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.310
 by group 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.770
 which is listed the greatest ie 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.080
 first fight in one of the mile computers 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.410
 there must be some speech dealer 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.740
 as soon as this group gets 400k 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.260
 This rdd should quickly run back to 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.080
 side a to the opposite group 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.080
 milishnikov must run another range 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.680
 damager to cleave punches now 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.489
 amazed this group and such alternating 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.850
 dashes 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.040
 last until the end of the battle range dd and 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:56.270
 healers must stand behind 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:00.530
 in one place about 25 30 meters from 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:04.160
 mile zone will be another ability and 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.459
 I will tell you how you can 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.959
 see the butcher under the health scale 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:12.620
 there is an energy indicator 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.720
 which he experiences during the battle as soon as 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.900
 this indicator will fill one hundred 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.359
 percent the boss will kick back all the players on 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.120
 15 meters 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:26.020
 and will take a reception called 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.180
 chilling blow after tilting he 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.360
 rush to the biggest cluster 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.659
 players and deal them a dissecting blow 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.030
 about which I spoke a little earlier that is 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:40.090
 all you need to do after dropping 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.060
 it's scatter about meek and two 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.770
 rdd which in turn received stacks in 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.750
 mile zone 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.539
 the rest red dd and he wears should 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.529
 stay in the same position they 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:56.050
 started the fight that is at one point 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:58.900
 This is done in order to dissect 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.659
 the blow flew into this very far one 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.090
 and as soon as the butcher strike this blow 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:07.120
 long-range melee group right away 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.520
 return to their original positions and all 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.550
 the above stack manipulations 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:16.270
 will repeat until wax 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.729
 will not be killed worth mentioning also that 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.360
 Normal mode, the number of stacks at 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.159
 which player dies equals 6 a in 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.430
 heroic 5 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.659
 as soon as the butcherâ€™s health drops to 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.960
 30 percent 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:34.289
 he will go berserk and inflict 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.080
 ten percent more damage and 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:41.110
 his attack speed will increase by 30 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.099
 percent is the right time for 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.080
 use of blood lust or heroism 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:48.729
 the killer needs to mentally prepare yourself 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.460
 since the whole fight 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:56.500
 they will have to intensively treat people with 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:58.089
 tagged especially tanks and I wish you 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.560
 good luck with the scraper 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:01.560
 that is, with the butcher
