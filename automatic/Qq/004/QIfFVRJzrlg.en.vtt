your blade you can use the rounded area

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.530 
your blade you can use the rounded area
or<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:46.580> could<00:01:46.700> use<00:01:46.820> a<00:01:46.850> flat<00:01:47.240> surface

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540

whichever one you prefer I prefer the
rounded<00:01:49.760> area<00:01:49.910> so<00:01:50.660> I<00:01:50.690> don't<00:01:50.810> have<00:01:50.900> to<00:01:50.960> be

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
rounded area so I don't have to be

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.400 
rounded area so I don't have to be
perfectly<00:01:51.940> angled<00:01:52.940> with<00:01:53.480> the<00:01:53.540> flat<00:01:53.810> surface

perfectly angled with the flat surface

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:01.690 
perfectly angled with the flat surface
so<00:01:55.010> you<00:01:56.980> set<00:01:57.980> the<00:01:59.140> rods<00:02:00.140> in<00:02:00.410> and<00:02:00.620> to<00:02:01.430> give<00:02:01.580> it

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
so you set the rods in and to give it

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.720 
so you set the rods in and to give it
the<00:02:02.630> final<00:02:02.960> edge<00:02:03.110> on<00:02:03.590> your<00:02:03.830> knife<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.520> hold

the final edge on your knife you hold

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
the final edge on your knife you hold
the<00:02:04.790> knife<00:02:04.910> parallel

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
the knife parallel

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.520 
the knife parallel
I<00:02:05.780> mean<00:02:06.320> vertical<00:02:07.119> to<00:02:08.119> their<00:02:08.899> ground<00:02:09.110> 90

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
I mean vertical to their ground 90

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.210 
I mean vertical to their ground 90
degrees<00:02:09.890> keep<00:02:10.610> it<00:02:10.759> steady<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:12.650> surface<00:02:13.040> leave

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
degrees keep it steady to surface leave

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.630 
degrees keep it steady to surface leave
your<00:02:13.340> table<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:13.879> he<00:02:14.269> just<00:02:14.510> start<00:02:14.810> from<00:02:15.680> the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
your table and he just start from the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.040 
your table and he just start from the
back<00:02:16.849> edge<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.269> blade<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.629> you<00:02:17.720> work<00:02:17.900> the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
back edge of the blade and you work the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.550 
back edge of the blade and you work the
Waco's<00:02:18.379> of<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.530> front<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.069> down

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
Waco's of the front and it down

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.460 
Waco's of the front and it down
and<00:02:19.980> yet<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:21.209> have<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.540> be<00:02:21.840> consistent<00:02:22.350> on<00:02:22.380> a

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
and yet you have to be consistent on a

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.210 
and yet you have to be consistent on a
number<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:24.170> swipes<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.380> do<00:02:25.530> each<00:02:25.680> side<00:02:25.920> so

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
number of swipes you do each side so

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:40.460 
number of swipes you do each side so
here<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.490> go<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:28.550> one<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:32.550> other<00:02:32.700> side<00:02:34.640> too<00:02:39.470> I

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
here you go is one the other side too I

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.620 
here you go is one the other side too I
think<00:02:41.130> three<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.340> enough<00:02:41.580> for<00:02:41.730> this<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:42.450> set

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
think three is enough for this to set
