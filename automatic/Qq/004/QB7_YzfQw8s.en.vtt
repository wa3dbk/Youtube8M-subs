00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.800 
that yet well seems you guys have this
same<00:03:22.709> book<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.340> my<00:03:23.840> adopted<00:03:24.840> mother<00:03:24.989> had<00:03:25.349> so

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
same book that my adopted mother had so

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.500 
same book that my adopted mother had so
yeah<00:03:27.810> it's<00:03:27.989> got<00:03:28.169> everything<00:03:28.440> in<00:03:28.680> here<00:03:29.959> okay<00:03:32.510> so

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
yeah it's got everything in here okay so

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.330 
yeah it's got everything in here okay so
pretty<00:03:33.989> much<00:03:34.109> if<00:03:34.349> we<00:03:34.410> turn<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.370> lights<00:03:35.400> off

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.030 

he<00:03:39.330> easily<00:03:39.690> turn<00:03:39.989> them<00:03:40.140> back<00:03:40.319> on<00:03:40.349> by<00:03:41.010> just

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
he easily turn them back on by just

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.470 
he easily turn them back on by just
adding<00:03:42.000> energy<00:03:42.569> to<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.349> room<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:44.209> pretty<00:03:45.209> much

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
adding energy to the room so pretty much

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:56.210 
adding energy to the room so pretty much
like<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:51.290> how<00:03:52.290> cool<00:03:53.390> you<00:03:54.390> guys<00:03:54.599> try<00:03:55.129> there<00:03:56.129> we

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
like this how cool you guys try there we

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.539 
like this how cool you guys try there we
go

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
go

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:05.290 
go
so<00:03:57.450> turn<00:03:57.930> them<00:03:58.019> off

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.390 

and<00:04:05.750> then<00:04:05.960> turn<00:04:06.320> them<00:04:06.410> back<00:04:06.560> on<00:04:06.740> by<00:04:07.070> just

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
and then turn them back on by just

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:15.070 
and then turn them back on by just
simply<00:04:08.150> adding

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:24.830 

try<00:04:16.080> again<00:04:16.350> okay<00:04:17.190> here<00:04:17.400> we<00:04:17.430> go

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.409 

and<00:04:26.970> there<00:04:27.970> we<00:04:28.090> go<00:04:28.240> I<00:04:28.479> did<00:04:28.870> it<00:04:29.050> let<00:04:29.800> me<00:04:29.830> try

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
and there we go I did it let me try

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.879 
and there we go I did it let me try
so<00:04:31.419> then<00:04:31.569> turn<00:04:32.199> them<00:04:32.379> off<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:34.409> then<00:04:35.409> turn<00:04:35.860> back

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
so then turn them off and then turn back

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:44.629 
so then turn them off and then turn back
on<00:04:36.190> by<00:04:36.370> adding<00:04:37.860> energy<00:04:42.539> let's<00:04:43.539> seize<00:04:43.659> nothing

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
on by adding energy let's seize nothing

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:59.070 
on by adding energy let's seize nothing
here<00:04:45.639> we<00:04:45.699> go<00:04:45.849> trying<00:04:46.419> again<00:04:57.630> why<00:04:58.630> isn't<00:04:59.020> it

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
here we go trying again why isn't it

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:12.390 
here we go trying again why isn't it
working<00:05:00.000> try<00:05:01.000> one<00:05:01.180> more<00:05:01.330> time

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.350 

there<00:05:13.240> see<00:05:13.630> you<00:05:13.870> did<00:05:14.080> it<00:05:14.460> okay<00:05:15.460> now<00:05:16.000> according

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
there see you did it okay now according

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.360 
there see you did it okay now according
to<00:05:16.540> that<00:05:16.720> book<00:05:17.580> apparently<00:05:18.580> it's<00:05:18.990> possible<00:05:20.370> to

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
to that book apparently it's possible to

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.360 
to that book apparently it's possible to
make<00:05:22.350> lightning<00:05:23.350> with<00:05:24.009> a<00:05:24.509> lot<00:05:25.509> of<00:05:25.660> energy<00:05:26.370> but

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
make lightning with a lot of energy but

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.710 
make lightning with a lot of energy but
none<00:05:28.240> of<00:05:28.330> us<00:05:28.419> have<00:05:28.660> the<00:05:28.690> power<00:05:29.020> to<00:05:29.259> do<00:05:29.440> that

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
none of us have the power to do that

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.390 
none of us have the power to do that
well<00:05:31.720> I<00:05:31.750> noticed<00:05:32.199> that<00:05:32.410> you<00:05:32.590> seem<00:05:32.620> to<00:05:33.039> get<00:05:33.160> that

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
well I noticed that you seem to get that

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.070 
well I noticed that you seem to get that
energy<00:05:34.060> thing<00:05:34.840> down<00:05:35.199> quite<00:05:35.800> quickly<00:05:37.080> think

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
energy thing down quite quickly think

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.570 
energy thing down quite quickly think
you<00:05:38.259> might<00:05:38.470> be<00:05:38.500> just<00:05:38.800> a<00:05:39.009> little<00:05:39.220> bit<00:05:39.400> more

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
you might be just a little bit more

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.439 
you might be just a little bit more
powerful<00:05:40.000> than<00:05:40.300> us<00:05:40.930> -<00:05:41.310> you<00:05:42.310> think<00:05:42.610> I<00:05:42.759> can<00:05:43.270> make

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
powerful than us - you think I can make

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.760 
powerful than us - you think I can make
a<00:05:43.479> lightning<00:05:44.050> happen<00:05:44.530> I<00:05:45.449> mean<00:05:46.449> you<00:05:47.050> can<00:05:47.440> try

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
a lightning happen I mean you can try

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.590 
a lightning happen I mean you can try
and<00:05:49.020> for<00:05:50.020> my<00:05:50.199> next<00:05:50.500> trick<00:05:51.100> I<00:05:51.400> will<00:05:52.060> make

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
and for my next trick I will make

00:05:52.600 --> 00:06:13.160 
and for my next trick I will make
lightning<00:05:53.440> happen<00:05:54.340> in<00:05:54.820> this<00:05:55.210> very<00:05:55.630> room

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:19.780 

nothing<00:06:14.170> seems<00:06:14.470> to<00:06:14.590> be<00:06:14.740> happening<00:06:16.320> yeah

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:30.430 

just<00:06:20.720> give<00:06:20.960> it<00:06:20.990> a<00:06:21.110> few<00:06:21.140> more<00:06:21.530> seconds<00:06:22.130> oh<00:06:29.440> my

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
just give it a few more seconds oh my

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:39.830 
just give it a few more seconds oh my
gosh<00:06:30.740> you<00:06:31.100> did

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.900 

you
