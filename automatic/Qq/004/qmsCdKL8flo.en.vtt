 Hello Russia, with you TMR. 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.420
 May I ask you for help? 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.460
 I wrote this song for you, 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.420
 So that you have fun. 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:34.460
 For your smiles, I am ready to give everything that I have. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.360
 And if you like what you see, support me! 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.520
 I will be glad to any amount 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.520
 After all, playing video games is hard work. 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.540
 Eating spicy lime tacos 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.840
 I'll make my way to the Prime final! 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:17.980
 And I want to win! 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.880
 Hi guys! I am The Mexican Runner, 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.540
 And yes, I'm from Mexico. 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.800
 And if you don't believe me, look at this guy. 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.620
 Mexico, Mexico, I carry your image in my heart! 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.580
 And so, the time has come which you have been waiting for 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.440
 Now I will show you what I will do in Prime Time! 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.860
 My show will be called “The Mexican Runner Show”, 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.680
 And it should turn out really great. 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.120
 I haven't done anything like this before 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.700
 The show was created specifically for Prime Time, 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.620
 I hope it will be a great success. 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.740
 and if you do not like it, then I will be very, very upset 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.880
 But I can say that I will do my best to interest you. 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.220
 And to maintain communication between us. 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.440
 We will have votes, contests, 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.920

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.260
 But I will try to hold a live concert for you. 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.980
 It should be amazing! 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.120
