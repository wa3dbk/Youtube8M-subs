00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
suffered from physical abuse that I had

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.530 
suffered from physical abuse that I had
suffered<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.600> came<00:01:33.840> out<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.710> way<00:01:34.890> that

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
suffered and it came out in a way that

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.410 
suffered and it came out in a way that
was<00:01:36.740> wanting<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.920> escape<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.640> gender<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> was

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
was wanting to escape the gender I was

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.899 
was wanting to escape the gender I was
in<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:39.960> eventually<00:01:40.470> had<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.490> gender

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
in so I eventually had the gender

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.859 
in so I eventually had the gender
surgery<00:01:42.360> at<00:01:42.570> at<00:01:42.780> age<00:01:43.079> 42<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.509> lived<00:01:45.509> as<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
gender surgery first off not one person

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.060 
gender surgery first off not one person

has ever actually changed their gender
as<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> result<00:01:59.820> of<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.149> surgery<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.649> to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
as a result of the surgery you have to

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.630 
as a result of the surgery you have to
be<00:02:02.689> sort<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.780> cooperating<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.100> madness

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
be sort of cooperating with the madness

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.960 
be sort of cooperating with the madness
to<00:02:06.509> assume<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.380> different<00:02:07.920> gender<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.520> surgery

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
to assume a different gender the surgery

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.210 
to assume a different gender the surgery
does<00:02:09.239> not<00:02:09.450> change<00:02:09.840> your<00:02:10.080> gender<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.129> I

think that's important

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.880 
think that's important
understand<00:02:13.819> it's<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.390> cosmetic<00:02:14.959> procedure<00:02:15.590> it

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
understand it's a cosmetic procedure it

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.960 
understand it's a cosmetic procedure it
does<00:02:16.100> not<00:02:16.340> change<00:02:16.700> your<00:02:16.970> gender<00:02:17.240> at<00:02:17.510> all<00:02:17.950> now

total madness and I think what's

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.400 
total madness and I think what's
happened<00:03:10.580> is<00:03:10.790> that<00:03:10.930> political<00:03:11.930> correctness

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
happened is that political correctness

happened is that political correctness
is<00:03:12.769> now<00:03:12.950> cooperating<00:03:13.310> with<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.269> madness<00:03:14.540> and

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
is now cooperating with the madness and

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.250 
is now cooperating with the madness and
