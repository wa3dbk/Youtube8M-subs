00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.689
 helios and ghost in jeans in the company of 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.130
 meylan it's everybody we get 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.439
 found for the fourth small storm 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.970
 on srpp know factions and you do not 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.310
 do not see but I assure you that but 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.599
 lens is in front of me and yes it's normal 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.210
 because I am an African 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.400
 and all that without cheat such as our 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.840
 sweet and so on and we'll show you 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.460
 can be tasted in a few moments 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.330
 but first we will prove to you that 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.040
 melenchon is well in the money and hama then 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.230
 to do this I spent a dee spencer 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.780
 here with nine different themes 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.809
 so the actors will be exempted from 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.040
 random way and they wanted 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.570
 scatter in this room there and there is 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.030
 absolutely no one this cabal their 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.129
 Suck the common test game to prove 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.940
 that he is absolutely nobody there is 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:05.129
 no access to the hours exemptions so 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.520
 but slow in theory has no way of 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.070
 to know which items will be scattered 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.299
 but he can anyway because that 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.369
 being frequently princes lens 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.280
 yes you broke the blocks in front 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.930
 I'm trying right now this is ok the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.960
 first and m it's a tree shoot 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.620
 so a crazy tree and yes it's a 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.260
 crazy tree 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.840
 so here we say here is luck 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.940
 to be a name to start over several 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.680
 time to prove that we do not have 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.250
 resumed the video until it 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:42.040
 it's nothing that ping is second and that 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:45.020
 it is a log succeeds a log 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.430
 the impressive had one last time 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.130
 still to go lay and 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:57.940
 voeckler gloucester dust and I bring 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:00.380
 kopin's at yellowstone from her girlfriends 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.200
 awesome good there you ask 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.490
 surely but what is this magic 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.860
 the top is not allowed of stars 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.250
 oh no, we assure you it's his 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.570
 title 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.410
 besides, I'll show you everything from 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.959
 Following so there is a small cave a 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.880
 base of operations here and there will tell you 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.890
 but no boat but what is 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.020
 pass and coots wade mind card 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.530
 what is water alain chest 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.570
 we never saw that good so the 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.150
 principle will close the arts we at 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.690
 case where clement arrives he draws 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.880
 the poor good aunt I broke his boat 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.170
 he is no longer in the heart soul so the 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.799
 principle is to put oneself in a 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.730
 vehicle 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.500
 so we have man map or boat or if you 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.640
 have custom plugin on your server 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.160
 it can be anything as long as 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.630
 it's a vehicle and from that you 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.310
 can do an internship at fo thin 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.950
 task pownce the warp 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.900
 it's equivalent and at the moment of 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.060
 to make this order there you do not 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.130
 will not know tp at spawn at your fo 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.980
 movistar has as usual but you 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.319
 will be on you even though you 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.200
 will still be in the mind map after 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.550
 the game but you can you 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.319
 transport freely in both 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.700
 dogs that you have previously loaded 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.550
 from vollmann map 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.730
 interesting thing if you move your 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.290
 hand a map they themselves because you 're going 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.269
 not loaded new chang with you 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.580
 in any case not in this big news the most 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.590
 late in the series we will present 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.180
 bugs much more well impressive 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.940
 that allow you to btp 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.319
 an app is good for that it will take you 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.239
 subscribe attention see no more 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.190
 wait I think you're waiting for the 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.230
 magic I will do it before your eyes 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.180
 amazed and hop 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.640
 oh oh oh 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.359
 with this inventory movement here is 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.670
 here 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.319
 little problem with mackerel so the 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.810
 mingling that I still see myself tomorrow a 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.200
 just map yes that's it or again 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.150
 mike hart but i'm not yet 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.409
 look up to his 6 and block they do not 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.920
 will not have to because actually they are not 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:03.739
 not broken 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.540
 it's just a visual bug so here I 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.790
 I am African I do not take absolutely 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.980
 no damage so if I fell that good 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:17.509
 gfail I would not even have to take the 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:20.389
 damage so I can under fear no I do not 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:22.520
 can not a golden pearl and we will go to 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.580
 the limit of blogs for you to see 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.930
 everything that has been loaded in advance 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.210
 so little explanation 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.650
 so you can do it with fo but 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.080
 that it's late to all who order there 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.669
 but be careful you do not have to 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.099
 be loading the Czechs 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.389
 of your traits from the spawn woods that's 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:39.590
 to say that if you're right next to 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.650
 your from your base 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.699
 you have installed your iphone ben 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.280
 when you go do it you have to 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.720
 will be directly from tp and the soul fuck 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.039
 will not work so if you're at 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.270
 your base makes loose points if you 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.010
 are in front of the spawn made very strong 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.880
 fight star notice to get by so 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.880
 here we see the limit 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.730
 junk so it depends on them we can 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.870
 not tell you exactly how many 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.790
 blocks his load 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.480
 it depends on your server so if I 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.760
 obviously falls I take no damage 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.250
 it's rather the wii ben it's money 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.890
 incomplete you see the animations so 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.740
 the furniture the people playing will everything 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.030
 that normally happens in the world 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.650
 so very practical the game will not you 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:25.630
 say for a practice you know of 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.440
 anyway and for for you to remove 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.890
 you have two solutions 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.400
 if you fall you may discover that 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.960
 it works 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.870
 Or you can ask your 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.130
 your friend if you come in making sure who 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.390
 is right next to your boat two 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.470
 case it is there but exciting 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:43.270
 boat puts an end to a last word 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.430
 finally - a map and instruments I am 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:49.120
 again dropped back to the position I'm 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:52.390
 so that's our first bug on the 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.410
 cash to me thatcher buy on it i 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.470
 think it was pretty much all said 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.600
 no yeah but you are to destroy the 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.030
 dummy could have done you even if you 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.560
 come ahead and you fart will take it 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.150
 there is that I hear you falling so 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.500
 you can doc there are two solutions either 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.790
 someone is breaking it for you I 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.240
 do you have to disconnect yourself you 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.370
 reconnect to the goods 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.580
 the headphones well be on you arrive 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.780
 you even at the limit of the wegmans map 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.370
 he you case it's you it's okay 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.650
 will walk 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.449
 but we will have a second video 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.720
 who will come who will be busier on 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:27.210
 the bugs of this free calm mode around 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.880
 of you and star still good for that 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.319
 it's not sure yet we do not have 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.090
 still finished all the concepts to test 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:34.319
 and we will obviously have other videos 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.270
 with even more bugs 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:38.069
 impressive that this is just a 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.199
 kind of before taste we wanted you 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:43.199
 show and as we have never seen but 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:44.069
 never seen on youtube before and I 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:47.400
 think we really care about something 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:53.630
 of exclusive good we will leave there 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:56.430
 on it yes I touched everything 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.440
 ah yes and little parenthesis for them 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.020
 blocks that you broke during other 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:04.289
 African time wanted to see that they are 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.759
 not broken but so glitch like that 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:07.440
 so all you will do is 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.610
 you can dice corcos that now 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.590
 that is done and it always works well 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.060
 what we advise if not if you 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.130
 right click the blocks leading 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.810
 directly reappear so it's a 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.969
 little parenthesis for that furniture 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.979
 the blocks will not reappear but 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:20.759
 no messing around made of a decor and 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:24.300
 right click 

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:24.860
 ouch on this point we will really 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.060
 to leave 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.060
 ciao ciao everyone
