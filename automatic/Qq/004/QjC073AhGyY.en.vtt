for<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:38.299> head<00:01:38.570> using<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.020> k7<00:01:39.530> it<00:01:39.619> has<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.860> 1.5

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
for the head using the k7 it has a 1.5

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.940 
for the head using the k7 it has a 1.5
time<00:01:41.060> headshot<00:01:41.659> multiplier<00:01:41.840> since<00:01:42.829> it

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
time headshot multiplier since it

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.859 
time headshot multiplier since it
already<00:01:43.130> has<00:01:43.460> that<00:01:43.610> normal<00:01:44.030> upward<00:01:44.420> kick<00:01:44.659> what

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
already has that normal upward kick what

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:45.999 
already has that normal upward kick what
you<00:01:44.930> want<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.170> do<00:01:45.259> is<00:01:45.380> start<00:01:45.560> at<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.740> chest

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
you want to do is start at the chest

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.620 
you want to do is start at the chest
having<00:01:46.400> kicked<00:01:46.670> its<00:01:46.790> way<00:01:46.939> up<00:01:47.180> you're<00:01:47.540> gonna

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
having kicked its way up you're gonna

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.999 
having kicked its way up you're gonna
find<00:01:47.840> yourself<00:01:48.140> getting<00:01:48.229> kills<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.619> lot<00:01:48.649> more<00:01:48.979> I

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
find yourself getting kills a lot more I

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.160 
find yourself getting kills a lot more I
would<00:01:49.280> say<00:01:49.460> normally<00:01:49.670> do<00:01:50.090> this<00:01:50.329> if<00:01:50.509> you<00:01:50.960> are

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
would say normally do this if you are

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.569 
would say normally do this if you are
that<00:01:51.350> distance<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:51.860> can<00:01:51.979> do<00:01:52.040> it<00:01:52.130> up<00:01:52.250> close<00:01:52.430> as

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
that distance you can do it up close as

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.100 
that distance you can do it up close as
well<00:01:52.729> as<00:01:52.820> you<00:01:52.939> want<00:01:53.149> to<00:01:53.329> but<00:01:53.780> if<00:01:53.899> you're<00:01:54.020> gonna

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
well as you want to but if you're gonna

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.510 
well as you want to but if you're gonna
be<00:01:54.259> at<00:01:54.320> a<00:01:54.380> distance<00:01:54.680> trying<00:01:54.979> to<00:01:55.040> birth<00:01:55.220> fire

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
be at a distance trying to birth fire

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
you find yourself in a situation where

you are going to be in a long end at a

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.340 
you are going to be in a long end at a
gunfight<00:01:59.299> then<00:01:59.450> I<00:01:59.509> would<00:01:59.630> suggest<00:01:59.750> you<00:02:00.020> try<00:02:00.290> to

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
gunfight then I would suggest you try to

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.050 
gunfight then I would suggest you try to
aim<00:02:00.500> for<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.710> head<00:02:00.950> even<00:02:01.430> if<00:02:01.640> it's<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:01.850> little

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
aim for the head even if it's a little

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.219 
aim for the head even if it's a little
hard<00:02:02.240> you're<00:02:02.390> gonna<00:02:02.479> find<00:02:02.689> yourself<00:02:03.020> taking

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
hard you're gonna find yourself taking

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.319 
hard you're gonna find yourself taking
less<00:02:03.649> time<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.070> kill<00:02:04.250> people<00:02:04.460> talking<00:02:05.240> about

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
less time to kill people talking about

extremely<00:02:11.150> fast<00:02:11.420> since<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.230> does<00:02:12.380> fire<00:02:12.650> rather

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
extremely fast since it does fire rather

extremely fast since it does fire rather

recoil is that going to be something
excessive<00:02:16.620> if<00:02:16.739> you're<00:02:16.860> up<00:02:16.980> close<00:02:17.010> you're<00:02:17.340> not

going to notice it if you're at a

going to notice it if you're at a

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
distance gonna be quite a bit there but

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.699 
distance gonna be quite a bit there but
it's<00:02:20.790> not<00:02:20.879> as<00:02:21.120> much<00:02:21.269> as<00:02:21.420> other<00:02:21.629> SMGs<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.470> call

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
it's not as much as other SMGs in call

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.229 
it's not as much as other SMGs in call
booty<00:02:22.950> go<00:02:23.099> so<00:02:23.370> it's<00:02:23.580> definitely<00:02:23.910> one<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.120> you

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
booty go so it's definitely one that you

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.150 
booty go so it's definitely one that you
can<00:02:24.540> manage<00:02:24.840> especially<00:02:25.560> if<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.769> put<00:02:25.950> a

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
17 damage at a distance which is pretty

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.970 
17 damage at a distance which is pretty
strange<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.410> we're<00:02:55.500> gonna<00:02:55.590> talk<00:02:55.769> about<00:02:55.860> a

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
strange and we're gonna talk about a

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.860 
strange and we're gonna talk about a
little<00:02:56.160> bit<00:02:56.310> more<00:02:56.370> ahead<00:02:56.610> but<00:02:57.360> let's<00:02:57.599> move<00:02:57.720> on

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
little bit more ahead but let's move on

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.690 
little bit more ahead but let's move on
to<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.140> next<00:02:58.260> thing<00:02:58.410> because<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:59.250> does<00:02:59.459> have

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
to the next thing because it does have

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.339 
to the next thing because it does have
that<00:02:59.849> steep<00:03:00.180> drop-off<00:03:00.630> but<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:00.900> still<00:03:01.140> does<00:03:01.319> a

kill as the same headshot multiplier it

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.290 
kill as the same headshot multiplier it
doesn't<00:04:34.110> have<00:04:34.320> as<00:04:34.560> fast<00:04:34.830> of<00:04:34.980> an<00:04:35.100> RPM<00:04:35.610> but<00:04:36.180> it

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
doesn't have as fast of an RPM but it

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.840 
doesn't have as fast of an RPM but it
does<00:04:36.570> actually<00:04:36.870> have<00:04:37.320> a<00:04:37.590> lot<00:04:38.010> more<00:04:38.220> range<00:04:38.550> and

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
does actually have a lot more range and

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.040 
does actually have a lot more range and
it<00:04:38.910> actually<00:04:39.240> is<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:39.390> lot<00:04:39.630> more<00:04:39.840> manageable

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
which means that the k7 is a lot more

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.450 
which means that the k7 is a lot more
