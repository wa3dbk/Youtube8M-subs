 hello to all i hope you go 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.339
 well then today I'm here to 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.020
 a new tutorial 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.420
 so I'm going to show how to create a 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.340
 usb bootable key in order to install 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.230
 windows 8 points I did say the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.820
 version 8 points so I'm going to you 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.820
 show how we enter this usb key 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.910
 bootable in order to install windows 8 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.680
 points since the usb key are stingy of 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.869
 particular problems so the souls 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.619
 so that's leaving your you need a 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.840
 usb key of minimum 4 gigas so like 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.600
 you can see I have a usb key already 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.110
 connected here with 4 gigas 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.000
 So here you need the usb key 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.760
 thoroughly whether to end so top 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.219
 then you need the iso images of 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.200
 windows 8 points 1 so we could not 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.320
 as you can see here I have the picture 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.520
 iso for the 64 bit version and the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.170
 32-bit version 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.260
 so if you want to download them I 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.680
 you put a link to download the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.840
 iso images we mean nothing of course so 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.539
 I have not applauded them yet so 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.760
 I applaud them later so we could 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.909
 see they are available for them 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.549
 versions 32 and 64 bit security 411 is 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.590
 taken out cave 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.659
 then friends you need windows 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.780
 seven usb says swell actually it's thanks 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.330
 at this fight software create another key 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.439
 bootable usb to install windows 8 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.799
 points so windows 7 usb dvd toul en 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.600
 does it's also to create classes 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.820
 bootable b for windows seven 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.670
 so we will use to create our 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.860
 bootable class b for version 8 for 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.100
 the 8-point version actually does that 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.530
 walk with windows 7 vista a 2,8 and 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.939
 a dose 8 points so it's gone so 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.990
 I would put a link to download this 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.520
 the installer of this little software 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.320
 it is a tool so I have you 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.659
 doubleclick and run next install 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.690
 here is finish in two seconds it's done 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.310
 so you will have the software here so I 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.590
 would put in there and I'm just going 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.190
 double click 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.410
 Yes 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.750
 so here you will have this window 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.760
 there simply you will click 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.120
 on bronze to select the images 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.150
 iso 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.860
 so for my part I will select 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.650
 the iso image that corresponds to me so it's 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.940
 the 64- bit version for my part since 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.770
 I have a computer these are two bits 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.830
 so I take the 64-bit version 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.450
 here is open then I click on a 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.130
 text 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.700
 then he asks me if you want him 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.960
 crav and on a support a usb mobile or 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.210
 on a dvd so for us it's usb 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.340
 then we can see here our class 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.310
 b detect so we're still going 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.440
 check from a computer and that we can 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:53.290
 see the class b the letter ch so so 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.390
 this is my class b h the move to bhl 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.810
 disc 3.26 giga so these four 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.730
 gigandet 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.330
 then we will simply click 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.920
 No big on copying and save to format 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.560
 usb key and it will start 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.200
 so during this phase there I beg you 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.230
 to wait patiently because it can 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.080
 take about 10 to 20 minutes 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.350
 so we're right after friends 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.810
 So here is the city years as seen 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.550
 the bar helped all green let's show the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.160
 progression so that's marc who are 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.900
 for its complete status is back 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.030
 that is, it's good so what we 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.060
 is going to do that we're going to close that we're going 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.489
 unplug the usb key and we'll put the 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.019
 key this buzz on the on the computer in 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.110
 which one will install windows 8 points 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.580
 so here I am doing this with you I 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.860
 still show you the appearance 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.480
 of the usb key into the computer for 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.070
 see if all files have been well 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.080
 copied in pureur tales with the icon of 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.180
 windows there 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.210
 the nation inside you can see 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.610
 installation files that have good 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.120
 been copied so there this for that's 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.120
 good everything 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:10.099
 so here I plugged my usb stick and 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:12.040
 o'barry started here that's it so I 'm going 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.780
 start the computer 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.200
 so here I'm going to show that it's not a 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.299
 fake 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.699
 so I 'll see the computer start up and 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.709
 we will access the bios to do it 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.550
 vote from the usb key we had 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.550
 connected it's gone 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:38.840
 so I'm going to access the good his 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:40.580
 keeping on the shower f10 for me 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.430
 from the camp my computer is an aspect of 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.370
 young people press the h / f key 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.169
 so your name is different so I 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.689
 will settle for it to go up on the 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:54.919
 more beautiful I will go on buttes 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:58.159
 option is so good smell with the 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:00.139
 key f6 I will go up for the key 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.150
 usb usb disk is one that are at 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.729
 first in fact so here I have already settled 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.589
 at first so I pressed m6 for 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:12.589
 that it is first time that the gc 

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:15.229
 exit exit his business yes and there it has 

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:22.360
 stuck on usb key for astrid windows 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:24.439
 8 points and we can see the logo of 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.969
 windows 8 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:28.569
 apart and for cause jean and 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:28.569
 Installation 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.280
 and opens the installation window of 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.710
 windows 8 in paris so here I wanted 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.400
 show how to prepare the usb key 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.880
 bootable 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.360
 so that's the end of this 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.070
 video 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.210
 I hope you liked it so
