00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello everyone is a sister and today 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.460
 one of the songs will need to work 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.740
 easier that guitar on those for 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.410
 beginners who sing you will have the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.970
 classic little song you touch you 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:21.270
 sings to the person's birthday then 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.180
 sorry then in this action song 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.850
 that result in two cases or not the mind 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.570
 or by launching a little and doing leaves 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.300
 a single door so that it becomes a little 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.530
 the faster you can not hear it 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.329
 and on the third race when it can be done 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.120
 immediately you can do the ropes you can 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.120
 do before the race place according to what 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.909
 the third on the strength of the tip and finally 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.819
 la7 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:56.129
 but I advise you like making a rope 

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:58.589
 first she 's doing the song first on 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.729
 third string and then when using 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:05.039
 even before 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:08.280
 the last three notes that only these are 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:14.670
 switch to the first string and serious with the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:17.479
 match is ok then let's start what he wanted 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.479
 that hear everything 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.420
 you believe we thought it happens on 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:02:03.720
 first rope as I said before 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:02:05.539
 was so he apologized at the same time and badly 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.069
 now pretend I'm not talking 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:23.580
 go immediately to the first string is 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:27.810
 restarted ok and the process of those 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:32.299
 keys and things then its rope head 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:37.230
 start started in an empty one 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:42.060
 I still go those twice second 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:46.489
 vast and still empty 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.670
 now but if it was the 34 notes do 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.390

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.390
 recapping 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.410
 I repeat what I can do right 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.720

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:09.600
 now we repeat until if until 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:13.350

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.019
 second then made the second vacuum 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.300
 raise the photo as before and then say about 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:36.919
 go to the fifth with the fourth we go 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:44.669
 in the seventh and then this is what it is 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:51.780
 pinto ok now I'll do it all again until 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:53.640

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.830
 still in the face if they are second 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:03.150

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:20.640
