00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
actually indeed just that everything

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.990 
actually indeed just that everything
that<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.800> loved<00:00:26.010> about<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.400> original<00:00:26.430> jazz

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
that you loved about the original jazz

the 40th anniversary of the jazz chorus
we're<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.250> excited<00:00:38.520> about<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.879> it's<00:00:39.180> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
we're really excited about that it's a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.479 
we're really excited about that it's a
classic<00:00:39.719> amplifier<00:00:40.260> it's<00:00:40.440> been<00:00:40.590> used<00:00:40.829> many

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
classic amplifier it's been used many

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.600 
classic amplifier it's been used many
many<00:00:41.730> years<00:00:42.200> question<00:00:43.200> as<00:00:44.190> far<00:00:44.460> as<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
many years question as far as the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.459 
many years question as far as the
circuitry<00:00:45.090> goes<00:00:45.300> other<00:00:45.539> than<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> power<00:00:46.079> is

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
circuitry goes other than the power is

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.700 
circuitry goes other than the power is
it<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:48.120> same<00:00:48.390> as<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> old<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.140> or<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.620> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
it the same as the old one or have you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.160 
it the same as the old one or have you
made<00:00:49.829> changes<00:00:50.420> I'm<00:00:51.420> sure<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.870> they've<00:00:52.020> had

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
made changes I'm sure that they've had

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.529 
made changes I'm sure that they've had
to<00:00:52.350> make<00:00:52.500> changes<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.550> sourcing<00:00:54.329> parts

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
to make changes as sourcing parts

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.500 
to make changes as sourcing parts
becomes<00:00:55.020> different<00:00:55.260> over<00:00:55.559> years<00:00:56.149> but<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
becomes different over years but the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.900 
becomes different over years but the
goal<00:00:57.870> was<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.500> same<00:00:58.770> sound<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.670> that

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
goal was to have the same sound and that

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.240 
goal was to have the same sound and that
we've<00:01:00.120> achieved<00:01:00.289> great<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.859> always<00:01:02.010> had

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
we've achieved great and it always had

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.100 
we've achieved great and it always had
that<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.640> love<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.210> chorus<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.660> always<00:01:03.840> love<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
that I love the chorus I always love the

that I love the chorus I always love the
chorus<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.650> amp<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.280> same<00:01:05.760> kind<00:01:06.060> of

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
chorus on that amp the same kind of

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.160 
chorus on that amp the same kind of
sound<00:01:06.740> absolutely<00:01:07.740> at<00:01:08.070> 100%<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.909> fact<00:01:09.170> just

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
sound absolutely at 100% in fact just

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.530 
sound absolutely at 100% in fact just
like<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.500> jazz<00:01:10.710> chorus<00:01:11.010> JC<00:01:11.280> 120<00:01:11.939> very<00:01:12.270> clean

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
like the jazz chorus JC 120 very clean

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.300 
like the jazz chorus JC 120 very clean
amplifier<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.650> tell<00:01:13.830> here

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:32.380 

now<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.370> add<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.850> chorus<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.480> it

that<00:01:50.330> we<00:01:50.450> made<00:01:50.630> on<00:01:50.780> this<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.710> new<00:01:51.860> JC<00:01:52.100> 40<00:01:52.640> has

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
that we made on this the new JC 40 has

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.180 
that we made on this the new JC 40 has
stereo<00:01:53.270> inputs<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:54.440> original<00:01:54.770> chance<00:01:54.979> course

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
stereo inputs the original chance course

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.320 
stereo inputs the original chance course
at<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.370> model<00:01:55.640> input<00:01:55.970> but<00:01:56.120> the<00:01:56.180> power

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
at a model input but the power

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.900 
at a model input but the power
amplifiers<00:01:56.870> were<00:01:57.080> in<00:01:57.200> stereo<00:01:57.620> this<00:01:58.610> allows

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
amplifiers were in stereo this allows

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.330 
amplifiers were in stereo this allows
you<00:01:59.090> to<00:01:59.120> use<00:01:59.270> stereo<00:01:59.900> FX<00:02:00.229> processors<00:02:00.830> going<00:02:01.190> in

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
you to use stereo FX processors going in

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.520 
you to use stereo FX processors going in
and<00:02:01.520> maintain<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:02.180> stereo<00:02:02.570> image<00:02:02.750> in<00:02:03.350> the

and maintain the stereo image in the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.350 
and maintain the stereo image in the
unit<00:02:03.800> itself<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:04.280> what<00:02:04.550> about<00:02:04.729> is<00:02:04.970> there<00:02:05.000> any

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
unit itself and what about is there any

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.570 
unit itself and what about is there any

kind of effects loop or anything on the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.370 
kind of effects loop or anything on the
back<00:02:07.759> yes<00:02:08.330> there<00:02:08.509> is<00:02:08.660> there's<00:02:08.990> an<00:02:09.140> effects

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
back yes there is there's an effects

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.260 
back yes there is there's an effects
loop<00:02:09.470> stereo<00:02:09.950> effects<00:02:10.280> loop<00:02:10.489> that<00:02:10.910> can<00:02:11.030> be<00:02:11.120> run

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
loop stereo effects loop that can be run

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.810 
loop stereo effects loop that can be run
either<00:02:11.420> series<00:02:12.320> or<00:02:12.560> parallel<00:02:12.800> so<00:02:13.580> there<00:02:13.700> is<00:02:13.790> a

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
either series or parallel so there is a

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.850 
either series or parallel so there is a
switch<00:02:14.060> back<00:02:14.270> there<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.690> that's<00:02:15.080> that<00:02:15.500> wasn't

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
switch back there and that's that wasn't

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.170 
switch back there and that's that wasn't
on<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.040> original<00:02:16.130> amp<00:02:16.550> right<00:02:16.760> no<00:02:17.000> the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
on the original amp right no the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.380 
on the original amp right no the
original<00:02:17.270> one<00:02:18.050> had<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.709> power<00:02:19.160> amp<00:02:19.340> on<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.209> back

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
original one had a power amp on the back

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.090 
original one had a power amp on the back
so<00:02:20.600> you<00:02:20.630> could<00:02:20.959> use<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.709> power<00:02:21.830> amp

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
so you could use the power amp

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.770 
so you could use the power amp
separately<00:02:22.550> but<00:02:22.670> there<00:02:22.850> really<00:02:22.970> wasn't<00:02:23.239> a<00:02:23.480> nan

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
separately but there really wasn't a nan

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.530 
separately but there really wasn't a nan

great<00:02:26.540> well<00:02:26.690> that's<00:02:26.810> very<00:02:26.870> exciting<00:02:27.440> news
