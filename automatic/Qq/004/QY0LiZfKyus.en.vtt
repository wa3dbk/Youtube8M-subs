00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:09.150
 if you too have happened to take it 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:12.630
 a tree or maybe a panettone of those 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.580
 rather to the traffic block than a pole 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.400
 you may find yourself compact of 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.400
 bodywork slightly recessed 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.119
 and it is true that they are not very aesthetically 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.070
 bad but could serve to bring them back to 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.910
 its original form for example in this 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.230
 case we lost the chance to 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.880
 insert the fog light that is retracted 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.910
 to perform this type of work 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.120
 we can use a car body fund 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.640
 who is able to heat the part e 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.170
 therefore to make it more malleable as 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.910
 see now doing hard I can't 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.340
 move the plastic let's see it 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.620
 heating up if I can restore one 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.620
 best form of this part 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.810
 and here is the restored fog light 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.099
 in its original location the repair 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.739
 so there are perfectly successful 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.830
 some there is some aesthetic detail 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.330
 to improve but all in all 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.170
 the efficiency of this fog light the 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.540
 one hundred percent 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.319
 if you need small ones too 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.209
 incoming repairs is part of ep tuf 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.680
 x.org la with the limits of small 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.959
 repairs you will surely find 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.769
 someone willing to help you repair 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.769
 at the post office things
