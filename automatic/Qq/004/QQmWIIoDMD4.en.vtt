00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.660
 today I bring you all the subscribers 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.430
 another very interesting concept that does not 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.400
 find in the course of harmony 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.800
 contemporary 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.100
 it's a very interesting idea of how 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.560
 derive how to do it we have seen 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.770
 in the ways of how to derive and how 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.890
 understand a little bit the three scales 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.700
 that we have in Western music that 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.700
 they are the major scale 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.790
 at a smaller natural scale 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.440
 it's true and we have derivations of 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.440
 these are the melodic minor scale 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.840
 we also have the minor scale something 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.840
 only 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.320
 very well let's say that one way 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.989
 traditional to learn this kind of 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.020
 ideas are not confused basically with the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.659
 second part of the minor scales is 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.640
 thinking about it in tones and halftones and how 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.180
 the lathes are correlated and 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.180
 semitones 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.869
 brito 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.869
 my natural minor scale I can say 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.700
 which is because it 's a scale that has 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.569
 half tone other than the sixth has a 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.460
 tone of a tone of the sixth the seventh 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:35.400
 degree and then another tone of the seventh 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.740
 the eighth tonic above I can also 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.570
 say as we have noted in the video 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.140
 previous I can say that it is a 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.140
 major scale 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.850
 which contains flat 3 6 and 7 which is a 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.640
 very practical way to see it 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.710
 true or I can also use this 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.200
 another mode that is also very interesting 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.400
 which is that of the tetra core god the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.100
 tetra core god then what they do 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.770
 is to divide the scale that I have true 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.440
 in two parts letter means four 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.840
 then I am dividing the scale into 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.930
 formations so to speak of four 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.080
 notes then if I had my scale 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.080
 higher 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.560
 because my first chord is the one that is 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.240
 formed by the root and the following 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.240
 four the next three notes 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.470
 My Fa Tower 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.630
 to this transport or is commonly 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.840
 also calls morally in harmony 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.880
 modal is called the tractor gave greater and 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.520
 the second one will have that 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.890
 formed from the fifth degree certain 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.720
 up to the root eighth river that is in 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.650
 this concrete case in C major would be 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.650
 solid 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.019
 it is the same formation of the first cut 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.629
 but started at the grade point that is 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.599
 we are talking about in this concrete case 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.400
 of two tracor of the elders 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.040
 separated by a tone that is in the 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.840
 half here 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.840
 in the fourth and fifth grades 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.000
 two 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:16.540
 to form it just by thinking 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.340
 divide into two say the scale of 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.380
 tracor god certain formations of 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.180
 four notes then for our 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.360
 larger scale we would have you record me 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.310
 greater would be a third I could see it 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.310
 as tone plus tone plus half tone 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.410
 and the second will have with I would be the 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.410
 same idea 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.500
 that is to say information of all this not 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.909
 tone and half tone because I can not say 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.180
 the major scale 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:46.310
 is made by a tetra akordio major is 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.489
 he calls you also and another record test 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.920
 evolution divided by an equal tone 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.540
 way I can take these ideas and 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.319
 forms the minor scales 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.319
 here we have 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.030
 and I have natural minor I can talk like 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.190
 the third is minor I can talk about this 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.280
 transportation or minor 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.630
 print the four notes ok I can talk 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.960
 here 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.360
 this would be smaller but because it has 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.920
 also the flat I can also talk about 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.920
 a tetra cut or less 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.900
 with the release of a flatted 2 within 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.900
 that second cordilleran tetra 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:32.669
 just interesting ideas so that 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.460
 you can correlate scales and 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.560
 modes in a very practical logical way 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.540
 and organized then we have 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.710
 tractor feed gave lower along with 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:47.560
 another one gave you minor with the edition 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.810
 we return two true inside in the 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.300
 formation as quickly as form 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:56.310
 natural minor scale let's see for example 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.310
 another melodic minor case 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.300
 in the simplest way to form 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.590
 melodic minor that is clear we have already 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.840
 commented 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.990
 it would simply be saying is a scale 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.990
 higher 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.470
 at any point that I want to start 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.470
 with the edition of 3 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.580
 from this new concept of our 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.069
 chords that you can also see in the 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.319
 course we can see then that I can 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:32.129
 say my first technician them giant 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:35.180
 tractor gave minor certain summed with a 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:35.180
 tetra core gave higher 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.910
 and a distance let's say true separated 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.910
 for a tone 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.680
 and let's also do the same exercise in 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.680
 lower harmonic 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:02.140
 a harmonic minor I will have myself 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:05.249
 of transport or less certain start and 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.739
 a detractor gave more 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:10.669
 as we see two by the edition we must 

00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:10.669
 two would be this idea 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:16.219
 true then it is also another way 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.719
 very practical to form scales 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:20.579
 particularly those that we use a lot 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:23.699
 in natural minor western music 

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:25.799
 less harmonious and lesser evil and that 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.349
 they use not only in jazz of course 

00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:31.889
 without classical music I hope that this 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:34.049
 kind of is also useful and that 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.509
 know that all this you already find in 

00:06:34.049 --> 00:06:38.819
 the new contemporary harmony resource 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:41.519
 I will love to hear from your comments 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:42.720
 that can leave them under then 

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:46.400
 video 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.400
 and see you very soon
