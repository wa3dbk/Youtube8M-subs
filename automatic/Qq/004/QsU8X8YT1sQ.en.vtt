production has been known to adapt as

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.880 
production has been known to adapt as
close<00:01:09.970> to<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:10.210> manga<00:01:10.509> as<00:01:10.600> possible<00:01:11.200> and<00:01:11.560> I

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
close to the manga as possible and I

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.620 
close to the manga as possible and I
think<00:01:12.070> leaving<00:01:12.280> out<00:01:12.520> a<00:01:12.550> part<00:01:12.909> 4<00:01:13.090> teaser<00:01:13.360> may

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
think leaving out a part 4 teaser may

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.109 
think leaving out a part 4 teaser may
have<00:01:13.720> been<00:01:13.840> a<00:01:13.869> part<00:01:14.050> of<00:01:14.170> this<00:01:14.320> I<00:01:14.590> also<00:01:15.580> think

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
have been a part of this I also think

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.820 
have been a part of this I also think
that<00:01:16.179> part<00:01:16.509> 3<00:01:16.720> was<00:01:16.899> only<00:01:17.140> teased<00:01:17.409> because<00:01:17.740> of

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
that part 3 was only teased because of

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.130 
that part 3 was only teased because of
its<00:01:17.979> direct<00:01:18.340> connection<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:18.819> part<00:01:19.030> 1<00:01:19.240> which

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
its direct connection to part 1 which

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.080 
its direct connection to part 1 which
was<00:01:20.259> also<00:01:20.470> included<00:01:20.710> in<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.340> same<00:01:21.550> season<00:01:21.970> as

another<00:01:34.119> argument<00:01:34.329> people<00:01:34.659> seem<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.020> be

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
another argument people seem to be

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.749 
another argument people seem to be
making<00:01:35.439> is<00:01:35.560> that<00:01:35.590> part<00:01:35.950> 4<00:01:36.189> was<00:01:36.340> announced<00:01:36.670> to
