photographed and measured and sure
enough<00:02:44.810> they<00:02:45.110> found<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.410> issue<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:47.150> they

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
enough they found the issue and they

enough they found the issue and they
fixed<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:47.600> so<00:02:48.260> now<00:02:48.610> both<00:02:49.610> of<00:02:49.790> them<00:02:50.440> measure

it's a wider lens wider is better when

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.850 
it's a wider lens wider is better when

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.759 
lights get brighter and brighter you
know<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.810> worst<00:03:45.050> thing<00:03:45.230> you<00:03:45.350> can<00:03:45.470> do<00:03:45.620> is<00:03:45.739> just

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
know the worst thing you can do is just

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.420 
know the worst thing you can do is just
have<00:03:46.070> a<00:03:46.690> 3,000<00:03:47.690> lumen<00:03:47.930> light<00:03:48.050> that's<00:03:48.430> so

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
have a 3,000 lumen light that's so

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.330 
have a 3,000 lumen light that's so
narrow<00:03:50.350> you're<00:03:51.350> just<00:03:51.500> wasting<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:51.980> light<00:03:52.130> and

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
narrow you're just wasting the light and

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.910 
narrow you're just wasting the light and
you<00:03:52.519> your<00:03:52.910> eyes<00:03:53.120> will<00:03:53.150> adjust<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.680> laser

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
you your eyes will adjust to the laser

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.040 
you your eyes will adjust to the laser
to<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:55.760> tunnel<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.239> you<00:03:56.510> can't<00:03:56.720> see<00:03:56.900> outside

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
to the tunnel and you can't see outside

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.140 
to the tunnel and you can't see outside
of<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.410> so<00:03:58.130> it's<00:03:58.250> good<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.459> have<00:03:58.550> a<00:03:58.610> wider<00:03:58.910> light

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
of it so it's good to have a wider light

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.850 
of it so it's good to have a wider light
the<00:03:59.450> last<00:03:59.630> light<00:03:59.840> from<00:03:59.989> baja<00:04:00.230> designs<00:04:00.410> is

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
the last light from baja designs is

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.860 
the last light from baja designs is
called<00:04:01.100> the<00:04:02.470> double<00:04:03.470> striker

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
called the double striker

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.850 
called the double striker
so<00:04:05.470> baja<00:04:06.840> no<00:04:07.840> make<00:04:08.140> me<00:04:08.319> make<00:04:08.620> it<00:04:08.709> a<00:04:08.769> good

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
so baja no make me make it a good

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.229 
so baja no make me make it a good
business<00:04:09.220> but<00:04:09.370> they<00:04:09.489> really<00:04:09.640> want<00:04:09.849> to<00:04:09.940> compete

so<00:05:08.199> let<00:05:08.470> me<00:05:08.530> turn<00:05:08.650> this<00:05:10.650> bad<00:05:11.650> boy<00:05:11.889> on<00:05:12.130> no<00:05:13.889> no

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
so let me turn this bad boy on no no

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.920 
so let me turn this bad boy on no no
adjustable<00:05:15.370> reflectors<00:05:15.849> on<00:05:16.060> on<00:05:16.450> this<00:05:16.690> light

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
adjustable reflectors on on this light

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.860 
adjustable reflectors on on this light
because<00:05:17.650> it's<00:05:17.950> not<00:05:18.130> needed<00:05:18.599> it's<00:05:19.599> wide<00:05:19.840> enough

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
because it's not needed it's wide enough

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:29.040 
because it's not needed it's wide enough
so<00:05:21.690> here<00:05:22.690> you<00:05:22.750> go<00:05:22.810> 89<00:05:23.289> bloomin<00:05:23.620> is<00:05:23.770> their<00:05:24.039> claim

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.999 

and<00:05:29.590> there<00:05:29.770> it<00:05:29.860> is<00:05:29.919> both<00:05:30.370> lights<00:05:31.830> shine<00:05:32.830> it<00:05:32.949> on

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
and there it is both lights shine it on

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:38.809 
and there it is both lights shine it on
the<00:05:33.129> street<00:05:33.370> here<00:05:33.990> just<00:05:34.990> a<00:05:35.110> nice<00:05:36.120> horizontal<00:05:37.120> a

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.600 
the street here just a nice horizontal a
center<00:05:39.819> spot<00:05:40.060> and<00:05:40.300> a<00:05:40.840> huge<00:05:41.169> very<00:05:42.129> huge<00:05:42.190> halo

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
center spot and a huge very huge halo

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.580 
center spot and a huge very huge halo
you<00:05:43.479> know<00:05:43.539> this<00:05:43.810> is<00:05:43.900> one<00:05:44.050> of<00:05:44.110> the<00:05:44.169> brighter

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
you know this is one of the brighter

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:50.330 
you know this is one of the brighter
lights<00:05:44.889> you<00:05:45.009> have<00:05:45.129> around<00:05:47.190> it<00:05:48.190> does<00:05:48.370> get<00:05:48.520> hot

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
lights you have around it does get hot

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.770 
lights you have around it does get hot
so<00:05:52.409> you<00:05:53.409> know<00:05:53.500> there's<00:05:53.680> just<00:05:53.740> so<00:05:53.949> much<00:05:54.069> power

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
so you know there's just so much power

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.839 
so you know there's just so much power
and<00:05:55.780> a<00:05:55.900> little<00:05:56.080> bit<00:05:56.139> of<00:05:56.199> heat<00:05:56.379> sinking<00:05:56.680> so<00:05:56.849> you

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
and a little bit of heat sinking so you

00:05:57.849 --> 00:05:59.790 
and a little bit of heat sinking so you
know<00:05:57.940> I<00:05:57.970> wouldn't<00:05:58.210> stand<00:05:58.449> around<00:05:58.720> the<00:05:59.110> the

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
know I wouldn't stand around the the

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.890 
know I wouldn't stand around the the
Arizona<00:06:00.250> desert<00:06:00.490> for<00:06:00.909> 10<00:06:01.060> minutes<00:06:01.240> with<00:06:01.780> your

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
Arizona desert for 10 minutes with your

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.350 
Arizona desert for 10 minutes with your
lights<00:06:02.139> on<00:06:02.289> for<00:06:02.530> you<00:06:02.560> know<00:06:02.860> you<00:06:02.919> don't<00:06:03.099> want

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
lights on for you know you don't want

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.430 
lights on for you know you don't want
you<00:06:04.360> don't<00:06:04.389> want<00:06:04.509> it's<00:06:04.719> getting<00:06:04.990> too<00:06:05.080> hot<00:06:05.110> what

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
you don't want it's getting too hot what

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.249 
you don't want it's getting too hot what
they'll<00:06:05.590> do<00:06:05.770> what<00:06:06.009> these<00:06:06.159> lights<00:06:06.370> do<00:06:06.580> is<00:06:06.729> heal

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
they'll do what these lights do is heal

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:09.420 
they'll do what these lights do is heal
you'll<00:06:08.259> step<00:06:08.560> down<00:06:08.770> to<00:06:08.949> protect<00:06:09.099> the

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
you'll step down to protect the

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.369 
you'll step down to protect the
circuitry<00:06:10.330> and<00:06:10.830> the<00:06:12.210> limiters<00:06:13.210> from<00:06:13.960> from<00:06:14.229> any

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:14.379 
circuitry and the limiters from from any

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:16.439 
circuitry and the limiters from from any
damage<00:06:14.560> so<00:06:15.009> if<00:06:15.190> it<00:06:15.310> gets<00:06:15.460> too<00:06:15.610> hot<00:06:15.819> they'll

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.449 
damage so if it gets too hot they'll

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.360 
damage so if it gets too hot they'll
just<00:06:16.569> step<00:06:16.750> down<00:06:16.780> you'll<00:06:17.080> get<00:06:17.229> less<00:06:17.440> light<00:06:17.680> so

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
just step down you'll get less light so

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.830 
just step down you'll get less light so
that's<00:06:18.819> the<00:06:18.940> only<00:06:18.969> needs<00:06:19.270> a<00:06:19.479> little<00:06:19.509> it's<00:06:19.780> a

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
that's the only needs a little it's a

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.680 
that's the only needs a little it's a
little<00:06:19.870> bit<00:06:20.080> hot<00:06:20.229> but<00:06:21.690> beautiful

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
little bit hot but beautiful

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.390 
little bit hot but beautiful
construction<00:06:23.169> you<00:06:23.740> know<00:06:23.830> just<00:06:24.039> a<00:06:24.159> beautiful
