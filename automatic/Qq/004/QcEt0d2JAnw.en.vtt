 in the county of kent 

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:05.070
 Dmitry Hare 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.610
 today we talk 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.460
 in the new bill here is the traffic police gibdd he 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.690
 plans to increase security 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.279
 pedestrians 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.639
 proposed to amend the rules 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.439
 road traffic 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:18.290
 the first 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.390
 create special zones in the cluster area 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.380
 office and shopping centers 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.099
 and so-called residential buildings 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.859
 At first, the movement will be 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.250
 limited to 30 kilometers per hour during 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:32.680
 second he is examined 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.470
 those kilometers per hour 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.200
 with residential buildings 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.400
 all benefits will be pedestrian 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.340
 the second 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.740
 limit the speed of movement populated 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.430
 paragraph 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.490
 at 50 kilometers per hour 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.820
 present act 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.960
 restrictions 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.230
 60 kilometers per hour 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.270
 lithium 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.160
 on every crosswalk inspectors 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.280
 you will not put 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.709
 therefore the number will be increased 

00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:00.550
 speed bumps 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.870
 fourth 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.560
 drivers will be required 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.920
 around the clock 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.799
 and here included 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.490
 headlights 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.490
 in the city and outside the village 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.240
 drivers will have to pass pedestrians 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.540
 not only when the latter is already on 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.820
 pedestrian crossing but also when only 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.820
 are going to set foot on him 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.409
 in my opinion this is another attempt 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.520
 traffic police offer 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.180
 full responsibility for 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.530
 road safety 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.330
 direct 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.270
 while road transport 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.360
 an incident 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.190
 happen not only through their fault but if not 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.540
 road lanes 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.020
 regulatory bodies and themselves 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.550
 pedestrians 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.720
 first point 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.960
 movement in the flooded area 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.789
 service 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.520
 and shopping centers and residential buildings 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.070
 in fact, this means trading 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.360
 office centers 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.800
 equated to a residential building 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.460
 the pedestrian has always had the advantage of the world 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.210
 of war 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.090
 everything else remains 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.530
 still 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.600
 the movement of a residential house is itself dangerous 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.589
 for driver 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:11.410
 here you need to be special 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.040
 attentive and able to manage well 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.479
 car idling 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:18.519
 feature non-residential home is 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.090

 the way her friends are important 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:33.669
 second point 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:35.959
 com speed limits populated 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.959
 paragraph based on the experience of Europeans 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:42.629
 this sentence gibdd to my surprise 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.139
 supported this ban on

 Pikulenko 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.289
 he said 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:53.089
 that with the introduction of this norm, the total speed 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.019
 flow to Russia 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.139
 statistics say 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.249
 what's the decrease maximum 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:01.199
 speeds up to 50 kilometers per hour 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.289
 reduces crash rates by 10 12 percent 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.999
 however the largest locality 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.069
 Moscow city 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.169
 average flow rate so below 50 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.009
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:16.279
 traffic jams but this natural 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.679
 character manifested articles 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:21.619
 that all the business activity I was there

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:33.919
 and other factor 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.129
 I have spoken about this repeatedly in my 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.449
 articles 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.809

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.349
 except the Chinese are connected 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:48.979

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.179
 on the elimination of traffic lights 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:56.329
 as it is done on the Moscow Ring Road with 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.529
 Leningrad highway 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:01.249
 one more thing is pedestrian crossings 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:04.729
 on the roadway 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.919
 and the problem of crossing the road in the wrong 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.050
 place as shown to my videos 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.139
 and the second to the pedestrian 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.689
 experienced driver 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.049
 often have time to respond even 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.259
 unexpected pedestrian activities 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.349
 and what if in one 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.289
 newbie 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.309
 modern approach to solving this problem 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:28.159
 construction of underground and above ground 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:31.059
 pedestrian crossings needed 

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:32.989
 limit contact as much as possible 

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:34.909
 pedestrians healthy 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:39.120
 October 16, 2009 in the west of Moscow 

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:42.940
 a major car accident happened bmw 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.309
 crashed into a bus stop 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:47.939
 I spoke about this in my video 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:49.529
 for us 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:51.770
 to limit the number 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.080
 such accidents must be done 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.449
 bus shelters 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.449
 and sidewalks 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:01.839
 third item 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:03.639
 nearest police 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.449
 speed bumps have long played their 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.150
 positive role on Russian roads 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.750
 it is necessary to regulate them 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.779
 installations 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.860
 in many places and not just on the west 

00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:17.810
 the road of another word 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.150
 you will not pick up 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.229
 many police officers in Moscow 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:22.380
 and Moscow region 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.480
 not redeemed have a different composition they 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.270
 correspond to the guest 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.400
 because of this suffers subjected cars 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.840
 and it doesn't bother anyone since 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.669
 suspension repair paid 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:35.639
 by citizens 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.289
 earlier budget 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.259
 policeman not matching guest 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.259
 may cause an accident itself 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:46.809
 fourth point 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:48.069
 drivers will be required 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.880
 around the clock everywhere 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.370
 rides with dipped headlights 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.560
 I agree that this measure is effective for the benefit 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.749
 native country 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:01.729
 however judge semenova jealous and harmful 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:02.740
 headlights 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.270
 in the village 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.669
 not proven say this results 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:09.699
 western researchers 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.559
 see mole dips 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:15.559
 advantages and disadvantages 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.369
 fifth paragraph 

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:21.349
 drivers will have to pass pedestrians 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.479
 not only when the latter is already on 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:24.900
 crosswalk 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.180
 but also when just going for it 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.180
 resistant 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.529
 First part 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:31.459
 when the pedestrian is already on 

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:33.050
 crosswalk 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.940
 understandably 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.440
 and the second allows the inspector 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.710
 interpret in a similar situation subjectively 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.310
 and how the driver can predict the thought 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.689
 pedestrian 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:47.049
 maybe the traffic police consider our 

00:06:47.049 --> 00:06:49.469
 drivers psychics 

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:51.889
 major trends in the department 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:54.149
 pedestrian interaction 

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:57.569
 but set out and the sky rollers on her powers 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:59.460
 crosswalk 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.480
 let's leave the structures dmitry hares
