00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.080
 Oh 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.969
 for this summer manicure you need 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.880
 a base a coral varnish a golden varnish 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:19.029
 then a varnish of gold flakes 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.599
 is also a white polish and for 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.919
 finish a finishing coat 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:27.210
 we start by applying the varnish 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:30.430
 coral on the index the little finger and the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.270
 hic years was applied the walleye on 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.710
 the index and middle finger when the walleye and 5 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.320
 we apply small glitter 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.740
 golden very nice and it will look like 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.050
 more to sucy when the doormats dry 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.690
 I was created a tribal pattern on 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.050
 the majors with a white varnish I 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.640
 start by drawing an x ​​on long so 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.650
 how to make a crime is simple 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.840
 speaks of a long and expresses t bpt in 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.720
 face one diagonal line to the other 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.970
 end as as I quote and the 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.659
 sodas line really varies according to this 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.640
 conference then be free girls 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:10.170
 create things and we were two 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.850
 the other pan os x same jean bardin 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.100
 and we go but the league so 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.619
 integral to the other point as if 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.720
 now we create triangle halfs 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.450
 in each neighborhood we compare 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.820
 middle and one is credit crunch ling who 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.390
 go to the end of the nail like those 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 here and we create three men united as 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.890
 that what the other to kill the triangle 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.860
 we always start from the middle 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.990
 lunch we go out and 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.970
 one pressed too hard on the brush 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.179
 it unless you want lines that 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:47.280
 are a little chair when it's dry 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.360
 makes you laugh easy to have 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.360
 lines a little more opaque 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.570
 and that's the tribal pattern is over 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.030
 just like the manicure 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.460
 here it is in full I hope that it will 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.560
 Please if you could see a success 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.000
 picture because I want to see that on this 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.000
