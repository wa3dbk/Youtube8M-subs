00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
can't really do and I thought this it's

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.800 
can't really do and I thought this it's
a<00:01:26.159> nice<00:01:26.310> creative<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.180> original<00:01:27.240> way<00:01:27.780> of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
this is Sonic the Hedgehog and the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.080 
this is Sonic the Hedgehog and the
reason<00:01:34.079> why<00:01:34.170> I'm<00:01:34.290> drawing<00:01:34.740> Sonic<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.670> because

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
reason why I'm drawing Sonic is because

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.929 
reason why I'm drawing Sonic is because
I<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.420> draw<00:01:36.659> Sonic<00:01:37.200> without<00:01:37.860> looking<00:01:38.610> at<00:01:38.880> a

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
I can draw Sonic without looking at a

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.899 
I can draw Sonic without looking at a
sonic<00:01:39.450> picture<00:01:39.900> because<00:01:40.650> uh<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:41.189> was<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.490> I'm

Harry<00:02:33.900> spikes<00:02:34.470> now<00:02:35.160> if<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.430> was<00:02:35.580> gonna<00:02:35.700> do<00:02:35.940> this

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
Harry spikes now if I was gonna do this

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.990 
Harry spikes now if I was gonna do this
picture<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.630> can<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.260> would<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.560> would<00:02:37.739> change<00:02:38.730> how

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
picture I can I would I would change how

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.940 
picture I can I would I would change how
to<00:02:39.060> use<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.450> bigger<00:02:39.780> paper<00:02:40.170> because<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.769> can

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
to use a bigger paper because you can

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.330 
to use a bigger paper because you can
see<00:02:41.220> right<00:02:41.489> there<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.900> blue<00:02:43.319> spikes<00:02:43.950> should

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
see right there the blue spikes should

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.280 
see right there the blue spikes should
be<00:02:44.580> bigger<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.480> think<00:02:45.540> they<00:02:45.810> should<00:02:45.959> be<00:02:45.989> bigger

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
be bigger I think they should be bigger

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.979 
be bigger I think they should be bigger
but<00:02:47.130> because<00:02:47.519> there<00:02:47.700> was<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.819> normal<00:02:48.180> paper<00:02:48.480> I

like it a lot I like it this video right
here<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.950> actually<00:03:23.150> eat<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.180> up<00:03:24.480> on<00:03:24.780> double<00:03:26.120> I'm

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
here is actually eat it up on double I'm

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.390 
here is actually eat it up on double I'm
actually<00:03:27.359> doing<00:03:27.690> it's<00:03:27.930> pretty<00:03:28.230> slow<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.980> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
actually doing it's pretty slow that the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.110 
actually doing it's pretty slow that the
original<00:03:30.060> video<00:03:30.359> is<00:03:30.510> like<00:03:31.220> 13<00:03:32.220> or<00:03:32.250> 14<00:03:32.790> minutes

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
original video is like 13 or 14 minutes

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.259 
original video is like 13 or 14 minutes
long<00:03:33.470> this<00:03:34.470> one<00:03:34.739> has<00:03:35.220> been<00:03:35.459> speeded<00:03:36.000> up<00:03:36.090> on

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
long this one has been speeded up on

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.840 
long this one has been speeded up on
double<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.989> now<00:03:37.260> it's<00:03:37.440> like<00:03:37.560> 6<00:03:38.040> minutes<00:03:38.340> long

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
double and now it's like 6 minutes long

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.020 
double and now it's like 6 minutes long
so

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
so

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.950 
so
originally<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.120> know<00:03:41.240> I'm<00:03:41.390> actually<00:03:41.660> just

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
originally you know I'm actually just

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.500 
originally you know I'm actually just
sitting<00:03:42.350> there<00:03:42.380> doing<00:03:43.340> this<00:03:43.610> pretty<00:03:43.970> slowly

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
sitting there doing this pretty slowly

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.530 
sitting there doing this pretty slowly
so<00:03:45.080> it<00:03:45.500> might<00:03:46.340> look<00:03:46.550> like<00:03:46.610> I'm<00:03:47.000> like<00:03:47.330> I'm<00:03:47.510> like

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
so it might look like I'm like I'm like

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.410 
so it might look like I'm like I'm like
I'm<00:03:48.470> know<00:03:48.740> what<00:03:48.890> I'm<00:03:49.010> doing<00:03:49.400> maybe<00:03:49.640> like<00:03:50.300> I'm

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420

what<00:05:58.110> I'm<00:05:58.199> doing<00:05:58.470> it<00:05:58.530> look<00:05:58.680> look<00:05:58.979> at<00:05:59.070> that<00:05:59.190> look

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
what I'm doing it look look at that look

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.249 
what I'm doing it look look at that look
how<00:05:59.370> it<00:05:59.520> stands<00:05:59.970> out<00:06:00.210> from<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.509> paper<00:06:00.900> and

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
how it stands out from the paper and

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:03.499 
how it stands out from the paper and
it's<00:06:01.949> really<00:06:02.370> heavy<00:06:02.669> you<00:06:02.849> know<00:06:03.090> it's<00:06:03.270> pretty

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
it's really heavy you know it's pretty

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.300 
it's really heavy you know it's pretty
heavy<00:06:03.720> so<00:06:04.050> once<00:06:04.319> you<00:06:04.440> finish<00:06:04.620> and<00:06:04.889> just<00:06:04.919> let<00:06:05.190> it

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
heavy so once you finish and just let it

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.430 
heavy so once you finish and just let it
dry<00:06:05.580> for<00:06:05.639> like<00:06:06.060> I<00:06:06.150> don't<00:06:06.210> know<00:06:06.360> six<00:06:07.259> hours

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
dry for like I don't know six hours

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.790 
dry for like I don't know six hours
maybe<00:06:07.860> maybe<00:06:08.250> a<00:06:08.370> day<00:06:08.639> just<00:06:08.699> let<00:06:09.000> it<00:06:09.150> sit<00:06:09.570> there

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
maybe maybe a day just let it sit there

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.860 
maybe maybe a day just let it sit there
