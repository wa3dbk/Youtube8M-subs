00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 day by day nature advances and we 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.390
 presents this type of examples in the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.880
 that as it is it is opened step in search of 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.889
 survival is that just as we do 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.320
 we the rest of the animals 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.250
 try to adapt in the best way to 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.590
 your environment 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.600
 many times leaving us speechless 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.539
 before the results filling us 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.880
 amazement and curiosity from the sciences 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.340
 we have tried to understand this kind of 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.349
 things for a long time we have 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.330
 established criteria to study the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.820
 order of the food chain and others 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.649
 but there are times when something happens 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.410
 that nobody predicted or that even 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.200
 I even imagined nature is like that 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.270
 of incredible is wise and perfect here 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.340
 you have some examples do not miss to 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.450
 these five animals that are killers 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.449
 brutal post number 5 spiders that 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.460
 Bats eat spiders eat 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.050
 bats live practically in 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.020
 everyone and except for the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.640
 antarctica on every continent there are no 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.710
 is that it is a copy in 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.049
 particular but of several within the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.570
 species which hunt and feed 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.640
 of bats of various sizes 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.830
 It is known that certain 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.960
 Spider species that are unique 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.000
 for its fascinating eating habits 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.130
 for example eating vertebrates or their 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.660
 capabilities to catch them for example 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.430
 catching fish with cobwebs or 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.840
 submerging underwater 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.479
 having examples like the tarantula 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.729
 goliat able to eat birds and rodents or 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.710
 species of spider tarantulas and wolf spiders 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.860
 other hunters that have been devoured 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.900
 frogs fish and lizards studies 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.970
 recent developments in costa rica and 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.680
 Other Central and South American regions 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.899
 have pointed out that both tarantulas 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.640
 like spiders who build cobwebs 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.060
 are able to feed on 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.649
 bats are known 52 species of 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.530
 spiders that eat bats in 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.210
 different parts of the world 90% of 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.640
 they inhabit warm regions and 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.470
 Tropical that's not all because the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.560
 look exactly the same 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.520
 feature they have 100 feet 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.770
 put number 4 fish that eat birds 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.259
 and it's not the world upside down this is the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.209
 evolution we have all seen birds 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.040
 eat fish throughout life but 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.340
 there are certain species of fish that 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.240
 they seem to have begun to change them 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.480
 especially the catfish and others 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.489
 freshwater species the cyrus glamis 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.380
 better known as insurance is one of 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.209
 the biggest and most dance species 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.310
 incredible that exist in the world 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.220
 abundant in many regions of europe 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.989
 Middle East and Asia continent last 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.380
 in which it is considered a species 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.180
 invasive as all catfish possess 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.069
 a huge mouth and a couple of long 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.170
 whiskers which allows him to catch 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.349
 large birds have been seen eating 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.720
 Seagulls notwithstanding the pigeons seem 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.790
 be their favorite prey so much is that 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.760
 that many fishermen are using 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.980
 Doves like bait another marine species 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.930
 that has been recorded eating sometimes in 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.330
 the octopus although little is known about it 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.739
 more than you are also able to eat 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:04.890
 large seagulls put number 3 toads 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.660
 who eat mice considered adorable 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.000
 pets by many people 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.010
 the horned toads or pacman toads 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.709
 South America make up a kind of 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.720
 completely huge amphibians will 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.940
 characterized by a large size and a 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.680
 giant mouth in which everything that enters 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.620
 that your body allows you 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.260
 going insects frogs lizards and others 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.510
 amphibians spiders small birds and by 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.640
 supposedly rats and mice almost from their 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.189
 size dams with which sometimes fight 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.870
 to death the mouth of this creature is a 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:36.810
 true abyss and can occupy the 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.879
 half of his body for it pacman these 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.859
 insatiable with rudos are so greedy 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.450
 besides reminding me of some of my 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.939
 neighbors have been found in the 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.349
 nature killed by suffocation 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.090
 practically suicide because 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.189
 they have the habit of swallowing whatever 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.139
 that crosses his path and sometimes 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.599
 its prey is larger than its 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.700
 body allows them so it is that they 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.189
 you can find in the Brazilian jungles 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.430
 dead with the mouth half-open and half 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:04.950
 adored body coming out of his mouth 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.709
 put number 2 moths that drink 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.169
 blood as if it was not enough with 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.209
 the useless mosquitoes a study 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:14.280
 Recent scientist has observed that 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.560
 the moths have developed a strange 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.150
 taste for the santÃ© including the human 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.009
 Of course 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.229
 Evolution continues to run and 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:24.780
 Vampire moths are a clear example of 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.910
 it has been found in Siberia 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.919
 and among other things have resulted in 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.320
 theories of all kinds suggesting even 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.479
 that for example the leeches some 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.820
 Once they could eat only fruit 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.740
 the situation is that when the moths 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.320
 could have contact with humans 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.169
 they attacked very similarly to the 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.180
 that mosquitoes do the problem 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.160
 is that these beings are much bigger 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.259
 that mosquitoes and they need a lot more 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.270
 blood to feed also 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:53.400
 some scientists need more time 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.750
 they point out that the vampire moth can 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.360
 be up to more than 20 minutes 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.000
 absorbing the pain is more intense and the 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.190
 brand on the skin is bigger perfect 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.060
 just perfect just what 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:09.120
 we needed position number 1 mantis that 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.070
 they eat birds beyond what skeeter 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.229
 I always found it one of the best 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.300
 pokemon this point I found the most 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.400
 surprising also known mantis 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.530
 as mambo you are lending and camps 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.990
 to many who eat small birds like 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.720
 hummingbirds mantises are insects 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.250
 amazing are excellent warriors 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.290
 in a terrifying aspect 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.150
 alien and very behaviors 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.800
 peculiar as for example the 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.020
 cannibalistic behavior that they have 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.720
 after copulating when they murder and they 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.880
 They eat the male but if that were not enough 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.070
 now we know that eat your boyfriends 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.050
 is not enough and they are capable of 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.210
 hunt birds and then devour the 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.090
 it is also known that they can eat 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.970
 small lizards frogs snakes e 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.280
 even small rodents maybe the most 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.430
 amazing how they catch their prey 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.050
 with a speed and a unique technique a 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.570
 insect that will never stop me from 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.300
 surprise good that's been all 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:06.420
