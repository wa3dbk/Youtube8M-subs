00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.000
 Hello 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.029
 going down his mailbox a 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.080
 notices with an unknown track number and 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:22.189
 It turned out that this parcel is 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.349
 I ordered attention on January 27 and this 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.060
 it turns out to be a second notice 1 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.089
 notifications for this reason have not received 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.519
 And this track was glued new track 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.410
 Number, too, hell knows why that is 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.370
 new mysticism, in principle, the post of Russia 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.680
 this is what explains 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.540
 let's bad i already know i hope that 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.960
 there is exactly what should lie because 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.789
 why for some reason this package's guide is a little bit 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.359
 hints at the fact that her most likely 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:56.109
 so I opened honestly and nothing 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:59.899
 I would not be surprised here but it seems to be a signet 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:02.300
 safeguarding and let's cross our fingers on 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.250
 in fact may not be so pricing 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.850
 up but nevertheless this is one of my 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.490
 favorite knives of this company 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:19.520
 here and let's cut in many ways 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:20.990
 print then so no intrigue 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.380
 turned out here we still lie 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.479
 instruction and now under the instructions still 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.319
 one instruction is good and under this 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:34.550
 we have instructions 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:37.940
 yes the so-called hamster beckers regional committee with 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.270
 titanium dies so here is this baby 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:45.319
 looks really your time I 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.910
 was very much looking very impressed 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.160
 In general, the quality of these kids we are now 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.720
 I can say right away that I am alone here 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.869
 of course 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.869
 walking and 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.910
 and then there was swearing because well this 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.980
 I had a tryndek beckers 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.780
 obkom he was made in taiwan and he was 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.570
 very good quality that is there was 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.210
 blade centered there was frey on the very 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:15.910
 the beginning of the heel of the blade and so on here 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:18.420
 do you see yes that is well thank God that 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.360
 he doesn't clap on closing 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.580
 Here is the knife itself, of course, too, well, I already 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.620
 tried to disassemble it already looked 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.220
 what's inside here in general is 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.610
 enough 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.270
 characteristic of the Chinese quality in 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.600
 quenching 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.640
 Torx Ie they already in principle 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.730
 further hint that we will sail on 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.990
 get the hell out of us once again unleash here 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.440
 so he feels he has to 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.000
 a little bit of them ther wake up that is 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.350
 do the work that is done before 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.110
 Should in general, in theory, the manufacturer 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.430
 This knife is actually a lot 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.140
 here I am explained by this honestly I am a little bit 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.860
 upset because I get waited 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.900
 this knife three months of the mouth and in the first 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.510
 same consideration until I figured out the strength so here 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.080
 kasya just who immediately rushes to 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.600
 eyes it is unpleasant nevertheless thank you 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.300
