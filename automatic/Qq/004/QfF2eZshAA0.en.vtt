20<00:03:16.770> Leon<00:03:17.210> come<00:03:18.210> on<00:03:18.360> let's<00:03:18.870> go<00:03:19.080> for<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.320> walk

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.730 

doctor<00:03:23.940> what's<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:26.000> Cyberman<00:03:27.000> arm<00:03:27.360> oh

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
doctor what's this a Cyberman arm oh

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:37.010 
doctor what's this a Cyberman arm oh
this<00:03:28.740> doesn't<00:03:28.980> look<00:03:29.160> good<00:03:30.260> Joxer<00:03:35.870> let's<00:03:36.870> go

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
this doesn't look good Joxer let's go

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:59.280

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.830 

so<00:04:00.250> that's<00:04:00.549> why<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.819> transport<00:04:01.510> coordinates

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
so that's why the transport coordinates

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:14.480 
so that's why the transport coordinates
were<00:04:02.260> set<00:04:02.500> for<00:04:02.709> this<00:04:02.799> place<00:04:04.799> what's<00:04:05.799> this

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:31.090 

Oh<00:04:15.350> No

what<00:04:32.100> is<00:04:32.250> it<00:04:32.430> this<00:04:32.670> is<00:04:32.850> probably<00:04:33.060> a<00:04:33.360> cyber

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
what is it this is probably a cyber

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.780 
what is it this is probably a cyber
controller<00:04:34.260> he's<00:04:34.710> probably<00:04:35.040> here<00:04:35.460> since

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
controller he's probably here since

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.670 
controller he's probably here since
their<00:04:36.030> home<00:04:36.240> planet<00:04:36.600> Mondo's<00:04:36.990> was<00:04:37.260> destroyed

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
their home planet Mondo's was destroyed

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.520 
their home planet Mondo's was destroyed
in<00:04:37.950> 1960s<00:04:38.850> he<00:04:39.389> was<00:04:39.600> apparently<00:04:39.900> unconnected

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
in 1960s he was apparently unconnected

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.100 
in 1960s he was apparently unconnected
to<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.190> other<00:04:41.310> Cybermen<00:04:41.880> so<00:04:42.480> he<00:04:42.720> remains

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
to the other Cybermen so he remains

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.560 
to the other Cybermen so he remains
while<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.710> others<00:04:43.919> were<00:04:44.070> destroyed<00:04:44.220> and<00:04:45.210> you

while the others were destroyed and you
you<00:04:46.440> have<00:04:46.710> reactivated<00:04:47.550> him<00:04:47.730> in<00:04:48.389> you<00:04:48.750> and

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
you have reactivated him in you and

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.230 
you have reactivated him in you and
given<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.350> Cybermen<00:04:49.860> good<00:04:50.550> strong<00:04:50.970> leader

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
given the Cybermen good strong leader

00:04:51.240 --> 00:05:01.870 
given the Cybermen good strong leader
again<00:04:59.690> no<00:05:00.690> wait

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
again no wait

again no wait
this<00:05:02.880> is<00:05:03.030> Peru<00:05:03.210> right<00:05:04.760> car<00:05:05.760> alright<00:05:06.800> at<00:05:07.800> some

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
this is Peru right car alright at some

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.700 
this is Peru right car alright at some
place<00:05:08.340> on<00:05:08.610> earth<00:05:08.790> by<00:05:09.330> an<00:05:09.510> unknown<00:05:09.840> force<00:05:10.230> the

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
place on earth by an unknown force the

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.790 
place on earth by an unknown force the
energy<00:05:11.160> levels<00:05:11.490> are<00:05:11.669> extremely<00:05:11.940> high<00:05:12.800> this

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
energy levels are extremely high this

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.000 
energy levels are extremely high this
happens<00:05:14.220> a<00:05:14.370> lot<00:05:14.400> in<00:05:14.730> Peru<00:05:15.060> but<00:05:15.740> I<00:05:16.740> saw<00:05:16.950> the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
happens a lot in Peru but I saw the

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.860 
happens a lot in Peru but I saw the
temple<00:05:17.280> stone<00:05:18.050> and<00:05:19.050> it<00:05:19.830> was<00:05:20.010> made<00:05:20.190> of<00:05:20.370> metal

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
temple stone and it was made of metal

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.780 
temple stone and it was made of metal
which<00:05:21.870> means<00:05:22.229> that<00:05:22.890> it<00:05:22.979> can<00:05:23.160> reflect<00:05:23.370> the

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
which means that it can reflect the

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.390 
which means that it can reflect the
energy<00:05:24.150> and<00:05:24.360> then<00:05:25.290> the<00:05:25.440> whole<00:05:25.620> area<00:05:26.040> around

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
energy and then the whole area around

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.260 
energy and then the whole area around
the<00:05:26.729> temple<00:05:27.120> will<00:05:27.570> be<00:05:27.750> with<00:05:27.960> that<00:05:28.110> energy

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
the temple will be with that energy

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.960 
the temple will be with that energy
now<00:05:30.270> if<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.720> temple<00:05:31.110> stone<00:05:31.320> would<00:05:31.740> turn<00:05:32.040> by<00:05:32.640> I

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
now if the temple stone would turn by I
