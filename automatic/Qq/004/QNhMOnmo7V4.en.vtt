00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
can't seem to understand why Hinata

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.219 
can't seem to understand why Hinata
keeps<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.210> forth<00:01:51.450> even<00:01:51.750> though<00:01:51.869> she<00:01:51.930> keeps

main<00:02:37.780> reason<00:02:38.320> this<00:02:38.680> special<00:02:39.160> exists<00:02:39.820> was<00:02:40.360> to

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
main reason this special exists was to

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.510 
main reason this special exists was to
promote<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.990> brand-new<00:02:41.620> Naruto<00:02:42.010> movie<00:02:42.220> the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
promote the brand-new Naruto movie the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.760 
promote the brand-new Naruto movie the
last<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.120> that's<00:02:43.390> because<00:02:43.780> Hanabi<00:02:44.230> is<00:02:44.440> going

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
last and that's because Hanabi is going

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.680 
last and that's because Hanabi is going
to<00:02:44.890> be<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.070> central<00:02:45.580> character<00:02:45.880> in<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:46.360> movie

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
to be a central character in that movie

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.410 
to be a central character in that movie
and<00:02:47.290> frankly<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.370> marketing<00:02:48.820> makes<00:02:49.030> sense<00:02:49.270> I

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
and frankly the marketing makes sense I

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.150 
and frankly the marketing makes sense I
think<00:02:49.630> this<00:02:49.750> was<00:02:49.930> a<00:02:49.960> good<00:02:50.200> idea<00:02:50.320> to<00:02:50.620> do<00:02:50.770> this<00:02:50.950> I

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
think this was a good idea to do this I

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.310 
think this was a good idea to do this I
just<00:02:51.610> wish<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.060> animation<00:02:52.720> in<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.930> artwork

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
just wish the animation in the artwork

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.450 
just wish the animation in the artwork
could<00:02:53.530> look<00:02:53.710> a<00:02:53.860> little<00:02:54.010> better

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
could look a little better

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.280 
could look a little better
there<00:02:54.910> are<00:02:55.030> times<00:02:55.300> when<00:02:55.720> they<00:02:55.840> use<00:02:56.080> these

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
there are times when they use these

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.250 
there are times when they use these
flashbacks<00:02:56.860> from<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:57.580> Chunin<00:02:57.970> exam<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:58.630> I

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
flashbacks from the Chunin exam and I

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.960 
flashbacks from the Chunin exam and I
don't<00:02:59.380> know<00:02:59.590> why<00:02:59.890> they<00:03:00.100> don't<00:03:00.280> do<00:03:00.460> this<00:03:00.640> maybe

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
don't know why they don't do this maybe

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.540 
don't know why they don't do this maybe
it's<00:03:01.210> because<00:03:01.360> it's<00:03:01.900> in<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.140> old<00:03:02.350> 4x3<00:03:02.830> format

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
it's because it's in the old 4x3 format

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.550 
it's because it's in the old 4x3 format
but<00:03:04.180> why<00:03:04.420> don't<00:03:04.600> they<00:03:04.690> just<00:03:04.720> reuse<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.530> old

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
but why don't they just reuse the old

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.950 
but why don't they just reuse the old
animation<00:03:06.340> from<00:03:06.730> part<00:03:07.000> one<00:03:07.270> why<00:03:07.540> do<00:03:07.600> they<00:03:07.810> have

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
animation from part one why do they have

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.440 
animation from part one why do they have
to<00:03:07.990> go<00:03:08.200> ahead<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:08.620> reanimate<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.430> because<00:03:10.030> the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
to go ahead and reanimate it because the

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.600 
to go ahead and reanimate it because the
new<00:03:10.630> animation<00:03:11.290> looks<00:03:11.620> way<00:03:12.010> worse<00:03:12.310> than<00:03:12.520> the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
new animation looks way worse than the

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.640 
new animation looks way worse than the
old<00:03:12.760> one<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.600> artwork<00:03:14.020> looks<00:03:14.260> even<00:03:14.620> worse

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
old one and the artwork looks even worse

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.040 
old one and the artwork looks even worse
it's<00:03:15.310> just<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:15.820> doesn't<00:03:16.060> work<00:03:16.540> this<00:03:16.750> is<00:03:16.930> an

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
it's just it doesn't work this is an

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.630 
it's just it doesn't work this is an
episode<00:03:17.530> that's<00:03:18.070> sort<00:03:18.280> of<00:03:18.340> like<00:03:18.400> a

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
episode that's sort of like a

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.729 
episode that's sort of like a
rollercoaster<00:03:19.060> of<00:03:19.510> quality<00:03:20.290> there<00:03:20.470> are<00:03:20.560> times

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
rollercoaster of quality there are times

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:21.900 
rollercoaster of quality there are times
where<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.040> looks<00:03:21.190> really<00:03:21.459> good

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
where it looks really good

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.250 
where it looks really good
and<00:03:22.030> then<00:03:22.360> there<00:03:22.510> are<00:03:22.540> times<00:03:22.810> when<00:03:23.050> it<00:03:23.140> just

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
and then there are times when it just

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.040 
and then there are times when it just
looks<00:03:23.470> kind<00:03:23.709> of<00:03:23.860> okay<00:03:24.550> but<00:03:25.390> still<00:03:25.780> I<00:03:25.840> think

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
looks kind of okay but still I think

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.600 
looks kind of okay but still I think
this<00:03:26.350> was<00:03:26.530> still<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:26.739> pretty<00:03:27.040> good<00:03:27.220> special

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
this was still a pretty good special

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.280 
this was still a pretty good special
that's<00:03:27.760> expanding<00:03:28.330> on<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.480> character<00:03:28.900> that

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
that's expanding on a character that

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.080 
that's expanding on a character that
frankly<00:03:29.680> we<00:03:29.800> just<00:03:30.040> never<00:03:30.220> really<00:03:30.610> get<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.820> see

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
either here or there but still this

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.050 
either here or there but still this
episode<00:04:10.840> was<00:04:11.019> just<00:04:11.230> okay<00:04:11.680> um<00:04:12.010> it<00:04:12.459> was<00:04:12.580> just<00:04:12.640> way

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
too many flashbacks for my taste but

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.250 
too many flashbacks for my taste but
still<00:04:15.820> it<00:04:16.000> is<00:04:16.030> cool<00:04:16.330> that<00:04:16.480> we<00:04:16.570> finally<00:04:16.930> do<00:04:17.080> have

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260

character<00:04:19.269> for<00:04:19.510> Hanabi<00:04:19.959> because<00:04:20.380> she<00:04:21.070> didn't

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
character for Hanabi because she didn't

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.100 
character for Hanabi because she didn't
really<00:04:21.400> have<00:04:21.700> one<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.270> know<00:04:22.390> before<00:04:22.750> she<00:04:22.780> was

basically just always sort of there in

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:25.050 
basically just always sort of there in
the

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.060
