00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.519
 all welcome on the channel my name is 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.559
 Ilyich 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.990
 and I continue a series of stories about thieves 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.520
 famous game universes 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.289
 today we will return to the elder series 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:27.990
 scrolls and talk more about 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:29.970
 device of this world and we will start with 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.250
 the very beginning namely the creation 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.320
 the known universe in the history of gold 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.260
 revealed the birth of the world takes place in 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.850
 the very first era of dawn by the way this 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.450
 the story is very similar to the lord 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.210
 rings 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.160
 but still different from her originally in 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.010
 this world was nothing but chaos 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.350
 which is called auras without a living â€” there were two 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.270
 entities and then and which 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.890
 invaded arbee's from the void which 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.350
 lies generally outside of everything 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.440
 and the interweaving of light and darkness they created 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.510
 the world that is cosmos itself yes sounds a little 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.059
 strange but it will be even more severe 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.700
 Well, what about the house and were delighted 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.070
 from the world but she loved her and home 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.869
 bitterness and decided to leave their world 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.180
 got pregnant but before she could 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.970
 to give birth at home, she came back and told her 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.580
 in love but she said she only loves 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.310
 Well, the lady in a rage brutally beat her 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.070
 she returned fought homely and 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.950
 cast him out of time did not give birth 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.799
 the universe but soon died from wounds anus 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.570
 grieving hid himself in the sun and fell asleep in 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.990
 this time arose and flourished life on 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.360
 12 measures of creation many centuries passed 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.140
 then I managed to get back in time he 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.909
 saw the universe and hated him 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.520
 around the house I swung my sword and smithereens 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.590
 broke all twelve worlds it 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.320
 I woke up again and fought with think 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.170
 long and furious it was a battle but she 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.820
 conquered he threw the body of his brother considering 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.130
 that dead and tried to save 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.770
 the universe has collected the remnants of 12 worlds and 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.410
 having created one of them is not the RM world of Tamriel 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.659
 where is the action of all parts of the game 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.340
 and while he was busy doing this around the house and 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.850
 pierced his chest with one deadly 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.280
 blow 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.869
 brother's anus brother and both of them fell and 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.780
 irrevocably vanished abroad 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.660
 time and hide on the house I have arisen before 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.600

 the stars they are blended blood both arose 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.400
 and the nucleus or the nucleus hence the ability 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.590
 do good and evil and lick them more 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.410
 to earthly affairs than deirdre which 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.310
 had no connection of the creation of the spirit 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.200
 kernels and deydras are called this yes but there is 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.930
 two is yes which is different from its 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.700
 fellow norfin and akatosh then as in 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.720

 oh well 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.020
 in the world did not reign chaos of all inhabitants 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.050
 12 worlds of creation survived only elena 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.560
 fairies and hist el on fairies are the ancestors of people and 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.820
 elves 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.950
 office you are trees organ and originally 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.460
 nervous was a single continent covered 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.190
 by the seas 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.810
 oceans did not exist one 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.760
 big piece of peace and flax fairies 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.950
 transferred to nirn relatively not 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.650
 suffered its inhabitants became ancestors 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.110
 elves radially fairies have protected their 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.520
 borders from external chaos and concealing from 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.820
 all their calm and refuge 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.920
 tried to live as they lived before 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.959
 other flax fairies who arrived on it were 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.760
 scattered over the remnants of broken worlds and 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.280
 for years they were doomed to wander in 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.290
 looking for each other in the end 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.180
 wanderers found the hidden country of old 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.040
 or on fairies and were admired 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.070
 and delighted to see their relatives 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.200
 amid the grandeur of former times 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.330
 fairies wanderers hoped that their heat 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.950
 will take in this peaceful country but old 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.470
 or looked at fairies descended 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.660
 relatives with disgust how else 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.299
 war broke out and swept around 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.370
 old flax nirnu fairies have kept their 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.709
 ancient power and knowledge of the wanderer 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.540
 were more numerous and long 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.120
 the struggle for survival on the nerve made 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.640
 their sturdy and hardy war 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.680
 transformed the look of a nirn as a result of her 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.440
 most of the land was flooded 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.239
 only oceans left 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.170
 several familiar continents 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.280
 tamriel and cover from mora and and where 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.590
 dilapidated on the old kingdom or on 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.510
 fairies became tamriel them remaining 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.109
 wanderers were divided into three others 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.810
 continent many years later or fit 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.320
 April have become measures elves 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.360
 2 underground measures sometimes called 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.669
 dwarves timers 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.669
 changed later they became given 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.910
 measures given by measures of dark or damned 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.610
 elves you measure green or forest 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.189
 elves and measure by elders 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.110
 or high elves 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:46.360
 wines fairies wanderers to other continents 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.740
 became people lords from mora 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.389
 read gordon and and kuda and cs kea kaver 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.840
 cysts stayed away from the war il 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.759
 fairies 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.580
 but most of their realm was also 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:59.889
 destroyed in the war a small part of it 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.779
 preserved on the land of tamriel having formed 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.319
 black swamp I but most of the country 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:08.139
 fist of disappeared under the waters of the seas at the end 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:10.210
 After all, people returned to Tamriel first 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.870
 there were nords led by the legendary of 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.120
 gram of morom 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.370
 they settled along the north coast 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.460
 in the days leading up 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.900
 the appearance of the first written chronicles 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.409
 the first chronicle was recorded king 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.370
 Harald 13 if not from grammar and so 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:29.349
 ended the mythical r.a. 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.169
 Remember I said that the history of the universe 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:34.300
 similar to the lord of the rings as an example 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.729
 Well, and at home and personify 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.699
 creators which is very similar to the iluvatar era 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:42.639
 and he is the lord because of whom he was created 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.650
 mortal plan is reminiscent of melkor and even in 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:48.009
 The whole narrative of both stories is very 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.589
 similar in general is just a generalization 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.339
 the history of the world behind the same 

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:53.639
 affordable 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:56.199
 simple enough language 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.509
 Myths of each of the Nirna peoples 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:00.159
 differ on monolith just 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:02.289
 tells us that everyone 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:05.080
 cultures alone are involved in the creation of the world 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:07.509
 and the same entities a lot was 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.599
 omitted and such unsaid moments i 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:12.639
 I will try to explain in the video and on the future 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.830
 This all do not forget to offer their 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.949
 topics for new videos and debate in 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.370
 the comments you were Ilyich and to new 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:20.370
 meeting
