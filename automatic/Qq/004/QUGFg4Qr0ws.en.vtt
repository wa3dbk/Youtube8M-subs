here is making a quick arctic pine guide
and<00:00:15.590> let's<00:00:16.590> get<00:00:16.770> started<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.210> levels<00:00:18.779> that

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
and let's get started so the levels that

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.349 
and let's get started so the levels that
you<00:00:18.930> are<00:00:19.140> going<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.500> need<00:00:19.650> for<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.010> hour<00:00:20.359> 54

wood cutting and 42 fire-making what you
want<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.080> do<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.470> head<00:00:25.740> over<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:26.220> me<00:00:26.580> it's<00:00:26.699> not

want to do is head over to me it's not
the<00:00:27.570> ideal<00:00:27.720> location<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.470> right<00:00:28.500> above<00:00:29.039> the

patch of five Arctic pine trees and then

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
and if you do this ideally you'll be AFK

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.560 
and if you do this ideally you'll be AFK
most<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> time<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:45.300> should<00:00:45.539> be

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
most of the time and you should be

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.720 
most of the time and you should be
hopefully<00:00:46.530> high<00:00:46.680> enough<00:00:46.950> level<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
hopefully high enough level that the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.340 
hopefully high enough level that the
trolls<00:00:48.030> around<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.450> don't<00:00:48.660> attack<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.140> if

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
trolls around you don't attack you if

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.590 
trolls around you don't attack you if
your<00:00:49.950> scalar<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.969> method<00:00:51.300> isn't<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
your scalar the this method isn't the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.200 
your scalar the this method isn't the
best<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.190> there<00:00:53.190> are<00:00:53.309> some<00:00:53.520> trees<00:00:53.940> around

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
best for you there are some trees around

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.250 
best for you there are some trees around
the<00:00:55.140> other<00:00:55.649> side<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:56.640> not<00:00:56.699> as<00:00:57.239> many<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.870> i'm

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
the other side but not as many and i'm

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.310 
the other side but not as many and i'm
i'm<00:00:58.920> not<00:00:59.129> sure<00:00:59.370> if<00:00:59.670> you<00:01:00.210> would<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.690> good

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
i'm not sure if you would have a good

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.139 
i'm not sure if you would have a good
enough<00:01:01.410> time<00:01:01.649> waiting<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.670> respawn<00:01:02.969> time

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
enough time waiting for the respawn time

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.340 
enough time waiting for the respawn time
on<00:01:03.449> Arctic<00:01:04.110> pines<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.339> should<00:01:05.519> still<00:01:05.549> work

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
on Arctic pines but it should still work

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.359 
on Arctic pines but it should still work
and<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.530> once<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> full<00:01:08.189> inventory

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
and then once you have a full inventory

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.640 
and then once you have a full inventory
how<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:08.970> drop<00:01:09.330> them<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.840> if<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
how you drop them is if you have a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.160 
how you drop them is if you have a
tinderbox<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.670> your<00:01:11.790> tool<00:01:11.970> belt<00:01:12.090> all<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:13.049> have

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
tinderbox in your tool belt all you have

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.620 
tinderbox in your tool belt all you have
to<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.799> run<00:01:14.490> your<00:01:14.520> mouse<00:01:14.909> across<00:01:15.210> them<00:01:15.450> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
to do is run your mouse across them and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.690 
to do is run your mouse across them and
click<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:15.990> fast<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.920> then<00:01:17.009> that

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
click as fast as you can and then that

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.340 
click as fast as you can and then that
will<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:18.090> rid<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.299> all<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.570> them<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.170> can

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
will get rid of all of them and you can

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.859 
will get rid of all of them and you can
go<00:01:19.439> back<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.619> start<00:01:19.950> cutting<00:01:20.130> trees<00:01:20.430> again

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
go back and start cutting trees again

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.270 
go back and start cutting trees again
the<00:01:21.869> reason<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.290> works<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.799> you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the reason that this works is that you

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.030 
the reason that this works is that you
can't<00:01:23.610> cut<00:01:23.939> an<00:01:24.030> Arctic<00:01:24.299> pine<00:01:24.540> with<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> knife<00:01:25.170> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
can't cut an Arctic pine with a knife to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.550 
can't cut an Arctic pine with a knife to
such<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> bow<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.960> knife<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.320> your<00:01:28.380> tool

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
such a bow so the knife in your tool

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.069 
such a bow so the knife in your tool
belt<00:01:28.710> will<00:01:29.009> actually<00:01:29.340> not<00:01:29.579> matter<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.150> you

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
belt will actually not matter and you

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.740 
belt will actually not matter and you
can<00:01:31.229> just<00:01:31.350> run<00:01:31.560> through<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.860> pretty<00:01:32.490> quick

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
can just run through this pretty quick

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.260 
can just run through this pretty quick
so<00:01:33.750> if<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.020> saw<00:01:34.259> my<00:01:34.880> we're<00:01:35.880> cutting<00:01:36.119> guide

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
so if you saw my we're cutting guide

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.270 
so if you saw my we're cutting guide
you're<00:01:37.020> going<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.320> know<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.770> said<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
you're going to know that I said the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.380 
you're going to know that I said the
same<00:01:38.400> thing<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.180> last<00:01:39.720> log<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:41.119> this<00:01:42.119> one

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
same thing for the last log and this one

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.300 
same thing for the last log and this one
I<00:01:42.659> know<00:01:42.720> for<00:01:43.140> sure<00:01:43.170> actually<00:01:43.590> works<00:01:44.009> I'm

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
I know for sure actually works I'm

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.480 
I know for sure actually works I'm
pretty<00:01:44.759> sure<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> last<00:01:45.119> one<00:01:45.270> works<00:01:45.509> too<00:01:45.659> but

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
pretty sure the last one works too but

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.740 
pretty sure the last one works too but
this<00:01:47.490> one<00:01:47.670> for<00:01:47.820> sure<00:01:47.880> works<00:01:48.299> if<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.630> were

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
this one for sure works if you were

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.880 
this one for sure works if you were
wondering<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:51.090> all<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.930> all<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.290> method<00:01:52.710> is
