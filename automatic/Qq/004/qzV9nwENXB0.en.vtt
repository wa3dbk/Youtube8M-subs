knitted Afghans you or any our knitted
project<00:02:59.360> you<00:02:59.960> would<00:03:00.140> hold<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:01.090> multiple

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
project you would hold the multiple

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.170 
project you would hold the multiple
strands<00:03:02.480> together<00:03:02.840> as<00:03:03.290> one<00:03:03.800> strand<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:04.940> this

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
strands together as one strand so this

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.830 
strands together as one strand so this
is<00:03:05.360> four<00:03:05.750> strands<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:08.030> would<00:03:08.180> just<00:03:08.450> hold

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
is four strands and you would just hold

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.190 
is four strands and you would just hold
them<00:03:09.140> all<00:03:09.560> together<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.430> then<00:03:11.180> make<00:03:11.750> a<00:03:11.780> loop

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
them all together and then make a loop

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.220 
them all together and then make a loop
like<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:13.460> then<00:03:14.060> if<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.630> open<00:03:14.660> that<00:03:14.990> loop

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
like this and then if you open that loop

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.470 
like this and then if you open that loop
up<00:03:15.500> you'll<00:03:15.800> see<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:16.040> top<00:03:16.400> strand<00:03:16.880> and<00:03:17.090> that

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
up you'll see a top strand and that

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.740 
up you'll see a top strand and that
strand<00:03:18.050> you<00:03:18.830> just<00:03:19.040> fold<00:03:19.370> over<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:20.060> back<00:03:20.330> and

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
strand you just fold over the back and

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.380 
strand you just fold over the back and
then<00:03:20.990> stick<00:03:21.560> your<00:03:21.740> thumb<00:03:22.040> in<00:03:22.070> or<00:03:22.640> finger<00:03:23.150> or

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
then stick your thumb in or finger or

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.720 
then stick your thumb in or finger or
whatever<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:24.020> just<00:03:24.500> pull<00:03:24.830> that<00:03:24.860> back<00:03:25.340> strand

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
whatever and just pull that back strand

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.480 
whatever and just pull that back strand
forward<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.810> you'll<00:03:27.320> notice<00:03:27.710> there's<00:03:28.040> a<00:03:28.100> knot

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
forward and you'll notice there's a knot

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.780 
forward and you'll notice there's a knot
side<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.420> there's<00:03:29.600> a<00:03:29.660> slip<00:03:30.080> side<00:03:30.380> and<00:03:30.830> you

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
the slip side and make it big enough to

the slip side and make it big enough to
go<00:03:41.750> on<00:03:41.990> your<00:03:42.110> hand<00:03:42.380> like<00:03:42.680> that<00:03:42.710> and<00:03:45.040> for<00:03:46.040> an

go on your hand like that and for an

go on your hand like that and for an
Afghan<00:03:47.080> that<00:03:48.080> has<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.770> lot<00:03:49.130> of<00:03:49.310> loops<00:03:49.520> like<00:03:49.820> 30

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
Afghan that has a lot of loops like 30

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.780 
Afghan that has a lot of loops like 30
loops<00:03:50.810> around<00:03:51.410> that<00:03:51.650> many<00:03:51.950> you're<00:03:52.610> going<00:03:52.730> to

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
loops around that many you're going to

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.700 
loops around that many you're going to
have<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.090> have<00:03:53.300> this<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.720> little<00:03:54.080> bit<00:03:54.200> looser

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
have to have this a little bit looser

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.190 
have to have this a little bit looser
but<00:03:55.160> for<00:03:55.430> scarves<00:03:55.850> that<00:03:56.300> maybe<00:03:56.660> only<00:03:56.990> have

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
but for scarves that maybe only have

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.280 
but for scarves that maybe only have
nine<00:03:57.500> cast<00:03:57.980> on<00:03:58.220> stitches<00:03:58.580> you<00:03:59.480> can<00:03:59.510> make<00:03:59.930> this

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
nine cast on stitches you can make this

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.760 
nine cast on stitches you can make this
a<00:04:00.770> little<00:04:01.160> bit<00:04:01.400> tighter<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:02.210> this<00:04:02.960> counts<00:04:03.410> as

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
a little bit tighter and this counts as

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.690 
a little bit tighter and this counts as
your<00:04:03.830> first<00:04:04.220> stitch<00:04:04.910> when<00:04:05.660> you're<00:04:05.810> casting<00:04:06.050> on

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
your first stitch when you're casting on

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.150 
your first stitch when you're casting on
okay<00:04:07.700> so<00:04:07.760> let's<00:04:08.510> say<00:04:08.840> instead<00:04:09.470> of<00:04:09.770> four

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
okay so let's say instead of four

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.810 
okay so let's say instead of four
strands<00:04:11.000> I'm<00:04:11.900> making<00:04:12.500> a<00:04:12.590> big<00:04:12.740> Afghan<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.700> I

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
strands I'm making a big Afghan and I

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.200 
strands I'm making a big Afghan and I
have<00:04:14.150> eight<00:04:14.390> strands<00:04:15.080> like<00:04:15.350> this<00:04:15.910> so<00:04:16.910> it's<00:04:17.120> the

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:17.210 
have eight strands like this so it's the

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.599 
have eight strands like this so it's the
same<00:04:17.450> thing<00:04:17.840> I'm<00:04:18.470> going<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:18.739> hold<00:04:18.950> all<00:04:19.250> eight

strands<00:04:20.090> together<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:21.430> I'm<00:04:22.430> going<00:04:22.730> to

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
strands together and I'm going to

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.060 
strands together and I'm going to
measure<00:04:23.030> off<00:04:23.210> from<00:04:23.720> my<00:04:23.870> long<00:04:24.110> tail<00:04:24.470> for<00:04:24.800> my

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
measure off from my long tail for my

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
cast on but I'm gonna make that loop at

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.140 
cast on but I'm gonna make that loop at
the<00:04:28.700> yeah<00:04:29.530> whatever<00:04:30.530> yardage<00:04:31.370> mark<00:04:31.670> I<00:04:31.850> need

strands now or one strand so I make the

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.780 
strands now or one strand so I make the
loop<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.780> top<00:04:42.050> strand<00:04:42.500> folds<00:04:43.220> over<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.550> back

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
loop the top strand folds over the back

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.150 
loop the top strand folds over the back
and<00:04:44.300> then<00:04:45.020> it<00:04:45.170> you<00:04:45.350> want<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:45.740> bring<00:04:45.980> that

and then it you want to bring that
through<00:04:46.550> not<00:04:46.790> all<00:04:47.030> the<00:04:47.180> way<00:04:47.300> through<00:04:47.660> but<00:04:47.930> just
