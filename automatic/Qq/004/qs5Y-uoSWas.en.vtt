00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:14.589 
reasons for that number one is the

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.250 
reasons for that number one is the
behavioral<00:00:15.219> side<00:00:15.429> number<00:00:15.730> one<00:00:15.910> russell<00:00:16.720> 2000

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.260 
behavioral side number one russell 2000

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.050 
behavioral side number one russell 2000
has<00:00:17.380> a<00:00:17.410> net<00:00:17.770> short<00:00:18.070> position<00:00:18.130> in<00:00:18.609> futures<00:00:18.910> and

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
the Russell in short the SP okay if

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.299 
the Russell in short the SP okay if
you're<00:00:46.930> just<00:00:47.079> purely<00:00:47.410> going<00:00:47.859> against<00:00:48.219> the

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
you're just purely going against the

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.490 
you're just purely going against the
crowd<00:00:48.520> which<00:00:48.760> is<00:00:48.879> a<00:00:48.910> very<00:00:49.149> good<00:00:49.510> way<00:00:49.690> not<00:00:50.320> all

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
crowd which is a very good way not all

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.020 
crowd which is a very good way not all
the<00:00:50.530> time<00:00:50.829> but<00:00:50.890> most<00:00:51.219> of<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:51.430> time<00:00:51.609> to<00:00:51.789> trade

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
the time but most of the time to trade

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.910 
the time but most of the time to trade
macro<00:00:52.480> so<00:00:52.660> that<00:00:52.780> would<00:00:52.899> be<00:00:52.930> reason<00:00:53.590> number<00:00:53.680> one

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
macro so that would be reason number one

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.770 
macro so that would be reason number one
reason<00:00:54.579> number<00:00:54.699> two<00:00:54.820> is<00:00:55.090> that<00:00:55.210> nobody<00:00:55.359> owns<00:00:55.690> a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
reason number two is that nobody owns a

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.380 
reason number two is that nobody owns a
Russell<00:00:56.109> because<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.550> Russell<00:00:57.879> has<00:00:58.030> sucked

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
Russell because the Russell has sucked

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.790 
Russell because the Russell has sucked
win<00:00:58.600> for<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:58.989> full<00:00:59.230> year<00:00:59.260> it<00:00:59.530> hasn't<00:00:59.769> done

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
win for a full year it hasn't done

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.259 
win for a full year it hasn't done
absolutely<00:01:00.100> it's<00:01:00.609> done<00:01:00.789> absolutely<00:01:00.969> nothing

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
absolutely it's done absolutely nothing

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.150 
absolutely it's done absolutely nothing
I<00:01:01.690> mean<00:01:01.809> you<00:01:01.929> could<00:01:02.050> have<00:01:02.199> bought<00:01:02.350> all<00:01:02.800> the

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
I mean you could have bought all the

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.130 
I mean you could have bought all the
Russell<00:01:03.519> that<00:01:03.640> you<00:01:03.760> wanted<00:01:04.120> on<00:01:04.330> January<00:01:05.019> the

08 I mean so at the end of the day
that's<00:01:12.310> I<00:01:12.700> don't<00:01:12.939> know<00:01:13.150> why<00:01:13.270> I<00:01:13.330> just<00:01:13.509> put<00:01:13.689> 1208

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
that's I don't know why I just put 1208

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.140 
that's I don't know why I just put 1208
into<00:01:14.409> my<00:01:14.530> system<00:01:14.860> but<00:01:15.100> that<00:01:15.310> is<00:01:15.490> not<00:01:15.670> going<00:01:16.060> to

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
into my system but that is not going to

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.810 
into my system but that is not going to
register<00:01:16.630> anything<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:17.740> point<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:18.310> final

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
register anything the point the final

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.030 
register anything the point the final
point<00:01:19.030> is<00:01:19.150> that<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.420> russell<00:01:19.689> 2000<00:01:20.229> is<00:01:20.350> a<00:01:20.650> play

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040

and you know it sucks I mean I don't

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.160 
and you know it sucks I mean I don't
know<00:01:45.670> why<00:01:45.820> you'd<00:01:46.030> say<00:01:46.270> that<00:01:46.299> stocks<00:01:46.780> have<00:01:47.020> done

well when the real thing that's done

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.219 
well when the real thing that's done
well<00:01:48.610> is<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:48.850> long<00:01:49.030> bond<00:01:49.210> but<00:01:49.750> again<00:01:50.049> I'm

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
well is the long bond but again I'm

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.539 
well is the long bond but again I'm
going<00:01:50.409> off<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.590> bit<00:01:50.829> on<00:01:50.920> it<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.159> third<00:01:51.340> row
