hey<00:00:11.340> guys<00:00:11.550> in<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.300> video<00:00:12.540> I'm<00:00:12.809> just<00:00:12.870> gonna<00:00:13.049> be

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
hey guys in this video I'm just gonna be

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.829 
hey guys in this video I'm just gonna be
unboxing<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.830> new<00:00:13.980> v-cube<00:00:14.190> 6<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:15.150> let's<00:00:15.750> get

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
unboxing the new v-cube 6 so let's get

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:53.079 
unboxing the new v-cube 6 so let's get
to<00:00:15.990> it

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.290 

so<00:00:54.089> it<00:00:54.180> looks<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.449> we've<00:00:55.110> got<00:00:56.000> both<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
so it looks like we've got both of the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.540 
so it looks like we've got both of the
new<00:00:57.449> pillowed<00:00:57.989> v-cube<00:00:58.379> sixes<00:00:58.769> and<00:00:59.040> some<00:00:59.309> extra

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
new pillowed v-cube sixes and some extra

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.290 
new pillowed v-cube sixes and some extra
stickers<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.120> got<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.510> other<00:01:00.690> cubes<00:01:01.250> so

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
stickers that I got for other cubes so

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.329 
stickers that I got for other cubes so
the<00:01:03.300> black<00:01:03.629> ones<00:01:03.839> for<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.019> friend<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.440> let's

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the black ones for a friend but let's

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:17.700 
the black ones for a friend but let's
see<00:01:05.460> how<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.580> white<00:01:05.759> one<00:01:05.940> turns<00:01:06.240> in

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.280 

Wow<00:01:18.710> I'm<00:01:18.950> actually<00:01:19.130> pretty<00:01:19.370> impressed<00:01:19.550> I<00:01:20.060> mean

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
Wow I'm actually pretty impressed I mean

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.990 
Wow I'm actually pretty impressed I mean
compared<00:01:21.290> to<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.440> old<00:01:21.590> eq6<00:01:22.160> this<00:01:22.670> sounds<00:01:22.910> like

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
compared to the old eq6 this sounds like

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:38.380 
compared to the old eq6 this sounds like
a<00:01:23.030> dream<00:01:36.820> still<00:01:37.820> could<00:01:37.970> use<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.120> little<00:01:38.270> bit<00:01:38.330> of

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
a dream still could use a little bit of

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.270 
a dream still could use a little bit of
work<00:01:38.600> let<00:01:39.380> me<00:01:39.470> go<00:01:39.560> play<00:01:39.710> that<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:39.920> little<00:01:40.160> bit

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
work let me go play that that little bit

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.910 
work let me go play that that little bit
and<00:01:40.430> then<00:01:40.670> I'll<00:01:41.030> come<00:01:41.300> back<00:01:41.330> and<00:01:41.750> finish<00:01:42.710> up

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
and then I'll come back and finish up

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.520 
and then I'll come back and finish up
the<00:01:43.070> review<00:01:45.730> so<00:01:46.730> I<00:01:46.760> solved<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.270> cube<00:01:47.570> maybe<00:01:47.750> 15

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
the review so I solved the cube maybe 15

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.040 
the review so I solved the cube maybe 15
or<00:01:48.650> 20<00:01:48.890> times<00:01:49.100> now<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.550> I<00:01:50.270> have<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.510> say<00:01:50.720> that

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
or 20 times now and I have to say that

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.870 
or 20 times now and I have to say that
I'm<00:01:51.140> very<00:01:51.170> very<00:01:51.800> impressed<00:01:52.220> with<00:01:52.700> this

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
I'm very very impressed with this

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.460 
I'm very very impressed with this
product<00:01:53.650> it<00:01:54.650> just<00:01:54.830> turned<00:01:55.040> so<00:01:55.460> smooth<00:01:55.910> and

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
product it just turned so smooth and

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.780 
product it just turned so smooth and
what<00:01:57.470> really<00:01:57.650> distinguishes<00:01:58.070> it<00:01:58.490> from<00:01:58.520> the

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
what really distinguishes it from the

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.420 
what really distinguishes it from the
previous<00:01:58.970> vq<00:01:59.570> 6<00:01:59.810> is<00:02:00.080> that<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:00.380> never<00:02:00.680> pops

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
previous vq 6 is that it never pops

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.090 
previous vq 6 is that it never pops
I<00:02:01.460> even<00:02:02.270> tried<00:02:02.479> forcing<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:03.170> pop<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:03.740> I<00:02:03.920> can

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
I even tried forcing it to pop and I can

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.100 
I even tried forcing it to pop and I can
only<00:02:04.220> pop<00:02:04.550> just<00:02:05.150> like<00:02:05.360> one<00:02:05.600> of<00:02:05.690> these<00:02:05.810> pieces

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
only pop just like one of these pieces

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.070 
only pop just like one of these pieces
out<00:02:06.470> I<00:02:06.770> couldn't<00:02:07.610> really<00:02:07.970> cause<00:02:08.420> any<00:02:08.630> serious

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
out I couldn't really cause any serious

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.340 
out I couldn't really cause any serious
damage<00:02:09.229> that<00:02:09.679> was<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:10.130> huge<00:02:10.790> improvement<00:02:11.350> now

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
damage that was a huge improvement now

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.510 
damage that was a huge improvement now
as<00:02:12.830> a<00:02:13.010> size<00:02:13.280> comparison<00:02:14.080> here's<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.459> vq5

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
as a size comparison here's a vq5

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.290 
as a size comparison here's a vq5
compared<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.540> new<00:02:18.200> 6x6<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:22.000> here's<00:02:23.000> the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
compared to the new 6x6 and here's the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:31.570 
compared to the new 6x6 and here's the
original<00:02:24.170> v-cube<00:02:24.680> 7<00:02:30.160> here's<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.250> quick<00:02:31.430> look

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
original v-cube 7 here's the quick look

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.940 
original v-cube 7 here's the quick look
at<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.880> mechanism<00:02:32.780> as<00:02:33.380> you<00:02:33.500> can<00:02:33.620> probably<00:02:33.770> see

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
at the mechanism as you can probably see

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.830 
at the mechanism as you can probably see
it's<00:02:34.340> very<00:02:34.550> similar<00:02:34.850> to<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.120> v-cube<00:02:35.450> 8<00:02:35.600> and

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
it's very similar to the v-cube 8 and

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.780 
it's very similar to the v-cube 8 and
really<00:02:36.830> there's<00:02:36.980> not<00:02:37.040> much<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.340> say<00:02:37.489> about<00:02:37.520> it

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
really there's not much to say about it

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.580 
really there's not much to say about it
because<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.270> performs<00:02:38.660> flawlessly<00:02:39.260> in<00:02:39.440> my

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
because it performs flawlessly in my

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.160 
because it performs flawlessly in my
opinion<00:02:40.010> now<00:02:40.850> what<00:02:41.360> I<00:02:41.390> think<00:02:41.480> is<00:02:41.750> probably<00:02:41.959> the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
opinion now what I think is probably the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.530 
opinion now what I think is probably the
best<00:02:42.230> change<00:02:42.739> they've<00:02:42.950> made<00:02:43.160> is<00:02:43.370> with<00:02:44.269> these

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
best change they've made is with these

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.170 
best change they've made is with these
centerpieces<00:02:45.580> here's<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.670> piece<00:02:46.910> from<00:02:47.030> the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
centerpieces here's a piece from the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.259 
centerpieces here's a piece from the
v-cube<00:02:47.570> 8<00:02:47.750> or<00:02:48.050> vq<00:02:48.410> 7<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:49.160> these<00:02:49.820> would<00:02:49.910> pop<00:02:50.120> out

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
v-cube 8 or vq 7 and these would pop out

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.920 
v-cube 8 or vq 7 and these would pop out
all<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.690> time<00:02:50.900> but<00:02:51.680> with<00:02:52.070> these<00:02:52.250> new<00:02:52.930> center

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
all the time but with these new center

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.890 
all the time but with these new center
pieces<00:02:54.140> in<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.680> v-cube<00:02:55.040> 6<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:56.000> never<00:02:56.330> pops<00:02:56.630> out

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
pieces in the v-cube 6 it never pops out

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.110 
pieces in the v-cube 6 it never pops out
so<00:02:57.739> that's<00:02:58.130> really<00:02:58.310> encouraging<00:02:58.970> especially

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
so that's really encouraging especially

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.320 
so that's really encouraging especially
considering<00:02:59.870> how<00:02:59.959> poor<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.970> previous

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
considering how poor the previous

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.479 
considering how poor the previous
display<00:03:02.570> 6<00:03:02.780> was<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.290> honestly<00:03:04.130> if<00:03:04.250> they<00:03:04.340> can

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
display 6 was and honestly if they can

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.670 
display 6 was and honestly if they can
make<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.700> cubic<00:03:05.209> version<00:03:05.600> that's<00:03:06.170> as<00:03:06.380> good<00:03:06.530> as

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
make a cubic version that's as good as

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.570 
make a cubic version that's as good as
this<00:03:06.860> pillowed<00:03:07.720> 6x6<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:09.160> honestly<00:03:10.160> could<00:03:10.370> see

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
this pillowed 6x6 I honestly could see

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.840 
this pillowed 6x6 I honestly could see
them<00:03:11.050> becoming<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.530> go-to<00:03:12.680> cube<00:03:13.220> for<00:03:13.489> speed

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
them becoming the go-to cube for speed

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.270 
them becoming the go-to cube for speed
cubers<00:03:14.090> as<00:03:14.269> a<00:03:14.300> 6x6<00:03:14.690> while<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.709> was<00:03:15.860> reassembling

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
cubers as a 6x6 while I was reassembling

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.530 
cubers as a 6x6 while I was reassembling
the<00:03:16.459> cube<00:03:16.670> I<00:03:16.790> figured<00:03:17.120> I'd<00:03:17.209> point<00:03:17.420> out

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.080 
the cube I figured I'd point out
something<00:03:17.780> that<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:18.019> noticed<00:03:18.430> these<00:03:19.430> are<00:03:19.910> the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
something that I noticed these are the

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.580 
something that I noticed these are the
center<00:03:20.330> pieces<00:03:20.540> that<00:03:20.930> would<00:03:21.020> typically<00:03:21.319> pop

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
center pieces that would typically pop

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.000 
center pieces that would typically pop
out<00:03:21.800> in<00:03:22.060> older<00:03:23.060> V<00:03:23.240> cubes<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.810> as<00:03:24.500> you<00:03:24.650> can<00:03:24.770> see

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
out in older V cubes and as you can see

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.630 
out in older V cubes and as you can see
in<00:03:25.280> this

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
in this

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.300 
in this
new<00:03:25.819> model<00:03:26.180> these<00:03:27.140> are<00:03:27.319> these<00:03:27.440> edge<00:03:28.010> pieces

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
new model these are these edge pieces

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.070 
new model these are these edge pieces
and<00:03:28.670> they<00:03:28.850> actually<00:03:28.970> hook<00:03:29.270> inside<00:03:29.720> this<00:03:29.900> inner

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
and they actually hook inside this inner

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.199 
and they actually hook inside this inner
core<00:03:30.440> so<00:03:31.130> it's<00:03:31.280> very<00:03:31.430> difficult<00:03:31.730> for<00:03:32.060> them<00:03:32.180> to

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
core so it's very difficult for them to

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.090 
core so it's very difficult for them to
come<00:03:32.390> out<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:32.810> I've<00:03:33.380> already<00:03:33.500> seen<00:03:33.770> that<00:03:33.830> with

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
come out and I've already seen that with

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:45.240 
come out and I've already seen that with
a<00:03:34.160> few<00:03:34.400> solves<00:03:34.730> that<00:03:34.790> I've<00:03:34.940> done

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.310
