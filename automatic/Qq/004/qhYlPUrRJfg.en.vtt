 but hey it makes you happy to be there 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:33.310
 with her and her guards did that 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.930
 of course it's all hip events 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.180
 we have so much hop on paris 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.980
 that it is necessary to maintain them 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.690
 more possible and so show this 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.770
 and then here is a good event it 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.910
 are not a small part 2 that come 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.740
 come and even more we allow it 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.180
 to show us that there are people who 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.560
 leave everywhere but their 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.320
 apps we can rest assured you do not know I 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.240
 am ephemeral music and again 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.730
 it's good to become a souvenir of this kind 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.970
 of event in us a little bit of down 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.350
 from your album there comes an album 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.070
 I worked on during 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.290
 the year 2012 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.730
 I told myself this price normally the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.000
 head to the concepts level these cases there 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.890
 it was important for me to 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.900
 to bring back something new to 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.190
 level of my universe you in any case me 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.070
 do more discover to people so I have 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.210
 taken no featuring france is so at 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.070
 loss because I feel it was 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.970
 time that I affirm my universe 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.780
 for every year they could surrender 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.650
 account what is the case this 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.320
 they listen when you know when you 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.450
 knew that actually ok ok ok 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.250
 but when you tell us no featuring 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.160
 French so he must surely have some 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.770
 foreign featurings is one 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.170
 small a small taste of children 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.940
 are waiting for the release of a hockey agreement 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.460
 and give me a little peton 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.980
 your point of view on everything on the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.230
 french rap in itself the hip hop what 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.940
 ie if you see that there is a 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.200
 some evolution or not at all 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.160
 I think she has some 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.870
 evolution but it's an evolution 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.490
 logic is that the 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.810
 degeneration that which succeed each other 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.330
 from each and bring back a new 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.460
 dredge and that's the rap as you say 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.750
 it's not a fnr music so in 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.340
 function of new arrivals time this 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.270
 what he means is it's like 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.410
 fruit for me killer means 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.370
 every season there are already new 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.330
 fruits but in the end it's always 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.550
 the same things you mean more 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.450
 these are the ones for me europe lille en 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.980
 perpetual evolution 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.420
 which means right now when I 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.619
 look at the same temptation all around you 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.360
 there is more and more rap a little 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.270
 everywhere it's the number one music of 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.890
 young salmon intelligent music m 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.060
 to have fun why so I was 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.680
 I think if the full-fledged disk 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.480
 then we must not forget that by the 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.680
 sample culture and that's the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.160
 possibility to synthesize all 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.840
 other music 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.740
 it means that even for me when he 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.700
 are there people who go on dollar to 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.780
 oussouye what's it all the same 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.040
 okay ok ok now who 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.230
 is well planted in the game that is 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.690
 that you can pass as a message 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.360
 to little ones to new kids who raps 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.620
 who come click on it not well at 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.060
 Street scope Guénot my guy who wants 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.430
 say I took out a mixtape that at least 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.530
 that it is for me for you the dream for 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.120
 I was pretty much interested what is 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.040
 well you must not burn the steps 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.440
 I arrive with an album is also there 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.480
 there is to say that I start to 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.739
 planting a roof in the games and 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.070
 careers that are defined 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.660
 bombs 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.640
 the advice I would give to young people 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.069
 it can be a pleasure 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.330
 do not use these barracks it demonstrates 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.310
 sacrifices in the work setting 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.600
 as any way but final 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.470
 do not think that's what's going to 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.569
 to leave the neighborhood vocable the passion 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.580
 before they agree they are happy 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.110
 ok but after the release of the album ya 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.660
 two projects coming in or of course there 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.920
 is another and so knew immediately 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.390
 resist for buying a cake in 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.220
 explosiveness will be built me ​​I'm going 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.600
 continue playing with the youth post 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.090
 history since there are few people who 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.590
 know that sadek that's real name is 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.110
 that for me john williams and that's 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.660
 like an alter ego like 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.080
 eminem skin failing come and so that's it 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.190
