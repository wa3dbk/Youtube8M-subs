00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.869 
point of view and came to me for help
and<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:41.719> rather<00:00:42.719> than<00:00:43.020> typing<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.800> out<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.280> you

so i get the the extra clip size the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.460 
so i get the the extra clip size the
extra<00:01:23.610> ammo<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.030> start<00:01:24.420> as<00:01:24.600> well<00:01:24.930> as<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
extra ammo to start as well as the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.830 
extra ammo to start as well as the
increased<00:01:26.009> movement<00:01:26.310> speed<00:01:26.610> when<00:01:27.090> i'm<00:01:27.210> aiming

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
increased movement speed when i'm aiming

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.350 
increased movement speed when i'm aiming
down<00:01:27.990> site<00:01:28.670> reason<00:01:29.670> i<00:01:29.759> don't<00:01:29.820> use<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> silencer

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
down site reason i don't use a silencer

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.539 
down site reason i don't use a silencer
is<00:01:30.810> because<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.350> takes<00:01:31.590> off<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> lot<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
is because it takes off a lot of the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.999 
is because it takes off a lot of the

doesn't<00:05:45.990> want<00:05:46.140> him<00:05:46.320> to<00:05:46.380> come<00:05:46.710> after<00:05:47.040> you<00:05:47.160> she

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
doesn't want him to come after you she

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.270 
doesn't want him to come after you she
thinks<00:05:48.330> maybe<00:05:48.570> that<00:05:48.900> that<00:05:49.260> this<00:05:49.530> threat<00:05:50.010> he's
