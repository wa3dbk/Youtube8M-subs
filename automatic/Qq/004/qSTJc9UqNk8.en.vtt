how's<00:03:16.099> that<00:03:16.310> doing<00:03:16.790> that<00:03:16.910> so<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:18.170> ps4<00:03:18.560> has<00:03:18.830> its

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
how's that doing that so the ps4 has its

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.420 
how's that doing that so the ps4 has its
own<00:03:19.280> Wi-Fi<00:03:19.720> capability<00:03:20.720> so<00:03:20.900> you<00:03:21.020> just<00:03:21.430> touch

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430

own Wi-Fi capability so you just touch
you<00:03:22.670> or<00:03:22.760> not<00:03:23.000> make<00:03:23.870> them<00:03:24.020> communicate

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.069 

and<00:03:28.079> so<00:03:28.290> this<00:03:28.409> is<00:03:28.590> an<00:03:28.709> app<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:28.890> you<00:03:29.159> download
