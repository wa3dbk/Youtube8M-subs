00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
distance between the band band and it's

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.490 
distance between the band band and it's

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
potential in these ones but it's gonna

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.540 
potential in these ones but it's gonna
be<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.440> hard<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.680> actually<00:02:47.890> create<00:02:48.310> any<00:02:48.430> kind

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
be so hard to actually create any kind

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.010 
be so hard to actually create any kind
of<00:02:48.670> killer<00:02:48.850> so<00:02:49.180> this<00:02:49.330> is<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.510> first<00:02:49.720> time<00:02:49.870> you

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
of killer so this is the first time you

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.270 
of killer so this is the first time you
guys<00:02:50.170> at<00:02:50.350> home<00:02:50.470> have<00:02:50.650> seen<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.950> magma<00:02:51.250> chamber

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
guys at home have seen the magma chamber

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.070 
guys at home have seen the magma chamber
and<00:02:51.640> as<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:51.880> can<00:02:52.030> see<00:02:52.060> it's<00:02:52.420> it's<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.750> pretty

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
and as you can see it's it's a pretty

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.780 
and as you can see it's it's a pretty
short<00:02:53.410> map<00:02:53.680> as<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.070> would<00:02:54.190> expect<00:02:54.310> it's<00:02:54.700> a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
short map as you would expect it's a

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.550 
short map as you would expect it's a
setup<00:02:55.030> for<00:02:55.210> a<00:02:55.270> straight<00:02:55.570> dueling<00:02:56.050> map<00:02:56.260> it's

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
setup for a straight dueling map it's

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.170 
setup for a straight dueling map it's
actually<00:02:56.680> quicker<00:02:57.070> to<00:02:57.250> walk<00:02:57.280> back<00:02:57.820> to<00:02:58.000> base

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
actually quicker to walk back to base

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.970 
actually quicker to walk back to base
that<00:02:58.390> is<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.810> back<00:02:59.020> off<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.650> can<00:02:59.800> see

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
that is the back off you can see

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.140 
that is the back off you can see
obviously<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.460> North<00:03:00.640> American<00:03:01.000> scene

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150

creaks<00:03:07.740> door<00:03:08.740> and<00:03:08.890> start<00:03:09.190> is<00:03:09.340> actually<00:03:09.640> kind

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
creaks door and start is actually kind

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.920 
creaks door and start is actually kind
of<00:03:09.850> interesting<00:03:10.030> though<00:03:10.390> considering

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
of interesting though considering

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.390 
of interesting though considering
there's<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.170> crystalline<00:03:11.560> flask<00:03:11.860> on<00:03:12.040> mistake

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
there's a crystalline flask on mistake

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.250 
there's a crystalline flask on mistake
so<00:03:12.550> any<00:03:12.700> erratic<00:03:12.970> special<00:03:13.420> double<00:03:13.660> take<00:03:13.840> there

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
so any erratic special double take there

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.410 
so any erratic special double take there
have<00:03:14.380> to<00:03:14.440> run<00:03:14.590> back<00:03:14.739> in<00:03:14.890> facebook<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.340> love<00:03:15.850> and
