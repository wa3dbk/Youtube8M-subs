delights golf stuff now it's a little
hokey<00:03:21.819> but<00:03:22.680> we<00:03:23.680> see<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:23.980> in<00:03:24.040> 3d<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:24.909> want<00:03:25.120> to

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
hokey but we see it in 3d you want to

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:35.940 
hokey but we see it in 3d you want to
play

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.420 

no<00:03:36.310> game<00:03:36.640> loads<00:03:36.879> honors<00:03:37.180> oh<00:03:37.620> good<00:03:38.620> dual<00:03:39.220> core

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
no game loads honors oh good dual core

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.970 
no game loads honors oh good dual core
so<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.750> game<00:03:40.930> is<00:03:40.959> symbolic<00:03:41.440> couldn't<00:03:41.830> even

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
so the game is symbolic couldn't even

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.320 
so the game is symbolic couldn't even
play<00:03:42.069> a<00:03:42.129> game<00:03:42.310> of<00:03:42.340> similar<00:03:42.670> size<00:03:42.730> of<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.060> single

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.440 
play a game of similar size of a single
core<00:03:43.480> so<00:03:44.080> given<00:03:44.349> that<00:03:44.379> a<00:03:45.010> huge<00:03:45.610> game<00:03:45.879> i<00:03:45.910> forgot

core so given that a huge game i forgot

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.410 
core so given that a huge game i forgot
my<00:03:46.629> hundreds<00:03:47.050> of<00:03:47.080> megabytes<00:03:48.000> yeah<00:03:49.000> game<00:03:49.239> times

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
my hundreds of megabytes yeah game times

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.890 
my hundreds of megabytes yeah game times
are<00:03:49.569> really<00:03:49.690> load<00:03:50.440> times<00:03:50.680> a<00:03:50.739> really<00:03:50.980> quick<00:03:51.900> so

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
are really load times a really quick so

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.570 
are really load times a really quick so
just<00:03:53.470> another<00:03:53.620> example

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.330 

see<00:04:00.360> I<00:04:00.390> can<00:04:00.690> see<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.020> scene<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.530> flyby<00:04:02.040> I<00:04:02.190> can

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
see I can see the scene the flyby I can

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.740 
see I can see the scene the flyby I can
imagine<00:04:02.490> flight<00:04:03.060> games<00:04:03.300> going<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.570> be<00:04:03.630> pretty

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
imagine flight games going to be pretty

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.770 
imagine flight games going to be pretty
cool<00:04:03.960> with<00:04:04.050> this<00:04:05.450> and

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.839

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
you look at your depth of field

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.729 
you look at your depth of field
Blackie's<00:04:15.250> exigency<00:04:15.970> cool<00:04:16.840> that's<00:04:17.230> good<00:04:17.350> if

Blackie's exigency cool that's good if
Ewing<00:04:18.100> angles<00:04:18.370> are<00:04:18.459> surprisingly<00:04:18.910> good<00:04:19.180> I

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
Ewing angles are surprisingly good I

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.390 
Ewing angles are surprisingly good I
know<00:04:19.510> like<00:04:19.810> it<00:04:20.139> didn't<00:04:20.410> i'm<00:04:20.530> 23<00:04:20.650> DSS<00:04:21.130> some<00:04:21.250> good

know like it didn't i'm 23 DSS some good
feeling<00:04:21.760> it<00:04:21.820> goes<00:04:21.940> this<00:04:22.090> is<00:04:22.150> read<00:04:22.420> it<00:04:22.540> on<00:04:22.810> par

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
feeling it goes this is read it on par

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.990 
feeling it goes this is read it on par
with<00:04:23.139> that<00:04:23.430> just<00:04:24.430> give<00:04:24.550> you<00:04:24.639> a<00:04:24.669> couple<00:04:24.790> things

on the UI here to be Optimus UI two
point<00:04:27.970> oh<00:04:28.060> so<00:04:28.110> nice<00:04:29.110> little<00:04:29.410> functionality<00:04:30.040> it

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
point oh so nice little functionality it

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.950 
point oh so nice little functionality it
basically<00:04:30.610> it's<00:04:30.820> taking<00:04:31.150> certain<00:04:31.419> things<00:04:31.720> to

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
basically it's taking certain things to

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.300 
basically it's taking certain things to
Android<00:04:32.320> to<00:04:32.440> do<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.590> little<00:04:32.740> bit<00:04:32.889> better<00:04:32.980> making

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
Android to do a little bit better making

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.409 
Android to do a little bit better making
them<00:04:33.490> easier<00:04:33.700> to<00:04:33.760> use<00:04:33.940> rather<00:04:34.300> than

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
them easier to use rather than

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.150 
them easier to use rather than
reinventing<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:35.110> whole<00:04:35.230> thing<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:35.830> thereby

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
reinventing the whole thing and thereby

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.070 
reinventing the whole thing and thereby
loading<00:04:37.000> on<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.120> processor<00:04:37.540> with<00:04:37.690> undated

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
loading on the processor with undated

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.930 
loading on the processor with undated
tasks<00:04:38.410> and<00:04:38.560> things<00:04:38.590> like<00:04:38.740> that<00:04:38.800> so<00:04:39.070> with<00:04:39.790> that

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
tasks and things like that so with that

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.330 
tasks and things like that so with that
with<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.450> apps<00:04:40.660> just<00:04:41.230> pinched<00:04:41.530> now<00:04:42.100> breaking

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
with the apps just pinched now breaking

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.310 
with the apps just pinched now breaking
down<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:42.550> added<00:04:43.120> or<00:04:43.330> sort<00:04:43.660> of<00:04:43.720> categories<00:04:44.169> you

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
down and added or sort of categories you

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.020 
down and added or sort of categories you
can<00:04:44.410> add<00:04:44.680> categories<00:04:45.580> you<00:04:45.669> can<00:04:45.730> move<00:04:45.850> them

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
can add categories you can move them

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.030 
can add categories you can move them
around<00:04:46.150> okay<00:04:46.780> what<00:04:47.260> I<00:04:47.290> like<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.620> do<00:04:47.740> is<00:04:47.770> take

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
around okay what I like to do is take

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.010 
around okay what I like to do is take
some<00:04:48.220> of<00:04:48.340> them<00:04:48.460> maybe<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.810> stuff<00:04:49.810> in<00:04:49.960> the

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
some of them maybe the stuff in the

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.270 
some of them maybe the stuff in the
phone<00:04:50.169> that<00:04:50.290> they<00:04:50.380> preload<00:04:50.740> their<00:04:51.040> bloatware

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
phone that they preload their bloatware

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.550 
phone that they preload their bloatware
and<00:04:52.030> maybe<00:04:52.270> you'll<00:04:52.390> never<00:04:52.570> use<00:04:52.750> them<00:04:52.960> or<00:04:53.230> think

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
and maybe you'll never use them or think

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.110 
and maybe you'll never use them or think
you<00:04:53.650> won't<00:04:53.770> often<00:04:54.010> maybe<00:04:54.400> create<00:04:54.700> a<00:04:54.730> drawer<00:04:55.000> at

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
you won't often maybe create a drawer at
