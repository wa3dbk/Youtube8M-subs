yourself<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.850> can<00:00:24.029> make<00:00:24.180> your<00:00:24.300> outlet

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
paint them you can stain them I think

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.169 
paint them you can stain them I think
they're<00:00:28.560> cool<00:00:28.769> let<00:00:29.429> me<00:00:29.550> show<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.760> how<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:30.000> go

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
they're cool let me show you how we go

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
a second CNC file the other important

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.860 
a second CNC file the other important
detail<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> stock<00:00:54.360> needs<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.750> be

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
detail is that the stock needs to be

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.170 
detail is that the stock needs to be
exactly<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:55.530> quarter<00:00:55.890> inch<00:00:56.010> thick<00:00:56.309> that's

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
exactly one quarter inch thick that's

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.930 
exactly one quarter inch thick that's
because<00:00:57.570> all<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> cutting<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.320> shaping<00:00:58.530> is

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
because all the cutting and shaping is

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.700 
because all the cutting and shaping is
happening<00:00:59.940> from<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.239> back<00:01:00.420> if<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.440> wood<00:01:01.590> is

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
happening from the back if the wood is

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.039 
happening from the back if the wood is
too<00:01:01.920> thick<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.789> router<00:01:03.090> bit<00:01:03.359> will<00:01:03.510> not<00:01:03.690> cut

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
too thick the router bit will not cut

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.530 
too thick the router bit will not cut
through<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.470> stock<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.070> tested<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.119> program

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
through the stock I tested this program

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.300 
through the stock I tested this program
using<00:01:06.840> mahogany<00:01:07.320> lumber<00:01:07.619> which<00:01:07.770> worked<00:01:08.010> fine

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
using mahogany lumber which worked fine

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.640 
using mahogany lumber which worked fine
and<00:01:08.640> then<00:01:09.150> for<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> real<00:01:09.659> acid<00:01:10.140> test

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
and then for the real acid test

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.820 
and then for the real acid test
I<00:01:10.680> used<00:01:11.130> Western<00:01:11.670> redcedar<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.619> figured<00:01:13.619> that

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
I used Western redcedar I figured that

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.310 
I used Western redcedar I figured that

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.080 
tear out on the end grain this project
was<00:01:18.869> pretty<00:01:19.110> much<00:01:19.259> perfect<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:20.580> eighth<00:01:20.759> inch

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
was pretty much perfect the eighth inch

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.289 
was pretty much perfect the eighth inch

the last cover plate off the CNC but I

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.190 
the last cover plate off the CNC but I
feel<00:01:42.119> pretty<00:01:42.390> strongly<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.170> should

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
feel pretty strongly that you should

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.899 
feel pretty strongly that you should
never<00:01:43.560> leave<00:01:43.890> your<00:01:43.979> shop<00:01:44.280> with<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> machine

never leave your shop with a machine
running<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.420> know<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.439> done<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:47.430> I

running I know that it's done but I

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.700 
running I know that it's done but I
think<00:01:47.759> it's<00:01:47.880> an<00:01:47.939> unsafe<00:01:48.240> practice<00:01:48.810> once<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
think it's an unsafe practice once the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.050 
think it's an unsafe practice once the
bit<00:01:49.860> has<00:01:49.979> hollowed<00:01:50.369> out<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.640> back<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.850> the
