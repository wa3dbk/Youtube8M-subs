00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
to have access to this you need to have

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.080 
to have access to this you need to have
a<00:00:49.230> voted<00:00:49.649> at<00:00:49.739> least<00:00:49.890> once<00:00:50.160> or<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:50.969> only

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
a voted at least once or you can only

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.970 
a voted at least once or you can only
vote<00:00:51.149> once<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.629> one<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.780> can't<00:00:51.989> anyway<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:52.829> I

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
vote once or one I can't anyway but I

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.529 
vote once or one I can't anyway but I
mean<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.730> haven't<00:00:54.000> voted<00:00:54.090> then<00:00:54.420> you

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
mean like if you haven't voted then you

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.660 
mean like if you haven't voted then you
won't<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.840> able<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.110> gain<00:00:55.800> access<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.399> it

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
won't be able to gain access to it

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.119 
won't be able to gain access to it
that's<00:00:57.449> what<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> believe<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.920> make<00:00:59.100> sure

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
sure unless you're against it then you

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.840 
sure unless you're against it then you
know<00:01:04.080> obviously<00:01:04.110> don't<00:01:04.650> vote<00:01:04.830> for<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.100> but

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850

entirely<00:01:26.130> sure<00:01:26.299> seems<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.479> most<00:01:27.570> reasonable

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
entirely sure seems the most reasonable

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.080 
entirely sure seems the most reasonable

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
back then I did I have been a member

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.149 
back then I did I have been a member
since<00:01:47.930> you<00:01:48.930> know<00:01:49.320> which<00:01:49.470> goes<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.770> show<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.979> i

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
since you know which goes to show that i

since you know which goes to show that i
have<00:01:50.220> enjoyed<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.930> know<00:01:51.960> 2007<00:01:52.710> was<00:01:52.920> a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
have enjoyed it and you know 2007 was a

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.550 
have enjoyed it and you know 2007 was a
really<00:01:53.430> good<00:01:53.610> year<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.020> was<00:01:55.170> about<00:01:55.409> two

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
really good year and so was about two

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.889 
really good year and so was about two
thousand<00:01:55.860> eight<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.219> sitting<00:01:56.820> until<00:01:57.210> 2009

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
thousand eight and sitting until 2009

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.080 
thousand eight and sitting until 2009
it's<00:01:58.079> going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.290> start<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.560> change<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.250> um<00:01:59.430> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
it's going to start to change but um you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.550 
it's going to start to change but um you
know<00:02:00.180> i<00:02:00.210> think<00:02:00.329> i<00:02:00.570> will<00:02:00.719> play<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.049> definitely

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
know i think i will play it definitely

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.050 
know i think i will play it definitely
the<00:02:01.649> first<00:02:01.829> month<00:02:02.130> on<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.610> think<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:02.969> it

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
the first month on that I think if it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.670 
the first month on that I think if it
stays<00:02:03.210> at<00:02:03.360> fifteen<00:02:03.780> dollars<00:02:04.200> then<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.530> might

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
stays at fifteen dollars then that might

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.020 
stays at fifteen dollars then that might
put<00:02:04.920> me<00:02:05.040> off<00:02:05.159> because<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.610> quite<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.880> lot

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
put me off because that is quite a lot

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.150 
put me off because that is quite a lot
of<00:02:06.090> money<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.509> but<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.560> know<00:02:07.680> if<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.890> hits<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
of money on but you know if it hits the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.580 
of money on but you know if it hits the
250<00:02:08.789> k<00:02:08.940> mark<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.390> think<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.869> goes<00:02:09.989> down<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.319> five

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
250 k mark I think it goes down to five

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.750 
250 k mark I think it goes down to five
dollars<00:02:10.920> which<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> bit<00:02:11.430> more<00:02:11.550> reasonable

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
dollars which is a bit more reasonable

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.460 
dollars which is a bit more reasonable
for<00:02:12.239> most<00:02:12.510> people

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
for most people

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.590 
for most people
and<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.680> might<00:02:14.010> give<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.760> shot<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.330> actually

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
and I might give it a shot of actually

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.410 
and I might give it a shot of actually
playing<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:16.470> um<00:02:17.270> today<00:02:18.270> with

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
playing it and that but um today with

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.970 
playing it and that but um today with
