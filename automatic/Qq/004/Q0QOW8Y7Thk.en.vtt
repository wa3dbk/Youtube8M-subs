00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hi guys, I have one more job today 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.519
 interesting 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.059
 today we are going to work this little flower 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.040
 that looks very cute these 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.800
 here I even worked with wire 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.920
 but it's what I'm going to do today I'm going to do it 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.550
 like a party that gets easier until 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.199
 for who will start making the flowers 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.789
 ok you'll be doing 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.390
 any size my new angel 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.100
 help the same size as yellow 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.340
 any size there will feel comfortable 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.570
 that you will then create our 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.360
 material 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.160
 crepe paper glue king scissors and the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.440
 string 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:55.980
 so I 'll make this one size 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:58.500
 flowers will be heavy and we'll 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.020
 enjoy this piece of bread better 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.690
 What could you do to make a flower? 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.979
 Are you going to make two of us? 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.979
 open a medium paper 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.200
 if you make two flowers 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.930
 There is no cut. 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.680
 we're just going to double you're going to double one 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.680
 crepe paper 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:29.090
 but it 's just a little glue to 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.550
 hold the toothpick that will sew the 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.150
 toothpick 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:40.910
 look this is the seam and let's roll 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:44.870
 curl up where you think it gets 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:47.450
 better with a violin here that finger goes 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.760
 work here in the middle because he is the one who 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.950
 will direct the role here that he has 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.070
 to be in the same direction then this 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.770
 God came in and out here and this 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.979
 that these two fingers are the ones that 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.160
 they make the nail and the one of the left hand 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:08.600
 what's going on 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:11.959
 So I made the beach and rolled it and got it. 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:18.160
 O rolled always working up do 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:21.769
 the little brother takes and rolls here 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.140
 making the pre wins and was worrying me 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.540
 to leave a space bigger than for power 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.060
 tie at the end 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.110
 then we making games up and rolled the 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:42.440
 There's no line and she'll be rolling. 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:46.690
 fitting in the vineyard was the flat goulão 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.690

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.690
 catch 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:58.000
 hall and so we are ending the 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:04.790
 Our forest line gets down 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:13.760
 Okay, now I'm going to spend a 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:28.370
 bit of string here 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:33.890
 bush and ró well tight that I take the 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:36.400
 excess of the string does a little bit of 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.400
 glue here 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:46.459
