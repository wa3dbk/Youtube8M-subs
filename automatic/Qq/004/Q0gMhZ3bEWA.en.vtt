 nintendo 74 that later would change

 for a nintendo gym with the second 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.979
 steven's name is quartz since 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.290
 represents rose quartz in too much 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.360
 birthday the adult version of stevens 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.700
 is quite similar to the brother of 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.650
 Rebecca Sugar is shown in the episode 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.830
 adventure is on the island that steven not 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.120
 he really knows the concept of privacy 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.680
 Steven is allergic to pollen from 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.240
 plants 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.400
 garnett 3 that violence can 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.380
 solve most of the things as 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.460
 shows when he tries to help steven in 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.580
 too many birthday shaking it 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.170
 the style of garnett is eighties in the 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.000
 introduction of the series can be seen 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.250
 two comets passing behind the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 cover letter from garner doing 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.890
 reference to what is a function 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.570
 in the mythology of the gems the 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.250
 draining are known as gems that 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.860
 provide protection to their 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.410
 owners of evil the names of the 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.780
 fusion of garnett osea ruby sapphire are 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.610
 a reference to pokemon one of the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.250
 things that tell us that garnett is a 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.050
 fusion with their gems since the gem that 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.510
 has the left hand has a facet 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.700
 square shape and the gem of his 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.500
 right hand has a facet of form 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.290
 triangular that represents in each of 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.180
 their respective subjects the reason why 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.070
 which garnett sorry excessively in the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.410
 episode alone and together is to return 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.910
 activate and akon and it works 2 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.280
 this is due to see another relationship 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.140
 romantic similar to yours according to 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.180
 rebecca sugar the style of fight and dance 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.800
 de garnett is based on walking to 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.560
 just like the blue track and she can 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.660
 control an element the thunder can 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.610
 give energy to things and divert rays 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.520
 the garnett lenses are the same as 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.230
 of but the way meat has ether another of mine 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.570
 what their colorful eyes show 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.430
 different in the methodology of the 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.230
 buds treats lies a menus is 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.510
 associated with founding the person with a 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.890
 mind sober this ironic syrian since 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.660
 amethyst is 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.819
 most reckless of all the gems of 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.069
 amethyst crystal in the gems that more 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.750
 we see the series running since the 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.670
 they are part of three functions 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.440
 different but which in turn revealed that 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.240
 the amethyst color palette is 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.130
 based on that of the lumpy princess of 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.930
 now adventure as a reference to your 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.400
 previous work in this series in the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.830
 series mentions that all the more 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.330
 they can change shape but amethyst the 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.550
 only gem that we see regularly 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.350
 changing amethyst shape can not 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.510
 change shape when I was with a lot 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.670
 pressure as seen in the episode the 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.040
 team climbed in episode one 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.410
 story for steven amethyst he was telling 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.390
 dre he liked his hair and 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.760
 Currently her hair is very similar to 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.680
 of drake at that time of all 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.110
 amethyst glass burns in which more 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.180
 his gem has been removed to heal the 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.220
 fast turn of amethyst makes a great 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.350
 reference to sonic in the episode 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.150
 too many birthdays but he mentions 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.190
 who really likes the poster and the track 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.380
 strange thing since in the episode 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.959
 fusion kitchen she says to eat in 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.120
 very thoughtful and who hates it although he can 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.550
 that pearl likes how they look or smell 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.950
 these eaten 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.950
 and this is not going to take away from that it 's a big 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.660
 pearl contradiction this minister in the 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.460
 myths of the gems sep the pearls a 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.590
 small society with dignity the 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.600
 beauty, modesty, purity and 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.820
 Pearl happiness has some interest 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.920
 about human customs if it were not 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.290
 because garnett is an option to see her 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.030
 would be the strongest to the team but the is 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.640
 a fan of cleanliness and order
