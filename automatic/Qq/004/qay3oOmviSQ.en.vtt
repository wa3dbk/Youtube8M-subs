now what you got to start doing is
cleaning<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.459> fork<00:02:13.700> up<00:02:13.850> around<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.989> top

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
cleaning the fork up around the top

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.290 
cleaning the fork up around the top
that's<00:02:15.860> where<00:02:16.209> dirt<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:17.450> stuff<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:19.300> all
