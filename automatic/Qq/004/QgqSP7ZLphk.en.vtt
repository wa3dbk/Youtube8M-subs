difficulties on the pull-up I'm gonna
start<00:00:57.050> with<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.230> easy<00:00:57.410> version<00:00:57.769> because<00:00:58.129> a

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
start with the easy version because a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.369

lot of people can't do a pull-up so if

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.020 
lot of people can't do a pull-up so if
you're<00:01:00.559> training<00:01:00.949> outside<00:01:01.070> you<00:01:01.550> can<00:01:01.699> do<00:01:01.820> this

your every one of these races has a
different<00:02:54.210> distance<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:54.840> so<00:02:54.990> far<00:02:55.170> we've<00:02:55.320> ran

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
different distance so so far we've ran

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.350 
different distance so so far we've ran
two<00:02:55.710> miles<00:02:55.890> if<00:02:56.250> you're<00:02:56.880> doing<00:02:57.120> one<00:02:57.240> of<00:02:57.300> the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
two miles if you're doing one of the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.900 
two miles if you're doing one of the
longer<00:02:57.780> distance<00:02:58.170> races<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.160> would<00:02:59.610> like<00:02:59.760> you

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
longer distance races I would like you

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.690 
longer distance races I would like you
to<00:03:00.440> subtract<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.650> two<00:03:02.070> miles<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.430> we<00:03:02.550> just

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
to subtract the two miles that we just

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.200 
to subtract the two miles that we just
did<00:03:02.910> from<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.630> total<00:03:04.280> race<00:03:05.280> distance<00:03:05.940> and

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
did from the total race distance and

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.170 
did from the total race distance and
that's<00:03:06.900> what<00:03:07.140> you're<00:03:07.260> going<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.410> do<00:03:07.560> for<00:03:07.800> this

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
that's what you're going to do for this

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.430 
that's what you're going to do for this
last<00:03:09.180> round<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.990> running<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:11.220> for<00:03:11.520> instance<00:03:12.440> if

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
last round of running so for instance if

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.040 
last round of running so for instance if
I<00:03:13.620> were<00:03:13.710> to<00:03:13.800> do<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:13.950> Tough<00:03:14.250> Mudder<00:03:14.280> which<00:03:14.820> was<00:03:15.540> 11

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
I were to do a Tough Mudder which was 11

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.140 
I were to do a Tough Mudder which was 11
miles<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.710> that's<00:03:16.830> so<00:03:16.920> far<00:03:17.070> grand<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.610> will

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
miles and that's so far grand to will

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.430 
miles and that's so far grand to will
guess<00:03:18.360> what<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.630> means<00:03:18.780> this<00:03:18.870> next<00:03:19.170> interval

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
guess what that means this next interval

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.890 
guess what that means this next interval
I<00:03:19.650> have<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.040> run<00:03:20.190> nine<00:03:20.370> miles<00:03:20.640> in<00:03:20.850> between<00:03:20.900> so

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
I have to run nine miles in between so

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.780 
I have to run nine miles in between so
if<00:03:22.020> you<00:03:22.110> can<00:03:22.230> do<00:03:22.380> in<00:03:22.500> train<00:03:22.740> you<00:03:23.340> can't<00:03:23.550> do<00:03:23.670> it

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
if you can do in train you can't do it

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.690 
if you can do in train you can't do it
