what I personally saw that night is that

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.619 
what I personally saw that night is that
the<00:00:40.710> first<00:00:40.980> six<00:00:41.249> rounds<00:00:41.730> clearly<00:00:42.120> Pacquiao<00:00:42.539> is

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
the first six rounds clearly Pacquiao is

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.529 
the first six rounds clearly Pacquiao is
the<00:00:42.899> winner<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:43.949> an<00:00:44.070> exciting<00:00:44.460> six<00:00:45.030> rounds

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.770 
the winner it was an exciting six rounds
but<00:00:46.409> what<00:00:46.589> I<00:00:46.620> saw<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> fourth<00:00:47.579> round<00:00:47.780> is

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
but what I saw in the fourth round is

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.989 
but what I saw in the fourth round is
that<00:00:49.170> patio<00:00:49.589> clearly<00:00:50.070> one<00:00:50.249> that<00:00:50.489> he<00:00:50.699> heard

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:50.999 
that patio clearly one that he heard

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.809 
that patio clearly one that he heard
Bradley<00:00:51.649> but<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.769> many<00:00:52.980> Paquiao<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.699> I've

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:53.819 
Bradley but the many Paquiao that I've

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:55.880 
Bradley but the many Paquiao that I've
judged<00:00:54.089> in<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> past<00:00:54.690> would<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.679> finished

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
judged in the past would have finished

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.059 
judged in the past would have finished
him<00:00:56.190> he<00:00:57.030> let<00:00:57.269> him<00:00:57.390> off<00:00:57.569> the<00:00:57.600> hook<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.260> then<00:00:58.920> in

00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.069 
him he let him off the hook and then in

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:02.000 
him he let him off the hook and then in
the<00:00:59.159> later<00:00:59.370> rounds<00:00:59.460> I<00:01:00.089> thought<00:01:00.749> he<00:01:00.989> tired<00:01:01.289> his

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010

the Nevada Commission goes through and
selecting<00:02:39.650> judges<00:02:40.070> I<00:02:40.390> frankly<00:02:41.390> think<00:02:41.480> it's

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
selecting judges I frankly think it's

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.640 
selecting judges I frankly think it's
the<00:02:42.050> best<00:02:42.580> Nevada<00:02:43.580> is<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.850> unique<00:02:44.300> state<00:02:44.630> it's<00:02:45.470> a

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
the best Nevada is a unique state it's a

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.950 
the best Nevada is a unique state it's a
state<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:46.160> allows<00:02:46.280> sports<00:02:46.850> gambling<00:02:47.330> and

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
state that allows sports gambling and

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.920 
state that allows sports gambling and
therefore<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:49.459> scrutiny<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.270> the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
therefore the the scrutiny and the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.590 
therefore the the scrutiny and the
selection<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.680> officials<00:02:52.220> is<00:02:53.030> done<00:02:53.270> very

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
selection of the officials is done very

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.380

selectively and there's input from the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.290 
selectively and there's input from the
participants<00:02:56.570> I<00:02:57.320> think<00:02:58.040> that<00:02:58.310> Nevada<00:02:58.730> has
