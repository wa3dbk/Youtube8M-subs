neoprene strip is is right there where

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.790 
neoprene strip is is right there where
you're<00:02:21.150> going<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.390> have<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.780> cradle<00:02:22.200> what

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
you're going to have the cradle what

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.010 
you're going to have the cradle what
that<00:02:22.950> neoprene<00:02:23.280> strip<00:02:23.640> does<00:02:23.940> in<00:02:24.210> addition<00:02:24.420> to

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
that neoprene strip does in addition to

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.230 
that neoprene strip does in addition to
protecting<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.800> bar<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.150> creates

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
protecting the bar is that it creates

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.660 
protecting the bar is that it creates
friction<00:02:27.660> for<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.200> rest<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.770> mount<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.370> if

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
friction for the rest of the mount so if

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.040 
friction for the rest of the mount so if
you<00:02:29.790> have<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.060> centered<00:02:30.450> it's<00:02:30.630> not<00:02:30.810> going<00:02:30.990> to

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
you have it centered it's not going to

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.290 
you have it centered it's not going to
move<00:02:31.200> around<00:02:31.350> or<00:02:31.830> or<00:02:31.980> rotate<00:02:32.490> anything<00:02:33.150> like

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
will peel that white backing off the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.620 
will peel that white backing off the

on<00:03:06.180> top<00:03:06.420> for<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.720> second<00:03:07.280> now<00:03:08.280> I'm<00:03:08.400> going<00:03:08.550> to

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
on top for a second now I'm going to

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.720 
on top for a second now I'm going to
take<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.360> plastic<00:03:10.290> quick-release<00:03:10.920> base<00:03:11.400> and

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
base this part is symmetrical so it

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.560 
base this part is symmetrical so it
doesn't<00:03:17.430> matter<00:03:17.520> which<00:03:17.790> way<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.060> put<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.360> on

doesn't matter which way you put it on

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.910 
doesn't matter which way you put it on
just<00:03:18.900> any<00:03:19.140> way<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.910> conforms<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.180> bar

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
where it can fit in I'm gonna want to

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.700 
where it can fit in I'm gonna want to
push<00:04:52.740> it<00:04:52.950> down<00:04:53.310> toward<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.300> bar<00:04:54.510> and<00:04:54.780> rotate

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.830 
push it down toward the bar and rotate
it<00:04:55.890> at<00:04:56.040> the<00:04:56.520> same<00:04:56.730> time<00:04:56.790> to<00:04:57.330> get<00:04:57.450> it<00:04:57.600> in<00:04:57.720> the

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
it at the same time to get it in the

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.110 
it at the same time to get it in the
first<00:04:58.020> set<00:04:58.320> of<00:04:58.350> notches<00:04:58.680> inside<00:04:59.310> so<00:04:59.730> kind<00:04:59.970> of

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
first set of notches inside so kind of

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.350 
first set of notches inside so kind of
push<00:05:00.900> down<00:05:01.110> rotate<00:05:01.760> simultaneously<00:05:02.760> so

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
push down rotate simultaneously so

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.840 
push down rotate simultaneously so
that's<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.870> first<00:05:04.140> set<00:05:04.350> of<00:05:04.380> notches<00:05:04.710> I<00:05:05.190> can

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
that's the first set of notches I can

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.940 
that's the first set of notches I can
rotate<00:05:06.060> it<00:05:06.300> again<00:05:06.600> same<00:05:07.110> direction<00:05:07.440> that's

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
rotate it again same direction that's

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.530 
rotate it again same direction that's
the<00:05:08.220> second<00:05:08.670> set<00:05:08.880> of<00:05:08.910> notches

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
the second set of notches

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.380 
the second set of notches
the<00:05:10.350> third<00:05:10.950> set<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.430> third<00:05:11.670> turn<00:05:11.940> here<00:05:12.240> is

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
the third set the third turn here is

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.390 
the third set the third turn here is
actually<00:05:12.870> going<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:13.170> release<00:05:13.320> it<00:05:13.740> again<00:05:13.830> so

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
actually going to release it again so

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.920 
actually going to release it again so
now<00:05:14.550> I<00:05:14.580> can<00:05:14.910> just<00:05:14.940> pull<00:05:15.180> that<00:05:15.600> right<00:05:15.870> out

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
now I can just pull that right out

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.890 
now I can just pull that right out
that's<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:17.010> pattern<00:05:17.300> around<00:05:18.300> the<00:05:18.540> entire

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
that's the pattern around the entire

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.120 
that's the pattern around the entire
mount<00:05:19.320> so<00:05:19.830> push<00:05:20.160> rotate<00:05:20.730> there's<00:05:21.180> one<00:05:22.130> there's

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
mount so push rotate there's one there's

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.860 
mount so push rotate there's one there's
two<00:05:23.550> and<00:05:24.140> the<00:05:25.140> third<00:05:25.770> notch<00:05:26.640> is<00:05:27.030> a<00:05:27.390> release

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
two and the third notch is a release

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.570 
two and the third notch is a release
point<00:05:28.190> so<00:05:29.190> I<00:05:29.220> want<00:05:29.550> to<00:05:29.610> get<00:05:29.760> that<00:05:29.970> where<00:05:30.360> it's

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
point so I want to get that where it's

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.610 
point so I want to get that where it's
now<00:05:32.580> straight<00:05:33.270> up<00:05:33.480> and<00:05:33.660> down<00:05:33.840> in<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.200> cradle

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
now straight up and down in the cradle
