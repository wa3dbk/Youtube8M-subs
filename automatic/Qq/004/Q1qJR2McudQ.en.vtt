fiberglass then you know it's like

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.310 
fiberglass then you know it's like
double<00:01:54.369> working<00:01:54.640> you<00:01:54.729> know<00:01:54.880> then<00:01:55.810> also<00:01:55.990> I<00:01:56.140> want

double working you know then also I want

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.690 
double working you know then also I want
to<00:01:56.439> have<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.680> next<00:01:56.890> layer<00:01:57.039> fiberglass<00:01:57.430> has

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
to have the next layer fiberglass has

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.249 
to have the next layer fiberglass has
something<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.000> catch<00:01:58.270> hold<00:01:58.450> onto

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
something to catch hold onto

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.910 
something to catch hold onto
and<00:02:00.210> when<00:02:01.210> one<00:02:01.869> thing<00:02:02.049> I<00:02:02.140> figured<00:02:02.500> out<00:02:02.619> was

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
and when one thing I figured out was

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.450 
and when one thing I figured out was
what<00:02:03.610> found<00:02:03.820> out<00:02:04.030> was<00:02:04.689> when<00:02:05.110> you're<00:02:05.649> laying

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
what found out was when you're laying

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.040 
what found out was when you're laying
down<00:02:06.700> your<00:02:06.850> cloth<00:02:08.550> make<00:02:09.550> sure<00:02:09.849> that<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:10.569> take

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
down your cloth make sure that you take

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.620 
down your cloth make sure that you take
out<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.319> time<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.739> get<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.980> cloth<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:13.030> form<00:02:13.360> to

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
out the time to get the cloth to form to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.490 
out the time to get the cloth to form to
the<00:02:13.780> final<00:02:14.140> outcome<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.900> how<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:16.930> did<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.290> first

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
the final outcome so how I did the first

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.809 
the final outcome so how I did the first
thing<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.709> was<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:17.860> just<00:02:18.069> put<00:02:18.310> down<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.580> cloth

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
thing it was I just put down the cloth

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.059 
thing it was I just put down the cloth
and<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.209> just<00:02:19.420> pour<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.720> resin<00:02:19.840> on<00:02:20.019> top<00:02:20.260> which

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
and I just pour the resin on top which

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.910 
and I just pour the resin on top which
someone<00:02:21.580> informed<00:02:22.000> me<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.120> was<00:02:22.420> wrong<00:02:22.660> way

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
someone informed me that was wrong way

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.199 
someone informed me that was wrong way
how<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:23.950> supposed<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.580> was<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:25.000> know<00:02:25.090> you

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
how you supposed to it was you know you

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.720 
how you supposed to it was you know you
waited<00:02:25.390> out<00:02:25.630> first<00:02:25.930> with<00:02:26.769> ready<00:02:27.010> with<00:02:27.340> resin

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
waited out first with ready with resin

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.890 
waited out first with ready with resin
put<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.000> gauze<00:02:28.180> over<00:02:28.480> there<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.750> put<00:02:28.870> some

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
put the gauze over there and put some

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.460 
put the gauze over there and put some
more<00:02:29.110> resin<00:02:29.440> on<00:02:29.530> top<00:02:29.799> so<00:02:30.580> that's<00:02:30.880> how<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.030> did

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
more resin on top so that's how I did

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.280 
more resin on top so that's how I did
get<00:02:32.470> those<00:02:32.680> whatever<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.280> but<00:02:34.180> I<00:02:34.209> find<00:02:34.510> out<00:02:34.720> but

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
get those whatever so but I find out but

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.949 
get those whatever so but I find out but
I<00:02:35.319> find<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.739> it's<00:02:35.920> best<00:02:36.160> is<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.970> lay<00:02:37.720> down

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
I find that it's best is to lay down

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.870 
I find that it's best is to lay down
just<00:02:38.290> sweat<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:38.980> out<00:02:39.069> but<00:02:39.310> first<00:02:39.489> make<00:02:39.849> sure

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
just sweat it out but first make sure

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.500 
just sweat it out but first make sure
that<00:02:40.360> your<00:02:40.989> that<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.440> don't<00:02:41.830> have<00:02:42.040> your<00:02:42.510> resin

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
that your that you don't have your resin

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.770 
that your that you don't have your resin
kicking<00:02:43.930> too<00:02:44.140> fast<00:02:44.640> use<00:02:45.640> less<00:02:46.000> cat<00:02:46.660> litter

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
kicking too fast use less cat litter

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.009 
kicking too fast use less cat litter
harder<00:02:47.380> so<00:02:47.980> let<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:48.640> put<00:02:48.820> down<00:02:48.850> your<00:02:48.970> resin<00:02:49.450> and

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
harder so let so put down your resin and

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.500 
harder so let so put down your resin and
then<00:02:50.320> put<00:02:51.070> your<00:02:51.190> cloth<00:02:51.370> over<00:02:51.730> check<00:02:52.269> out<00:02:52.390> the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
then put your cloth over check out the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.380 
then put your cloth over check out the
time<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.959> have<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.829> smooth<00:02:54.280> out<00:02:54.579> and<00:02:54.850> form<00:02:55.209> to

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
time to have it smooth out and form to

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.960 
time to have it smooth out and form to
the<00:02:55.480> final<00:02:56.430> outcome<00:02:57.430> how<00:02:57.579> you<00:02:57.640> want<00:02:57.850> that<00:02:57.910> to

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
the final outcome how you want that to

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.039 
the final outcome how you want that to
because<00:02:58.299> if<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.510> don't<00:02:58.660> you're<00:02:58.870> going<00:02:58.959> to

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
because if you don't you're going to

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.240 
because if you don't you're going to
have<00:02:59.140> these<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.440> wrinkles<00:02:59.769> in<00:02:59.859> there<00:03:00.010> we<00:03:00.130> go

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
have these the wrinkles in there we go

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.590 
have these the wrinkles in there we go
to<00:03:00.310> send<00:03:00.579> it<00:03:00.700> now<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.090> those<00:03:01.239> are<00:03:01.359> going<00:03:01.480> to

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
to send it now and those are going to

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.330 
to send it now and those are going to
cause<00:03:02.280> cause<00:03:03.280> holes<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:05.500> didn't<00:03:06.100> pay<00:03:06.220> in

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
cause cause holes and I didn't pay in

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.979 
cause cause holes and I didn't pay in
the<00:03:06.400> mind<00:03:06.549> so<00:03:06.700> that<00:03:06.730> first<00:03:07.030> I'm<00:03:07.420> putting<00:03:07.480> three

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
the mind so that first I'm putting three

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.780 
the mind so that first I'm putting three
four<00:03:08.200> layers<00:03:08.410> on<00:03:08.500> side<00:03:08.829> needs<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.160> tip<00:03:09.579> every

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
four layers on side needs to tip every

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.809 
four layers on side needs to tip every
time<00:03:09.940> glue<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.620> yes<00:03:11.620> so<00:03:11.950> long<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:12.549> sparse

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
time glue that yes so long and sparse

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.360 
time glue that yes so long and sparse
these<00:03:13.030> corners<00:03:13.510> those<00:03:13.900> those<00:03:14.380> are<00:03:14.620> okay<00:03:15.160> for

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
these corners those those are okay for

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.340 
these corners those those are okay for
the<00:03:15.549> most<00:03:15.730> part<00:03:16.000> those<00:03:16.390> are<00:03:16.420> pretty<00:03:16.750> fine

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
the most part those are pretty fine

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.500 
the most part those are pretty fine
I<00:03:17.380> had<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:17.980> same<00:03:18.130> problem<00:03:18.190> back<00:03:18.730> here<00:03:19.000> had

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
I had the same problem back here had

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.300 
I had the same problem back here had
these<00:03:19.660> sort<00:03:19.840> of<00:03:19.900> wrinkly<00:03:20.230> is<00:03:20.290> right<00:03:20.440> here<00:03:20.680> and

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
these sort of wrinkly is right here and

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.370 
these sort of wrinkly is right here and
so<00:03:21.489> I<00:03:21.519> when<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.239> sanded<00:03:22.510> down<00:03:22.569> had<00:03:22.840> holes<00:03:23.079> in<00:03:23.260> it

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
so I when I sanded down had holes in it

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.410 
so I when I sanded down had holes in it
so<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.590> last<00:03:23.859> two<00:03:24.040> layers<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.400> just<00:03:24.639> took

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
so it last two layers I just took

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.900 
so it last two layers I just took
sandpaper<00:03:26.410> with<00:03:26.650> my<00:03:27.040> hand<00:03:27.310> on<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.549> corners

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
sandpaper with my hand on the corners

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.120 
sandpaper with my hand on the corners
and<00:03:27.940> right<00:03:28.180> here<00:03:28.359> just<00:03:29.049> to<00:03:29.170> send<00:03:29.350> it<00:03:29.470> down<00:03:29.650> just
