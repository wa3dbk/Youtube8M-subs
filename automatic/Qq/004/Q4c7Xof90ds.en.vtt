00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello very good to all and welcome to 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.830
 my channel here where the gamer with a 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 scary game with the heart rate monitor 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.970
 again remember that the number of 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.040
 above marks the pulsations and the 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.259
 down saturation is the one that goes to 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.100
 be almost always 99 my case only 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.110
 the other 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.580
 and above I see that this game will see a 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.280
 little complicated because I have to be 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.750
 constantly squeezing good free 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.869
 go to have the link of the download 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.000
 well in the description as always and 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.740
 let's see what we find today touches 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.850
 indeci medical ya not going to bring 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:37.390
 a week or two ago that does not bring it yes 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.520
 yes I will bring the only problem with 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.240
 the one that confronts me is that today I'm not going to 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.520
 be at home I will go out 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.850
 and it makes me a little complicated 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.719
 OK 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.719
 no way 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.780
 well then what is going to be 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.870
 complicated and that's precisely why I decided 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.440
 that it is best to bring it tomorrow that I have 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.440
 more time 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.440
 I do not know if he 's recording the heart rate monitor or 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.710
 no but I can not stop letting go 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.710
 here 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.990
 how people shout 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.490
 let's call back to the asylum or something like that 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.490
 he was the shrink 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.250
 and see that we are the first 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.189
 time I play even though with so I played the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.740
 first part of the king who are called the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.579
 other games begin with de reik and the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.579
 another was hotel 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.020
 I have a madam, I would play games 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.280
 fear and is constantly looking towards the 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.280
 work in which there is nothing 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.880
 that is 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.630
 I think it's because of that door 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.400
 it's better not to go, I think, my heart 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.510
 it's a dissertation, do not go for that 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.510
 door please 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.200
 my mother of beautiful love but that was 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.200
 that bug 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.270
 I have stayed 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.330
 I do not leave here, it can be done 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.330
 let's go 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.540
 I was playing 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.870
 you know that less on top I did not see anything 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.360
 personal noise and I stay on plan that 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.099
 I have done I do not know if not even the 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.959
 pulsations go good I have them in 110 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.250
 no wonder a lot if you do not have to be 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.110
 for or near 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.500
 do not worry and this is not there 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.500
 exit 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.040
 the rooms without exits do not 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.330
 we like let's leave here 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.830
 supposedly you have to find the 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.830
 I do not know if the game has a final 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.830
 I just heard something is worth 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.110
 I swear I just heard something like 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.819
 it opened something I do not know if it would be the gate 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.250
 next door but the truth is that neither 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.250
 I'm very willing to discover it 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.780
 and with what came out before I had 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.020
 for all good that allen tomorrow I'm going 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.780
 to bring an episode 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.810
 the longer it is worth of love because 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.380
 played for days he not brought them so 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.480
 what is said 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.810
 I will bring it without any problems 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.810
 Enchanted already with the candles was fine 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.810
 2.0 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.670
 that already touches that already touches I was looking for 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.710
 even to play stories 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.010
 personalized amnesia in Spanish 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:45.530
 because several comments me ideas and he 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.530
 play fool plays amnesia 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.760
 I'm where I started, it's very good 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.740
 well let's change zone 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.049
 I'm sorry if I stay quiet but 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:09.549
 when I'm really scared the truth 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.549
 is that to be commenting is in the 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.060
 and I listen to things it 's good to hear things 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:26.980
 rare 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.660
 fuck there's no way out I'm not going in there 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.190
 because it was on the walls and there's 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.130
 where to escape but I do not know if it is 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.690
 which is that what I said I do not know which role 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.449
 have this game I think only 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.650
 the one with lame 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.650
 Mars as a bitch 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:50.080
 well I think I believe for the good of me 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:53.080
 mentally I'm going to leave it here 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.080
 OK 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.009
 to her 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.199
 that's why he locked me more and handled it better 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.479
 but what stuck in me 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.590
 heart rate monitor there are times that it restarts that 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:10.730
 so he returns 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.870
 and like you give it and the rib if you know 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.040
 of some scary game in which 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.430
 you want me to play 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.990
 I would prefer it to be in Spanish or 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.140
 that does not have a lot of history because my 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.140
 level 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.960
 my English level is not exactly 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.960
 very good 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:36.110
 I think that we are not the only one 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.110
 possible output this can be good 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.860
 I can stay this mattress to sleep 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.060
 here like he does not want the good thing 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.620
 before kalina at least I saw the 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.750
 person himself was clinging to me 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.250
 I embraced eagerly to kill myself not from 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:59.540
 Honey but he hugged me he is here 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.100
 because he wants to kill me 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.920
 good faults but also more 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.620
 less I take it from above 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.570
 the truth is I'm talking nonsense 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:11.290
 forgive me the same I am an amoeba is that 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:13.570
 is that a toilet here for 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.830
 so that when I say that I'm married 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.830
 of fear is not so literal 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.469
 and lost I'm lost 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.290
 I already leave it here 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.300
 there are three exits are not three cells 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.689
 I know what they are 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.289
 Hello 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:40.289
 Hello 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.160
 nothing other than the game that the fuck 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.540
 you have to do what you said if you want 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.850
 play some scary game on something in 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:52.050
 You already warn me and tell me about 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:53.460
 karim plays tomorrow Friday comes out 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.190
 on Sunday we have to bring the truth 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:59.430
 because suter I see that you do not like it 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.930
 so much that I do and then I do not know the 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.050
 I'm really a little lost that I'll bring 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.430
 Sunday not as something fixed but not 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.199
 admits good pieces I do not know what I have 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.570
 On Sunday, if I'm still alive, I bring something to 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:12.070
 commenting on me is not my idea for what will 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.830
 on Sunday I leave it here 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.360
 more of me you give me ideas of what 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.790
 what he wants is that I bring to Sunday and 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.960
 I do it okay and that's it if you want 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.970
 play the game you will have the 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.130
 description up here from the gamer 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.930
 excuse me but this game that I know that I 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.090
 is going to leave a sudden scare is not very 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:31.000
 good to be put participate 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.740
 commenting as if nothing as I said a 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.670
 greeting to the next from here from 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.670
 the one that goodbye
