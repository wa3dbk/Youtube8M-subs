00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
receiver that does not come off so we'll

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.639 
receiver that does not come off so we'll
go<00:00:35.610> ahead<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.820> we'll<00:00:36.059> connect<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:37.440> right

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
go ahead and we'll connect it's right

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.670 
go ahead and we'll connect it's right
here<00:00:38.450> and<00:00:39.450> then<00:00:39.629> we'll<00:00:39.780> bring<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.140> hand

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
do is hook up the wireless receiver and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.459 
do is hook up the wireless receiver and
you<00:00:46.200> will<00:00:46.379> pull<00:00:46.680> off<00:00:47.750> this<00:00:48.750> piece<00:00:49.170> right<00:00:49.289> here

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
you will pull off this piece right here

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.709 
you will pull off this piece right here
and<00:00:50.460> you'll<00:00:51.090> go<00:00:51.239> ahead<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:52.020> put<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:53.719> device

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
and you'll go ahead and put this device

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.970 
and you'll go ahead and put this device
in<00:00:55.670> this<00:00:56.670> direction<00:00:57.500> you'll<00:00:58.500> see<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.800> it's

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
in this direction you'll see that it's

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.700 
in this direction you'll see that it's
lots<00:00:59.309> right<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.760> there<00:01:00.289> and<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.469> go<00:01:01.649> ahead

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
lots right in there and just go ahead

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.590 
lots right in there and just go ahead
and<00:01:01.859> spend<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.670> little<00:01:02.850> bit<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.180> tighten<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.570> up

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
and spend a little bit and tighten it up

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.200 
and spend a little bit and tighten it up
so<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.899> doesn't<00:01:04.140> come<00:01:04.260> off<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.820> reason<00:01:06.150> we

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
so it doesn't come off and the reason we

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.270 
so it doesn't come off and the reason we
do<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.110> isn't<00:01:07.439> covering<00:01:07.799> on<00:01:08.040> top

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
do that is so this isn't covering on top

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.630 
do that is so this isn't covering on top
of<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.700> zoom<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.330> out<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.810> camcorder

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
of the zoom in and out of the camcorder

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.560 
of the zoom in and out of the camcorder
and<00:01:11.640> over<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.030> side<00:01:12.090> you're<00:01:12.390> going<00:01:12.510> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
and over on this side you're going to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.380 
and over on this side you're going to
open<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.080> door<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:14.240> you're<00:01:15.240> going<00:01:15.330> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
open up the door and you're going to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.830 
open up the door and you're going to
plug<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.710> connection<00:01:16.979> where<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> red

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
plug in the connection where the red

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.320 
plug in the connection where the red
port<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> red<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.400> microphone

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
port is in the red is the microphone

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.550 
port is in the red is the microphone
port<00:01:22.820> at<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.000> point<00:01:24.240> you're<00:01:24.360> going<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.720> lift

up<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.220> antenna<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.210> then<00:01:27.570> kind<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.140> gently

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
up the antenna and then kind of gently

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.530 
up the antenna and then kind of gently
pull<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:29.990> spin<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.320> around<00:01:31.650> there

reason<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:21.220> turn<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:21.640> on<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.910> battery<00:02:22.390> light

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
reason you turn it on the battery light

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.990 
reason you turn it on the battery light
does<00:02:22.930> not<00:02:22.960> come<00:02:23.320> on<00:02:23.500> on<00:02:23.770> either<00:02:24.490> one<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:24.820> these

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
does not come on on either one of these

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.430 
does not come on on either one of these
units<00:02:25.330> I'm<00:02:25.540> just<00:02:25.690> going<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.840> show<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.050> quickly

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
units I'm just going to show you quickly

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.030 
units I'm just going to show you quickly
how<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:27.090> replace<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.270> battery<00:02:28.710> so<00:02:29.710> on<00:02:29.890> the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
how to replace the battery so on the

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.270 
how to replace the battery so on the
side<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.310> this<00:02:30.490> one<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:31.090> going<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:32.070> push<00:02:33.070> up

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
side of this one it's going to push up

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.730 
side of this one it's going to push up
side<00:02:33.850> like<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.510> then<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.290> battery<00:02:35.620> will

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
side like that and then the battery will

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.610 
side like that and then the battery will
come<00:02:35.890> out<00:02:36.040> like<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:37.170> if<00:02:38.170> we<00:02:38.290> look<00:02:38.410> inside

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
come out like that if we look inside

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.870 
come out like that if we look inside
here<00:02:39.070> you'll<00:02:39.430> see<00:02:39.520> that<00:02:39.970> there<00:02:40.209> is<00:02:40.240> a<00:02:41.880> minus

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
here you'll see that there is a minus

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.979 
here you'll see that there is a minus
and<00:02:43.150> plus<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.680> they're<00:02:45.610> making<00:02:46.600> sure<00:02:46.780> that

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
and plus so they're making sure that

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.820 
and plus so they're making sure that
when<00:02:47.140> you<00:02:47.260> put<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.560> in<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.680> minus<00:02:50.680> and

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
when you put it in that the minus and

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.280 
when you put it in that the minus and
plus<00:02:50.860> we'll<00:02:51.459> be<00:02:51.489> facing<00:02:51.880> down<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.989> on<00:02:53.170> the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
plus we'll be facing down and on the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.720 
plus we'll be facing down and on the
right<00:02:53.440> direction<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.130> plus<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.580> the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
right direction so the plus is the

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.580 
right direction so the plus is the
little<00:02:54.880> smaller<00:02:55.239> guy<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:56.670> it's<00:02:57.670> going<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.590> see

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
little smaller guy and it's going to see

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.640 
little smaller guy and it's going to see
the<00:02:59.680> plus<00:02:59.890> there<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:01.750> plus<00:03:02.019> is<00:03:02.350> right

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
the plus there and the plus is right

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.110 
the plus there and the plus is right
there<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.070> minuses<00:03:03.400> error<00:03:03.610> so<00:03:03.850> you<00:03:03.940> want

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
there and the minuses error so you want

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.330 
there and the minuses error so you want
to<00:03:04.180> slide<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.570> in<00:03:04.630> like<00:03:04.780> that<00:03:04.830> close<00:03:05.830> it<00:03:05.980> up<00:03:06.070> and

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
to slide it in like that close it up and

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.960 
to slide it in like that close it up and
then<00:03:06.459> slide<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:06.820> over<00:03:08.489> same<00:03:09.489> as<00:03:09.519> this<00:03:09.760> unit

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
then slide it over same as this unit

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.390 
then slide it over same as this unit
here<00:03:10.410> same<00:03:11.410> kind<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.709> door<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:13.630> push<00:03:14.400> you're

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
here same kind of door and push you're

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.449 
here same kind of door and push you're
going<00:03:15.550> to<00:03:15.610> see<00:03:15.730> that<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:16.360> does<00:03:16.540> say<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:18.310> know

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
going to see that it does say you know

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.460 
going to see that it does say you know
the<00:03:20.250> minus<00:03:21.250> in<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.489> plus

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
the minus in the plus

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.200 
the minus in the plus
so<00:03:24.040> I'm<00:03:24.160> going<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.310> face<00:03:24.490> it<00:03:24.640> towards<00:03:24.730> so<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:25.030> can

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
so I'm going to face it towards so I can

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.210 
so I'm going to face it towards so I can
see<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.690> then<00:03:26.170> you're<00:03:26.500> going<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.650> find<00:03:26.920> the

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
see it and then you're going to find the

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.210 
see it and then you're going to find the
+<00:03:27.490> on<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:28.150> battery<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.800> you<00:03:29.800> look<00:03:29.950> inside

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
+ on the battery and you look inside

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.440 
+ on the battery and you look inside
there<00:03:30.490> and<00:03:30.520> it<00:03:30.700> says<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.030> plus<00:03:31.210> on<00:03:31.390> the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
there and it says the plus on the

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.050 
there and it says the plus on the
battery<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:31.750> on<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:31.960> left<00:03:32.080> hand<00:03:32.320> side<00:03:33.060> slide

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
battery is on the left hand side slide

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.940 
battery is on the left hand side slide
it<00:03:34.180> in<00:03:34.300> like<00:03:34.420> that<00:03:34.450> close<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:35.410> and<00:03:35.590> slide<00:03:35.920> it
