00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
tests and I've shrunk down the toe part

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.779 
tests and I've shrunk down the toe part
a<00:00:27.449> ton<00:00:27.810> because<00:00:28.349> basically<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.310> just<00:00:29.519> like<00:00:29.670> to

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
a ton because basically I just like to

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.730 
a ton because basically I just like to
have<00:00:29.880> my<00:00:30.029> foot<00:00:30.210> as<00:00:30.330> close<00:00:30.510> as<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.720> can<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.960> my

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
have my foot as close as I can to my

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.990 
have my foot as close as I can to my
grip<00:00:31.920> tape<00:00:32.130> whatever<00:00:32.369> when<00:00:32.640> I'm<00:00:32.730> trying<00:00:32.910> to

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
grip tape whatever when I'm trying to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.120 
grip tape whatever when I'm trying to
kick<00:00:33.210> flip<00:00:33.329> or<00:00:33.660> ollie<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.500> hugs<00:00:34.770> your<00:00:34.920> foot

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
kick flip or ollie it hugs your foot

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.100 
kick flip or ollie it hugs your foot
without<00:00:35.610> making<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.360> uncomfortable

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
without making it uncomfortable

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.889 
without making it uncomfortable
so<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.829> flex<00:00:38.100> grooves<00:00:38.390> it's<00:00:39.390> not<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> gimmick

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
so the flex grooves it's not a gimmick

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.900 
so the flex grooves it's not a gimmick
or<00:00:40.110> anything<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.649> runs<00:00:40.950> straight<00:00:41.399> through<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
or anything it runs straight through the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.790 
or anything it runs straight through the
sole<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.450> then<00:00:42.660> into<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> cushion<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.710> you

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
sole and then into the cushion so you

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.220 
sole and then into the cushion so you
get<00:00:44.040> maximum<00:00:44.280> flexibility<00:00:45.210> that's<00:00:45.870> honestly

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
get maximum flexibility that's honestly

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.450 
get maximum flexibility that's honestly
