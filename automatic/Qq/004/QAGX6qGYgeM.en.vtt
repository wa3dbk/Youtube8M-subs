 a reference to it will be in the description so 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.730
 what let's watch now movie 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.860
 few knew that fireworks can 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.239
 direct the flow of water or let's 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.430
 just try avatar 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.440
 run fireworks he flies with us faith 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.120
 but if we put fireworks water 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.559
 About here here he will have us 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.840
 fly already at an angle 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.030
 that is a very nice and quite 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.879
 interesting to see how fly explode 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.520
 fireworks on the background of the moon and this is such 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.290
 interesting secret about which many 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.880
 many 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.790
 suites on let's look 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.950
 the next secret many did not know what with 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.950
 here you can use such boilers 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.470
 getting enough water to wait for the rain 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.080
 and in these boilers will be gradually 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.490
 fill with water more precisely 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.260
 to be filled that I start talking when 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.620
 last time and here you will see this 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.120
 the boiler for our water is full and 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.430
 gradually filled into other boilers 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.430
 that's cool enough guys lets you 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.470
 clean armor if there is no water and nearby 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.450
 and so on you can collect rainwater 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.440
 and let's use it itself 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.509
 watch 3 places few people knew that if 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.610
 turn on auto clicker in minecraft 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.920
 You can do about such here 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.470
 weird things you see how many peas 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.680
 spawn it really cool too 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.300
 you can very quickly how to build 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.180
 way, let's note a little bit 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.430
 away and again turn on our 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.800
 autoclicker and we will build about here 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.750
 so here are very very very fast guys 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.570
 this is not four this autoclicker 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.649
 accordingly and it will work on 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.540
 any server 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.119
 accordingly, you can throw bottles with 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.130
 experiences and give your friends a very 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.630
 very fast experience but unfortunately like this 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.940
 very much everything lags 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.650
 see how much experience literally 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.239
 a few seconds you can dial yourself up 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.430
 LVL 30 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.760
 Well, actually let's watch the second 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.709
 minecraft location is very 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.660
 many ways to look behind 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.510
 textures are starting from this 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.720
 of the way that is, we click like this 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.730
 do and choose our player deal here 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.920
 such a view and run and just 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.080
 peeking at the texture we see that we 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.730
 there comes from above but my 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.489
 tunnel through which I here 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.739
 went down and finished this way with 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.230
 bed and there it will not lie then we will 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.030
 see everything that happens with us for 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.000
 textures now we actually 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.280
 wake up we fill the bed and we 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.930
 on the street the day we saw everything we wanted 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.110
 you actually let's watch first 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.850
 place the next secret he is very obvious 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.450
 but nevertheless many are not even 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.700
 guess that you can usually do this 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.730
 how to spawn snowmen put in two blocks 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.370
 Top put pumpkin and spawns snowman 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.470
 but no one 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.090
 that you can remember the snowmen like this 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.220
 here then the other way and even here 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.260
 so look your own need 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.200

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.580
 blog now put here pumpkin and 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.549
 the snowman will fall asleep at all 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.260
 miracle and do not know so here is the export of wood but 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.299
 many do not realize the real about it 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.909
 precisely because of this i put such 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.440
 the obvious secret in the first place well 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.470
 actually see a snowman right to us in 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.370
