00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 for the veneers and compass and welcome to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.960
 another new video and how they saw it in 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.360
 the title the aba of minecraft in large 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.780
 5 auto online and if I know it sounds 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.509
 something curious that sounds strange but 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.029
 if it's like a minecraft lava in 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.189
 big missed 5 and if you ask hey 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.590
 but how can I see the lava of 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.150
 minecraft in big auto 5 online then 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.800
 It is very simple in describing 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.720
 this video I'm going to leave the game 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.699
 personalized that was created by my good 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.710
 friend carlos with hd to be the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.870
 download and you can appreciate 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.579
 this lava that is in the game I the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.890
 true that when I saw it I stayed a little 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.350
 shocked because it's not something normal that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.050
 there's lava in the game and I think it's not 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.399
 the base I suppose already seeing it of a 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.719
 much more comprehensive side and much more 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.910
 smart I think it's a building 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.100
 burned because as they can not see the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.570
 lava would go down no and this is 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.789
 like fire that is going up 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.280
 like the embers are rising 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.719
 but if it is something extremely strange that 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.670
 me the truth called me very much the 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.049
 attention and that's why I wanted them 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.820
 attract so in the description of this 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.159
 video I will leave you 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.440
 since this mission is a capture and there 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.450
 is the lava is worth noting that 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.590
 besides having all this lava that 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.960
 we are seeing here we can also 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.760
 find small cubes 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.710
 which are quite curious indeed 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.260
 who will remember us when it is good 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.380
 minecraft and suddenly throw a bucket of 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.390
 wash as it is done when it is pulled and it is 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.009
 exactly the same reaction as me 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.619
 I had when I saw this the truth that you see 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.800
 something curious since the big car 5 is 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.140
 like a real world and minecraft then 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.119
 obviously it 's a world of cubes and seeing 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.220
 this I was like something astonished and 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.930
 as you can see there lava cubes 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.270
 everywhere the truth is that it is the most 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.430
 random and casual and strange that I have seen 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.660
 in the game that has surprised me and the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.550
 true that when I was playing this 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.350
 departure that was with ring ring carlos 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.030
 I had a good time because I 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.250
 it got pretty cool since I never 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.479
 I had seen this before in the game but 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.080
 anyway I hope you liked it 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.410
 this video if any of you want 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.090
 or do you know where this lava is 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.679
 maybe there in the munchi's and the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.959
 I think it would be enough 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.330
 well and something more curious about the game is 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.550
 the lava is right 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.410
 in the background william ok it 's as if 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.480
 did some kind of rash and out 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.640
 some giant volcano imagine that the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.560
 click monchi liat one day I have a 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.150
 eruption and this eruption destroys the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.980
 saints and leaves us a zombie apocalypse 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.690
 well I'm smoking it already 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.460
 I know I hope you liked this video 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.770

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.150
