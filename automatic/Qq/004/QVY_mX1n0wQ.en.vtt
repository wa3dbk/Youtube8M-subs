yeah well we stopped a couple times and
watered<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:10.810> you<00:01:11.810> know<00:01:11.930> we<00:01:12.080> dilly-dally

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
watered and and you know we dilly-dally

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.029 
watered and and you know we dilly-dally
when<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:13.369> happened<00:01:13.759> with<00:01:13.910> Madonna<00:01:14.240> I<00:01:14.450> I

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
when that happened with Madonna I I

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:16.960 
when that happened with Madonna I I
really<00:01:16.039> didn't<00:01:16.220> want<00:01:16.369> to<00:01:16.399> have<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:16.610> vote<00:01:16.640> her

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
really didn't want to have to vote her

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.090 
really didn't want to have to vote her
so<00:01:17.210> I<00:01:17.240> debated<00:01:17.509> about<00:01:18.080> it<00:01:18.170> for<00:01:18.380> a<00:01:18.410> while<00:01:18.560> but<00:01:18.920> it

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
so I debated about it for a while but it

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.740 
so I debated about it for a while but it
was<00:01:19.220> definitely<00:01:19.490> a<00:01:20.619> chance<00:01:22.300> she<00:01:23.300> is<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.539> best

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
was definitely a chance she is the best

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.540 
was definitely a chance she is the best
dog<00:01:23.960> hit<00:01:24.679> but<00:01:25.690> yeah<00:01:26.690> but<00:01:26.899> they<00:01:27.410> I<00:01:27.830> mean<00:01:28.160> I<00:01:28.369> think

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
dog hit but yeah but they I mean I think

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.100 
dog hit but yeah but they I mean I think
the<00:01:28.789> dogs<00:01:29.000> reality<00:01:29.479> it<00:01:29.539> around<00:01:29.780> it<00:01:29.990> and

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
the dogs reality it around it and

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.980 
the dogs reality it around it and
understood<00:01:30.530> that<00:01:30.970> Madonna<00:01:31.970> was<00:01:32.210> in<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.750> sled

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
understood that Madonna was in the sled

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.290 
understood that Madonna was in the sled
so<00:01:33.229> we<00:01:33.530> get<00:01:33.979> here<00:01:34.280> as<00:01:34.369> fast<00:01:34.399> as<00:01:34.850> possible

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
so we get here as fast as possible

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.790 
so we get here as fast as possible
because<00:01:35.360> they<00:01:35.599> started<00:01:35.929> pulling<00:01:36.170> harder<00:01:36.619> than

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
because they started pulling harder than

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.940 
because they started pulling harder than
they<00:01:37.520> do<00:01:37.580> at<00:01:37.729> all<00:01:37.880> all<00:01:38.569> the<00:01:39.020> race<00:01:39.200> so<00:01:39.470> far<00:01:39.500> as

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
as soon as I was on the top like King

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.550 
as soon as I was on the top like King
Solomon<00:02:22.819> was<00:02:23.420> like<00:02:23.599> hey<00:02:23.840> we're<00:02:24.140> getting<00:02:24.319> our

Solomon was like hey we're getting our

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.220 
Solomon was like hey we're getting our
snow<00:02:24.890> so<00:02:25.370> hopefully<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.270> continues<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.930> nap

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
snow so hopefully it continues a nap

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.619 
snow so hopefully it continues a nap
slows<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.250> trail<00:02:28.520> down<00:02:28.849> a<00:02:28.879> little<00:02:29.150> bit<00:02:29.420> for

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
slows the trail down a little bit for

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.330 
slows the trail down a little bit for
the<00:02:29.750> second<00:02:30.140> half<00:02:30.290> that's<00:02:30.650> gonna<00:02:30.860> that's

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
the second half that's gonna that's

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.400 
the second half that's gonna that's
gonna<00:02:31.790> work

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
gonna work

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.150 
gonna work
to<00:02:32.650> my<00:02:32.800> advantage<00:02:33.250> I<00:02:33.760> think<00:02:34.600> if<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:34.990> fit<00:02:35.890> get<00:02:36.040> to

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
to my advantage I think if I fit get to

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.660 
to my advantage I think if I fit get to
do<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.340> little<00:02:36.550> bit<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:37.050> slog<00:02:38.050> I<00:02:38.860> think<00:02:39.550> you

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
do a little bit of a slog I think you

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.810
