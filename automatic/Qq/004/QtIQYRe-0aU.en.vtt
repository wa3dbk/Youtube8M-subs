00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:15.380 
there you go there's the two light side

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.200 
there you go there's the two light side
by<00:00:15.530> side<00:00:15.710> on<00:00:15.889> the<00:00:16.009> right<00:00:16.160> and<00:00:16.460> you<00:00:16.670> can<00:00:16.700> see<00:00:16.849> the

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
by side on the right and you can see the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.359 
by side on the right and you can see the
new<00:00:17.390> glitzy<00:00:18.080> ones<00:00:18.290> at<00:00:18.560> land<00:00:18.770> rover<00:00:19.220> if

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
new glitzy ones at land rover if

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.790 
new glitzy ones at land rover if
designed<00:00:19.759> for<00:00:20.119> us<00:00:20.360> not<00:00:20.960> for<00:00:21.140> us<00:00:21.230> for<00:00:21.259> everybody

designed for us not for us for everybody

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.659 
designed for us not for us for everybody
to<00:00:22.520> help<00:00:22.700> them<00:00:22.820> sell<00:00:23.029> more<00:00:23.239> cars<00:00:23.480> on<00:00:23.810> the<00:00:24.669> 2012

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:25.669 
to help them sell more cars on the 2012

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.269 
to help them sell more cars on the 2012
one<00:00:25.910> model<00:00:26.270> Freelander<00:00:26.809> 2<00:00:26.840> or<00:00:27.169> lr<00:00:27.500> -<00:00:27.710> and

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
one model Freelander 2 or lr - and

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.959 
one model Freelander 2 or lr - and
there's<00:00:28.790> the<00:00:29.210> older<00:00:29.779> style<00:00:30.200> one<00:00:30.649> now<00:00:31.309> we

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
there's the older style one now we

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:33.250 
there's the older style one now we
thought<00:00:32.329> they're<00:00:32.599> mechanically<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.230> same

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
thought they're mechanically the same

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.110 
thought they're mechanically the same
shape<00:00:33.739> so<00:00:33.980> you<00:00:34.040> can<00:00:34.280> put<00:00:34.460> them<00:00:34.550> into<00:00:34.730> the<00:00:34.910> car

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
shape so you can put them into the car

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.360 
shape so you can put them into the car
no<00:00:35.360> problem<00:00:35.840> and<00:00:36.110> we<00:00:36.590> were<00:00:36.710> hoping<00:00:37.160> that<00:00:37.220> the

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
no problem and we were hoping that the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.120 
no problem and we were hoping that the
connector<00:00:37.850> plugs<00:00:38.150> on<00:00:38.450> the<00:00:38.480> back<00:00:39.140> would<00:00:39.560> be<00:00:39.830> the

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
connector plugs on the back would be the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.670 
connector plugs on the back would be the
same<00:00:40.400> but<00:00:40.970> they're<00:00:41.180> not<00:00:41.420> so<00:00:42.050> this<00:00:42.230> is<00:00:42.380> the<00:00:42.530> old

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
same but they're not so this is the old

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.210 
same but they're not so this is the old
plug<00:00:43.280> here<00:00:43.730> and<00:00:43.970> the<00:00:44.600> new<00:00:44.840> one<00:00:45.110> here<00:00:45.560> you<00:00:46.040> can

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
plug here and the new one here you can

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.370 
plug here and the new one here you can
see<00:00:46.400> is<00:00:46.520> completely<00:00:46.700> different<00:00:47.450> for<00:00:47.930> start<00:00:48.200> as

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
see is completely different for start as

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.350 
see is completely different for start as
one's<00:00:48.680> male<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.400> one<00:00:49.700> female

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
one's male and one female

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.569 
one's male and one female
now<00:00:50.750> where's<00:00:51.200> that<00:00:51.440> other<00:00:51.470> connector<00:00:52.310> I<00:00:52.340> had

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
now where's that other connector I had

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.580 
now where's that other connector I had
Tom<00:00:52.880> with<00:00:53.060> the<00:00:53.180> wires<00:00:53.420> can<00:00:53.840> I<00:00:53.930> just<00:00:54.200> grab<00:00:54.320> that

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
Tom with the wires can I just grab that

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.770 
Tom with the wires can I just grab that
for<00:00:54.770> a<00:00:54.829> moment

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
for a moment

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.240 
for a moment
thank<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:56.870> Tom<00:00:57.020> so<00:00:57.530> if<00:00:57.590> I<00:00:57.650> just<00:00:57.829> actually<00:00:58.040> put

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
thank you Tom so if I just actually put

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.889 
thank you Tom so if I just actually put
them<00:00:58.579> side-by-side<00:00:59.649> you<00:01:00.649> can<00:01:01.310> see<00:01:01.910> there<00:01:02.270> the

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
them side-by-side you can see there the

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.469 
them side-by-side you can see there the
new<00:01:03.200> connector<00:01:03.980> on<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.280> left<00:01:04.579> and<00:01:04.939> the<00:01:05.390> old

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
new connector on the left and the old

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:06.760 
new connector on the left and the old
connector<00:01:05.780> on<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.079> right<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:06.439> they're<00:01:06.590> not

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
connector on the right and they're not

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.910 
connector on the right and they're not
even<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:08.030> opposite<00:01:08.510> mating<00:01:08.990> path<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:09.680> it's

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
even the opposite mating path so it's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.310 
even the opposite mating path so it's
just<00:01:10.220> a<00:01:10.310> different<00:01:10.729> connector<00:01:11.210> system<00:01:11.420> so

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
just a different connector system so

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.860 
just a different connector system so
what<00:01:12.530> we've<00:01:12.680> done<00:01:12.950> here<00:01:13.010> on<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:14.210> old<00:01:14.420> car

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
what we've done here on the old car

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.230 
what we've done here on the old car
we've<00:01:15.650> we've<00:01:16.340> labeled<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:16.970> we'll<00:01:17.060> put<00:01:17.210> a

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
we've we've labeled and we'll put a

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.940 
we've we've labeled and we'll put a
diagram<00:01:17.810> somewhere<00:01:18.260> on<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.500> internet<00:01:18.799> for

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
diagram somewhere on the internet for

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.510 
diagram somewhere on the internet for
you<00:01:19.010> to<00:01:19.040> fine

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
you to fine

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.460 
you to fine
but<00:01:19.880> we've<00:01:20.000> basically<00:01:20.210> labeled<00:01:20.690> up<00:01:21.140> as<00:01:21.350> you

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
but we've basically labeled up as you

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.800 
but we've basically labeled up as you
can<00:01:21.620> see<00:01:21.860> here<00:01:22.250> what<00:01:22.820> each<00:01:22.970> of<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.270> functions

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
can see here what each of the functions

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.010 
can see here what each of the functions
of<00:01:24.170> this<00:01:24.320> connector<00:01:24.920> is<00:01:25.070> okay<00:01:25.970> so<00:01:26.750> what<00:01:26.780> we're

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
of this connector is okay so what we're

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.590 
of this connector is okay so what we're
going<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.170> try<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.409> do<00:01:27.590> now<00:01:27.799> is<00:01:28.130> snip<00:01:29.090> off<00:01:29.330> the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
going to try and do now is snip off the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.630 
going to try and do now is snip off the
Warriors<00:01:30.049> so<00:01:30.320> if<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.500> just<00:01:30.680> pass<00:01:30.860> that<00:01:31.190> to<00:01:31.400> a

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
Warriors so if I just pass that to a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.870 
Warriors so if I just pass that to a
party<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.330> camera<00:01:32.720> Tom<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.710> I'll<00:01:33.890> I'll<00:01:34.640> let

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880

upgrade<00:01:56.540> that<00:01:56.659> way<00:01:56.810> or<00:01:56.960> we<00:01:57.080> might<00:01:57.320> try<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:57.710> get

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
upgrade that way or we might try and get

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.380 
upgrade that way or we might try and get
somewhere<00:01:58.280> we'll<00:01:58.490> do<00:01:58.700> it<00:01:58.790> in<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:58.939> workshop

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
somewhere we'll do it in the workshop

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.700 
somewhere we'll do it in the workshop
and<00:01:59.570> solder<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:00.200> put<00:02:00.350> some<00:02:00.380> heat-shrink

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
and solder it and put some heat-shrink

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.100 
and solder it and put some heat-shrink
sleeving<00:02:01.280> over<00:02:01.700> for<00:02:01.939> you<00:02:02.150> and<00:02:02.299> then<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:02.930> can

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
sleeving over for you and then you can

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.070 
sleeving over for you and then you can
buy<00:02:03.259> them<00:02:03.470> plug-and-play<00:02:04.540> fed<00:02:05.540> demand<00:02:05.869> for

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
buy them plug-and-play fed demand for

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.210 
buy them plug-and-play fed demand for
that<00:02:06.170> we'll<00:02:06.290> try<00:02:06.409> and<00:02:06.560> get<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:06.770> done<00:02:07.009> so

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
that we'll try and get that done so

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.729 
that we'll try and get that done so
basically<00:02:08.090> what<00:02:08.750> we're<00:02:08.899> going<00:02:08.989> to<00:02:09.049> do<00:02:09.259> here<00:02:09.590> is

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
basically what we're going to do here is

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.220 
basically what we're going to do here is
just<00:02:10.189> snip<00:02:10.849> off<00:02:11.090> each<00:02:11.299> of<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.540> wires<00:02:11.749> but<00:02:12.049> what

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
just snip off each of the wires but what

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.190 
just snip off each of the wires but what
Allah<00:02:12.879> and<00:02:13.879> I<00:02:14.450> will<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.109> yet<00:02:15.469> most<00:02:15.769> whilst

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
Allah and I will it yet most whilst

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.479 
Allah and I will it yet most whilst
the<00:02:16.290> Morphin<00:02:16.560> will<00:02:16.680> give<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.040> connection

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
the Morphin will give you the connection

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.960 
the Morphin will give you the connection
diagram<00:02:17.870> later<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.319> we'll<00:02:20.069> leave<00:02:20.250> pretty<00:02:20.790> much

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
diagram later so we'll leave pretty much

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.559 
diagram later so we'll leave pretty much
as<00:02:21.180> much<00:02:21.360> as<00:02:21.390> we<00:02:21.660> can<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.890> we'll<00:02:23.040> just<00:02:23.569> snip

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
as much as we can and we'll just snip

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.460 
as much as we can and we'll just snip
these<00:02:24.870> or<00:02:25.379> roughly<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.370> same<00:02:26.580> length<00:02:27.470> okay

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
these or roughly the same length okay

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.759 
these or roughly the same length okay
and<00:02:29.510> then<00:02:30.510> we<00:02:30.660> work<00:02:30.900> out<00:02:31.140> how<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.410> put<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.680> all

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
and then we work out how to put it all

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.839 
and then we work out how to put it all
back<00:02:31.920> together<00:02:32.720> all<00:02:33.720> right<00:02:34.069> so<00:02:35.069> that's<00:02:35.459> that

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
back together all right so that's that

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.490 
back together all right so that's that
removed<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.630> basically<00:02:37.050> we're<00:02:37.319> going<00:02:37.410> to

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
removed and basically we're going to

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.370 
removed and basically we're going to
swap<00:02:37.769> that<00:02:38.010> for<00:02:38.970> that<00:02:39.090> now<00:02:39.690> we'll<00:02:39.870> go<00:02:39.989> away<00:02:40.200> and

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
swap that for that now we'll go away and

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.979 
swap that for that now we'll go away and
work<00:02:40.560> out<00:02:40.860> how<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.280> wire<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:42.000> up<00:02:42.090> now<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:42.630> we'll

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
work out how to wire it up now and we'll

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.660 
work out how to wire it up now and we'll
come<00:02:43.230> back<00:02:43.260> when<00:02:43.890> we've<00:02:44.069> worked<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.400> out<00:02:44.489> and

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
come back when we've worked it out and

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.940 
come back when we've worked it out and
show<00:02:44.819> you<00:02:44.880> how<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.090> light<00:02:45.360> then<00:02:45.629> here<00:02:46.410> we<00:02:46.500> go<00:02:46.680> so

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
show you how to light then here we go so

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.620 
show you how to light then here we go so
we<00:02:47.069> have<00:02:47.250> gone<00:02:47.549> through<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:48.120> worked<00:02:48.330> out

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
we have gone through and worked out

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.300 
we have gone through and worked out
which<00:02:48.930> wire<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.290> which<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:49.890> again

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
which wire is which and again

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.580 
which wire is which and again

here the bottom wire there is your fog
feed<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.750> one<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.170> goes<00:03:01.349> between<00:03:01.560> these

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
feed the one that goes between these

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.490 
feed the one that goes between these
bottom<00:03:02.310> two<00:03:02.640> is<00:03:03.420> joined<00:03:03.810> together<00:03:03.930> here

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
bottom two is joined together here

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.449 
bottom two is joined together here
that's<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:07.380> other<00:03:07.500> wire<00:03:07.769> on<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.130> bottom

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
that's the the other wire on this bottom

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.520 
that's the the other wire on this bottom
one<00:03:08.670> is<00:03:08.880> your<00:03:09.060> side<00:03:09.329> light<00:03:09.660> which<00:03:09.840> also<00:03:10.079> goes

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
one is your side light which also goes

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.580 
one is your side light which also goes
up<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.040> top<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:12.660> one<00:03:12.810> on<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.140> top<00:03:13.349> that's

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
up to the top the one on the top that's

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.190 
up to the top the one on the top that's
disconnected<00:03:13.980> is<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.430> brake<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.200> one

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
disconnected is the brake the one

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.110 
disconnected is the brake the one
nearest<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.220> middle<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.579> car<00:03:17.790> nearest

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
nearest the middle of a car nearest

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.990 
nearest the middle of a car nearest
these<00:03:18.299> screws<00:03:18.690> here<00:03:18.980> this<00:03:19.980> this<00:03:20.549> but<00:03:20.819> this

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
these screws here this this but this

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.180 
these screws here this this but this
area<00:03:21.660> here<00:03:21.870> is<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.109> indicator<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:22.859> the<00:03:22.980> wire

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
area here is the indicator so the wire

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.309 
area here is the indicator so the wire
that<00:03:23.459> you've<00:03:24.000> cut<00:03:24.269> that<00:03:24.420> goes<00:03:24.630> into<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:24.989> is

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
that you've cut that goes into that is

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.729 
that you've cut that goes into that is
indicator<00:03:25.889> and<00:03:26.340> then<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.720> one<00:03:28.019> that<00:03:28.560> goes

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
indicator and then the one that goes

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.670 
indicator and then the one that goes
into<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.190> middle<00:03:29.310> bit<00:03:29.670> there<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.389> reverse

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
into the middle bit there is the reverse

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.259 
into the middle bit there is the reverse
okay<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:32.160> what<00:03:32.370> we're<00:03:32.549> going<00:03:32.579> to<00:03:32.700> do<00:03:32.880> now<00:03:33.090> is

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
okay so what we're going to do now is

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.720 
okay so what we're going to do now is
we're<00:03:33.480> just<00:03:33.510> going<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:33.989> marry<00:03:34.739> those<00:03:35.040> up<00:03:35.370> to

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
we're just going to marry those up to

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.920 
we're just going to marry those up to
these<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:36.269> we're<00:03:36.389> going<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.569> see<00:03:36.720> if<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:36.900> all

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
these and we're going to see if it all

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.170 
these and we're going to see if it all
works<00:03:37.290> on<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.650> car<00:03:37.859> so<00:03:38.400> we'll<00:03:38.579> do<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:38.910> next

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
works on the car so we'll do that next

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.879 
works on the car so we'll do that next
right<00:03:39.600> so<00:03:39.900> we've<00:03:40.079> connected<00:03:40.620> them<00:03:40.769> up

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
right so we've connected them up
