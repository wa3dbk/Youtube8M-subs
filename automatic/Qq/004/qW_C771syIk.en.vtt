00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.350
 e 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.000
 hi to all and fra big there we are 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.779
 on nice gta where I show you a 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.840
 video showing you four locations 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:21.369
 UFOs so for three of these 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.400
 locations you have to finish the game at 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.509
 100% and cheat codes to change 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.590
 the time will be in the description 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:34.480
 so here we are in the first the 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.640
 first UFO it takes in English then the 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.850
 alien ship and there is one 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.949
 where there is just above them 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.199
 what is the name of the military base? 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.300
 so you go in a helicopter at the very top 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.329
 so there you can look at what act 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.559
 altitude i'm looking at the map 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.149
 we go left 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.329
 so you can drink it looks like a 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.739
 circle so he was shunning handsome 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.629
 graphics a circle 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.059
 you have to be in the circle and you 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.489
 look pretty much at this place and 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.600
 you will normally find the 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:10.240
 ship so here I am actually you 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.710
 have looked around at 3 bars you 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.660
 want to helicopter you can stay 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.740
 in a helicopter it's just that I actually 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.630
 had a lucky chance to find him 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.780
 I really struggled so it takes 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.200
 work you have to finish the game at 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.880
 100% and after a while there you 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.270
 go find the alien ship 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.700
 so there sorry it will not last 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.870
 forever because in fact I 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.880
 parachute while I could 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.270
 do the helicopter so that's it 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.390
 the location not its surroundings upstairs at 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.280
 left of the map you go there and 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.690
 Normally you find the ship 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.300
 alien then there we are 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.250
 we second location so with a 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.250
 ship of fbi 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.640
 I'm here it's the second one 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.799
 actually find you go to 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.860
 the location at the second location and 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.439
 marked save us you go by helicopter 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.990
 all the way down and in fact you go up in 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.770
 maths now have the trigger 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.179
 right 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.619
 you go to the top you touch to 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.519
 nothing and after a while you go 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.870
 hitting the the spaceship so this 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.790
 which is boring is actually when we 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.680
 approach too much and ben actually it does 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.200
 to cut the propellers in fact it's okay 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.690
 cut but that the luco does not accelerate anymore 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.290
 so after you go back to altitude and 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.200
 you can find it 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.400
 so here it is here so at 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.580
 middle right above the city 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.160
 towards the ocean where there is the 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.019
 great'mare enormously you will find 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.019
 the extraterrestrial spaceship 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.290
 so here I am going to show you the 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.750
 third 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.870
 so the third one is in the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.299
 sea ​​so he's pretty hot cia found 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.640
 I advise you to take an outfit 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.810
 dive so this one too that that 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.390
 I just showed there a moment ago 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.430
 it takes 100% you complete the game at 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.410
 100% but on the other hand what I want 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.700
 show no not at all you can 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.310
 do for example if you're done 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.890
 the game at 50% you can still 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.549
 access so he's at the very top of the 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.200
 ba you can see in the sea in 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.959
 the ocean you lie about the same thing 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.100
 you go all the way down you can also 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.350
 go with a submarine 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.530
 so I used a cheat for 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.450
 to be to have the god mode and that's a 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.430
 beautiful UFO scratch and in the ocean 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.260
 so he's really gorgeous he's 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.780
 really or so huge and besides 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.840
 can access it closely so it's 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.480
 really not bad at all here after 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.139
 you can see again where you 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.540
 so want the fourth location there 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:54.299
 lies 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.560
 how to say to the cable car so to 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.880
 access more easily you can 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.439
 take the left cable car 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.659
 went straight to that one right 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.700
 so where there is the location of the 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:09.890
 parachute 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.930
 you also have a wall with me I know 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.840
 not how to explain illuminati with 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.680
 the eye the pyramid and all that so I 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.889
 you make a small plan with kinematics 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.990
 you see well or so so for 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.850
 keep longer makes you a 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.780
 screenshot or whatever you want at 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.669
 same place you go right next to the 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.650
 cable car 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.780
 you go up here or there where there are 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.360
 Motocross and Norman next door 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.139
 they tell you to do to finish the 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.070
 campaign 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:46.010
 so in fact to have the 100% pure for 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.310
 provide extraterrestrials and that's 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.720
 between hull 3am and 8am and he 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.760
 must it rain or thunderstorms 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.110
 you can use cheats codes and 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.479
 after while you're just backing up 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.100
 before you look at the spaceship 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.510
 after you go back to your backup 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.350
 like that you can still 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.850
 win trophies and successes so 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.460
 there I activate lots of cheat codes 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.970
 I think it's about 3h 4am and 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.860
 hop another ship that appears so 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.990
 I think it's between 3 and 8 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.400
 three o'clock in the morning i'm on 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.940
 my eight o'clock I'm not sure at all 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:28.910
 so it would have to be a bit more 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:30.050
 accurate so that's so at the end of this 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.880
 video I showed you the location 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.580
 but that's good next to the cable cars 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.100
 you see pretty much how you put 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.530
 at long sight and so here I am you 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.169
 leave the end of the video on a beauf 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.530
 fireworks to celebrate the end of this 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.860
 video 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:48.110
 here it was fra big on gta 5 ibos 360 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.310
 even if it works on ps3 I do you 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.450
 big kisses as usual 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.450
 are you going to have everyone
