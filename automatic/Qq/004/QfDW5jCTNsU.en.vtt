00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.570
 to say there is something fantastic 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.690
 also considered that most 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.610
 of you are active and this reason has 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.730
 more and more to make it more and more video 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.680

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.750

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.300
 really guys means so much to me 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.500
 see all of you commenting 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.000

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.620
 here are people with the skin air that I am

 I still shoot the stream so thank you 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.649
 for the 4000 it will not be a special one there 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.140
 I'll do it for the 5,000 and then if we get there 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.329
 also for the ten thousand because I made them 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.780
 too many specials for now so me 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.820
 after a moment to stop is to make them 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.170
 for much higher figures now 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.420
 so for the 5000 there will be another 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.540
 special and for the ten thousand another 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.220
 still however this is said yesterday 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.900
 we had a beautiful day 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.470
 in the square all together a beautiful one 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.960
 evening 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.330
 we were with 130 we did an open 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.460
 unorganized lobby to divide the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.180
 wife I dani alesi depicted the ex 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.380
 flame we really did everything 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.689
 I think you all had fun 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.180
 how many we went to for example in mine 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.810

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.180
 Minecraft kids is also the others 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.290
 boys or girls we also have 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.509
 encountered a clue that it was too much 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.700
 nice or life bean is 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.470
 he practically had type 4 shut is not 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.810
 He went to live 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.729
 we arrived in 130 to destroy them 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.960
 correct to write the hearts you are good 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.479
 bla bla 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.640
 in short, nice things to improve 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.040
 the day to someone especially to 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.530
 kids because I liked it is the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.439
 guy loved us guys loved so much 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.060
 in fact he writes that he almost said like you 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.160
 the great don't know me you came 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.550
 we told him 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.890
 ps have not been made we told them 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.300
 but to become an inquiry but it makes me have it 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.220
 said he unfortunately did not have the 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.380
 computer and had no team speed though if 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.480
 he wasn't buying that was he was 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.400
 buying ts from mobile only for 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.590
 it was too much to talk to us 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.240
 happy and knows what I liked so much 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.710
 because we also made others 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.840
 kids a little younger than that 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.670
 they played minecraft that from scratch 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.100
 spectators were of type 700 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.350
 comments 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.050
 in the comments section it is type 120 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.970
 100 spectators and obviously boys 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.680
 we improve, that is, improve the day 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.190
 something like that to those who are doing 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.050
 one live 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.860
 then others of course we are too 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.240
 members of their tweet channel is nice 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.240
 because they really didn't know 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.850
 what was going on was all weird 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.650
 for them because while you streamy from a 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.600
 moment to the next bomet arrive 120 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.330
 people you know to write gigi ai 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.950
 fan origins and stuff like that is I think 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.440
 that anyone would have been very happy 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.000
 of a stuff like that so we're at it 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.010
 we enjoyed doing good too 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.950
 because this is doing good precisely that 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.900
 yes the guys were happy and we're there 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.020
 enjoy us later in the evening we are 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.459
 It was me and made with you with another 60's 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.660
 you spoke like 2 at night 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.730
 still you were in 60 we have there 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.550
 disassembled 11 to make you say a sentence in the 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.790
 your dialect and the not-so-good laughs 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.070
 you have any idea we died from laughter 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.470
 for certain people, especially for the 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.760
 veneto which I adore Veneto dialect for 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.709
 me is beautiful 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.190
 here comes out an absurd thing and then to 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.410
 ischia put it with a bang and stuff 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.050
 messages, that is, robe recordings 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.850
 anyway we had so much fun e 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.130
 this is the community I want one 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.950
 community unit that you support a 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.920
 each other is that he enjoys following us 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.050
 that is updated to our posts at 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.840
 our events because exactly as I said 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.750
 we will always do events in ps not 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.270
 maybe not 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.790
 if Rome often we will often do these 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.710
 events and on the Sunday there will be 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.020
 but another open no b this time 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.640
 will be for larger pro lobbies with 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.040
 with everyone there will also be hicks 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.840
 dani there will be flame there will be among the ex ci 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.549
 it will be anesi we will all be there 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.160
 and since you have noticed store laganÃ  not 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.290
 I know why that happens to telecom but or 120 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.440
 ms that I don't really have that many 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.690
 details more than anything else interested me 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.550
 talking during this video is not me 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.350
 it matters a lot in pvp and otherwise i would be 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.960
 went into the runs he has among other things for 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.120
 who tells me is that from the judge that today 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.120
 interested in the pp but not even decades 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.430
 1840 euros which is very high blah and not 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.440
 you make videos but it's obvious because if you don't 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.080
 I should engage more obvious that lello 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.700
 I want it because I play too but the 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.310
 fact is that my channel is not 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.140
 set to the minecraft pvp but I don't have 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.090
 never said that the ppd minecraft beyond 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.190
 yard I don't like it doesn't amuse me 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.830
 I simply like to play for 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.960
 have fun and make videos for per 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.360
 entertain you because if you had to do 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.160
 video mair also boys should 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.669
 concentrate in 100 times more and 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.720
 I would lose it I would be frustrated 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.900
 then bad videos would also come 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.800
 I also play trudges and then boh 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.690
 Decide it for us to let it be to you 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.410
 this video to 500 to the one I make myself 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.850
 another game was also despite or 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.250
 1840 euros so I could lose it is 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.120
 acting but will never reach 500 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.950
 like to say therefore there is no risk 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.750
 then other things I wanted to talk about 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.360
 guys soon format the pc a lot 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.430
 probably a video will be released tomorrow 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.500
 after this video let out another 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.600
 I recorded everything today when I say 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.820
 precisely that I'm forming the pc is that 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.560
 I probably won't be able to answer 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.910
 new comments 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.560
 or the comments of this video is 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.690
 of the other still because they will be 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.000
 simply programmed in the channel in 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.220
 so that they go out alone and I will be without 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.500
 pc for a couple of days because you know 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.570
 that I am having problems in the south of 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.180
 vals bike and they did not do it alone 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.949
 here sometimes even while in the register 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.690
 also other games as it unlocks 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.259
 milano this is a big big one 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.889
 problem 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:13.479
 then for those who tell me kendall but 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:15.400
 you investigate if almost always with yours 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.350
 friends you're not not entering the room 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.710
 publish with us but I want to play 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.960
 with you otherwise what sense to tsr girls 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.160
 obviously I have to be with my parents too 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.840
 friends in the sense 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.180
 I too want to play is not who I am 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.199
 a zoo monkey that I have to force 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.060
 stay around the clock 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:34.090
 with you it makes no sense 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.770
 I understand it and I hope, however, the evening a 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.509
 part of the events etc in the evening 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.370

 events uainbar lion so I don't come 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.410

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.910
 anyway people came and told me 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.800

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.759
 record the video again for tomorrow 

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:38.680
 where I'll tell you this by formatting 

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:41.020
 etc. so don't panic if not 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.030
 should a video come out there was nothing there 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.099
 feelings suffering in my best 

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.050
 so this video will be out today 

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:49.120

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.919

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.930
 pcs the next day does not come out a 

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:55.750
 another video understood for what reason though 

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:57.460

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.960

00:07:59.409 --> 00:08:03.669
 as before and I have no more fps problems 

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.050
