still have your icons on the screen only

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
still have your icons on the screen only
because<00:02:27.459> apple<00:02:28.090> doesn't<00:02:28.959> allow<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:30.030> put

windows on the PC operating system

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.550 
windows on the PC operating system
allows<00:02:37.329> you<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.600> put<00:02:37.750> your<00:02:37.870> icons<00:02:38.260> where<00:02:38.470> you

want on the Apple devices you cannot now

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.000 
want on the Apple devices you cannot now
I<00:02:42.790> know<00:02:42.910> this<00:02:43.120> looks<00:02:43.180> tedious<00:02:43.690> there<00:02:44.680> used<00:02:44.890> to

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
I know this looks tedious there used to

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.370 
I know this looks tedious there used to
be<00:02:45.069> another<00:02:45.510> tweak<00:02:46.510> that<00:02:46.780> worked<00:02:47.019> really<00:02:47.260> good

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
be another tweak that worked really good

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.039 
be another tweak that worked really good
to<00:02:47.920> do<00:02:48.040> this<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.430> was<00:02:48.519> called<00:02:48.760> gridlock<00:02:49.299> where

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
to do this it was called gridlock where

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.840 
to do this it was called gridlock where
it<00:02:50.170> would<00:02:50.500> allow<00:02:50.889> you<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.190> put<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.489> icons

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
it would allow you to put the icons

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.740 
it would allow you to put the icons
anywhere<00:02:52.269> but<00:02:52.959> since<00:02:53.769> upgrading<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.519> 6.1<00:02:55.420> and

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
anywhere but since upgrading to 6.1 and
