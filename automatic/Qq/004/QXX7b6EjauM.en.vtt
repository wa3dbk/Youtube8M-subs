I was introduced to freeform pro earlier
this<00:00:35.910> year<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.930> has<00:00:37.079> completely<00:00:37.649> changed

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
this year and it has completely changed

this year and it has completely changed
the<00:00:38.399> way<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.670> build<00:00:39.180> characters<00:00:39.660> heads<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.230> used

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the way I build characters heads I used

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.740 
the way I build characters heads I used
to<00:00:40.680> do<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> lot<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.070> tricks<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.969> methods<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.510> try

to do a lot of tricks and methods to try
and<00:00:42.930> make<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.140> work<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.770> was<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> slow

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and make it work and it was a slow

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.069 
and make it work and it was a slow
arduous<00:00:44.520> process<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.840> has<00:00:46.050> changed

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
arduous process but this has changed

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.440 
arduous process but this has changed
everything<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.879> rotate

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
everything as you can see I can rotate

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.260 
everything as you can see I can rotate
freely<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.289> wide<00:00:49.590> range<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.280> motion<00:00:50.760> both<00:00:51.030> on

x y&amp;z axes this was all done with the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.790 
x y&amp;z axes this was all done with the
drawing<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.870> character's<00:00:55.260> head<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.680> was

can i create a 3d head and manipulated

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.179 
can i create a 3d head and manipulated
around<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:07.110> i<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.350> also<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.159> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
around but i can also do that to a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.250 
around but i can also do that to a
nested<00:01:08.670> composition<00:01:09.299> which<00:01:09.479> allows<00:01:09.780> me<00:01:10.049> to

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
nested composition which allows me to

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.230 
nested composition which allows me to
create<00:01:10.409> blinks<00:01:11.010> let<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> odd<00:01:11.729> make<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> eyes

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
create blinks let the odd make the eyes

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
and the cheeks and the eyebrows and

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.070 
and the cheeks and the eyebrows and
actually<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.090> distort<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.630> displacement

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
actually have it distort a displacement

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.950

map<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.619> real<00:01:19.860> time<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.630> see<00:01:21.659> I've

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
map in real time and as you can see I've

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.749 
map in real time and as you can see I've
built<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.380> number<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.770> sliders<00:01:23.070> here<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.670> I

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
built a number of sliders here that I

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.030 
built a number of sliders here that I
can<00:01:23.939> use<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.420> change<00:01:24.930> his<00:01:25.140> facial<00:01:25.500> expressions

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
can use to change his facial expressions

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.120 
can use to change his facial expressions
and<00:01:26.220> manipulate<00:01:26.700> his<00:01:26.880> eyes<00:01:27.500> everything<00:01:28.500> from

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and manipulate his eyes everything from

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.030 
and manipulate his eyes everything from
his<00:01:29.759> blinking<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.990> his<00:01:31.170> interest<00:01:31.590> distance

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
his blinking to his interest distance

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.590 
his blinking to his interest distance
for<00:01:32.280> his<00:01:32.400> pupils<00:01:32.820> going<00:01:33.180> cross-eyed

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
for his pupils going cross-eyed

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.219 
for his pupils going cross-eyed
wall-eyed<00:01:33.930> his<00:01:34.490> pupil<00:01:35.490> size<00:01:35.700> his<00:01:36.689> eyebrows

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
wall-eyed his pupil size his eyebrows

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.950 
wall-eyed his pupil size his eyebrows
both<00:01:37.680> left<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.250> right<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.909> both<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.659> them

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
both left and right and both of them

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.719 
both left and right and both of them
together<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> can<00:01:40.860> manipulate<00:01:41.100> each<00:01:41.520> one

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
together so I can manipulate each one

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.810 
together so I can manipulate each one
individually<00:01:42.000> or<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.869> group<00:01:42.990> i<00:01:43.530> also<00:01:44.399> have

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
individually or as a group i also have

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.730 
individually or as a group i also have
an<00:01:45.149> anger<00:01:45.540> one<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.079> brings<00:01:46.200> his<00:01:46.380> eyebrows

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
an anger one so that brings his eyebrows

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.440 
an anger one so that brings his eyebrows
closer<00:01:47.070> together<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.880> make<00:01:48.000> him<00:01:48.149> look<00:01:48.210> more

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
closer together to make him look more

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.929 
closer together to make him look more
angry<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.229> also<00:01:49.380> brings<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:50.250> squints<00:01:50.820> up

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
angry and it also brings up squints up

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.460 
angry and it also brings up squints up
his<00:01:51.060> cheeks<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.450> little<00:01:51.479> bit

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
his cheeks a little bit

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.210 
his cheeks a little bit
and<00:01:53.000> then<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.030> have<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> smile<00:01:54.750> control<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.770> a

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
and then I have a smile control and a

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.560 
and then I have a smile control and a
mouth<00:01:56.430> shape<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.060> can<00:01:57.270> create<00:01:57.540> multiple

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
mouth shape so I can create multiple

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.750 
mouth shape so I can create multiple
mouth<00:01:58.170> shapes<00:01:58.560> which<00:01:58.830> are<00:01:58.980> nested<00:01:59.400> into<00:01:59.640> the

mouth shapes which are nested into the
head<00:01:59.910> composition<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.810> can<00:02:01.320> manipulate<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
expressions on top of that it created a

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.050

him<00:02:24.390> breathe<00:02:24.600> convincingly<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.560> can

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
him breathe convincingly so I can

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.380 
him breathe convincingly so I can
actually<00:02:25.860> just<00:02:26.130> animate<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:26.700> slider<00:02:27.030> and

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
actually just animate this slider and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.670 
actually just animate this slider and
not<00:02:27.720> have<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.990> think<00:02:28.200> about<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.530> while<00:02:28.620> I

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
not have to think about it while I

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.870 
not have to think about it while I
animate<00:02:29.070> all<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.310> other<00:02:29.430> parts<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.820> the

puppet<00:02:31.800> that<00:02:31.890> is<00:02:31.980> significantly<00:02:32.670> different

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
puppet that is significantly different

from<00:02:33.150> puppets<00:02:33.660> I've<00:02:33.780> done<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.170> past<00:02:34.320> is

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
from puppets I've done in the past is

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.620 
from puppets I've done in the past is
that<00:02:34.770> it<00:02:34.860> uses<00:02:35.010> inverse<00:02:35.490> kinematics<00:02:36.090> this<00:02:36.510> is

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
that it uses inverse kinematics this is

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.840 
that it uses inverse kinematics this is
a<00:02:36.660> major<00:02:37.050> time<00:02:37.470> saver<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:38.190> used<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.670> have<00:02:38.760> to

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
a major time saver I used to have to

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.000 
a major time saver I used to have to
rotate<00:02:39.209> each<00:02:39.450> joint<00:02:39.870> manually<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.830> make<00:02:40.980> a

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
rotate each joint manually to make a

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.890 
rotate each joint manually to make a
character<00:02:41.370> move<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.000> now<00:02:42.450> with<00:02:42.630> inverse

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
character move and now with inverse

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.990 
character move and now with inverse
kinematics<00:02:43.470> he's<00:02:43.650> really<00:02:44.310> really<00:02:44.580> simple<00:02:44.850> to

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
kinematics he's really really simple to

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.090 
kinematics he's really really simple to
make<00:02:45.180> him<00:02:45.330> move<00:02:45.510> it's<00:02:45.750> easier<00:02:46.110> than<00:02:46.260> ever<00:02:46.470> this

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
make him move it's easier than ever this

paired it with the puppet tool which has

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.539 
paired it with the puppet tool which has
actually<00:03:28.080> enabled<00:03:28.470> me<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.650> create<00:03:28.980> smooth

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.539 
actually enabled me to create smooth
distortions<00:03:30.540> with<00:03:31.080> single<00:03:31.739> layers<00:03:32.010> like<00:03:32.400> an

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
distortions with single layers like an

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.320 
distortions with single layers like an
arm<00:03:32.820> or<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.209> leg<00:03:33.420> or<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.110> torso<00:03:34.860> or<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.220> shirt<00:03:36.000> so<00:03:36.239> as

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
arm or a leg or a torso or a shirt so as

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.120 
arm or a leg or a torso or a shirt so as
you<00:03:36.450> can<00:03:36.570> see<00:03:36.750> I'm<00:03:36.870> bending<00:03:37.080> his<00:03:37.320> torso<00:03:37.650> and

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
you can see I'm bending his torso and

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.280 
you can see I'm bending his torso and
that's<00:03:38.489> just<00:03:38.610> one<00:03:39.060> drawing<00:03:39.480> i<00:03:39.750> haven't<00:03:40.080> had<00:03:40.140> to

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
that's just one drawing i haven't had to

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.440 
that's just one drawing i haven't had to
split<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.830> segment<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:41.459> up<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:42.060> way<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.269> used

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
split and segment it up the way you used

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.930 
split and segment it up the way you used
to<00:03:42.720> have<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.930> do<00:03:43.080> cutout<00:03:43.470> animation<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:44.340> after

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
to have to do cutout animation in after

effects on top of everything else I've

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.820 
effects on top of everything else I've
made<00:03:47.880> some<00:03:48.090> fairly<00:03:48.390> specific<00:03:48.780> hand<00:03:49.320> controls

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
made some fairly specific hand controls

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.370 
made some fairly specific hand controls
the<00:03:50.459> sliders<00:03:50.940> in<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.180> effects<00:03:51.510> box<00:03:51.810> actually

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
the sliders in the effects box actually

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.890 
the sliders in the effects box actually
control<00:03:52.769> how<00:03:52.980> much<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.640> fingers<00:03:54.030> Bend<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.510> have

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
control how much the fingers Bend I have

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.539 
control how much the fingers Bend I have
one<00:03:55.110> for<00:03:55.470> all<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.890> fingers<00:03:56.190> where<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.430> can

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
one for all the fingers where you can

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.190 
one for all the fingers where you can
select<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.030> open<00:03:57.180> or<00:03:57.600> close<00:03:57.780> them<00:03:57.989> all<00:03:58.080> at

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
select and open or close them all at

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.410 
select and open or close them all at
once<00:03:58.440> or<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.950> can<00:03:59.340> individually<00:03:59.910> select<00:04:00.239> each

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
once or you can individually select each

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
right here on top of that I can control

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.310 
right here on top of that I can control
the<00:04:29.500> angle<00:04:29.890> of<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.220> toe<00:04:30.460> for<00:04:30.940> walking<00:04:31.390> using

once you have all of these elements

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.909 
once you have all of these elements
combined<00:04:36.940> you<00:04:37.150> get<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.300> very<00:04:37.630> versatile<00:04:38.320> puppet

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
combined you get a very versatile puppet

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.070 
combined you get a very versatile puppet
one<00:04:39.370> that<00:04:39.520> can<00:04:39.669> suit<00:04:39.940> most<00:04:40.210> of<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.540> animation

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
are actually quite simple they just seem

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.720 
are actually quite simple they just seem
complex<00:04:47.500> because<00:04:47.770> they're<00:04:48.070> all<00:04:48.160> stacked<00:04:48.490> on

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730
