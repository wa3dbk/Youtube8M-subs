00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.780 

let's<00:00:04.470> take<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:04.680> look<00:00:04.890> at<00:00:05.009> my<00:00:05.040> pole<00:00:05.609> vector

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
let's take a look at my pole vector

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.709 
let's take a look at my pole vector
constraint<00:00:08.120> within<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.240> scene<00:00:09.420> we<00:00:09.570> have<00:00:09.690> a

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
constraint within the scene we have a

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.669 
constraint within the scene we have a
very<00:00:09.900> basic<00:00:10.260> leg<00:00:10.889> reg<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.730> like<00:00:11.969> chain<00:00:12.679> it's

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
very basic leg reg the like chain it's

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.430 
very basic leg reg the like chain it's
been<00:00:13.830> connected<00:00:14.340> with<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:15.139> rotate<00:00:16.139> plane

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
been connected with a rotate plane

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.950 
been connected with a rotate plane
solver<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.609> if<00:00:17.699> we<00:00:17.760> were<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.940> grab<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.449> legs

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
solver so if we were to grab the legs

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.349 
solver so if we were to grab the legs
animation<00:00:19.529> control<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.939> see<00:00:21.090> we<00:00:21.240> have

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
animation control you see we have

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.840 
animation control you see we have
inverse<00:00:21.990> kinematics<00:00:22.619> okay<00:00:22.980> now<00:00:23.640> with<00:00:23.760> this

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
inverse kinematics okay now with this

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.150 
inverse kinematics okay now with this

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
very basic rig you'll see that

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.640 
very basic rig you'll see that
eventually<00:00:26.310> as<00:00:26.849> we<00:00:27.029> start<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.930> transform<00:00:28.529> this

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
eventually as we start to transform this

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.339 
eventually as we start to transform this
control<00:00:29.099> up<00:00:29.310> eventually<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.599> run<00:00:30.840> into<00:00:30.990> some

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
control up eventually we run into some

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.110 
control up eventually we run into some
very<00:00:31.470> bad<00:00:31.769> twisting<00:00:32.399> as<00:00:33.140> we<00:00:34.140> cross<00:00:34.440> over<00:00:35.120> this

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
very bad twisting as we cross over this

control this twisting let's go ahead and

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.610 
control this twisting let's go ahead and
take<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.390> look<00:00:51.480> at<00:00:51.780> them<00:00:51.960> well<00:00:52.170> i'll<00:00:52.469> go<00:00:52.590> ahead

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
take a look at them well i'll go ahead

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.430 
take a look at them well i'll go ahead
and<00:00:52.770> leave<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.160> leg<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:54.170> select<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> ik

handle start to scroll down until we

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.040 
handle start to scroll down until we
find<00:00:57.870> our<00:00:58.140> PO<00:00:58.949> vector<00:00:59.340> channels<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.809> we're<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
find our PO vector channels so we're to

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.750 
find our PO vector channels so we're to
use<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.350> x<00:01:01.500> axis<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.510> animate<00:01:03.510> twist<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:05.640> we

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
use the x axis to animate twist and we

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.560 
use the x axis to animate twist and we
also<00:01:05.909> have<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:07.010> twist<00:01:08.010> attribute<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:09.270> further

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
also have a twist attribute for further

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.490 
also have a twist attribute for further
control<00:01:11.299> however<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.170> not<00:01:13.290> too

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
control however this is not too

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.920 
control however this is not too
convenient<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.250> animation<00:01:14.820> ideally<00:01:15.780> an

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
convenient for animation ideally an

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.469 
convenient for animation ideally an
animator<00:01:16.350> would<00:01:16.650> like<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.520> control

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
animator would like to have a a control

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.550 
animator would like to have a a control
and<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> scene<00:01:19.939> to<00:01:21.320> position<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> knee

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
and the scene to position the knee

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.560 
and the scene to position the knee
wherever<00:01:23.130> he<00:01:23.640> or<00:01:23.670> she<00:01:23.880> would<00:01:24.150> like<00:01:24.390> the

wherever he or she would like the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.730 
wherever he or she would like the
control<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.140> be<00:01:25.290> for<00:01:25.770> their<00:01:26.310> performance<00:01:27.740> so

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
control to be for their performance so

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.550 
control to be for their performance so
you<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:30.060> how<00:01:30.090> how<00:01:30.479> daunting<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.200> would<00:01:31.380> be

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
you can see how how daunting it would be

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.219 
you can see how how daunting it would be

back to its default posso simply go

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.450 
back to its default posso simply go
ahead<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.450> zero<00:02:00.780> out<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.460> translate

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
ahead and zero out the translate

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.880 
ahead and zero out the translate
channels<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.090> we<00:02:03.810> could<00:02:03.930> always<00:02:04.049> work<00:02:04.320> with<00:02:04.530> a

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
channels and we could always work with a

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.330 
channels and we could always work with a
locator<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.469> use<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.770> as<00:02:07.950> our<00:02:08.129> knee

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340

clean up our transform channels so if we

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.759 
ever need to get back to the spine codes
it's<00:03:30.180> just<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.480> matter<00:03:30.630> of<00:03:30.780> zeroing<00:03:31.380> out<00:03:31.500> our

going<00:04:35.160> back<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:35.430> what<00:04:35.700> we<00:04:35.820> saw<00:04:36.030> before<00:04:36.060> when<00:04:36.660> we

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
going back to what we saw before when we

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.650 
going back to what we saw before when we
grabbed<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.230> leg<00:04:37.380> control<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:37.920> start<00:04:38.100> to

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
grabbed the leg control and start to

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.880 
grabbed the leg control and start to
started<00:04:39.660> to<00:04:39.750> bring<00:04:39.960> that<00:04:40.080> up<00:04:40.140> and<00:04:40.440> we<00:04:40.560> rent<00:04:40.770> it

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
started to bring that up and we rent it

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.190 
started to bring that up and we rent it
to<00:04:40.920> some<00:04:41.190> twisting<00:04:41.610> can<00:04:42.090> see<00:04:42.240> how<00:04:42.300> leg<00:04:42.930> is<00:04:43.050> now

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
to some twisting can see how leg is now

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.460 
to some twisting can see how leg is now
upside<00:04:43.410> down<00:04:43.800> no<00:04:44.070> problem<00:04:44.370> at<00:04:44.430> all<00:04:44.520> we<00:04:44.670> simply

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
upside down no problem at all we simply

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.280 
upside down no problem at all we simply
adjust<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.680> pole<00:04:47.010> vector<00:04:47.160> control<00:04:47.760> to<00:04:48.290> fix

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
adjust the pole vector control to fix

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.930 
adjust the pole vector control to fix
that<00:04:50.660> if<00:04:51.660> we<00:04:51.810> were<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.200> select<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:53.310> ik<00:04:53.490> handle

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
that if we were to select the ik handle

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.450 
that if we were to select the ik handle
again<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:54.360> can<00:04:54.480> see<00:04:54.510> all<00:04:54.980> three<00:04:55.980> pole<00:04:56.310> vector

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
again you can see all three pole vector

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.730 
again you can see all three pole vector
channels<00:04:57.000> have<00:04:57.270> been<00:04:57.630> locked<00:04:58.230> down<00:04:58.350> by<00:04:58.680> the

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
channels have been locked down by the

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.480 
channels have been locked down by the
constraint<00:04:59.960> so<00:05:00.960> that's<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.200> look<00:05:01.380> at<00:05:01.620> mayas

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
constraint so that's a look at mayas

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.340 
constraint so that's a look at mayas
pole<00:05:03.150> vector<00:05:03.420> control<00:05:04.230> a<00:05:04.500> way<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.370> control

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
pole vector control a way to control

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.980 
pole vector control a way to control
twisting<00:05:07.350> on<00:05:07.530> all<00:05:08.280> ik<00:05:08.640> handles<00:05:09.390> that<00:05:09.660> have

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
twisting on all ik handles that have

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.700 
twisting on all ik handles that have
twist<00:05:10.950> asst<00:05:11.190> so<00:05:11.640> this<00:05:11.790> would<00:05:12.000> apply<00:05:12.210> for<00:05:12.710> apply

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
twist asst so this would apply for apply

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.570 
twist asst so this would apply for apply
to<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:15.530> rotate<00:05:16.530> plane<00:05:16.740> solver<00:05:17.160> it<00:05:17.310> could<00:05:17.430> also

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
to the rotate plane solver it could also

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.610 
to the rotate plane solver it could also
be<00:05:17.730> used<00:05:17.850> for<00:05:18.180> maya's<00:05:19.160> spring<00:05:20.160> softer
