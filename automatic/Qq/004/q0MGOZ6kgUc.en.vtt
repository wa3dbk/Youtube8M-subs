this<00:00:06.390> isn't<00:00:06.660> gonna<00:00:06.750> work<00:00:06.839> for<00:00:06.990> me<00:00:07.200> well<00:00:07.410> hold

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
this isn't gonna work for me well hold

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.249 
this isn't gonna work for me well hold
off<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.580> edge<00:00:11.780> what<00:00:12.780> you're<00:00:12.929> gonna<00:00:13.019> want

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
off to the edge what you're gonna want

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.420 
off to the edge what you're gonna want
to<00:00:13.349> do<00:00:13.759> is<00:00:14.759> see<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.000> half<00:00:15.330> circle<00:00:16.310> you<00:00:17.310> want

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
to do is see that half circle you want

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.759 
to do is see that half circle you want
to<00:00:17.580> make<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.000> circle<00:00:19.070> so<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.100> always<00:00:20.340> start

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
to make it a circle so I always start

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.089 
to make it a circle so I always start
with<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:22.830> half<00:00:23.220> moon<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:24.410> then<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.439> move<00:00:25.859> this

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
with that half moon and then I move this

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.189 
with that half moon and then I move this
thing<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:27.029> where<00:00:27.119> it's<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.390> full<00:00:27.660> moon<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.109> when

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
thing to where it's a full moon and when

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.279 
thing to where it's a full moon and when
I<00:00:28.230> back<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.859> off<00:00:29.420> it<00:00:30.420> should<00:00:30.689> smoke<00:00:31.050> within

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
I back that off it should smoke within

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.120 
I back that off it should smoke within
seconds<00:00:31.949> if<00:00:32.250> you've<00:00:32.520> got<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.910> right<00:00:33.120> okay<00:00:34.130> so

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
seconds if you've got it right okay so

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.139 
seconds if you've got it right okay so
you<00:00:35.190> start<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:36.500> diffuse<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.829> then<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.910> back

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
you start to diffuse and then you back

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.260 
you start to diffuse and then you back
it<00:00:39.360> off<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.930> tell<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.860> pinpoints<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.850> Alam

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
it off and tell it pinpoints and Alam

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.760 
it off and tell it pinpoints and Alam
this<00:00:42.540> should<00:00:42.690> immediately<00:00:42.989> be<00:00:43.379> action

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
this should immediately be action

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.420 
this should immediately be action
happening<00:00:44.190> or<00:00:44.550> you're<00:00:44.789> fucking<00:00:45.149> out<00:00:46.430> and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
happening or you're fucking out and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.160 
happening or you're fucking out and
usually<00:00:48.030> how<00:00:48.180> you're<00:00:48.360> doing<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.989> your

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
usually how you're doing that is your

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:58.099 
usually how you're doing that is your
angles<00:00:49.640> there<00:00:50.640> are<00:00:50.700> two<00:00:50.850> diffuse<00:00:56.930> I'm<00:00:57.930> gonna

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
angles there are two diffuse I'm gonna

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.599 
angles there are two diffuse I'm gonna
get<00:00:58.260> right<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.739> area<00:00:58.949> here<00:00:59.160> and

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
get right in this area here and

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.630 
get right in this area here and
eventually<00:01:00.420> I'm<00:01:00.510> gonna<00:01:00.660> have<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.079> shade<00:01:01.320> it

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
eventually I'm gonna have to shade it

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.189 
eventually I'm gonna have to shade it
we'll<00:01:02.640> put<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.000> right<00:01:03.120> down<00:01:03.510> look<00:01:03.930> familiar

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
we'll put this right down look familiar

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:15.830 
we'll put this right down look familiar
right<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.460> we'll<00:01:05.610> back<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.850> up

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.510 

just<00:01:16.840> without<00:01:17.200> most<00:01:17.409> breathing<00:01:17.979> it<00:01:18.070> starts<00:01:18.399> to

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
just without most breathing it starts to

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.249 
just without most breathing it starts to
dance<00:01:18.729> around<00:01:19.119> anyway<00:01:19.600> I'm<00:01:19.720> just<00:01:19.750> gonna<00:01:20.049> do<00:01:20.229> it

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
dance around anyway I'm just gonna do it

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.779 
dance around anyway I'm just gonna do it
a<00:01:20.409> spiral<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:23.409> eventually<00:01:24.070> another<00:01:24.460> few

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
a spiral and eventually another few

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.889 
a spiral and eventually another few
seconds<00:01:25.270> I'm<00:01:26.110> trying<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.680> always<00:01:26.829> maintain

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
seconds I'm trying to always maintain

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.160 
seconds I'm trying to always maintain
that<00:01:28.899> focus<00:01:29.350> that<00:01:29.799> pinpoint<00:01:30.490> of<00:01:30.640> light<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
that focus that pinpoint of light and

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.810 
that focus that pinpoint of light and
eventually<00:01:32.770> I'm<00:01:32.860> gonna<00:01:32.979> have<00:01:33.220> to<00:01:33.369> just<00:01:33.580> take

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
eventually I'm gonna have to just take

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:42.649 
eventually I'm gonna have to just take
my<00:01:34.060> chances

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:02:04.730 

be<00:01:43.140> very<00:01:43.320> careful<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.859> that

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.680 

why<00:02:05.740> do<00:02:05.799> I<00:02:05.920> have<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.280> be<00:02:06.369> very<00:02:06.420> careful<00:02:07.420> with

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
why do I have to be very careful with

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:27.360 
why do I have to be very careful with
this<00:02:07.869> bundle<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:25.620> have<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.770> really<00:02:27.040> make<00:02:27.190> them

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
this bundle I have to really make them

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.370 
this bundle I have to really make them
powder<00:02:27.610> fine<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.870> deal<00:02:29.080> with<00:02:29.260> the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
powder fine to deal with the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.410 
powder fine to deal with the
conductivity<00:02:30.010> of<00:02:30.250> that<00:02:30.489> one<00:02:30.730> pinpoint<00:02:31.330> of

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
conductivity of that one pinpoint of

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.110 
conductivity of that one pinpoint of
light<00:02:31.450> right<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.260> it's<00:02:33.130> kind<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.430> forcing<00:02:33.970> me

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
light right so it's kind of forcing me

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.870 
light right so it's kind of forcing me
to<00:02:34.390> back<00:02:34.720> off<00:02:34.989> a<00:02:35.050> little<00:02:35.230> bit<00:02:35.470> because<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.580> made

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
to back off a little bit because I made

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.830 
to back off a little bit because I made
it<00:02:37.000> extra<00:02:37.480> fine<00:02:37.690> for<00:02:38.680> this<00:02:38.860> ignition<00:02:39.160> source

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
it extra fine for this ignition source

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.479 
it extra fine for this ignition source
but<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:41.200> can<00:02:41.380> see<00:02:41.590> there's<00:02:41.830> conduction

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
but you can see there's conduction

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.660 
but you can see there's conduction
working<00:02:42.910> now<00:02:43.209> here<00:02:43.450> is<00:02:43.510> convection<00:02:44.340> along<00:02:45.340> is

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
working now here is convection along is

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.600 
working now here is convection along is
it<00:02:45.790> still<00:02:46.000> smoking<00:02:46.570> I<00:02:46.800> can<00:02:47.800> safely<00:02:48.070> put<00:02:48.459> my

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
it still smoking I can safely put my

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.820 
it still smoking I can safely put my
ignition<00:02:48.880> away<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:50.019> we're<00:02:50.260> gonna<00:02:50.350> be<00:02:50.530> real

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
ignition away and we're gonna be real

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.000 
ignition away and we're gonna be real
safe<00:02:51.130> because<00:02:51.730> we're<00:02:51.910> not<00:02:52.680> we're<00:02:53.680> gonna<00:02:53.830> go

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
safe because we're not we're gonna go

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.220 
safe because we're not we're gonna go
down<00:02:54.250> so<00:02:54.610> you<00:02:54.790> will<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.720> I'll<00:02:55.810> show<00:02:56.019> you<00:02:56.110> how

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
down so you will and I'll show you how

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:14.430 
down so you will and I'll show you how
you<00:02:56.260> blow<00:02:56.470> one<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.709> these<00:02:56.830> off

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.260 

so<00:03:15.440> notice<00:03:15.830> this<00:03:16.040> which<00:03:16.460> is<00:03:16.610> gonna<00:03:16.760> fit<00:03:17.060> his

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
so notice this which is gonna fit his

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.410 
so notice this which is gonna fit his
motor<00:03:17.720> motor<00:03:18.410> motor<00:03:19.010> I'm<00:03:19.880> gonna<00:03:20.060> accentuate

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
motor motor motor I'm gonna accentuate

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.040 
motor motor motor I'm gonna accentuate
that<00:03:20.990> with<00:03:21.200> my<00:03:21.380> breath<00:03:21.970> it's<00:03:22.970> still<00:03:23.270> volatile

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
that with my breath it's still volatile

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.600 
that with my breath it's still volatile
to<00:03:24.470> wear<00:03:24.760> this<00:03:25.760> cake<00:03:26.360> I<00:03:26.830> could<00:03:27.830> this<00:03:28.280> is<00:03:28.340> all

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
to wear this cake I could this is all

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.130 
to wear this cake I could this is all
this<00:03:28.850> math<00:03:29.180> it's<00:03:29.420> kind<00:03:29.600> of<00:03:29.630> sticking<00:03:29.900> together

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
this math it's kind of sticking together

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.260 
this math it's kind of sticking together
that's<00:03:30.530> now<00:03:30.680> on<00:03:30.860> fire<00:03:31.130> could<00:03:31.670> I<00:03:31.820> could<00:03:32.090> blow<00:03:32.240> it

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
that's now on fire could I could blow it
