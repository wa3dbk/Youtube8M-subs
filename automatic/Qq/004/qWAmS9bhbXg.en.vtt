00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
more of a curl instead of just like a

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.370 
more of a curl instead of just like a
scrunch<00:03:22.000> wave<00:03:22.329> look<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:22.810> at<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.049> very<00:03:23.230> end

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
scrunch wave look and at the very end

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.199 
scrunch wave look and at the very end
I'm<00:03:23.680> just<00:03:23.920> taking<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.340> weed<00:03:24.519> out<00:03:24.670> of<00:03:24.790> texture

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
I'm just taking the weed out of texture

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.960 
I'm just taking the weed out of texture
taffy<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:25.870> this<00:03:26.530> is<00:03:26.799> like<00:03:27.070> a<00:03:27.100> very<00:03:27.430> sticky

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970

taffy and this is like a very sticky
sticky<00:03:28.690> type<00:03:29.260> of<00:03:29.530> like<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.430> can<00:03:30.609> even<00:03:30.819> see

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
sticky type of like you can even see

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.360 
sticky type of like you can even see
it's<00:03:31.180> like<00:03:31.329> stringy<00:03:31.750> but<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:32.470> works<00:03:32.709> so<00:03:33.340> well

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
it's like stringy but it works so well

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.699 
it's like stringy but it works so well
you<00:03:33.790> need<00:03:33.970> eight<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.600> mean<00:03:34.810> I'm<00:03:34.930> just<00:03:35.200> going<00:03:35.470> to

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
scrunch upwards so just like this and

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.800 
scrunch upwards so just like this and
it's<00:03:40.329> just<00:03:40.600> going<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:41.019> give<00:03:41.230> one<00:03:41.549> final<00:03:42.810> barrel

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
it's just going to give one final barrel

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.319 
it's just going to give one final barrel
turn<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:44.769> guys<00:03:44.920> can<00:03:45.160> see<00:03:45.430> it's<00:03:45.910> just<00:03:46.120> going

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
turn so you guys can see it's just going

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.949 
turn so you guys can see it's just going
to<00:03:46.450> give<00:03:46.690> one<00:03:47.139> final<00:03:47.799> little<00:03:48.420> dimension<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.750> it

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
to give one final little dimension to it

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.110 
to give one final little dimension to it
so<00:03:50.440> how<00:03:50.680> simple<00:03:51.220> is<00:03:51.340> that<00:03:51.519> this<00:03:51.700> is<00:03:51.850> literally
