00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
the main reason I got these is because I

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.020 
the main reason I got these is because I
had<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.920> younger<00:00:31.920> brother<00:00:32.189> these<00:00:32.579> basically

the<00:00:33.239> HD<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.350> believe<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.040> yeah<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.520> 428<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
the HD I believe it yeah the 428 and

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.290 
the HD I believe it yeah the 428 and
it's<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.250> little<00:00:38.460> bit<00:00:38.579> different<00:00:38.940> than<00:00:39.090> these<00:00:39.239> I

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
it's a little bit different than these I

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.500 
it's a little bit different than these I
believe<00:00:39.719> they<00:00:40.200> were<00:00:40.260> those<00:00:40.860> were<00:00:41.129> $80<00:00:42.090> these

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
believe they were those were $80 these

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.700 
believe they were those were $80 these
are<00:00:42.690> $100<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:44.030> about<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.090> $20<00:00:46.020> increase<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
are $100 so about a $20 increase the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.010 
are $100 so about a $20 increase the
main<00:00:46.860> reason<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.550> was<00:00:48.120> looking<00:00:48.420> up<00:00:48.510> grades<00:00:48.780> just

it's plastic so I mean metal would have

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.099 
it's plastic so I mean metal would have
made<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.680> lot<00:02:20.920> heavier<00:02:21.659> and<00:02:22.659> probably<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:22.989> lot

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:23.109 
made a lot heavier and probably a lot

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.690 
made a lot heavier and probably a lot
less<00:02:23.290> comfortable<00:02:23.769> but<00:02:23.920> they<00:02:24.069> are<00:02:24.189> very

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
less comfortable but they are very

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.959 
less comfortable but they are very
flexible<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.629> noticed<00:02:26.049> so<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:26.950> mean<00:02:27.430> that's<00:02:27.579> a

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:27.969 
flexible I noticed so I mean that's a

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.270 
flexible I noticed so I mean that's a
very<00:02:28.810> good<00:02:28.930> thanks<00:02:29.379> I<00:02:29.530> know<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:30.010> DJ<00:02:30.549> a<00:02:30.579> lot<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:31.450> I

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
very good thanks I know I DJ a lot so I

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.360 
very good thanks I know I DJ a lot so I
like<00:02:33.280> wearing<00:02:33.639> like<00:02:33.819> one<00:02:34.530> at<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.650> time<00:02:35.829> or<00:02:36.310> you

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
like wearing like one at a time or you

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.789 
like wearing like one at a time or you
can<00:02:36.430> twist<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.909> to<00:02:37.180> your<00:02:37.780> thing<00:02:38.260> around<00:02:38.530> there

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
can twist it to your thing around there

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.690 
can twist it to your thing around there
so<00:02:39.159> they're<00:02:39.760> they're<00:02:40.450> very<00:02:40.840> durable<00:02:41.230> but<00:02:42.040> very

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
so they're they're very durable but very

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.489 
so they're they're very durable but very
light<00:02:43.030> at<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.299> same<00:02:43.510> time<00:02:43.780> with<00:02:44.139> the<00:02:44.290> foam

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:44.499 
light at the same time with the foam

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.039 
light at the same time with the foam
padding<00:02:44.889> so<00:02:45.099> I<00:02:45.310> mean<00:02:45.849> all<00:02:46.030> around<00:02:46.299> I<00:02:46.450> just<00:02:46.480> love

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
padding so I mean all around I just love

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.530 
padding so I mean all around I just love
wearing<00:02:47.290> these<00:02:47.469> headphones<00:02:48.299> they<00:02:49.299> have<00:02:49.510> a

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
wearing these headphones they have a

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.250 
wearing these headphones they have a
neodymium<00:02:50.669> I<00:02:51.989> don't<00:02:52.989> know<00:02:53.079> if<00:02:53.169> I'm

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
neodymium I don't know if I'm

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.809 
neodymium I don't know if I'm
pronouncing<00:02:53.469> it<00:02:53.799> correct<00:02:54.129> they<00:02:54.699> have

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
pronouncing it correct they have

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.300 
pronouncing it correct they have
neodymium<00:02:55.449> magnets<00:02:55.930> in<00:02:56.079> it<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:56.949> basically

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
neodymium magnets in it so basically

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.979 
neodymium magnets in it so basically
that<00:02:57.519> just<00:02:57.760> gives<00:02:57.939> it<00:02:58.060> its<00:02:58.299> crystal<00:02:58.959> clear

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
that just gives it its crystal clear

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.520 
that just gives it its crystal clear
sound<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.829> it's<00:03:00.060> extremely<00:03:01.060> fast<00:03:01.530> base

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
sound and it's extremely fast base

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.220 
sound and it's extremely fast base
response<00:03:03.099> so<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.060> wouldn't<00:03:04.359> say<00:03:04.540> these<00:03:04.750> are<00:03:04.989> the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
response so I wouldn't say these are the

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.129 
response so I wouldn't say these are the
most<00:03:05.980> bass<00:03:06.340> heavy<00:03:06.790> headphones<00:03:07.480> but<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:07.840> would

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
most bass heavy headphones but I would

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:09.959 
most bass heavy headphones but I would
say<00:03:08.409> that<00:03:08.439> these<00:03:08.829> are<00:03:08.889> probably<00:03:09.579> one<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:09.819> the

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:09.969 
say that these are probably one of the

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.500 
say that these are probably one of the
best<00:03:10.150> quality<00:03:11.430> as<00:03:12.430> far<00:03:12.790> as<00:03:12.819> it<00:03:13.030> comes<00:03:13.209> to

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
best quality as far as it comes to

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.530 
best quality as far as it comes to
crystal<00:03:14.500> clear<00:03:14.530> base<00:03:15.189> so<00:03:15.549> you<00:03:15.639> can<00:03:15.819> really<00:03:16.180> get

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
crystal clear base so you can really get

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.800 
crystal clear base so you can really get
that<00:03:17.409> natural<00:03:18.280> base<00:03:18.489> down<00:03:18.759> you<00:03:19.000> don't<00:03:19.180> get<00:03:19.389> any

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
that natural base down you don't get any

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.899 
that natural base down you don't get any
distortion<00:03:20.560> almost<00:03:20.859> at<00:03:21.040> all<00:03:21.189> so<00:03:21.519> I<00:03:21.790> love<00:03:22.689> that

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
distortion almost at all so I love that

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.990 
distortion almost at all so I love that
it<00:03:24.909> comes<00:03:25.090> with<00:03:25.269> a<00:03:25.389> it<00:03:26.259> has<00:03:26.879> seventeen<00:03:27.879> to

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
it comes with a it has seventeen to

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.849 
it comes with a it has seventeen to
twenty<00:03:28.060> two<00:03:28.449> point<00:03:28.689> five<00:03:28.870> Hertz<00:03:29.319> for

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
twenty two point five Hertz for

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.969 
twenty two point five Hertz for
frequency<00:03:30.489> so<00:03:30.819> it<00:03:31.629> covers<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:32.049> lot<00:03:32.139> of<00:03:32.259> sound

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:32.979 
frequency so it covers a lot of sound

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.640 
frequency so it covers a lot of sound
range<00:03:33.280> right<00:03:33.699> there<00:03:33.729> so<00:03:34.239> a<00:03:34.720> lot<00:03:35.169> of<00:03:35.319> them<00:03:35.470> will

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
range right there so a lot of them will

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.899 
range right there so a lot of them will
have<00:03:35.680> a<00:03:36.129> shorter<00:03:36.870> Hertz<00:03:37.870> frequency<00:03:38.560> so<00:03:38.829> that

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
have a shorter Hertz frequency so that

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.429 
have a shorter Hertz frequency so that
it'll<00:03:39.909> become<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.209> lot<00:03:40.419> more<00:03:40.449> distorted<00:03:41.169> so

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 
it'll become a lot more distorted so

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.939 
it'll become a lot more distorted so
it's<00:03:42.159> very<00:03:42.280> nice<00:03:43.109> they<00:03:44.109> are<00:03:44.409> a<00:03:44.439> hundred

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:44.949 
it's very nice they are a hundred

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:48.689 
it's very nice they are a hundred
dollars<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.810> got<00:03:47.079> the<00:03:47.259> fifteen<00:03:47.919> dollar

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
dollars and I got the fifteen dollar

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.140 
dollars and I got the fifteen dollar
two-year<00:03:49.569> warranty<00:03:50.079> I<00:03:50.680> just<00:03:51.669> like<00:03:51.790> doing<00:03:51.970> that

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
upgraded to these in the first place

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.900 
upgraded to these in the first place
now<00:04:24.820> to<00:04:24.880> that<00:04:25.240> like<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.600> bad<00:04:25.780> side<00:04:26.110> of<00:04:26.139> these

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
now to that like the bad side of these

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.230 
now to that like the bad side of these
pretty<00:04:27.910> much<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.419> only<00:04:28.660> thing<00:04:29.050> I<00:04:29.770> could<00:04:30.070> find

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
pretty much the only thing I could find

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.610 
pretty much the only thing I could find
that's<00:04:31.240> negative<00:04:31.750> about<00:04:31.930> these<00:04:32.169> is<00:04:32.440> they

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
that's negative about these is they

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.730 
that's negative about these is they
aren't<00:04:33.210> noise-canceling<00:04:34.210> there's<00:04:35.199> no<00:04:35.470> place

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
aren't noise-canceling there's no place

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.520 
aren't noise-canceling there's no place
for<00:04:35.770> like<00:04:36.070> a<00:04:36.190> battery<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.759> go<00:04:36.910> in<00:04:37.150> and<00:04:37.600> cover

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
for like a battery to go in and cover

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.260 
for like a battery to go in and cover
that<00:04:38.680> up<00:04:38.740> so<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.220> mean<00:04:39.520> when<00:04:39.699> you<00:04:39.789> put<00:04:39.970> them<00:04:40.090> on<00:04:40.240> I

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
that up so I mean when you put them on I

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.390 
that up so I mean when you put them on I
can<00:04:40.600> still<00:04:40.870> hear<00:04:41.199> everything<00:04:41.440> around<00:04:41.800> me<00:04:42.070> so

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
can still hear everything around me so

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.900 
can still hear everything around me so
that's<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.389> only<00:04:43.539> thing<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.320> I<00:04:44.620> would<00:04:45.550> say

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
that's the only thing that I would say

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.850 
that's the only thing that I would say
that<00:04:46.210> these<00:04:46.449> are<00:04:46.509> a<00:04:46.660> downside<00:04:47.199> other<00:04:47.590> than

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
that these are a downside other than

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.249 
that these are a downside other than
that<00:04:48.070> if<00:04:48.430> you're<00:04:48.850> looking<00:04:49.210> for<00:04:49.389> a<00:04:49.419> very<00:04:49.930> good

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
something ridiculously expensive that I

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.689 
something ridiculously expensive that I
know<00:04:55.510> I<00:04:55.780> personally<00:04:56.500> don't<00:04:56.860> want<00:04:56.949> to<00:04:57.190> waste<00:04:57.400> my
