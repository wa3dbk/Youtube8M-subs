building<00:00:29.589> a<00:00:29.919> recovery<00:00:30.339> track<00:00:30.640> and<00:00:30.909> so<00:00:31.509> today

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
building a recovery track and so today

I'm<00:00:32.710> introducing<00:00:32.980> project<00:00:33.940> fat<00:00:34.180> Beatty<00:00:34.450> which

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
I'm introducing project fat Beatty which

I'm introducing project fat Beatty which
is<00:00:35.230> what<00:00:35.380> I<00:00:35.410> call<00:00:35.530> this<00:00:35.860> truck<00:00:36.240> in<00:00:37.240> so<00:00:37.480> far<00:00:37.750> this

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
is what I call this truck in so far this

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.620 
is what I call this truck in so far this
is<00:00:38.860> that<00:00:39.040> really<00:00:39.490> it's<00:00:39.730> probably<00:00:39.970> been<00:00:40.330> a<00:00:40.360> good

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
is that really it's probably been a good

but<00:01:26.050> this<00:01:27.010> kind<00:01:27.280> of<00:01:27.510> engineering<00:01:28.510> is<00:01:28.659> a<00:01:28.690> wee

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
but this kind of engineering is a wee

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.289 
but this kind of engineering is a wee
bit<00:01:28.930> different<00:01:29.350> so<00:01:29.920> anyway<00:01:30.250> and<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:31.030> first

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
bit different so anyway and the first

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:38.190 
bit different so anyway and the first
thing<00:01:31.540> is<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:34.140> rc4<00:01:35.140> drive<00:01:36.990> controller<00:01:37.990> with

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
thing is the rc4 drive controller with

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.620 
thing is the rc4 drive controller with
their<00:01:38.670> their<00:01:39.670> little<00:01:39.909> switches<00:01:40.180> and<00:01:40.390> all<00:01:40.479> that

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
their their little switches and all that

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.340 
their their little switches and all that
sort<00:01:40.840> of<00:01:40.870> chairs<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:42.180> I've<00:01:43.180> got<00:01:43.450> that<00:01:43.659> for<00:01:44.200> the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
sort of chairs and I've got that for the

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.760 
sort of chairs and I've got that for the
wench

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770

Weaver<00:01:45.100> I<00:01:45.280> use<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.670> winch<00:01:45.850> what<00:01:46.150> I<00:01:46.180> mean<00:01:46.540> does

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.580 

the<00:01:50.830> axles<00:01:51.810> I'll<00:01:52.810> get<00:01:53.049> on<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.260> those<00:01:53.409> I've

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
the axles I'll get on to those I've

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.730 
the axles I'll get on to those I've
already<00:01:53.770> taken<00:01:53.950> them<00:01:54.130> out<00:01:54.220> of<00:01:54.400> box<00:01:54.640> there<00:01:55.150> I'm

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
already taken them out of box there I'm

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.520 
already taken them out of box there I'm
Dao<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.799> wound<00:01:57.130> drives<00:01:58.049> excells

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.630 

digital<00:02:03.720> high<00:02:04.720> torque<00:02:05.290> servo<00:02:06.070> now<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.369> brought

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
digital high torque servo now I brought

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.520 
digital high torque servo now I brought
this<00:02:06.820> one<00:02:07.000> because<00:02:07.180> it's<00:02:07.299> programmable<00:02:07.930> and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
this one because it's programmable and

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.070 
this one because it's programmable and
I'm<00:02:08.679> planning<00:02:08.920> on<00:02:09.129> having<00:02:09.189> rear<00:02:09.759> steer<00:02:10.239> and<00:02:10.690> I

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
I'm planning on having rear steer and I

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.970 
I'm planning on having rear steer and I
thought<00:02:11.380> I<00:02:11.709> would<00:02:11.950> see<00:02:12.280> this<00:02:12.459> 2:52<00:02:13.330> sink<00:02:13.599> throw

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
thought I would see this 2:52 sink throw

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.820 
thought I would see this 2:52 sink throw
so<00:02:15.580> I<00:02:15.610> can<00:02:15.819> run<00:02:16.000> with<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.510> y-cable<00:02:17.080> with<00:02:17.710> the

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
so I can run with a y-cable with the

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.030 
so I can run with a y-cable with the
front<00:02:18.100> steering<00:02:19.530> that's<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.650> plan<00:02:20.860> at<00:02:20.980> the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
I've got a few boxes of those because

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.710
