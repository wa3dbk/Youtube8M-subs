it to break and I think that's a lot of
fear<00:01:05.700> for<00:01:05.909> people<00:01:05.939> because<00:01:06.689> they're<00:01:06.780> saying

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it's probably on a break but that's not

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.420 
it's probably on a break but that's not
the<00:01:10.260> case<00:01:10.380> we're<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> think<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.070> hardware

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
the case we're here I think the hardware

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.570 
the case we're here I think the hardware
is<00:01:11.520> pretty<00:01:11.670> solid<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.799> again<00:01:14.130> keep

is pretty solid so this and again keep

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
is pretty solid so this and again keep
in<00:01:14.700> mind<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.119> tablet<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.570> 100<00:01:16.020> bucks<00:01:16.229> so

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
using that lot I have no clue why that's

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.130 
using that lot I have no clue why that's
actually<00:01:45.990> there<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.470> oh<00:01:47.240> it's<00:01:48.240> there<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.750> you

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
actually there but oh it's there and you

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.380 
actually there but oh it's there and you
know<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.259> use<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.130> thought<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.270> pretty

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
know I use it so I thought it's pretty

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.719 
know I use it so I thought it's pretty
cool<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.470> screen<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.130> most<00:01:53.250> important

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
cool so the screen is the most important

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.609 
cool so the screen is the most important
thing<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.180> here<00:01:54.420> obviously<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.500> we're

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
thing going here obviously so we're

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.350 
thing going here obviously so we're
going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:55.890> looking<00:01:56.189> at<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.460> most<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:56.909> this

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
going to be looking at the most so this

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.240 
going to be looking at the most so this
does<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.960> an<00:01:58.079> IPS<00:01:58.439> display<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.860> watch

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
does not have an IPS display so watch

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.090 
does not have an IPS display so watch
you<00:01:59.850> see<00:02:00.060> attending<00:02:00.360> out<00:02:00.570> blue<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.979> know

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
you see attending out blue that you know

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.800 
you see attending out blue that you know
the<00:02:02.340> viewing<00:02:02.610> angles<00:02:02.880> aren't<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.390> good<00:02:03.659> on

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
the viewing angles aren't that good on

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.249 
the viewing angles aren't that good on
here

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
here

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.560 
here
but<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.520> know<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.759> my<00:02:05.790> time<00:02:06.090> using<00:02:06.360> it

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
but it you know in my time using it

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.690 
but it you know in my time using it
looking<00:02:07.049> at<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> head<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.890> didn't<00:02:08.340> have<00:02:08.489> any

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
looking at a head on I didn't have any

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.790 
looking at a head on I didn't have any
problems<00:02:09.239> with<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:10.170> viewing<00:02:10.440> angles<00:02:10.739> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
problems with the viewing angles and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.270 
problems with the viewing angles and
stuff<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.790> thought<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.930> know

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
stuff like that so I thought you know

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.580 
stuff like that so I thought you know
fairly<00:02:14.030> decent<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:15.020> screen<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.410> fairly

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
fairly decent the screen is fairly

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.530 
fairly decent the screen is fairly
decent<00:02:15.830> say<00:02:16.190> 1020<00:02:17.150> by<00:02:18.490> 600<00:02:19.490> display<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.420> it's

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
decent say 1020 by 600 display so it's

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.140 
decent say 1020 by 600 display so it's
not<00:02:20.660> an<00:02:20.780> HD<00:02:21.080> display<00:02:21.440> coming<00:02:21.770> from<00:02:21.920> an<00:02:22.150> HD

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
not an HD display coming from an HD

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.370 
not an HD display coming from an HD
display<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.480> don't<00:02:23.690> notice<00:02:24.020> it<00:02:24.110> if<00:02:24.230> you're

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
display you don't notice it if you're

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.960 
display you don't notice it if you're
coming<00:02:24.560> from<00:02:24.680> an<00:02:24.860> HD<00:02:25.130> display<00:02:25.400> on<00:02:25.520> a<00:02:25.550> smaller

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
coming from an HD display on a smaller

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.020 
coming from an HD display on a smaller
tablet<00:02:26.600> you<00:02:27.080> will<00:02:27.260> notice<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:28.030> resolution

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
tablet you will notice the resolution

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.430 
tablet you will notice the resolution
but<00:02:29.150> once<00:02:29.390> you<00:02:29.480> get<00:02:29.630> used<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.930> it's<00:02:30.110> not<00:02:30.290> all

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
but once you get used to it's not all

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.040 
but once you get used to it's not all
that<00:02:30.470> bad<00:02:30.650> have<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.730> say<00:02:31.910> watching<00:02:32.180> movies<00:02:32.720> and

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
that bad have to say watching movies and

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.900 
that bad have to say watching movies and
videos<00:02:33.350> on<00:02:33.560> here<00:02:33.830> it's<00:02:34.130> much<00:02:34.400> better<00:02:34.670> than

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
videos on here it's much better than

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.820 
videos on here it's much better than
only<00:02:35.090> 7-inch<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:35.960> if<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.200> do<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.380> lot<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.590> that

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
only 7-inch so if you do a lot of that

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.410 
only 7-inch so if you do a lot of that
you're<00:02:37.430> going<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.700> definitely<00:02:38.090> want<00:02:38.240> to<00:02:38.270> check

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
are interested in performance so before

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.449 
are interested in performance so before
we<00:02:44.150> get<00:02:44.630> into<00:02:44.930> performance<00:02:45.500> this<00:02:46.010> thing<00:02:46.250> would

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
we get into performance this thing would

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.330 
we get into performance this thing would

the United States play if you do have
that<00:03:07.070> problem<00:03:07.250> I'd<00:03:07.610> know<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:07.820> few<00:03:08.120> people<00:03:08.420> have

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600

that problem and go ahead and do that

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.460 
that problem and go ahead and do that
that<00:03:10.640> pretty<00:03:10.790> much<00:03:10.970> fixes<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.510> problem<00:03:11.930> but

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
that pretty much fixes the problem but

if you use these stock browsers even

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.560 
if you use these stock browsers even
smoother<00:03:36.500> play<00:03:36.680> hate<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.430> stock<00:03:37.670> browser<00:03:37.940> but

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570

if<00:03:39.050> you<00:03:39.170> use<00:03:39.290> Chrome<00:03:39.590> it's<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:41.000> performance

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
if you use Chrome it's the performance

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.960 
if you use Chrome it's the performance
is<00:03:41.600> pretty<00:03:41.840> decent<00:03:42.019> as<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:42.350> can<00:03:42.500> see<00:03:42.620> here<00:03:42.970> my

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
is pretty decent as you can see here my

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.690 
is pretty decent as you can see here my
Wi-Fi<00:03:44.390> so<00:03:44.690> that's<00:03:44.900> why<00:03:45.049> it's<00:03:45.320> not<00:03:45.590> loading<00:03:46.519> up

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
Wi-Fi so that's why it's not loading up

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.090 
Wi-Fi so that's why it's not loading up
and<00:03:47.120> down<00:03:48.080> here<00:03:48.290> they<00:03:48.440> do<00:03:48.500> throw<00:03:48.830> in<00:03:48.920> some

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
and down here they do throw in some

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.220 
and down here they do throw in some
capacitive<00:03:49.700> buttons<00:03:50.030> volume<00:03:50.660> rocker<00:03:51.019> which

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
capacitive buttons volume rocker which

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.910 
capacitive buttons volume rocker which
is<00:03:51.350> actually<00:03:51.620> pretty<00:03:51.830> useful<00:03:52.060> too<00:03:53.590> alright<00:03:54.590> so

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
is actually pretty useful too alright so

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.190 
is actually pretty useful too alright so
performance<00:03:55.910> so<00:03:56.299> let's<00:03:56.510> go<00:03:56.630> ahead<00:03:56.720> and<00:03:56.930> take

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
performance so let's go ahead and take

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.229 
performance so let's go ahead and take
on<00:03:57.350> some<00:03:57.500> games<00:03:57.799> if<00:03:58.340> you<00:03:58.400> wanted<00:03:58.910> to<00:03:59.030> play

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
games with this tablet then it'll be

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.680 
games with this tablet then it'll be
capable<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.459> do<00:04:01.610> that<00:04:01.820> with<00:04:02.000> you<00:04:02.090> 1.5

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
capable to do that with you 1.5

capable to do that with you 1.5
gigahertz<00:04:02.959> dual-core<00:04:03.500> processor<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:04.400> that

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
gigahertz dual-core processor and that

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.870 
gigahertz dual-core processor and that
one<00:04:05.000> get<00:04:05.209> by<00:04:05.330> it<00:04:05.390> round<00:04:05.780> so<00:04:06.380> this<00:04:06.530> is<00:04:06.709> asphalt<00:04:06.980> 8

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
one get by it round so this is asphalt 8

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.690 
one get by it round so this is asphalt 8
and<00:04:08.330> this<00:04:09.110> we<00:04:09.680> all<00:04:09.799> know<00:04:09.920> this<00:04:10.040> game<00:04:10.130> has<00:04:10.489> is

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:49.659 

all<00:04:42.589> right<00:04:47.830> so<00:04:48.830> you<00:04:48.949> can<00:04:49.069> see<00:04:49.159> the<00:04:49.279> graphics

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
all right so you can see the graphics

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.439 
all right so you can see the graphics
look<00:04:49.759> really<00:04:50.029> nice<00:04:50.240> even<00:04:50.599> though<00:04:50.659> I'm<00:04:50.779> medium

look really nice even though I'm medium

00:04:52.449 --> 00:05:08.089 
look really nice even though I'm medium
let's<00:04:53.449> suck<00:04:53.569> at<00:04:53.719> this<00:04:53.839> game<00:04:54.080> so

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.529 

we're<00:05:08.580> just<00:05:08.699> going<00:05:08.849> to<00:05:08.879> crash<00:05:09.089> into<00:05:09.119> some

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
we're just going to crash into some

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:20.030 
we're just going to crash into some
slow-motion

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:35.260 

I<00:05:20.130> guess

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.770 

yeah<00:05:36.270> there<00:05:37.139> we<00:05:37.229> go<00:05:37.819> so<00:05:38.819> you<00:05:39.120> can<00:05:39.389> see<00:05:39.659> the

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
yeah there we go so you can see the

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.080 
yeah there we go so you can see the
graphics<00:05:40.259> on<00:05:40.440> here<00:05:40.470> and<00:05:40.919> it<00:05:41.370> being<00:05:41.789> able<00:05:41.940> to

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
graphics on here and it being able to

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.820 
graphics on here and it being able to
play<00:05:42.270> games<00:05:42.479> so<00:05:42.720> I'm<00:05:43.289> pretty<00:05:43.440> sure<00:05:43.590> I<00:05:43.710> can

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
play games so I'm pretty sure I can

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.330 
play games so I'm pretty sure I can
handle<00:05:43.889> any<00:05:44.340> game<00:05:44.520> we<00:05:44.669> throw<00:05:44.909> at<00:05:45.120> it<00:05:45.860> so<00:05:46.860> it's

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
handle any game we throw at it so it's

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.210 
handle any game we throw at it so it's
pretty<00:05:47.580> it's<00:05:47.970> a<00:05:48.060> pretty<00:05:48.240> good<00:05:49.009> gaming<00:05:50.009> if<00:05:50.129> you

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
pretty it's a pretty good gaming if you

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.969 
pretty it's a pretty good gaming if you
want<00:05:50.400> to<00:05:50.490> use<00:05:50.580> it<00:05:50.729> for<00:05:50.759> that<00:05:51.060> too<00:05:51.330> so<00:05:51.979> talking

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
want to use it for that too so talking

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.439 
want to use it for that too so talking
about<00:05:53.039> the<00:05:53.280> cameras<00:05:53.759> I<00:05:53.879> really<00:05:54.090> don't<00:05:54.270> want<00:05:54.389> to

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:54.449 
about the cameras I really don't want to

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:55.670 
about the cameras I really don't want to
get<00:05:54.509> in<00:05:54.599> too<00:05:54.690> much<00:05:54.840> around<00:05:54.990> cameras<00:05:55.470> cuz<00:05:55.590> they

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
get in too much around cameras cuz they

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.119 
get in too much around cameras cuz they
suck<00:05:56.300> so<00:05:57.300> you<00:05:57.360> can<00:05:57.690> see<00:05:57.960> it<00:05:58.229> it's<00:05:58.440> a<00:05:58.560> unless

00:05:59.119 --> 00:05:59.129 
suck so you can see it it's a unless

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:00.740 
suck so you can see it it's a unless
you're<00:05:59.280> in<00:05:59.400> good<00:05:59.550> light<00:05:59.789> you<00:06:00.360> won't<00:06:00.569> get

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
you're in good light you won't get

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.469 
you're in good light you won't get
really<00:06:01.020> good<00:06:01.199> performance<00:06:02.060> it's<00:06:03.060> got<00:06:03.240> to<00:06:03.360> be

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
really good performance it's got to be

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.499 
really good performance it's got to be
less<00:06:03.720> than<00:06:03.870> megapixel<00:06:05.060> so<00:06:06.060> you<00:06:06.120> know<00:06:06.330> that

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:06.509 
less than megapixel so you know that

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:08.480 
less than megapixel so you know that
really<00:06:06.629> sucks<00:06:06.960> but<00:06:07.289> you<00:06:08.069> know<00:06:08.099> if<00:06:08.370> you're

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
really sucks but you know if you're

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.279 
really sucks but you know if you're

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
going to be doing Skype a lot or some

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:11.149 
going to be doing Skype a lot or some
like<00:06:10.409> that<00:06:10.440> you<00:06:10.710> might<00:06:10.830> want<00:06:11.009> to<00:06:11.039> look

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:11.159 
like that you might want to look

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:12.740 
like that you might want to look
somewhere<00:06:11.490> else<00:06:11.550> and<00:06:12.150> look<00:06:12.300> for<00:06:12.449> a<00:06:12.479> tablet

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
somewhere else and look for a tablet

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.270 
somewhere else and look for a tablet
with<00:06:13.020> a<00:06:13.289> you<00:06:14.219> know<00:06:14.310> much<00:06:14.520> better<00:06:14.669> camera<00:06:15.229> so

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
with a you know much better camera so

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.559 
with a you know much better camera so
overall<00:06:17.280> I<00:06:17.430> think<00:06:17.490> this<00:06:17.729> tablet<00:06:18.150> is<00:06:18.270> really

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:18.569 
overall I think this tablet is really

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:20.510 
overall I think this tablet is really
nice<00:06:18.780> I<00:06:18.990> like<00:06:19.169> the<00:06:19.289> 10<00:06:19.469> inch<00:06:19.620> form<00:06:19.919> factor<00:06:20.009> I

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
nice I like the 10 inch form factor I

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.029 
nice I like the 10 inch form factor I
think<00:06:21.000> the<00:06:21.120> screen<00:06:21.419> is<00:06:21.629> pretty<00:06:22.500> good<00:06:22.710> for<00:06:22.770> the

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
think the screen is pretty good for the

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:25.850 
think the screen is pretty good for the
price<00:06:23.310> you<00:06:23.520> get<00:06:23.699> and<00:06:24.050> I<00:06:25.050> have<00:06:25.349> to<00:06:25.469> say<00:06:25.620> I<00:06:25.650> really

price you get and I have to say I really

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.040 
price you get and I have to say I really

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
different country or whatever but I

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.550 
different country or whatever but I
don't<00:06:51.479> know<00:06:51.539> what<00:06:51.659> that's<00:06:51.840> about<00:06:51.990> but<00:06:52.139> you

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560

this<00:06:55.229> tablet<00:06:55.500> that<00:06:55.740> I<00:06:55.770> didn't<00:06:56.099> like<00:06:56.310> I<00:06:56.610> think

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
this tablet that I didn't like I think

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.550 
this tablet that I didn't like I think
it's<00:06:57.210> a<00:06:57.240> pretty<00:06:57.419> decent<00:06:57.870> child<00:06:58.020> for<00:06:58.229> the<00:06:58.289> price

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 
it's a pretty decent child for the price

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.870 
it's a pretty decent child for the price
obviously<00:06:59.370> that<00:07:00.380> discoloration<00:07:01.380> the<00:07:01.849> lack<00:07:02.849> of

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
obviously that discoloration the lack of

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.180 
obviously that discoloration the lack of
IPS<00:07:03.569> could<00:07:04.349> be<00:07:04.440> a<00:07:04.469> problem<00:07:04.710> for<00:07:04.979> some<00:07:05.159> people

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.190 
IPS could be a problem for some people

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.300 
IPS could be a problem for some people
but<00:07:05.699> overall<00:07:06.509> it's<00:07:06.690> not<00:07:06.840> a<00:07:06.870> problem<00:07:07.080> for<00:07:07.259> me<00:07:07.409> so

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.310 
but overall it's not a problem for me so

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.159 
but overall it's not a problem for me so
that's<00:07:08.819> pretty<00:07:09.090> much<00:07:09.240> it<00:07:09.479> guys<00:07:09.509> that<00:07:09.810> wraps<00:07:09.990> up
