you're<00:00:01.589> sort<00:00:01.859> of<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.100> planetary<00:00:02.969> man<00:00:03.330> in

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
you're sort of the planetary man in

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.210 
you're sort of the planetary man in
charge<00:00:03.750> here<00:00:04.110> at<00:00:04.200> NASA<00:00:04.319> headquarters<00:00:04.620> is<00:00:05.100> that

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
charge here at NASA headquarters is that

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.769 
charge here at NASA headquarters is that
correct<00:00:05.430> yeah<00:00:05.759> you<00:00:05.820> could<00:00:06.240> look<00:00:06.390> at<00:00:06.570> it<00:00:06.630> that

way indeed my job is to be the top

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.529 
way indeed my job is to be the top
advocate<00:00:10.980> for<00:00:11.160> planetary<00:00:11.579> science<00:00:12.089> in<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:12.539 
advocate for planetary science in the

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.329 
advocate for planetary science in the
federal<00:00:12.839> government<00:00:13.230> well<00:00:13.619> and<00:00:13.889> we've<00:00:14.099> been

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:14.339 
federal government well and we've been

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:15.829 
federal government well and we've been
wondering<00:00:14.759> what<00:00:14.879> kind<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.179> science<00:00:15.599> do<00:00:15.749> you

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
wondering what kind of science do you

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.800 
wondering what kind of science do you
think<00:00:16.049> we'll<00:00:16.199> get<00:00:16.410> from<00:00:16.860> this<00:00:17.730> very<00:00:18.179> rare<00:00:18.539> in

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
think we'll get from this very rare in

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.480 
think we'll get from this very rare in
our<00:00:18.929> case<00:00:19.199> event<00:00:19.619> every<00:00:19.890> hundred<00:00:20.160> years<00:00:20.189> are

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
our case event every hundred years are

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.179 
our case event every hundred years are
saying<00:00:20.699> yeah<00:00:20.849> i<00:00:21.089> mean<00:00:21.330> its<00:00:21.359> last<00:00:22.170> time<00:00:22.439> anyone

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
saying yeah i mean its last time anyone

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.159 
saying yeah i mean its last time anyone
on<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.849> earth<00:00:24.029> will<00:00:24.419> be<00:00:24.539> able<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.869> have<00:00:25.050> an

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:25.169 
on this earth will be able to have an

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.419 
on this earth will be able to have an
opportunity<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.769> look<00:00:25.949> at<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.189> fabulous

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:26.429 
opportunity to look at this fabulous

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.790 
opportunity to look at this fabulous
event<00:00:26.999> and<00:00:27.179> so<00:00:27.660> from<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.960> scientific<00:00:28.289> point<00:00:28.679> of

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
event and so from a scientific point of

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.800 
event and so from a scientific point of
view<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:29.580> have<00:00:29.789> developed<00:00:30.089> a<00:00:30.329> variety<00:00:30.449> of

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
view we have developed a variety of

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.070 
view we have developed a variety of
instruments<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.650> will<00:00:31.829> be<00:00:32.009> trained<00:00:32.460> on<00:00:33.080> this

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
instruments that will be trained on this

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.230 
instruments that will be trained on this
transit<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.890> particular<00:00:35.610> there's<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.910> point

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.240 
transit in particular there's a point

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.950 
transit in particular there's a point
where<00:00:36.630> Venus<00:00:37.020> as<00:00:37.470> it<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:38.220> gets<00:00:38.970> nearly

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
where Venus as it just gets nearly

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.680 
where Venus as it just gets nearly
completely<00:00:40.740> on<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.550> desk<00:00:41.820> where<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
completely on the desk where the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.300 
completely on the desk where the
sunlight<00:00:43.170> shines<00:00:43.620> through<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.130> atmosphere

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.310 
sunlight shines through the atmosphere

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.140 
sunlight shines through the atmosphere
and<00:00:44.940> provides<00:00:45.900> us<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.290> great<00:00:46.650> spectrum<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.460> not

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
and provides us a great spectrum of not

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.570 
and provides us a great spectrum of not
only<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.510> solar<00:00:48.720> spectrum<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.860> what's<00:00:50.280> going

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
only the solar spectrum but what's going

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.510 
only the solar spectrum but what's going
on<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.480> Venus<00:00:51.840> atmosphere<00:00:52.080> and<00:00:52.710> that's

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
on in the Venus atmosphere and that's

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.180 
on in the Venus atmosphere and that's
very<00:00:53.790> unique<00:00:54.410> it's<00:00:55.410> important<00:00:55.830> to<00:00:55.890> make<00:00:56.010> those

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
very unique it's important to make those

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.880 
very unique it's important to make those
observations<00:00:56.750> it's<00:00:57.750> important<00:00:58.290> that<00:00:58.860> we

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
observations it's important that we

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.710 
observations it's important that we
compare<00:00:59.400> him<00:00:59.520> with<00:00:59.670> what<00:00:59.970> we<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.510> should

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
compare him with what we think we should

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.600 
compare him with what we think we should
see<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.620> never<00:01:01.830> can<00:01:02.040> tell<00:01:02.100> there<00:01:02.460> might

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
see and you never can tell there might

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.789 
see and you never can tell there might
be<00:01:02.640> some<00:01:02.940> big<00:01:03.150> surprises<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.259> not<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
be some big surprises so it's not just a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.260 
be some big surprises so it's not just a
historical<00:01:05.430> event<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.880> it's<00:01:06.090> we're

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
historical event it's it's we're

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.670 
historical event it's it's we're
actually<00:01:06.480> making<00:01:06.810> some<00:01:07.080> key<00:01:07.290> science

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
actually making some key science

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.980 
actually making some key science
absolutely<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.210> fact<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.630> one<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.900> those

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
absolutely and in fact it's one of those

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.690 
absolutely and in fact it's one of those
things<00:01:10.050> that<00:01:10.410> you<00:01:10.560> never<00:01:10.800> can<00:01:11.130> tell<00:01:11.190> what<00:01:11.580> will

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
things that you never can tell what will

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.580 
things that you never can tell what will
come<00:01:11.910> out<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.230> of<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.440> really

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
come out of it but one of the really

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.420 
come out of it but one of the really
exciting<00:01:14.100> things<00:01:14.640> about<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.480> we're

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
exciting things about this is we're

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.640 
exciting things about this is we're
understanding<00:01:17.600> that<00:01:18.600> planets<00:01:19.170> exist<00:01:19.500> around

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
understanding that planets exist around

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.610 
understanding that planets exist around
other<00:01:19.950> stars<00:01:20.070> they<00:01:21.060> also<00:01:21.300> go<00:01:22.260> through<00:01:22.470> this

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
other stars they also go through this

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.280 
other stars they also go through this
transit<00:01:23.190> mechanism<00:01:23.730> Kepler<00:01:24.090> sees<00:01:24.450> many<00:01:25.140> of

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
transit mechanism Kepler sees many of

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.040 
transit mechanism Kepler sees many of
these<00:01:25.380> transiting<00:01:25.950> planets<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.300> we<00:01:27.810> want

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
these transiting planets and so we want

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.390 
these transiting planets and so we want
to<00:01:28.140> look<00:01:28.260> at<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> atmospheres<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.100> those

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
to look at the atmospheres of those

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.360 
to look at the atmospheres of those
planets<00:01:29.909> too<00:01:30.120> and<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:31.080> by<00:01:31.260> looking<00:01:31.620> at<00:01:31.950> Venus

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
planets too and so by looking at Venus

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.580 
planets too and so by looking at Venus
in<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> right<00:01:32.850> way<00:01:33.120> within<00:01:33.690> our<00:01:33.960> own<00:01:33.990> system

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
in the right way within our own system

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950 
in the right way within our own system
it<00:01:34.830> sort<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.250> gives<00:01:35.370> us<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.729> rosetta<00:01:36.240> stone<00:01:36.630> of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
it sort of gives us a rosetta stone of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.530 
it sort of gives us a rosetta stone of
what<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:37.470> might<00:01:37.770> see<00:01:37.940> when<00:01:38.940> we<00:01:39.090> look<00:01:39.120> at<00:01:39.360> other

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
what we might see when we look at other

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.510 
what we might see when we look at other
planets<00:01:40.050> around<00:01:40.500> other<00:01:40.680> stars<00:01:40.860> you're

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
planets around other stars you're

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.219 
planets around other stars you're
looking<00:01:42.060> at<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> lot<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.510> these<00:01:42.630> objects<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.140> our

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
looking at a lot of these objects in our

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.800 
looking at a lot of these objects in our
solar<00:01:43.440> system<00:01:44.010> and<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.340> idea<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.299> more<00:01:45.570> we

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
solar system and the idea is the more we

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.200 
solar system and the idea is the more we
learn<00:01:45.990> about<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.560> solar<00:01:46.860> system<00:01:47.400> yeah<00:01:48.000> it's

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
learn about this solar system yeah it's

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.910 
learn about this solar system yeah it's
going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.450> make<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.780> much<00:01:49.020> more<00:01:49.229> easy<00:01:49.500> along

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
going to make it much more easy along

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.770 
going to make it much more easy along
with<00:01:50.100> what<00:01:50.220> we<00:01:50.310> learn<00:01:50.490> from<00:01:50.520> Kepler<00:01:51.150> how<00:01:51.720> to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
with what we learn from Kepler how to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.170 
with what we learn from Kepler how to
actually<00:01:52.620> move<00:01:52.860> out<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.100> our<00:01:53.310> solar<00:01:53.549> system

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
actually move out of our solar system

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.780 
actually move out of our solar system
yeah<00:01:54.720> indeed<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.650> more<00:01:55.799> we<00:01:56.100> learn<00:01:56.130> about<00:01:56.370> our

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
yeah indeed the more we learn about our

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.030 
yeah indeed the more we learn about our
solar<00:01:57.090> system<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.840> more<00:01:57.869> we<00:01:58.229> understand<00:01:58.860> how

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
solar system the more we understand how

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.570 
solar system the more we understand how
other<00:01:59.220> solar<00:01:59.580> systems<00:02:00.080> should<00:02:01.080> look<00:02:01.350> like

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
other solar systems should look like

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.830 
other solar systems should look like
around<00:02:02.580> other<00:02:02.790> stars<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.450> what<00:02:03.690> we're

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
around other stars and what we're

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.130 
around other stars and what we're
finding<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.619> they<00:02:05.369> look<00:02:05.729> very<00:02:05.760> different<00:02:06.570> we

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
finding is they look very different we

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.259 
finding is they look very different we
have<00:02:07.290> planets<00:02:07.799> like<00:02:07.979> Jupiter<00:02:08.580> around<00:02:09.090> other

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
have planets like Jupiter around other

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.129 
have planets like Jupiter around other
stars<00:02:09.389> that<00:02:10.259> are<00:02:10.319> as<00:02:10.590> close<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:12.120> their<00:02:12.599> son<00:02:12.930> as

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:13.139 
stars that are as close to their son as

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:14.430 
stars that are as close to their son as
mercury<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:14.010> too

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
mercury is too

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.920 
mercury is too
our<00:02:14.500> son<00:02:14.740> so<00:02:15.190> how<00:02:15.340> did<00:02:15.400> this<00:02:15.670> huge<00:02:16.150> planet<00:02:16.600> get

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
our son so how did this huge planet get

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.170 
our son so how did this huge planet get
in<00:02:17.110> Word<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:18.040> actually<00:02:18.310> has<00:02:18.640> caused<00:02:18.910> us

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
in Word and this actually has caused us

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.210 
in Word and this actually has caused us
to<00:02:19.330> start<00:02:19.600> thinking<00:02:19.660> about<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.230> dynamics<00:02:20.620> the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
to start thinking about the dynamics the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.550 
to start thinking about the dynamics the
gravitational<00:02:21.940> dynamics<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.570> go<00:02:22.840> on<00:02:23.080> that

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
gravitational dynamics that go on that

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.040 
gravitational dynamics that go on that
push<00:02:23.830> planets<00:02:24.280> around<00:02:24.580> within<00:02:25.210> solar<00:02:25.570> systems

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
push planets around within solar systems

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.570 
push planets around within solar systems
and<00:02:26.200> what<00:02:26.410> might<00:02:26.650> have<00:02:26.770> happened<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:27.220> our<00:02:27.250> own

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
and what might have happened to our own

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.480 
and what might have happened to our own
over<00:02:28.330> time<00:02:28.600> because<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:29.440> our<00:02:29.710> large<00:02:29.950> planets

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
over time because of our large planets

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.490 
over time because of our large planets
and<00:02:30.640> their<00:02:30.790> interactions<00:02:31.500> gravitationally

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
and their interactions gravitationally

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.140 
and their interactions gravitationally
yeah<00:02:32.860> I'm<00:02:33.070> sitting<00:02:33.340> here<00:02:33.490> thinking<00:02:33.790> what

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
yeah I'm sitting here thinking what

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.960 
yeah I'm sitting here thinking what
would<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.510> venus<00:02:34.990> transit<00:02:35.200> look<00:02:35.680> like<00:02:35.890> if<00:02:36.190> Venus

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
would a venus transit look like if Venus

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.940 
would a venus transit look like if Venus
was<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.300> size<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.540> Jupiter<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.350> mean<00:02:38.620> we<00:02:38.770> might

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
was the size of Jupiter I mean we might

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.520 
was the size of Jupiter I mean we might
be<00:02:39.160> in<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.340> really<00:02:39.700> bad<00:02:39.880> situation<00:02:40.180> in<00:02:41.110> terms<00:02:41.290> of

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
be in a really bad situation in terms of

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.800 
be in a really bad situation in terms of
well<00:02:41.830> if<00:02:42.070> we<00:02:42.340> had<00:02:42.490> a<00:02:42.520> Jupiter<00:02:43.030> there<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:43.630> it

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
well if we had a Jupiter there and it

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.480 
well if we had a Jupiter there and it
formed<00:02:44.320> there<00:02:44.470> originally<00:02:45.010> we<00:02:45.220> probably

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
formed there originally we probably

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.460 
formed there originally we probably
would<00:02:45.850> not<00:02:46.000> have<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.270> planet<00:02:46.810> called<00:02:46.990> Earth

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
would not have a planet called Earth

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.610 
would not have a planet called Earth
well<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.400> reason<00:02:48.580> why<00:02:48.880> is<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.210> gravitational

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
well the reason why is the gravitational

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.990 
well the reason why is the gravitational
interaction<00:02:50.620> with<00:02:50.770> Jupiter<00:02:51.250> is<00:02:51.700> so

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
interaction with Jupiter is so

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.420 
interaction with Jupiter is so
disruptive<00:02:52.900> we<00:02:53.560> would<00:02:53.740> have<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:53.920> very<00:02:54.040> hard

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
disruptive we would have a very hard

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.760 
disruptive we would have a very hard
time<00:02:54.750> accumulating<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.020> material<00:02:56.560> necessary

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
time accumulating the material necessary

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.760 
time accumulating the material necessary
to<00:02:57.400> form<00:02:57.610> a<00:02:57.790> planet<00:02:58.240> now<00:02:58.990> here's<00:02:59.230> how<00:02:59.290> we<00:02:59.470> know

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
to form a planet now here's how we know

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.190 
to form a planet now here's how we know
that<00:03:00.060> jupiter<00:03:01.060> has<00:03:01.180> already<00:03:01.390> done<00:03:01.780> that<00:03:02.020> to

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
that jupiter has already done that to

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.380 
that jupiter has already done that to
our<00:03:02.320> own<00:03:02.710> objects<00:03:03.370> in<00:03:03.520> our<00:03:03.610> solar<00:03:03.850> system

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
our own objects in our solar system

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.510 
our own objects in our solar system
there's<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:04.990> huge<00:03:05.440> region<00:03:05.920> called<00:03:06.190> the

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
there's a huge region called the

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.330 
there's a huge region called the
asteroid<00:03:07.300> belt<00:03:07.330> that<00:03:08.200> exists<00:03:08.680> between<00:03:08.710> Mars

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
asteroid belt that exists between Mars

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.210 
asteroid belt that exists between Mars
and<00:03:09.490> Jupiter<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:10.240> it's<00:03:10.900> actually<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.740> set<00:03:12.100> of

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
and Jupiter and it's actually a set of

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.100 
and Jupiter and it's actually a set of
material<00:03:12.670> that's<00:03:12.850> trying<00:03:13.300> to<00:03:13.450> come<00:03:13.750> together

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
material that's trying to come together

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.710 
material that's trying to come together
to<00:03:14.440> form<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.920> planet<00:03:15.340> but<00:03:15.760> Jupiter's<00:03:16.210> gravity

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
to form a planet but Jupiter's gravity

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.660 
to form a planet but Jupiter's gravity
won't<00:03:16.930> let<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.740> keeps<00:03:18.070> tugging<00:03:18.400> and

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
won't let it it keeps tugging and

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.430 
won't let it it keeps tugging and
pulling<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.180> keeping<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:19.570> apart<00:03:19.930> I've<00:03:20.170> always

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
pulling and keeping it apart I've always

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.620 
pulling and keeping it apart I've always
been<00:03:20.800> suspicious<00:03:21.010> of<00:03:21.489> Jupiter<00:03:21.940> I'm<00:03:22.120> sorry<00:03:22.480> I

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
been suspicious of Jupiter I'm sorry I

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.330 
been suspicious of Jupiter I'm sorry I
manas<00:03:23.080> think<00:03:23.320> that's<00:03:23.500> really<00:03:23.770> unfortunate

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
manas think that's really unfortunate

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.120 
manas think that's really unfortunate
okay<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:25.000> Jupiter<00:03:25.330> is<00:03:25.450> a<00:03:25.570> good<00:03:25.780> god<00:03:26.040> it's<00:03:27.040> a

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
okay the Jupiter is a good god it's a

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.770 
okay the Jupiter is a good god it's a
really<00:03:27.280> good<00:03:27.580> guy<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:28.000> here's<00:03:28.300> why<00:03:28.480> here's

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
really good guy and here's why here's

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.140 
really good guy and here's why here's
why<00:03:29.080> okay<00:03:29.500> there's<00:03:30.070> a<00:03:30.130> lot<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.370> material<00:03:30.970> we're

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
why okay there's a lot of material we're

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.970 
why okay there's a lot of material we're
finding<00:03:31.540> out<00:03:31.720> not<00:03:31.930> only<00:03:31.959> in<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.380> Kuiper<00:03:32.590> belt

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
finding out not only in the Kuiper belt

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.420 
finding out not only in the Kuiper belt
but<00:03:33.370> in<00:03:33.550> very<00:03:34.120> distant<00:03:34.720> regions<00:03:35.430> cometary

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
but in very distant regions cometary

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.210 
but in very distant regions cometary
material<00:03:36.610> at<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.209> very<00:03:37.540> fringe<00:03:38.170> of<00:03:38.560> the

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
material at the very fringe of the

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.540 
material at the very fringe of the
gravity<00:03:39.850> of<00:03:40.120> our<00:03:40.420> Sun<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:41.250> sometimes<00:03:42.250> those

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
gravity of our Sun and sometimes those

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.400 
gravity of our Sun and sometimes those
that<00:03:42.880> material<00:03:43.360> comes<00:03:43.600> in<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.019> when<00:03:44.200> they<00:03:44.350> do

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
that material comes in and when they do

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.680 
that material comes in and when they do
they're<00:03:45.340> going<00:03:45.519> to<00:03:45.580> come<00:03:45.850> in<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.390> hit<00:03:46.570> the

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
they're going to come in and hit the

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.500 
they're going to come in and hit the
biggest<00:03:46.900> target<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:47.530> that's<00:03:47.890> Jupiter<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:48.940> so

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
biggest target and that's Jupiter and so

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.780 
biggest target and that's Jupiter and so
we<00:03:49.780> believe<00:03:50.260> jupiter<00:03:50.980> has<00:03:51.100> been<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.340> big

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
we believe jupiter has been a big

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.940 
we believe jupiter has been a big
brother<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.209> us<00:03:52.390> and<00:03:52.720> it's<00:03:52.870> really<00:03:53.170> protected

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
brother to us and it's really protected

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.580 
brother to us and it's really protected
life<00:03:54.610> on<00:03:54.850> this<00:03:55.000> planet<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.630> allowed<00:03:55.989> us<00:03:56.019> to

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
life on this planet and allowed us to

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.580 
life on this planet and allowed us to
flourish<00:03:57.550> the<00:03:58.209> only<00:03:58.540> way<00:03:58.720> we<00:03:58.959> know<00:03:59.170> about

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
flourish the only way we know about

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.650 
flourish the only way we know about
these<00:04:00.100> is<00:04:00.370> actually<00:04:00.550> get<00:04:00.970> out<00:04:01.000> and<00:04:01.150> visit

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
these is actually get out and visit

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.080 
these is actually get out and visit
visit<00:04:02.140> Jupiter<00:04:02.500> go<00:04:03.070> to<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:03.310> asteroid<00:04:03.790> belt<00:04:03.820> we

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
visit Jupiter go to the asteroid belt we

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.240 
visit Jupiter go to the asteroid belt we
have<00:04:04.269> a<00:04:04.300> huge<00:04:04.720> spacecraft<00:04:05.140> called<00:04:05.620> dawn<00:04:05.920> with

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
have a huge spacecraft called dawn with

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.460 
have a huge spacecraft called dawn with
very<00:04:06.489> big<00:04:06.730> solar<00:04:07.060> panels<00:04:07.600> and<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.840> ion

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
very big solar panels and the ion

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.280 
very big solar panels and the ion
engines<00:04:08.950> is<00:04:09.610> currently<00:04:10.120> orbiting<00:04:10.540> Vesta<00:04:11.110> and

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
engines is currently orbiting Vesta and

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.830 
engines is currently orbiting Vesta and
it's<00:04:11.950> done<00:04:12.190> its<00:04:12.400> mission<00:04:12.790> now<00:04:12.970> and<00:04:13.209> it's<00:04:13.660> on

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
it's done its mission now and it's on

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.470 
it's done its mission now and it's on
its<00:04:14.080> way<00:04:14.170> out<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:15.100> it<00:04:15.670> will<00:04:15.910> go<00:04:16.030> to<00:04:16.060> another

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
its way out and it will go to another

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.390 
its way out and it will go to another
asteroid<00:04:16.989> called<00:04:17.290> series<00:04:17.769> and<00:04:17.950> then<00:04:18.280> we'll

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
asteroid called series and then we'll

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.159 
asteroid called series and then we'll
learn<00:04:18.549> more<00:04:18.880> about<00:04:19.120> what's<00:04:19.480> in<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.660> asteroid

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
learn more about what's in the asteroid

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.960 
learn more about what's in the asteroid
belt<00:04:20.200> and<00:04:20.560> then<00:04:21.040> we<00:04:21.160> have<00:04:21.340> another<00:04:21.370> spacecraft

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
belt and then we have another spacecraft

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.320 
belt and then we have another spacecraft
called<00:04:22.479> cassini<00:04:22.990> and<00:04:23.410> it<00:04:23.890> is<00:04:24.070> orbiting

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
called cassini and it is orbiting

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.050 
called cassini and it is orbiting
Saturn<00:04:25.750> I<00:04:26.020> feel<00:04:26.650> like<00:04:26.740> I<00:04:26.800> got<00:04:27.159> my<00:04:27.310> notepad<00:04:27.550> out

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
Saturn I feel like I got my notepad out

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.619 
Saturn I feel like I got my notepad out
yeah<00:04:28.360> because<00:04:29.199> that<00:04:29.439> mission<00:04:30.310> is<00:04:30.460> looking<00:04:31.449> at

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:31.629 
yeah because that mission is looking at

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:35.129 
yeah because that mission is looking at
objects<00:04:32.250> moons<00:04:33.250> like<00:04:33.969> Enceladus<00:04:34.449> little

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
objects moons like Enceladus little

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.390 
objects moons like Enceladus little
bitty<00:04:35.289> moons<00:04:35.590> that<00:04:35.800> are<00:04:35.860> just<00:04:36.159> absolutely

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
bitty moons that are just absolutely

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.149 
bitty moons that are just absolutely
turning<00:04:37.180> itself<00:04:37.509> inside<00:04:37.780> out<00:04:37.990> spraying<00:04:38.800> water

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:39.159 
turning itself inside out spraying water

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.820 
turning itself inside out spraying water
in<00:04:39.520> that<00:04:39.669> whole<00:04:39.939> area<00:04:40.210> and<00:04:40.569> then<00:04:41.110> bigger<00:04:41.469> moons

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
in that whole area and then bigger moons

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.980 
in that whole area and then bigger moons
like<00:04:42.129> Titan<00:04:42.610> yeah<00:04:42.879> and<00:04:43.210> Titan<00:04:43.599> has<00:04:43.810> this

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
like Titan yeah and Titan has this

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.679 
like Titan yeah and Titan has this
enormous<00:04:44.319> atmosphere<00:04:45.159> and<00:04:45.340> in<00:04:45.759> fact<00:04:46.000> Titan<00:04:46.509> is

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:46.689 
enormous atmosphere and in fact Titan is

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.040 
enormous atmosphere and in fact Titan is
bigger<00:04:46.719> than<00:04:47.379> the<00:04:47.530> planet<00:04:47.650> Mercury<00:04:48.780> okay<00:04:49.780> and

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
bigger than the planet Mercury okay and

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.170 
bigger than the planet Mercury okay and
if<00:04:50.169> we<00:04:50.349> were<00:04:50.469> to<00:04:50.530> take<00:04:50.770> Titan<00:04:51.250> and<00:04:51.400> pull<00:04:51.789> it<00:04:51.819> out

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
if we were to take Titan and pull it out

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.209 
if we were to take Titan and pull it out
of<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.419> gravitational<00:04:52.900> influence<00:04:53.680> of<00:04:53.860> Saturn

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:54.219 
of the gravitational influence of Saturn

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:56.879 
of the gravitational influence of Saturn
and<00:04:54.449> put<00:04:55.449> it<00:04:55.569> around<00:04:55.659> the<00:04:55.900> Sun<00:04:56.169> we'd<00:04:56.500> call<00:04:56.710> it<00:04:56.740> a

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
and put it around the Sun we'd call it a

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.700 
and put it around the Sun we'd call it a
planet<00:04:57.310> Wow<00:04:57.960> well<00:04:58.960> that's<00:04:59.199> how<00:04:59.349> you're<00:04:59.620> going

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
planet Wow well that's how you're going

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.619 
planet Wow well that's how you're going
to<00:04:59.800> have<00:04:59.949> to<00:05:00.069> readjust<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.819> whole<00:05:01.030> planetary

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:01.629 
to have to readjust the whole planetary

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:03.719 
to have to readjust the whole planetary
system<00:05:02.289> but<00:05:02.469> I<00:05:02.500> guess<00:05:02.979> it<00:05:03.099> does<00:05:03.250> it's<00:05:03.460> it's

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
system but I guess it does it's it's

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.670 
system but I guess it does it's it's
fixed<00:05:04.150> moon<00:05:04.389> it<00:05:04.690> can't<00:05:04.900> be<00:05:05.020> a<00:05:05.050> planet<00:05:05.500> yet

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
fixed moon it can't be a planet yet

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.459 
fixed moon it can't be a planet yet
right<00:05:06.060> kirari<00:05:07.060> so<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.539> have<00:05:07.750> to<00:05:07.870> relearn<00:05:08.199> the

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:08.469 
right kirari so I have to relearn the

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:09.959 
right kirari so I have to relearn the
planets<00:05:08.949> that's<00:05:09.219> one<00:05:09.550> thing<00:05:09.669> I'm<00:05:09.789> very

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:09.969 
planets that's one thing I'm very

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:12.270 
planets that's one thing I'm very
concerned<00:05:10.180> about<00:05:10.479> being<00:05:10.930> over<00:05:11.169> 40<00:05:11.560> okay<00:05:11.979> well

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
concerned about being over 40 okay well

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.040 
concerned about being over 40 okay well
we<00:05:12.490> might<00:05:12.639> have<00:05:12.879> to<00:05:13.030> do<00:05:13.180> that<00:05:13.210> because<00:05:13.599> we're

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
we might have to do that because we're

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.990 
we might have to do that because we're
all<00:05:14.229> we're<00:05:14.620> on<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:14.949> road<00:05:15.129> of<00:05:15.310> discovering

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
all we're on the road of discovering

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.129 
all we're on the road of discovering
major<00:05:16.419> things<00:05:16.930> that's<00:05:17.440> all<00:05:17.650> in<00:05:17.800> our<00:05:17.919> future
