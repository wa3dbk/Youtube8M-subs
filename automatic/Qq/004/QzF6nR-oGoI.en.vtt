see it's a very simple mechanism it's

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.170 
see it's a very simple mechanism it's
just<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:10.020> one<00:02:10.500> spare<00:02:10.860> straight<00:02:11.520> with<00:02:11.940> what<00:02:12.090> we

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
just a one spare straight with what we

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.660 
just a one spare straight with what we
call<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.390> beard<00:02:12.870> at<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.080> end<00:02:13.379> so<00:02:14.190> when<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.489> goes

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
call a beard at the end so when it goes

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.030 
call a beard at the end so when it goes
in<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.030> fish<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.599> it<00:02:15.810> comes<00:02:16.050> out<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.770> doesn't

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
in the fish and it comes out it doesn't

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.770 
in the fish and it comes out it doesn't
you<00:02:17.400> know<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.640> doesn't<00:02:17.970> slide<00:02:18.239> back<00:02:18.540> out<00:02:18.750> of

you know it doesn't slide back out of
the<00:02:19.020> fish<00:02:20.660> spearing<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.900> most<00:02:22.080> effective

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
the fish spearing is the most effective

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.290 
the fish spearing is the most effective
method<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.010> my<00:02:23.130> favorite<00:02:23.550> method<00:02:23.940> because

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
method in my favorite method because

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.200 
method in my favorite method because
unlike<00:02:24.960> with<00:02:25.590> fishing<00:02:26.040> pots<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.700> unlike

unlike with fishing pots and unlike

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.630 
unlike with fishing pots and unlike
can<00:02:27.330> line<00:02:27.650> those<00:02:28.650> two<00:02:28.890> methods<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.370> really

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
can line those two methods you really

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.800 
can line those two methods you really
never<00:02:29.850> know<00:02:30.000> what<00:02:30.300> you're<00:02:30.420> going<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.660> get

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810

smaller fish can get in there that that

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.740 
smaller fish can get in there that that
may<00:02:33.390> die<00:02:34.520> when<00:02:35.520> you're<00:02:35.670> hooking<00:02:35.940> in<00:02:36.210> line<00:02:36.420> you

you<00:02:42.090> actually<00:02:42.510> swim<00:02:42.870> down<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.800> pick<00:02:44.100> the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
you actually swim down and you pick the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.180 
you actually swim down and you pick the
fish<00:02:44.520> that<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.850> will<00:02:44.970> be<00:02:45.320> killing<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.500> what

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
fish that you will be killing and what

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.040 
fish that you will be killing and what
you<00:02:47.310> do<00:02:47.430> is<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.670> swim<00:02:47.940> down<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.360> very<00:02:48.600> simple

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
you do is you swim down and very simple

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.980 
you do is you swim down and very simple
you<00:02:49.380> just<00:02:49.410> take<00:02:49.830> aim<00:02:50.300> put<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.420> in<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.690> sling

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
you just take aim put it in the sling

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.740 
you just take aim put it in the sling
and<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.100> sling<00:02:53.940> back<00:02:54.150> just<00:02:54.600> like

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
and you the sling back just like

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.170 
and you the sling back just like
this<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.200> then<00:02:55.980> once<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.370> have<00:02:56.580> your<00:02:56.730> target

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
this and then once you have your target

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.630 
this and then once you have your target
you<00:02:57.450> just<00:02:57.690> let<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.230> sling<00:02:58.470> go<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.370> spare

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
you just let the sling go and the spare

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.820 
you just let the sling go and the spare
will<00:02:59.820> be<00:02:59.940> projected<00:03:00.150> out<00:03:00.690> into<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.320> fish<00:03:01.560> and

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
will be projected out into the fish and

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.430 
will be projected out into the fish and
hopefully<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:02.670> brain<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.420> don't<00:03:03.870> have

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
hopefully you brain it so you don't have

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.930 
hopefully you brain it so you don't have
to<00:03:04.650> lose<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.860> spare<00:03:05.280> because<00:03:05.580> they're<00:03:05.730> quite

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
to lose a spare because they're quite

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.240 
to lose a spare because they're quite
expensive<00:03:05.970> there<00:03:06.780> are<00:03:06.900> also<00:03:07.110> several<00:03:07.680> illegal

this it will also kill off the reef it

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.690 
this it will also kill off the reef it
will<00:03:33.500> affect<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.650> surrounding<00:03:35.190> fish<00:03:35.460> and

will affect the surrounding fish and

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.250 
will affect the surrounding fish and
then<00:03:35.850> what<00:03:36.030> happens<00:03:36.390> with<00:03:36.570> bleach<00:03:36.810> is<00:03:36.990> that<00:03:37.140> it

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
then what happens with bleach is that it

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.170 
then what happens with bleach is that it
doesn't<00:03:37.560> stay<00:03:37.740> with<00:03:37.890> one<00:03:38.040> place<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:39.030> have

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
doesn't stay with one place you have

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.660 
doesn't stay with one place you have
tied<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:39.540> have<00:03:40.020> current<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:41.070> what<00:03:41.220> happens<00:03:41.550> is

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
tied you have current so what happens is

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.250 
tied you have current so what happens is
the<00:03:41.790> current<00:03:42.120> will<00:03:42.240> carry<00:03:42.270> this<00:03:42.690> bleach<00:03:43.020> and

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
the current will carry this bleach and

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.020 
the current will carry this bleach and
as<00:03:43.350> it<00:03:43.560> dissipates<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.280> will<00:03:44.400> kill<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.820> reef

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
as it dissipates it will kill the reef

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.990 
as it dissipates it will kill the reef
as<00:03:45.240> it<00:03:45.420> goes<00:03:45.600> along<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.260> bleach<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:47.070> the

as it goes along and bleach it the
second<00:03:48.420> Liam<00:03:48.720> method<00:03:49.110> would<00:03:49.290> be<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:50.220> use<00:03:50.250> of

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
second Liam method would be the use of

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.730 
second Liam method would be the use of
explosives<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.900> most<00:03:52.110> popular<00:03:52.320> being

explosives the most popular being

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.180 
explosives the most popular being
dynamite<00:03:53.280> now<00:03:53.820> this<00:03:54.000> is<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.300> most

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
dynamite now this is the most

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.220 
dynamite now this is the most
destructive<00:03:56.190> method<00:03:56.820> you<00:03:57.810> would<00:03:57.870> drop<00:03:58.080> the

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
destructive method you would drop the

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.840 
destructive method you would drop the
stick<00:03:58.410> of<00:03:58.560> dynamite<00:03:58.680> in<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.160> water<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.730> will

stick of dynamite in the water it will

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.910 
stick of dynamite in the water it will
explode<00:04:00.270> and<00:04:00.960> what<00:04:01.140> happens<00:04:01.530> is<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.680> there

explode and what happens is that there

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.280 
explode and what happens is that there
is<00:04:02.010> no<00:04:02.040> selection<00:04:02.790> process<00:04:03.270> here<00:04:03.510> every<00:04:04.050> fish

pieces of the reef off and reef coral

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.180 
pieces of the reef off and reef coral
takes<00:04:17.370> about<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.299> year<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.780> grow<00:04:19.109> one<00:04:19.380> inch<00:04:19.620> so

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
takes about a year to grow one inch so

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.920 
takes about a year to grow one inch so
if<00:04:20.340> you're<00:04:20.489> thinking<00:04:20.640> if<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:21.060> blow<00:04:21.330> off<00:04:21.600> a

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
if you're thinking if you blow off a

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.380 
if you're thinking if you blow off a
couple<00:04:22.650> feet<00:04:23.100> of<00:04:23.310> reef<00:04:23.580> you've<00:04:23.880> killed<00:04:24.180> off

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
couple feet of reef you've killed off

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.540 
couple feet of reef you've killed off
many<00:04:24.840> years<00:04:25.200> of<00:04:25.410> growth<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:25.890> it<00:04:26.250> will<00:04:26.340> take<00:04:26.520> a

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
many years of growth and it will take a

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.700 
many years of growth and it will take a
long<00:04:26.790> time<00:04:27.060> for<00:04:27.120> that<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.630> reproduce<00:04:28.350> itself

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
long time for that to reproduce itself

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.190 
long time for that to reproduce itself
now<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.670> destruction<00:04:30.270> of<00:04:30.360> coral<00:04:30.780> reefs<00:04:30.960> is

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
now the destruction of coral reefs is

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.870 
now the destruction of coral reefs is
very<00:04:31.470> significant<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.370> Nassau<00:04:32.730> grouper

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
very significant to the Nassau grouper

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.510 
very significant to the Nassau grouper
because<00:04:33.360> that<00:04:33.540> is<00:04:33.660> its<00:04:33.810> habitat<00:04:34.280> obviously<00:04:35.280> if

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
because that is its habitat obviously if

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.400 
because that is its habitat obviously if
you<00:04:35.760> destroy<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.330> habitat<00:04:36.480> for<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.169> species

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
you destroy the habitat for the species

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.590 
you destroy the habitat for the species
then<00:04:38.280> it<00:04:38.400> will<00:04:38.520> have<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:38.820> move<00:04:39.060> into<00:04:39.240> another

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
then it will have to move into another

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
then it will have to move into another
area<00:04:39.840> or

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
area or

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.310 
area or
eventually<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.460> may<00:04:41.669> become<00:04:41.850> totally<00:04:42.479> extinct

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
eventually it may become totally extinct

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.530 
eventually it may become totally extinct
I<00:04:43.530> would<00:04:44.190> have<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:44.580> say<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:45.060> there<00:04:45.240> has<00:04:45.360> been

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
I would have to say that there has been

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.340 
I would have to say that there has been
a<00:04:45.570> slight<00:04:45.870> decline<00:04:46.940> especially<00:04:47.940> in<00:04:48.030> abaco<00:04:48.570> you

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
a slight decline especially in abaco you

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.700 
a slight decline especially in abaco you
can<00:04:49.620> go<00:04:49.889> out<00:04:49.919> how<00:04:50.220> you<00:04:50.280> use<00:04:50.639> to<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.350> go<00:04:52.350> out<00:04:52.500> for

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
can go out how you use to and go out for

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.500 
can go out how you use to and go out for
an<00:04:52.770> hour<00:04:52.860> or<00:04:53.130> two<00:04:53.280> and<00:04:53.430> fill<00:04:53.639> your<00:04:53.669> boat<00:04:54.000> with

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
an hour or two and fill your boat with

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.939 
an hour or two and fill your boat with
with<00:04:54.840> group<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.290> now<00:04:55.380> you<00:04:55.440> have<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:55.800> actually

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
with group and now you have to actually

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.129 
with group and now you have to actually
go<00:04:56.310> looking<00:04:56.340> you<00:04:57.000> have<00:04:57.120> to<00:04:57.270> search<00:04:57.510> hard<00:04:57.840> under

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
go looking you have to search hard under

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.439 
go looking you have to search hard under
the<00:04:58.320> rocks<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:58.919> the<00:04:58.979> group<00:04:59.910> are<00:05:00.060> actually

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
the rocks and the group are actually

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.000 
the rocks and the group are actually
getting<00:05:00.600> smaller<00:05:01.080> too<00:05:01.380> because<00:05:01.770> of<00:05:01.919> the

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
getting smaller too because of the

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.100 
getting smaller too because of the
overfishing<00:05:02.520> people<00:05:03.090> aren't<00:05:03.600> giving<00:05:03.870> them<00:05:04.020> a

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
overfishing people aren't giving them a

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.750 
overfishing people aren't giving them a
chance<00:05:04.320> to<00:05:04.530> reproduce<00:05:05.100> and<00:05:05.310> catch<00:05:05.490> themselves

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
chance to reproduce and catch themselves

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.810 
chance to reproduce and catch themselves
so<00:05:06.750> there's<00:05:06.930> been<00:05:07.139> a<00:05:07.169> definite<00:05:07.680> decline<00:05:08.040> first

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
so there's been a definite decline first

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.610 
so there's been a definite decline first
of<00:05:09.000> all<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.419> the<00:05:09.630> regulation<00:05:10.169> on<00:05:10.290> group<00:05:10.470> is

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
of all the the regulation on group is

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.320 
of all the the regulation on group is
being<00:05:10.770> three<00:05:11.280> pounds<00:05:11.760> you<00:05:11.940> don't<00:05:12.120> want<00:05:12.270> to

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
being three pounds you don't want to

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.029 
being three pounds you don't want to
take<00:05:12.510> a<00:05:12.540> juvenile<00:05:13.080> group<00:05:13.320> because<00:05:13.770> they<00:05:13.919> have

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
take a juvenile group because they have

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.370 
take a juvenile group because they have
not<00:05:14.220> yet<00:05:14.460> had<00:05:14.580> a<00:05:14.639> chance<00:05:14.729> to<00:05:15.330> to<00:05:15.780> spawn<00:05:16.139> and

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
not yet had a chance to to spawn and

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.680 
not yet had a chance to to spawn and
reproduce<00:05:16.970> you<00:05:17.970> want<00:05:18.180> them<00:05:18.330> to<00:05:18.419> have<00:05:18.539> the

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
reproduce you want them to have the

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.750 
reproduce you want them to have the
chance<00:05:18.990> to<00:05:19.139> make<00:05:19.680> more<00:05:19.919> grupa<00:05:20.370> so<00:05:20.610> there's

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
chance to make more grupa so there's

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.480 
chance to make more grupa so there's
more<00:05:21.000> for<00:05:21.150> everyone<00:05:21.539> the<00:05:21.960> second<00:05:22.440> method<00:05:22.620> the

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
more for everyone the second method the

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.029 
more for everyone the second method the
close-season<00:05:24.240> is<00:05:24.720> a<00:05:24.750> very<00:05:25.110> effective<00:05:25.530> method

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
close-season is a very effective method

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.150 
close-season is a very effective method

one<00:05:29.430> month<00:05:29.699> now<00:05:30.449> is<00:05:30.660> extended<00:05:31.289> from<00:05:31.470> December

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
one month now is extended from December

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.010 
one month now is extended from December
under<00:05:32.430> februari<00:05:32.940> and<00:05:33.210> this<00:05:33.449> is<00:05:33.600> important

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
under februari and this is important

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.960 
under februari and this is important
because<00:05:34.080> this<00:05:34.410> is<00:05:34.530> when<00:05:34.710> the<00:05:34.830> groupers<00:05:35.250> spawn

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
because this is when the groupers spawn

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.490 
because this is when the groupers spawn
the<00:05:36.180> most<00:05:36.389> this<00:05:36.570> is<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:36.750> most<00:05:36.870> active

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
the most this is the most active

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.670 
the most this is the most active
reproductive<00:05:38.280> season<00:05:38.490> so<00:05:39.419> it<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:40.169> logic

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
reproductive season so it the logic

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.200 
reproductive season so it the logic
behind<00:05:40.800> it<00:05:41.100> is<00:05:41.220> that<00:05:41.250> it<00:05:41.490> gives<00:05:41.520> the<00:05:41.850> group<00:05:42.060> or

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
behind it is that it gives the group or

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.990 
behind it is that it gives the group or
a<00:05:42.240> chance<00:05:42.510> to<00:05:42.750> catch<00:05:42.930> itself<00:05:43.380> and<00:05:43.710> in<00:05:44.520> in

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
a chance to catch itself and in in

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.540 
a chance to catch itself and in in
return<00:05:45.930> there's<00:05:46.349> more<00:05:46.620> group<00:05:46.830> available<00:05:47.370> for

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
return there's more group available for

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.029 
return there's more group available for
fishermen<00:05:48.000> by<00:05:48.930> taking<00:05:49.320> a<00:05:49.410> group<00:05:49.590> with<00:05:49.770> that<00:05:49.919> is

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
fishermen by taking a group with that is

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.680 
fishermen by taking a group with that is

lot of development going on now in the

lot of development going on now in the

Nassau and all these places a lot of the
development<00:06:50.580> is<00:06:50.700> being<00:06:51.060> made<00:06:51.300> in<00:06:51.510> wetlands

mainly<00:06:52.560> mangroves<00:06:53.099> because<00:06:53.460> it's<00:06:53.640> cheap

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
mainly mangroves because it's cheap

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.120 
mainly mangroves because it's cheap
and<00:06:54.390> what's<00:06:55.140> happening<00:06:55.560> is<00:06:55.740> that<00:06:55.770> these

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.130 
and what's happening is that these

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.250 
and what's happening is that these
fishing<00:06:56.940> nurseries<00:06:57.360> are<00:06:57.390> being<00:06:57.780> destroyed<00:06:58.200> by

fishing nurseries are being destroyed by

fishing nurseries are being destroyed by
man<00:06:58.770> and<00:06:59.040> then<00:06:59.310> the<00:06:59.520> fish<00:06:59.730> don't<00:07:00.000> have

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
man and then the fish don't have

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.790 
man and then the fish don't have
anywhere<00:07:00.600> to<00:07:00.660> grow<00:07:01.020> and<00:07:01.200> so<00:07:01.260> I<00:07:01.320> think<00:07:01.590> you<00:07:01.650> have

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 
anywhere to grow and so I think you have

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.680 
anywhere to grow and so I think you have
to<00:07:01.830> the<00:07:02.520> strategy<00:07:02.790> you<00:07:03.090> have<00:07:03.240> to<00:07:03.360> take<00:07:03.540> you

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
to the strategy you have to take you

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.870 
to the strategy you have to take you
have<00:07:03.810> to<00:07:03.930> come<00:07:04.110> at<00:07:04.260> it<00:07:04.380> from<00:07:04.410> a<00:07:04.680> few<00:07:05.220> angles<00:07:05.580> and

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 
have to come at it from a few angles and

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.420 
have to come at it from a few angles and
a<00:07:06.420> combination<00:07:07.170> of<00:07:07.260> things<00:07:07.320> to<00:07:07.860> keep<00:07:08.280> the

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 
a combination of things to keep the

a combination of things to keep the
grouper<00:07:08.820> alive
