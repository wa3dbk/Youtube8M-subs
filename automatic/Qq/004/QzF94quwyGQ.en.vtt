opera knology sauce you can trim your

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.770 
opera knology sauce you can trim your
brisket<00:01:47.159> up<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:51.030> would<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.299> going<00:01:51.509> with<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
brisket up that would be going with the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.850 
brisket up that would be going with the
grain<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.290> side<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:54.810> would<00:01:55.020> be<00:01:55.049> this

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
grain on that side this would be this

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.649 
grain on that side this would be this
would<00:01:56.040> be<00:01:56.189> trimming<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.640> against<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> grain

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
would be trimming it against the grain

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.260 
would be trimming it against the grain
