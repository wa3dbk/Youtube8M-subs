00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.030
 in good I am we are here in maker port 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.620
 to see a new tutorial from the rest of the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.210
 sir today according to this turielle 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.630
 quite interesting today I bring you a 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.369
 hidden warehouse if it's a mere this 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.020
 rather curious that what allows us 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.320
 is to have a hidden warehouse with chests 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.550
 craft table and kilns in a hidden way 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.960
 in this way we can have in 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.300
 our house that nobody realizes that 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.769
 we have there is a hidden area get it 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.719
 for there is a mountain that nobody gives 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.399
 account is worth for example here we have a 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.110
 couple is a wall is the same as it was 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.210
 what have I done then on the wall of our 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.430
 house a wall a mountain an area 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.649
 hidden is worth a cave worth and we 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.000
 running a lever that we have here is 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.370
 how to become one over the warehouse 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.680
 hidden and how to turn a craft table 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.020
 eo the big chests in our sell 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.730
 chaise and five we have to say 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.739
 that this plan expandable actions say 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.300
 that we are going to do it until 16 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.829
 blocks because what gives us the subtraction a 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.780
 ok because then with repeats of not 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.949
 it works we have that is praia block and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.809
 you can do our smallest say 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.610
 we could do it just like that only that 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.450
 have a chest is worth in this case done 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.300
 of five 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.190
 It interests me well 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.110
 this is a reservation system so 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.550
 simple bullet that used a lever that 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.170
 when it's up it goes on and with the 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.460
 work goes off is worth this what 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.900
 retransmit we would make a button one 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.180
 lever hides a mechanism of rest in 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.700
 As I always say , it's good 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.010
 I explain how any pulse works 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.840
 the lever is worth a tic here 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.480
 around here is worth up 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.270
 remove this row of blocks that I eat 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.729
 I'm going to do it so we can see better 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.979
 when it's closed when we give the 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.450
 lever turns on low these pistons 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.450
 from here it's worth it because it comes because the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.860
 signal drops them and at the same time enters 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.290
 the rest here what happens when they are under 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.450
 these pistons like how to see this floor 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.160
 of a sticky here when it arrives 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.560
 down is extended vale and as has a 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.100
 block here is worth that block is put here 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.390
 ok we have this block put 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.700
 now for them to upload what we do is 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.990
 to come down here because the limiter of 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.310
 pulse is that when you turn off the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.020
 current is as we already know the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.970
 Pulse listings send a pulse 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.050
 when the bossy current is paid in 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.420
 the feedback that makes them do 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.250
 click and upload all this row of balloons 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.280
 tony the piston upwards is worth as 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.709
 move makes it go up you see it goes up and 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.080
 last here we have a small row 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.330
 with then of rest in which they give cane 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.830
 to these sticky piston that we have here 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.600
 that elevate these stairs not because 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.070
 these are stairs so we can 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.800
 access the oven clear because if I eat 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.630
 here block d 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.490
 Well, the oven, so we have to give it there 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.940
 ok and so we have a little more of 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.200
 hollow to catch it is worth everything that 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.550
 this mechanism is therefore completely 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.770
 personalized is to say that I do want 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.950
 instead of putting this is look let's go to 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.160
 change the age of putting these blocks 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.770
 A) Yes 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.050
 and we are going to put metal blocks worth and 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.670
 we are going to use stairs and in green 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.410
 to save the chest with using it for 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.320
 save them in a collection of blocks 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.610
 of diamond or offers your intent in elche 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.190
 is what we want worth the 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.360
 hidden system is very good this is the 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.850
 had version let's build today 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.560
 forward the objects that we use 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.990
 structural are these as you can see 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.370
 they are relatively simple but we have 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.640
 the problem that we are going to give enough 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.230
 pistons in the east is worth it because 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.140
 think we're going to use pistons for 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.020
 all sides ai ai ai good there with having 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.900
 pistons by hand and it is already worth this 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.110
 case let's make a d 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.489
 we are not going to make this demand so that 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.379
 they are smaller more compact is going to be 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.569
 that's how small it is ok we can first 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.760
 this is worth once put this we are going to 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.590
 start with the mechanism first in the 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.230
 part of here worth here is going to be the 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.879
 wall in this part I'm going to put here here 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.140
 down we are going to put three visions 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.000
 sticky, okay, this is going to 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.859
 extend towards truck we create good vale 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.870
 be sticky pistons and towards here 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.549
 let's do exactly the same but 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.620
 with normal people normal pistons 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.500
 vale proposed here close tonella remove 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.349
 the promo yes is worth and we do here is like 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.150
 a wall and is of balloons with good vale 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.390
 now 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.079
 here we put two sticky pistons worth 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.450
 here we put blocks of what is going to 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.489
 cover the wall is worth then 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.260
 we will put a row that points towards 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.409
 down from normal pistons in the part 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.620
 back here it's worth normal pistons 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:17.329
 normal 1 2 3 ok and on the other side 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.979
 which is pointing to the blocks of 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.479
 quartz or blocks or hidden 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:28.000
 you have sticky instead of normal 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:30.080
 to see well correct okay ok let's continue 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.729
 Now let's start making 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.120
 mechanism that you will see here back it's worth 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:37.340
 well it's relatively simple for it 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.350
 we put our input here up 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.970
 on this diagonal to see it here here 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.949
 we put a torch since I 'm going to put 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.449
 the lever is worth the lever where 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.850
 the signal will arrive badly 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.180
 let's go here a block here we put a 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.039
 torch now highlighted this piston room 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.780
 we can this here and we put this here 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.430
 it is worth remembering that there is longer as 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.740
 we can see here are ten four then it is 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.030
 I will do everything wrong to give coba libya 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.889
 note that if you do not then go to 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.620
 mess up 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.080
 ok we continue here we will go another 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.939
 row of reston size today sorry 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.550
 here not one below 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:11.409
 here is worth the size as how to see the same 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.539
 and now let's start doing here the 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.039
 mechanism that we are interested in 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.499
 the limited of pulses we put here a 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.659
 little reston is worth here we put a 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:21.699
 repeater pointing towards it already 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.349
 we have a sticky piston pointing 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.169
 down it's worth and here we're going to put a 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:28.139
 rest block 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.360
 even if it does not go well here perfect now 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.240
 today we are going to remove this part from here 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.800
 ok as you could see let's take it out 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.060
 let's make a hole we should reach 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.919
 the rest block put it here 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.699
 remains and here below we are going to put 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.229
 torches below these pistons is worth 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:46.090
 perfect 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.310
 well this we could cover it already with the 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.960
 block what is going to be published and 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:54.039
 let's continue the tutorial is worth now 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:56.020
 around here we will get a new one from 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.319
 rest we put here a piston here in 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:02.039
 seen normal will spread what on 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.039
 and we get out here 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.910
 as these blocks are worth here we put a 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:13.820
 repetitive repeater is worth and we put here 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:15.050
 block blocks and here rest is worth I'm 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.580
 good as bombeiros fountains 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.620
 mechanism works correctly values 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.850
 that we would make our wall hide and 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.280
 We have the mechanism so that you can not see 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:25.580
 from outside and we could have this already 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.980
 hidden pulse I talked open them we can 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.230
 access here to our little things is worth and 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.580
 when we leave we press the lever a 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.100
 hidden mechanism that we have for 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.320
 close it and the mechanism closes well 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.280
 this mechanism rest like eating is 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.560
 pretty simple to build 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.030
 relatively easy and very useful and good 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.130
 prisoners of this mechanism this in a 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.620
 hidden store is sometimes you can 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.450
 like then and give light and favorites 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.220
 and subscribe almost wants to say more 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.670
 My videos, I'm sorry, but what a fright 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.670
 another goodbye
