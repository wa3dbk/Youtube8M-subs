00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.219
 hello I'm francisco I'm an instructor 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.620
 police shooting I'll explain a 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:13.230
 little basic safety rules 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.240
 in the handling of firearms what 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.420
 more important when we handle a weapon 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.540
 the most important security 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.369
 The first thing we have to do when 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.560
 put any circumstance there 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.490
 let's manipulate a firearm is 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.630
 check whether or not it is loaded 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:35.530
 then we will first extract the charger 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.530
 we will check that there is no cartridge 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.880
 next 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.250
 back we'll make the gun belt and the 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.070
 we will leave behind and check that 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.420
 the long gun chamber here does not 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.340
 there is no cartridge 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.380
 we are missing ham 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.260
 no cartridge 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.830
 so then in principle the soul is 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.230
 downloaded is still worth it we always have 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.320
 to manipulate it as if it were 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.270
 charged is then how the weapon is 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.540
 loaded never sticks your finger in the 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:14.260
 trigger if I'm not going to shoot 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.880
 if I do not make the conscious decision of 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.330
 I'm going to shoot, I put my finger 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.770
 inside the finger always outside 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.660
 the canyon always has to be 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.300
 directed towards a safe area we are 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.040
 a shooting gallery 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.380
 through the safest area of ​​the firing range 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.280
 in the area of ​​whites 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.730
 is where we are going to shoot 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.120
 good 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.490
 and finally we should have well 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.190
 clear that there are behind those targets and 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.670
 continuing with the issue of safety in 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.920
 the fields and shooting galleries is very 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.900
 important and it's mandatory and for 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.140
 always with protective glasses worth 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.860
 always when we are making a 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.800
 shooting practice as a pod one 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.650
 splinter of a bullet from a rebound we 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.680
 can cause lesions in one eye in 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.040
 an important injury and then how is 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.410
 obvious then because of the noise as good ones 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.440
 protective helmets approved a 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.370
 shooting headphones that protect us from 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.370
 sound 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.769
 yes 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.110
