00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
field I feel like it is just because I'm

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.900 
field I feel like it is just because I'm
a<00:00:46.110> smaller<00:00:46.379> guy<00:00:46.620> fat<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.280> faster<00:00:47.670> than<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
a smaller guy fat and faster than the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.330 
a smaller guy fat and faster than the
tight<00:00:48.120> end<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:49.320> stay<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.980> receiver

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
tight end I can stay with the receiver

tight end I can stay with the receiver
so<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.030> feel<00:00:51.300> like<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.570> would<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:51.719> no<00:00:51.870> problem

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
so I feel like it would be no problem

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.630 
so I feel like it would be no problem
for<00:00:52.289> me<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.620> run<00:00:52.800> outside<00:00:52.949> with<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> running
