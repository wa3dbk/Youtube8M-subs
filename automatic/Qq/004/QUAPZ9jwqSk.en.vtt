00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.540
 gold in this mini tutorial we will explain 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.689
 how one of the tools works 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.929
 used on the digital board 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.619
 we are before a compass 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.449
 to start compass 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.449
 we can comment on it and decrease it in size 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.529
 the compass parts sun the joining part 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.529
 selecting the we can drag compass 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.329
 the right arm 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.329
 we can also be blind to move it 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.870
 the left arm although it will allow us to rotate 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.840
 Compass 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.760
 in pencil that will allow 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.600
 turn 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.080
 and at the same time draw 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.320
 and this part of union of the left arm with pencil 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.320
 Which will allow 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.660
 the shopping overture 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.200
 in such a way that we 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.800
 we can draw 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.710
 circumferences chirp course 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.370
 with different radios 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.370
 an example we can achieve here 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.490
 once drawn 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.490
 We have 3 circumferences 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.560
 that we can solve and drag anywhere 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.280
 the screen 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.280
 as objects and independent 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.490
 as well 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.390
 once a circle has been selected 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.780
 not only will we be able to drag fran 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.990
 but we are going to be able to rotate it 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.030
 change its size 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.310
 with the shooters 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.310
 which is inscribed 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.159
 and this is all once we know how to use this magnificent tool 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.719
 It will not be easy and colorful 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.219
 explain 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.049
 for example geometry exercises
