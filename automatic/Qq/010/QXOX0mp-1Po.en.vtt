00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.320 

the<00:00:12.690> last<00:00:12.900> time<00:00:13.170> we<00:00:13.759> spun<00:00:14.759> up<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.059> motor

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
the last time we spun up this motor

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.200 
the last time we spun up this motor
we're<00:00:15.660> just<00:00:15.929> using<00:00:16.340> the<00:00:17.340> power<00:00:17.550> from<00:00:17.970> for

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
we're just using the power from for

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.900 
we're just using the power from for
these<00:00:18.390> batteries<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.320> spin<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.920> at<00:00:20.100> 48<00:00:20.580> volts

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
these batteries to spin it at 48 volts

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.310 
these batteries to spin it at 48 volts
we<00:00:21.060> didn't<00:00:21.300> have<00:00:21.390> any<00:00:21.570> sort<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.840> speed<00:00:22.140> control

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
we didn't have any sort of speed control

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.470 
we didn't have any sort of speed control
or<00:00:22.740> anything<00:00:22.920> like<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.699> we<00:00:23.760> just<00:00:24.150> used

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
or anything like that and we just used

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.630 
or anything like that and we just used
one<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.720> these<00:00:24.840> high<00:00:25.380> power<00:00:25.650> disconnects<00:00:26.369> to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
one of these high power disconnects to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.900 
one of these high power disconnects to
turn<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.960> off<00:00:28.109> now<00:00:28.470> I've<00:00:29.279> got<00:00:29.609> a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
turn it on and off now I've got a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.049 
turn it on and off now I've got a
potentiometer<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.949> zero<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.850> five

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
potentiometer this is a zero to five

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.200 
potentiometer this is a zero to five
kilo<00:00:33.390> ohm<00:00:33.600> potentiometer<00:00:34.579> I<00:00:35.579> picked<00:00:35.880> up<00:00:36.000> at

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
kilo ohm potentiometer I picked up at

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.990 
kilo ohm potentiometer I picked up at
RadioShack<00:00:37.020> for<00:00:37.500> four<00:00:37.680> bucks

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
RadioShack for four bucks

this<00:00:39.300> Kurtis<00:00:40.050> controller<00:00:40.469> very<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:40.920> designed

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
this Kurtis controller very is designed

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.280 
this Kurtis controller very is designed
to<00:00:41.520> use<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> zero<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.300> five<00:00:42.719> kilo<00:00:43.110> ohm

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
to use a zero to five kilo ohm

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.270 
to use a zero to five kilo ohm
potentiometer

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
potentiometer

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.810 
potentiometer
as<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.350> signal<00:00:46.350> control<00:00:46.800> essentially<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.579> gas

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
as a signal control essentially the gas

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.690 
as a signal control essentially the gas
pedal<00:00:48.329> or<00:00:48.539> your<00:00:48.690> speed<00:00:48.989> control<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.920> got<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> zero

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
pedal or your speed control I got a zero

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.810 
pedal or your speed control I got a zero
to<00:00:50.969> ten<00:00:51.300> kilo<00:00:51.570> ohm<00:00:52.309> because<00:00:53.309> I'll<00:00:53.489> just<00:00:53.640> use

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
to ten kilo ohm because I'll just use

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.819 
to ten kilo ohm because I'll just use
the<00:00:53.969> first<00:00:54.120> half<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.809> because<00:00:55.410> then<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.649> only

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
the first half of it because then I only

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.130 
the first half of it because then I only
have<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> spin<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.850> half<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.480> far<00:00:57.750> because

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
have to spin it a half as far because

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.099 
have to spin it a half as far because
out<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.770> box<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.670> dial<00:01:00.000> spins<00:01:00.390> 300

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
out of the box this dial spins 300

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.290 
out of the box this dial spins 300
degrees<00:01:01.469> which<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.730> better<00:01:02.879> part<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
degrees which is the better part of a

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.530 
degrees which is the better part of a
circle<00:01:03.660> which<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.960> too<00:01:04.379> far<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.880> simple

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
circle which is too far for a simple

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.719 
circle which is too far for a simple
spring-loaded<00:01:07.200> swing<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.580> have

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
spring-loaded swing that I can have

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.210 
spring-loaded swing that I can have
hooked<00:01:09.330> up<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.659> gas<00:01:09.810> pedal<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.229> car<00:01:10.470> so

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
hooked up to the gas pedal in the car so

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.200 
hooked up to the gas pedal in the car so
now<00:01:11.430> with<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:13.320> potentiometer<00:01:13.830> hooked<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:14.970> to

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
now with this potentiometer hooked up to

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.300 
now with this potentiometer hooked up to
pins<00:01:15.570> 2<00:01:15.840> &amp;<00:01:15.990> 3<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.409> Curtiss<00:01:16.650> controller<00:01:17.070> if

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
pins 2 &amp; 3 on the Curtiss controller if

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.679 
pins 2 &amp; 3 on the Curtiss controller if
I<00:01:17.400> turn<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.909> little<00:01:17.939> bit<00:01:18.150> let's<00:01:18.450> see<00:01:18.540> what

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
I turn it a little bit let's see what

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:41.649 
I turn it a little bit let's see what
happens

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.090 

so<00:01:42.659> now<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:42.990> speed<00:01:43.320> control<00:01:43.770> over<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
so now I have speed control over the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.950 
so now I have speed control over the
motor<00:01:44.280> using<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.850> potentiometer<00:01:45.329> but<00:01:45.840> as

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
motor using this potentiometer but as

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.270 
motor using this potentiometer but as
you<00:01:46.079> can<00:01:46.200> hear<00:01:46.439> there's<00:01:46.649> something<00:01:47.040> that's<00:01:47.159> a

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
you can hear there's something that's a

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.830 
you can hear there's something that's a
lot<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.700> balance<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.240> there<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.570> I'm<00:01:48.659> still

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
lot of balance in there so I'm still

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.910 
lot of balance in there so I'm still
going<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.049> have<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.229> take<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> motor<00:01:49.740> apart

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
going to have to take the motor apart

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.130 
going to have to take the motor apart
and<00:01:50.369> make<00:01:51.149> sure<00:01:51.330> everything's<00:01:51.780> put<00:01:52.020> together

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
and make sure everything's put together

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.649 
and make sure everything's put together
properly<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:53.009> might<00:01:53.580> still<00:01:53.850> be<00:01:53.880> replacing<00:01:54.539> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
properly I might still be replacing the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.560 
properly I might still be replacing the
bearings<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.140> there<00:01:55.259> as<00:01:55.409> well
