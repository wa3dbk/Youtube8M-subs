defensive purposes i suppose but i use a
neck<00:01:23.130> knife<00:01:23.340> or<00:01:23.610> utility<00:01:24.150> purpose<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.810> its

neck knife or utility purpose and its

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.280 
neck knife or utility purpose and its
really<00:01:25.650> good<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.390> to<00:01:27.390> poke<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.869> things

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
really good to to poke in the things

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.380 
really good to to poke in the things
like<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:29.220> goes<00:01:29.430> right<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> cardboard

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
like it goes right in the cardboard

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.660 
like it goes right in the cardboard
without<00:01:30.840> even<00:01:31.079> thinking<00:01:31.110> about<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.740> things

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
without even thinking about it things

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.880 
without even thinking about it things
i'd<00:01:32.880> use<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.299> neck<00:01:33.659> knife<00:01:33.900> or<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.320> would<00:01:34.439> be<00:01:34.470> to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
i'd use a neck knife or it would be to

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.960 
i'd use a neck knife or it would be to
maybe<00:01:35.520> cut<00:01:35.790> cardboard<00:01:36.619> like<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:40.970> comes

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
maybe cut cardboard like that and comes

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.810 
maybe cut cardboard like that and comes
right<00:01:42.060> off<00:01:42.290> another<00:01:43.290> thing<00:01:43.560> i<00:01:43.680> use<00:01:43.950> recognized

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
right off another thing i use recognized

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.230 
right off another thing i use recognized
a<00:01:44.850> lot<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.619> cut<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.950> tape<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:48.149> I

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
a lot for is to cut the tape and I

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.639 
a lot for is to cut the tape and I
probably<00:01:48.450> shouldn't<00:01:48.780> cut<00:01:48.930> toward<00:01:49.229> myself

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
probably shouldn't cut toward myself

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.270 
probably shouldn't cut toward myself
like<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.700> cut<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.720> tape<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.770> open<00:01:53.040> up<00:01:53.159> a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
like that but cut the tape to open up a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.120 
like that but cut the tape to open up a
package<00:01:54.020> really

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
package really

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.590 
package really
eyes<00:01:57.200> when<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.229> do<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> lot<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.909> mine<00:02:00.360> you'd

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
eyes when I do a lot of is mine you'd

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.410 
eyes when I do a lot of is mine you'd
work<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.890> figure<00:02:02.189> if<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.460> neck<00:02:02.670> knife<00:02:02.850> can

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
work and I figure if a neck knife can

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.190 
work and I figure if a neck knife can
cut<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.780> lanyard<00:02:04.170> cleanly<00:02:04.979> then<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.020> good

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
cut the lanyard cleanly then it's a good

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.780 
cut the lanyard cleanly then it's a good
knife<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.970> cuts<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.780> really<00:02:10.050> nice<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.790> a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
knife and that cuts it really nice and a

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.820 
knife and that cuts it really nice and a
lot<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.030> neck<00:02:12.269> knives<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:13.170> are<00:02:13.500> not<00:02:13.709> very

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
lot of neck knives that are not very

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.690 
lot of neck knives that are not very
sharp<00:02:14.160> will<00:02:14.940> leave<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.480> lot<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.930> dull<00:02:16.700> flappy

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
sharp will leave a lot of dull flappy

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.270 
sharp will leave a lot of dull flappy
edges<00:02:18.090> I'm<00:02:18.900> not<00:02:19.140> sure<00:02:19.290> how<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.500> describe<00:02:19.709> it

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
edges I'm not sure how to describe it

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.600 
edges I'm not sure how to describe it
but<00:02:20.580> not<00:02:21.330> cleanly<00:02:21.690> without<00:02:22.470> any<00:02:22.890> effort<00:02:23.130> that

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
but not cleanly without any effort that

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.570 
but not cleanly without any effort that
cut<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.930> really<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.650> with

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
cut that and I really like that with

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.110 
cut that and I really like that with
this<00:02:26.730> knife<00:02:27.000> any<00:02:27.870> knife<00:02:28.160> now<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.220> use<00:02:29.549> I'd<00:02:29.940> like

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
this knife any knife now to use I'd like

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.080 
this knife any knife now to use I'd like
it<00:02:30.299> to<00:02:30.420> cut<00:02:30.660> lanyard<00:02:31.500> cord<00:02:31.799> 550<00:02:32.370> cord<00:02:32.549> easily

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
it to cut lanyard cord 550 cord easily

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.750 
it to cut lanyard cord 550 cord easily
the<00:02:34.049> old<00:02:34.170> paper<00:02:34.380> test<00:02:34.739> it's<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:35.580> little<00:02:35.640> bit

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
the old paper test it's a little bit

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.240 
the old paper test it's a little bit
harder<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.150> do<00:02:36.390> with<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.720> neck<00:02:36.870> knife<00:02:37.250> because

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
harder to do with the neck knife because

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.270 
harder to do with the neck knife because
blade<00:02:38.940> shorter<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:40.319> can<00:02:40.470> see<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.830> cuts<00:02:41.069> it

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
blade shorter but you can see it cuts it

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.809 
blade shorter but you can see it cuts it
you<00:02:41.880> can<00:02:42.060> stop<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.720> cut<00:02:43.170> too<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.640> cuts

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
you can stop and cut too and so it cuts

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.309 
you can stop and cut too and so it cuts
cleanly<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.540> that's<00:02:48.720> what<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:48.959> want<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.200> see

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
cleanly and that's what you want to see

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.220 
cleanly and that's what you want to see
in<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.500> paper<00:02:49.709> cut<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.209> cuts<00:02:51.450> in<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:52.019> nice

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
in the paper cut if it cuts in a nice

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.620 
in the paper cut if it cuts in a nice
clean<00:02:52.560> edge<00:02:52.890> instead<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.579> a<00:02:53.730> ragged<00:02:54.269> bird<00:02:54.540> I

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
clean edge instead of a ragged bird I

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.750 
clean edge instead of a ragged bird I
really<00:02:57.630> can't<00:02:58.500> say<00:02:58.590> enough<00:02:58.890> about<00:02:59.069> this<00:02:59.519> so

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
really can't say enough about this so

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.870 
really can't say enough about this so
far<00:02:59.790> I<00:03:00.239> really<00:03:00.660> like<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.140> neck<00:03:01.319> night<00:03:01.880> I'm

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
far I really like the neck night I'm

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.080 
far I really like the neck night I'm
already<00:03:03.120> wearing<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:03.750> it's<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:05.100> knife<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:06.030> I

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
already wearing it it's a knife that I

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.259 
already wearing it it's a knife that I
definitely<00:03:06.720> would<00:03:06.959> wear<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.850> keep<00:03:08.850> with<00:03:09.060> me

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
definitely would wear and keep with me

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.199 
definitely would wear and keep with me
it's<00:03:10.079> light<00:03:10.440> it's<00:03:10.799> not<00:03:10.950> too<00:03:11.130> heavy<00:03:11.310> it's<00:03:12.060> got<00:03:12.180> a

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
it's light it's not too heavy it's got a

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.809 
it's light it's not too heavy it's got a
nice<00:03:12.420> wrap<00:03:12.750> on<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.049> D<00:03:13.319> that<00:03:13.680> Dirk<00:03:14.310> did<00:03:14.579> and

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
nice wrap on the D that Dirk did and

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.940 
nice wrap on the D that Dirk did and
just<00:03:14.930> all<00:03:15.930> around<00:03:16.100> a<00:03:17.100> nice<00:03:17.790> knife<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:19.440> I'd

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
just all around a nice knife and so I'd

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.150 
just all around a nice knife and so I'd
hybrid<00:03:20.370> highly<00:03:20.700> recommend<00:03:21.180> this<00:03:21.389> little<00:03:22.230> neck

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
hybrid highly recommend this little neck

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.580 
hybrid highly recommend this little neck
knife<00:03:23.370> if<00:03:23.489> he<00:03:23.639> makes<00:03:23.840> different<00:03:24.840> knives<00:03:25.170> he's

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
knife if he makes different knives he's

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.059 
knife if he makes different knives he's
really<00:03:26.750> noted<00:03:27.750> for<00:03:27.930> his<00:03:28.109> double<00:03:28.680> edge<00:03:28.799> knives

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
really noted for his double edge knives

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.750 
really noted for his double edge knives
as<00:03:29.310> well<00:03:29.549> so<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.930> don't<00:03:31.920> like<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.250> double<00:03:32.639> edge

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
as well so I don't like a double edge

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.490 
as well so I don't like a double edge
because<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.510> probably<00:03:33.630> cut<00:03:33.900> myself<00:03:34.049> too<00:03:34.470> much

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
because it probably cut myself too much

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.170 
because it probably cut myself too much
I<00:03:34.950> sure<00:03:35.670> like<00:03:35.850> this<00:03:36.120> knife<00:03:36.359> thank<00:03:37.019> you
