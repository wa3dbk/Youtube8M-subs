00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.330 
the squad cast and not even just beards
I<00:00:36.390> mean<00:00:36.809> they<00:00:37.140> could<00:00:37.320> even<00:00:37.469> add<00:00:37.829> there's<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
I mean they could even add there's a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.310 
I mean they could even add there's a
bunch<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.730> masks<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.390> stuff<00:00:39.690> that's<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
bunch of masks and stuff that's in the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.410 
bunch of masks and stuff that's in the
single<00:00:40.649> player<00:00:40.739> that's<00:00:41.340> not<00:00:41.550> an<00:00:41.730> online<00:00:42.120> and

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
single player that's not an online and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.180 
single player that's not an online and
it's<00:00:43.110> probably<00:00:43.290> gonna<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.559> coming<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.100> know

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
it's probably gonna be coming you know

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.260 
it's probably gonna be coming you know
they<00:00:44.370> don't<00:00:44.460> want<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.700> release<00:00:44.879> everything

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
they don't want to release everything

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.840 
they don't want to release everything
right<00:00:45.960> now<00:00:46.140> because<00:00:46.530> if<00:00:46.739> they<00:00:47.250> do<00:00:47.309> then<00:00:47.820> they

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
right now because if they do then they

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.760 
right now because if they do then they
probably<00:00:48.239> won't<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.629> much<00:00:48.960> DLC<00:00:49.530> content

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
probably won't have much DLC content

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.000 
probably won't have much DLC content
further<00:00:50.760> down<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> line<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.350> would

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
further down the line but I would

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.979 
further down the line but I would
definitely<00:00:53.190> see<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.730> because<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.750> more

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
definitely see that because the more

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.810 
definitely see that because the more
customization<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.070> better<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.340> mean<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.670> can

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
customization the better I mean you can

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.819 
customization the better I mean you can
never<00:00:57.000> go<00:00:57.120> wrong<00:00:57.300> with<00:00:57.600> adding<00:00:58.020> more

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
never go wrong with adding more

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.889 
never go wrong with adding more
customizable<00:00:59.579> options<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.510> others<00:01:00.750> your

something from single player in online

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.929 
something from single player in online
but<00:01:10.680> moving<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.310> next<00:01:11.520> question<00:01:11.610> we

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
but moving on to the next question we

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.570 
but moving on to the next question we
have<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> pc<00:01:12.720> gamer<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.170> he<00:01:13.380> says<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.490> you

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
then do some more stuff because they

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.460 
then do some more stuff because they
clearly<00:02:15.330> could<00:02:15.540> do<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:15.720> with<00:02:15.840> snow<00:02:16.050> they<00:02:16.320> can

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
clearly could do it with snow they can

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.960 
clearly could do it with snow they can
probably<00:02:16.770> deal<00:02:16.860> with<00:02:16.890> other<00:02:17.160> elements<00:02:17.430> or

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
probably deal with other elements or

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.510 
probably deal with other elements or
other<00:02:18.300> things<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:20.130> would<00:02:20.250> be<00:02:20.280> awesome

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
other things and that would be awesome

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
that they add where you can make

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.150

missions<00:02:27.900> not<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.320> races<00:02:28.680> or<00:02:28.770> death<00:02:28.920> matches

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
missions not like races or death matches

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.790 
missions not like races or death matches
you<00:02:29.820> mean<00:02:29.970> like<00:02:30.150> missions<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.620> can

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
you mean like missions that you can

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.590 
you mean like missions that you can
still<00:02:32.010> cook<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.490> a<00:02:32.550> bunch<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.880> by<00:02:33.060> try<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.360> kill

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
still cook and a bunch of by try to kill

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.480 
still cook and a bunch of by try to kill
you<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.990> you<00:02:34.380> must<00:02:34.560> deliver<00:02:34.800> them<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.160> spot

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
you and you must deliver them to a spot

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.980 
you and you must deliver them to a spot
I<00:02:35.640> think<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:35.940> would<00:02:36.030> be<00:02:36.120> cool<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.840> make

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
I think that would be cool to make

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.980 
I think that would be cool to make
missions<00:02:37.410> well<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.160> do<00:02:38.370> too<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:38.970> we've<00:02:39.720> talked

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
missions well I do too and we've talked

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.740 
missions well I do too and we've talked
about<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.410> little<00:02:40.650> bit<00:02:40.740> before<00:02:41.420> but<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.570> one

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
about it a little bit before but the one

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.810 
about it a little bit before but the one
problem<00:02:43.140> with<00:02:43.410> missions<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.220> we<00:02:44.340> see<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.670> when

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
problem with missions and we see it when

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.760 
problem with missions and we see it when
they<00:02:44.850> add<00:02:45.030> any<00:02:45.270> type<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.570> creator<00:02:46.050> the

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
they add any type of creator the

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.070 
they add any type of creator the
glitches<00:02:47.070> man<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:48.000> almost<00:02:48.030> seems<00:02:48.510> like<00:02:48.630> if

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
glitches man it almost seems like if

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.720 
glitches man it almost seems like if
they<00:02:49.260> were<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:49.530> release<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.920> mission<00:02:50.400> crater

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
they were to release a mission crater

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.580 
they were to release a mission crater
there<00:02:51.270> would<00:02:51.360> be<00:02:51.390> some<00:02:51.720> person<00:02:52.170> who<00:02:52.260> makes<00:02:52.410> a

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
there would be some person who makes a

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.680 
there would be some person who makes a
mission<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.850> go<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.000> get<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.330> coke<00:02:54.510> and

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
mission that you go to get the coke and

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.850 
mission that you go to get the coke and
then<00:02:54.900> as<00:02:55.020> soon<00:02:55.110> as<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.260> get<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.470> coke<00:02:55.650> like

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
then as soon as you get the coke like

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.650 
then as soon as you get the coke like

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
would love to see it and I think

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.650 
would love to see it and I think
somebody<00:03:05.790> actually<00:03:05.940> found<00:03:06.300> in<00:03:06.540> the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
somebody actually found in the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.300 
somebody actually found in the
innovative<00:03:07.290> files<00:03:07.650> or<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:07.920> don't<00:03:08.190> know

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
innovative files or I don't know

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.830 
innovative files or I don't know
somewhere<00:03:08.610> in<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.790> code<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.300> they<00:03:09.750> were

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
somewhere in the code and they were

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.300 
somewhere in the code and they were
messing<00:03:10.140> around<00:03:10.200> with<00:03:10.410> it<00:03:10.560> they<00:03:10.680> can<00:03:11.010> actually

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
messing around with it they can actually

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.790 
messing around with it they can actually
get<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.460> mission<00:03:11.850> crater<00:03:12.090> but<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:13.290> know<00:03:13.440> it

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
get a mission crater but you know it

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.340 
get a mission crater but you know it
from<00:03:14.580> what<00:03:14.820> we've<00:03:14.970> seen<00:03:15.000> with<00:03:15.270> GTA<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:15.990> far<00:03:16.230> the

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
from what we've seen with GTA so far the

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.170 
from what we've seen with GTA so far the
community<00:03:16.800> I<00:03:17.010> don't<00:03:17.430> think<00:03:17.490> rockstar<00:03:18.060> is

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
community I don't think rockstar is

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.660 
community I don't think rockstar is
ready<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.750> release<00:03:19.080> that<00:03:19.110> so<00:03:20.070> unfortunately

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
ready to release that so unfortunately

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.100 
ready to release that so unfortunately
we're<00:03:20.790> probably<00:03:20.970> never<00:03:21.390> going<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:21.960> get<00:03:22.080> that

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
we're probably never going to get that

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.470 
we're probably never going to get that
anytime<00:03:22.680> soon<00:03:23.220> but<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.790> next<00:03:24.000> question<00:03:24.330> from

completed this heist with no cops on me
so<00:03:56.430> i<00:03:56.790> don't<00:03:57.209> think<00:03:57.420> that's<00:03:57.540> going<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.810> happen

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
so i don't think that's going to happen

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.530 
so i don't think that's going to happen
but<00:03:58.380> would<00:03:58.709> be<00:03:58.740> really<00:03:58.980> cool<00:03:59.250> is<00:03:59.550> if<00:04:00.180> they

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
but would be really cool is if they

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.350 
but would be really cool is if they
added<00:04:00.959> sort<00:04:01.170> of<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.350> stealth<00:04:01.800> mode<00:04:02.250> where<00:04:02.970> say

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
added sort of a stealth mode where say

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.210 
added sort of a stealth mode where say
like<00:04:03.840> in<00:04:04.020> single-player<00:04:04.470> you<00:04:04.860> go<00:04:05.040> the

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
like in single-player you go the

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.790 
like in single-player you go the
stealthy<00:04:05.640> way<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:06.170> you<00:04:07.170> kind<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.530> have<00:04:07.770> that

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
stealthy way and you kind of have that

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.280 
stealthy way and you kind of have that
cops<00:04:08.400> turn<00:04:08.640> a<00:04:08.670> blind<00:04:08.850> eye<00:04:09.150> built-in<00:04:09.660> so<00:04:10.230> to

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
cops turn a blind eye built-in so to

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.750

robbers they have guns let's shoot them
where<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:18.780> take<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.080> stealthy<00:04:19.440> approach

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
where you take the stealthy approach

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.039 
where you take the stealthy approach
they<00:04:20.280> won't<00:04:20.520> shoot<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:21.000> until<00:04:21.359> obviously<00:04:21.900> you

they won't shoot you until obviously you

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.719 
they won't shoot you until obviously you
break<00:04:22.560> into<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:23.010> bank<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.400> you<00:04:23.490> start

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
break into the bank and you start

break into the bank and you start
stealing<00:04:23.910> money<00:04:24.380> that<00:04:25.380> could<00:04:25.530> definitely<00:04:25.770> I

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
stealing money that could definitely I

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.930

really

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.940 
really
hope<00:04:27.210> that<00:04:27.540> they<00:04:28.050> have<00:04:28.260> a<00:04:28.290> feature<00:04:28.530> when<00:04:28.860> we

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
hope that they have a feature when we

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.220 
hope that they have a feature when we
play<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.340> heist<00:04:29.520> that<00:04:29.940> allows<00:04:30.540> us<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:30.960> do<00:04:31.080> that

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
play the heist that allows us to do that

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.350 
play the heist that allows us to do that
but<00:04:31.890> as<00:04:32.130> for<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.430> feature<00:04:32.610> yeah<00:04:32.940> man<00:04:33.180> I<00:04:33.300> don't

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
but as for the feature yeah man I don't

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.570 
but as for the feature yeah man I don't
think<00:04:33.690> they<00:04:34.230> will<00:04:34.440> ever<00:04:34.560> allow<00:04:35.040> us<00:04:35.310> to<00:04:35.430> that

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
think they will ever allow us to that

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.970 
think they will ever allow us to that
because<00:04:35.760> it<00:04:36.150> is<00:04:36.330> kind<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:36.930> cheap<00:04:37.230> if<00:04:37.440> you<00:04:37.800> think

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
because it is kind of cheap if you think

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.040 
because it is kind of cheap if you think
about<00:04:38.130> it<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:39.300> then<00:04:39.540> finally<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.020> last
