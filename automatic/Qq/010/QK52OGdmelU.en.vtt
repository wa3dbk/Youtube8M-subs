number<00:01:49.950> one<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.240> much<00:01:51.389> smaller<00:01:51.600> and

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
number one is it's a much smaller and

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.989 
number one is it's a much smaller and
modern<00:01:52.350> component<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.249> lightened<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.819> the

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:53.999 
modern component it lightened up the

seventy pounds we were able to drop the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.260 
seventy pounds we were able to drop the
motor<00:01:57.659> down<00:01:57.990> about<00:01:58.590> six<00:01:58.979> inches<00:01:59.429> move<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.090> back

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
motor down about six inches move it back

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.059 
motor down about six inches move it back
four<00:02:00.630> inches<00:02:00.959> to<00:02:01.170> give<00:02:01.319> ourselves<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.799> really

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
four inches to give ourselves a really

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.980 
four inches to give ourselves a really
good<00:02:02.219> weight<00:02:02.399> distribution<00:02:02.659> right<00:02:03.659> now<00:02:03.810> we've

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
good weight distribution right now we've

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.050 
good weight distribution right now we've
got<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.319> car<00:02:04.529> weight<00:02:04.770> distribution<00:02:05.429> at<00:02:05.549> 52

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
got the car weight distribution at 52

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.999 
got the car weight distribution at 52
front<00:02:06.359> 48<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:06.990> back<00:02:07.139> so<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.529> really<00:02:07.560> makes

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
front 48 and back so that really makes

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.309 
front 48 and back so that really makes
it<00:02:08.160> handle<00:02:08.520> very<00:02:08.729> very<00:02:08.940> well<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.509> addition<00:02:10.140> to

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
it handle very very well in addition to

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.510 
it handle very very well in addition to
that<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.800> motor<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.100> just<00:02:11.160> much<00:02:11.490> more

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
that the motor is just much more

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.509 
that the motor is just much more
efficient<00:02:12.180> we<00:02:12.629> did<00:02:12.780> an<00:02:12.900> ls7<00:02:13.439> cam<00:02:13.830> swap<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.370> give

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
efficient we did an ls7 cam swap to give

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.460 
efficient we did an ls7 cam swap to give
it<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.700> little<00:02:14.849> bit<00:02:15.030> more<00:02:15.209> horsepower<00:02:15.689> so<00:02:16.290> right

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
it a little bit more horsepower so right

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.260 
it a little bit more horsepower so right
now<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:16.799> motor<00:02:17.010> puts<00:02:17.310> out<00:02:17.430> 505

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
now this motor puts out 505

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.050 
now this motor puts out 505
