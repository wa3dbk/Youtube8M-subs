00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
this was somewhere around $69 that's how

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.080 
this was somewhere around $69 that's how
much<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.350> paid<00:02:04.380> from<00:02:04.799> future<00:02:05.130> shop<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
much I paid from future shop but in the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.150 
much I paid from future shop but in the
US<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.630> guys<00:02:06.750> probably<00:02:06.960> get<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.380> for<00:02:07.409> much

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
US you guys probably get it for much

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.260 
US you guys probably get it for much
less<00:02:08.989> somewhere<00:02:09.989> around<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.229> 40<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.590> 50<00:02:10.890> range

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270
