00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:05.649
RISK &amp; RISKY

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:11.305
Most people follow the mass 

00:00:11.406 --> 00:00:15.519
rather than trust on own wisdom,
let’see why.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.640
Here we are, is it ok here? 
Well, we’re here to understand

00:00:27.702 --> 00:00:30.102
 people’s opinion about investments.

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:32.162
Here’s a man passing. 

00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:35.562
Excuse me, do you invest your own savings?

00:00:34.842 --> 00:00:37.342
 No... it’s too risky, in this period then. . . 

00:00:37.416 --> 00:00:41.716
Investing is not risky, it’s just
 the lack of 

00:00:41.738 --> 00:00:44.738
economic basics and financial 
intelligence 

00:00:44.808 --> 00:00:50.508
that makes people think : 
"It’s too risky".

00:00:51.654 --> 00:00:52.830
Ok, good

00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:54.874
What you know is your greatest richness

00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:58.611
What you do without 
knowing is your worst risk.

00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:01.111
There will always be a risk, 
so you’d better learn how 

00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:04.725
to manage rather than keep out of it.
Think  like this: when one euro comes

00:01:05.725 --> 00:01:08.125
into your activities, 
it has to work for you.

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:11.636
The main detail is that 
money can work

00:01:12.416 --> 00:01:15.416
 twenty four hours a day,
seven days a week, 

00:01:16.416 --> 00:01:18.216
for generations.

00:01:18.254 --> 00:01:21.254
ou can afford luxuries 
only after consolidating

00:01:21.708 --> 00:01:23.293
 your financial position.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:37.043
FINANCIAL  I.Q. 

00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:40.443
Financial  I.Q. grows 

00:01:41.443 --> 00:01:43.843
by knowing four specific areas:

00:01:44.843 --> 00:01:46.403
1, Accounting!

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.960
To be familiar with accounting 
is basic 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.450
if you want to build an empire.

00:01:52.608 --> 00:01:54.168
2, Investment! 

00:01:55.168 --> 00:01:57.068
The science of money producing money.

00:01:58.325 --> 00:01:59.525
3, Market! 

00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:03.525
To understand 
The science of supply and demand

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.085
4, Law!

00:02:11.783 --> 00:02:14.183
 Every person who knows about 
 fiscal benefits 

00:02:14.713 --> 00:02:17.713
due to companies, 
can become rich much earlier

00:02:17.813 --> 00:02:20.613
than a small shop owner or an employee.

00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:24.683
Employees work, earn, 
pay taxes 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.209
and live with what is left. 
A company indeed makes profit,

00:02:28.395 --> 00:02:31.795
spends all that is possible and
it is taxed on that nothing left.

00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:34.295
A company indeed makes profit, spends all that is possible and it is taxed on that nothing left.

00:02:34.617 --> 00:02:36.817
In certain standards it is 
important to defend against legal debates.

00:02:36.867 --> 00:02:40.167
Rich are never owner of anything.
Have you ever noticed? 

00:02:43.585 --> 00:02:44.526
Will you pay on the spot?
