but<00:00:23.710> they<00:00:24.070> were<00:00:24.699> playing<00:00:25.029> this<00:00:25.359> groove<00:00:25.720> it<00:00:26.080> was

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
but they were playing this groove it was

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.739 
but they were playing this groove it was
a<00:00:26.230> programmed<00:00:27.039> groove<00:00:27.490> but<00:00:28.480> what<00:00:28.630> was

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:28.749 
a programmed groove but what was

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:30.960 
a programmed groove but what was
interesting<00:00:28.779> is<00:00:29.439> it<00:00:29.650> was<00:00:29.769> in<00:00:29.949> it<00:00:30.189> was<00:00:30.339> in<00:00:30.519> seven

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
interesting is it was in it was in seven

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.970 
interesting is it was in it was in seven
which<00:00:31.390> I<00:00:31.539> don't<00:00:31.660> hear<00:00:32.020> that<00:00:32.050> much<00:00:32.200> electronica

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
which I don't hear that much electronica

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.920 
which I don't hear that much electronica
and<00:00:33.010> seven<00:00:33.610> and<00:00:33.810> the<00:00:34.810> groove<00:00:35.020> itself<00:00:36.899> had<00:00:37.899> a

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
and seven and the groove itself had a

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.229 
and seven and the groove itself had a
kind<00:00:38.289> of<00:00:38.410> over<00:00:38.739> the<00:00:38.829> bar<00:00:39.100> line<00:00:39.370> accent<00:00:40.000> feel

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
kind of over the bar line accent feel

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.760 
kind of over the bar line accent feel
and<00:00:40.480> what<00:00:40.660> I<00:00:40.690> mean<00:00:40.870> by<00:00:40.930> that<00:00:41.079> is<00:00:41.230> I<00:00:41.469> was<00:00:41.590> I

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
and what I mean by that is I was I

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.160 
and what I mean by that is I was I
considered<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.520> groove<00:00:42.699> to<00:00:42.820> be<00:00:42.910> in<00:00:43.000> 78<00:00:43.510> but

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
considered the groove to be in 78 but

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.959 
considered the groove to be in 78 but
the<00:00:44.350> accent<00:00:44.920> was<00:00:45.010> being<00:00:45.430> played<00:00:45.640> on<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:45.820> high

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
the accent was being played on the high

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.700 
the accent was being played on the high
hat<00:00:46.000> on<00:00:46.420> the<00:00:46.719> quarter<00:00:47.020> note<00:00:47.170> so<00:00:47.350> it'd<00:00:47.440> be<00:00:47.500> like

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
hat on the quarter note so it'd be like

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.670 
hat on the quarter note so it'd be like
this<00:00:47.949> if<00:00:48.160> you<00:00:48.699> counted<00:00:49.149> it<00:00:49.300> and<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:50.530> know<00:00:50.559> I'm

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
this if you counted it and you know I'm

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.569 
this if you counted it and you know I'm
going<00:00:50.769> to<00:00:50.859> do<00:00:50.949> it<00:00:51.039> much<00:00:51.160> slower<00:00:51.370> than<00:00:51.519> the

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
going to do it much slower than the

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.840 
going to do it much slower than the
actual<00:00:51.760> groove<00:00:52.120> it<00:00:52.629> was<00:00:52.780> 1<00:00:53.559> 2<00:00:54.010> 3<00:00:54.340> 4<00:00:54.789> 5<00:00:55.600> 6<00:00:55.629> 7<00:00:56.500> 1<00:00:56.800> 2<00:00:57.100> 3

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090

a<00:01:46.270> couple<00:01:46.600> different<00:01:46.870> speeds<00:01:47.140> I've

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
a couple different speeds I've

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.410 
a couple different speeds I've
transcribed<00:01:47.890> it<00:01:48.190> for<00:01:48.400> you<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:48.700> again<00:01:49.270> it's

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
transcribed it for you and again it's

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.520 
transcribed it for you and again it's
just<00:01:49.540> some<00:01:49.720> group<00:01:49.900> that<00:01:50.080> I<00:01:50.110> heard<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:50.500> I

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
just some group that I heard and I

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.380 
just some group that I heard and I
thought<00:01:50.710> it<00:01:50.860> would<00:01:50.950> be<00:01:51.070> kind<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.340> cool<00:01:51.730> to<00:01:52.120> do<00:01:52.360> a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
thought it would be kind of cool to do a

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.360 
thought it would be kind of cool to do a
little<00:01:52.660> lesson<00:01:52.840> on<00:01:53.050> it<00:01:53.200> I<00:01:53.620> thought<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.250> was<00:01:54.310> a

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
little lesson on it I thought it was a

little lesson on it I thought it was a
pretty<00:01:54.520> cool<00:01:54.760> groove<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:56.350> I<00:01:56.470> hope<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:56.710> enjoy

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
pretty cool groove and I hope you enjoy

pretty cool groove and I hope you enjoy
it<00:01:56.980> too<00:01:57.250> so<00:01:57.760> take<00:01:57.970> your<00:01:58.000> time<00:01:58.150> with<00:01:58.450> it

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
it too so take your time with it

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.660 
it too so take your time with it
practice<00:01:58.900> it<00:01:58.960> really<00:01:59.200> slow<00:01:59.530> because<00:02:00.160> the<00:02:00.490> key

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
practice it really slow because the key

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.640 
practice it really slow because the key
to<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:00.970> is<00:02:01.090> keeping<00:02:01.600> this<00:02:01.900> 3<00:02:02.800> 4<00:02:03.130> 5<00:02:03.550> 6<00:02:03.880> 7<00:02:04.060> 1<00:02:04.450> 2<00:02:04.660> 3<00:02:05.050> 4

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
to it is keeping this 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.940 
to it is keeping this 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4
5<00:02:06.190> 6<00:02:06.220> 7<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:07.390> accented<00:02:08.080> versus<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.590> unaccented

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
5 6 7 the accented versus the unaccented

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.280 
5 6 7 the accented versus the unaccented
notes<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:09.759> that<00:02:10.390> gets<00:02:10.599> a<00:02:10.660> little<00:02:10.780> difficult

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
notes and that gets a little difficult

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.990 
notes and that gets a little difficult
when<00:02:11.349> you<00:02:11.469> start<00:02:11.739> playing<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.189> quite<00:02:12.879> a<00:02:12.909> bit

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
when you start playing it quite a bit

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.300 
when you start playing it quite a bit
quicker<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.170> i'll<00:02:14.620> try<00:02:14.769> to<00:02:14.829> play<00:02:15.069> it<00:02:15.189> up<00:02:15.250> to

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
quicker and i'll try to play it up to

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.180 
quicker and i'll try to play it up to
speed

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
speed

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.950 
speed
from<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.120> original<00:02:17.420> group<00:02:17.630> from<00:02:17.750> what<00:02:17.930> I

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
from to the original group from what I

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.810 
from to the original group from what I
remember<00:02:18.280> hopefully<00:02:19.280> I'll<00:02:19.370> get<00:02:19.490> it<00:02:19.610> close<00:02:19.790> to

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
remember hopefully I'll get it close to

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.810 
remember hopefully I'll get it close to
what<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.270> recall<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:21.260> being<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.430> again<00:02:22.670> I'll

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
what I recall it being so again I'll

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.460 
what I recall it being so again I'll
play<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.240> couple<00:02:23.510> different<00:02:23.570> tempos<00:02:24.140> and

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
play it it a couple different tempos and

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.740 
play it it a couple different tempos and
I<00:02:25.070> hope<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.550> get<00:02:26.000> something<00:02:26.180> on<00:02:26.270> this<00:02:26.390> lesson
