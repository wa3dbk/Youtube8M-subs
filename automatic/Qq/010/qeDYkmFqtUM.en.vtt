00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:07.859
 how to use the search engine wines from 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.200
 In general , we can absolutely search for 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.349
 any file or file fragment 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.570
 but the goal is anything at the top right 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:21.500
 you have a search button you can 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.640
 add here to write what you want and 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.640
 put i want to find a logo 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.550
 and here he starts the search 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.560
 on my computer I know where the file is 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.220
 is located but he sooner or later him on 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:42.520
 him further if you do not remember the full 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:46.420
 file name or not to remember which 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:50.580
 words begins you can only donate 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:54.550
 some part of the fragment he will find it 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:57.309
 even if you don't know don't remember let's say 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.680
 since this file you know 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.970
 approximately where he is you 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:09.299
 You can go to this folder and thus 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:11.830
 he will quickly find your file now he 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.770
 checks and searches for absolutely everything 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.719
 computer 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:24.110
 and he is obliged to find him because I will see 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:24.110
 my logo is on the desktop 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.030
 I would also like to add, you can 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.049
 search for all files 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.159
 that is, even a different format that is 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.130
 if you doubt that you have 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.209
 exists there suppose here here 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.959
 logo it will be formatted 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:53.369
 march ie dock format dock or 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:57.780
 same file dzhipeg that is if you 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.649
 doubt that there is a chance that in such 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.880
 file 2 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:07.049
 and this is possible then you can safely 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.479
 add to file extension 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.629
 write there we put through the dots as 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:18.620
 I have a logo let's see it is not for you 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:21.400
 that is, I will put a dot on its properties 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.400
 g &amp; p 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.430
 Search 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:33.849
 delayed we will simplify the task i will show 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.020
 how to search in that folder suppose 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.960
 by which 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:44.510
 know to go so now it was me 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:46.730
 Immediately found it, that is, you do not know where 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.330
 He knows exactly what is in this folder. 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.700
 and a friend was lying around, he did not immediately see 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.640
 I found if I saw another computer 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.930
 as the search is generally very long because 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.680
 what they say that makes every folder every 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:06.890
 every program skipping well, as you can see 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.990
 search engine is not difficult to use 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.940
 forget if you know the extension 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.690
 file use this 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.690
 that's not all
