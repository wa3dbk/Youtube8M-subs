00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.610
 Let's learn coloring techniques for 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.340
 improve the quality of work 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.520
 hit in the first class 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:26.080
 let's learn color in gradient 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:28.570
 using only one color from the dark to 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.749
 Of course we started putting more 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.180
 weight by its intensity in the hand of this 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.579
 so the color gets stronger and 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.640
 few we let not be more 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.980
 smooth so that the color becomes 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.910
 clearer and consequently 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:49.960
 we managed to give the gradient effect 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.480
 in case of light to dark we go 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.940
 do the reverse 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.609
 we start with the light soft hand 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.179
 creating light and gradual tones 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:05.519
 putting more weight strength and intensity 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.519
 on the hand to create the darker tones 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.840
 Let's try doing 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.830
 the first step is to search for a drawing 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.360
 to send her to color then 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.729
 choose a color 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.729
 let's color and observe
