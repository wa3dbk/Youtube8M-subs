try to find some some bunches than were

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.089 
try to find some some bunches than were
left<00:00:26.790> in<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.090> vines<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:28.110> explain<00:00:28.559> you<00:00:28.680> all<00:00:28.710> are

left in the vines to explain you all are
we<00:00:29.220> make<00:00:29.399> port<00:00:29.809> this<00:00:30.809> pretty<00:00:31.079> simple<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:32.009> have

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
we make port this pretty simple we have

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.580 
we make port this pretty simple we have
three<00:00:32.820> kinds<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.149> port<00:00:33.480> white<00:00:33.899> port<00:00:34.290> which<00:00:34.559> is

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
three kinds of port white port which is

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.400 
three kinds of port white port which is
made<00:00:34.859> with<00:00:34.980> white<00:00:35.160> grapes<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.960> rosy<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:36.989> red

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
made with white grapes and rosy and red

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.349 
made with white grapes and rosy and red
port<00:00:37.739> which<00:00:37.949> is<00:00:38.070> made<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.309> red<00:00:38.850> grapes<00:00:39.120> like

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:39.359 
port which is made with red grapes like

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.579 
port which is made with red grapes like
this<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:41.160> red<00:00:41.370> port<00:00:41.750> can<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:42.839> divided<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.289> two

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
this the red port can be divided in two

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.910 
this the red port can be divided in two
types<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.219> ruby<00:00:45.059> port<00:00:45.300> which<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.079> bottle<00:00:46.679> age

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
types in ruby port which is bottle age

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.709 
types in ruby port which is bottle age
and<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.940> tawny<00:00:48.149> port<00:00:48.239> which<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.019> barrel<00:00:49.739> aged

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
and the tawny port which is barrel aged

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.419 
and the tawny port which is barrel aged
so<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:52.050> difference<00:00:52.350> between<00:00:52.410> port<00:00:52.920> wine<00:00:53.160> and

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
so the difference between port wine and

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:55.660 
so the difference between port wine and
the<00:00:53.609> regular<00:00:53.940> wine<00:00:54.179> is<00:00:54.929> in<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.140> fermentation

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
the regular wine is in the fermentation

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.569 
the regular wine is in the fermentation
for<00:00:56.670> port<00:00:56.999> we<00:00:57.329> stop<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.749> fermentation<00:00:58.579> when

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
for port we stop the fermentation when

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.959 
for port we stop the fermentation when
it<00:00:59.670> has<00:00:59.850> run<00:01:00.390> at<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> mill<00:01:00.839> so<00:01:01.829> we<00:01:02.609> had<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> kind

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
it has run at the mill so we had a kind

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.670 
it has run at the mill so we had a kind
of<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.120> brandy<00:01:03.539> which<00:01:03.929> is<00:01:04.050> it<00:01:04.199> which<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.559> have

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
of a brandy which is it which we have

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.539 
of a brandy which is it which we have
here<00:01:05.060> 77%<00:01:06.060> alcohol<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.990> adding<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.070> brandy

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
here 77% alcohol and adding this brandy

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.600 
here 77% alcohol and adding this brandy
the<00:01:09.060> East<00:01:09.750> will<00:01:10.200> die<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.159> will<00:01:11.369> try<00:01:11.520> to

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the East will die so I will try to

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.090 
the East will die so I will try to
explain<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.000> little<00:01:12.180> bit<00:01:12.329> how<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.780> make<00:01:12.930> it

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.200 

in<00:01:17.100> general<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.939> fermentation<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.719> last<00:01:19.560> for

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
in general the fermentation can last for

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.310 
in general the fermentation can last for
three<00:01:21.210> four<00:01:21.540> days<00:01:21.570> depending<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
three four days depending on the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.440 
three four days depending on the
temperatures<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.990> we<00:01:25.820> we<00:01:26.820> ferment<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
temperatures we have we we ferment the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.600 
temperatures we have we we ferment the
the<00:01:28.110> Joyce<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.530> contact<00:01:28.920> with<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.100> skin<00:01:29.340> to

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the Joyce in contact with the skin to

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.370 
the Joyce in contact with the skin to
get<00:01:29.729> more<00:01:29.969> structure<00:01:31.280> so<00:01:32.450> we<00:01:33.450> almost<00:01:33.930> always

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
get more structure so we almost always

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.160 
get more structure so we almost always
we<00:01:34.920> take<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.640> berries<00:01:35.939> out<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.479> out<00:01:37.110> of

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
we take the berries out of the out of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.850 
we take the berries out of the out of
the<00:01:37.640> bunch<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.360> disclaim<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:40.560> today

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
the bunch so we disclaim it but today

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.069 
the bunch so we disclaim it but today
it's<00:01:41.070> not<00:01:41.219> not<00:01:41.759> very<00:01:42.149> easy<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.509> do<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:42.930> let's

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
it's not not very easy to do it so let's

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.130 
it's not not very easy to do it so let's
put<00:01:43.289> all<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.560> bunch<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.009> grapes<00:01:44.369> here<00:01:44.990> then<00:01:45.990> it

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
put all the bunch of grapes here then it

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.730 
put all the bunch of grapes here then it
will<00:01:46.229> crush<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:48.200> let's<00:01:49.200> try<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.439> crush<00:01:49.680> it

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
will crush it so let's try to crush it

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.270 
will crush it so let's try to crush it
not<00:01:50.189> easy<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.320> was<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.859> is<00:01:52.979> what<00:01:53.130> our

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
not easy so this was this is what our

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.700 
not easy so this was this is what our
crushing<00:01:54.210> machine<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:55.170> crushed<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
crushing machine that just crushed the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.120 
crushing machine that just crushed the
berry<00:01:56.539> we<00:01:57.539> crush<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.289> can<00:01:58.619> see<00:01:58.770> then<00:01:58.920> we

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
berry we crush it you can see then we

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.429 
berry we crush it you can see then we
already<00:01:59.399> have<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> little<00:01:59.640> bit<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.880> color

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
already have a little bit of color

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.210 
already have a little bit of color
pretty<00:02:01.439> light<00:02:01.649> yet

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
pretty light yet

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.950 
pretty light yet
at<00:02:04.220> scrunching<00:02:05.030> this<00:02:07.330> actually<00:02:08.330> then<00:02:08.479> the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
at scrunching this actually then the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.779 
at scrunching this actually then the
juice<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.259> pretty<00:02:09.530> cold<00:02:09.740> today<00:02:10.280> this<00:02:10.580> morning

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
juice is pretty cold today this morning

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.990 
juice is pretty cold today this morning
we<00:02:11.540> had<00:02:11.660> zero<00:02:12.200> degrees<00:02:12.620> I<00:02:12.890> guess<00:02:13.790> now<00:02:13.970> it's

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
we had zero degrees I guess now it's

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.960 
we had zero degrees I guess now it's
around<00:02:14.330> four<00:02:14.600> or<00:02:14.630> five<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:16.640> daughter<00:02:16.850> is

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
around four or five the daughter is

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.870 
around four or five the daughter is
getting<00:02:17.410> schooled<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.650> called<00:02:19.090> November<00:02:20.530> and

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
getting schooled and called November and

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.120 
getting schooled and called November and
so<00:02:22.880> I'm<00:02:23.870> pressing<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.410> berries<00:02:26.890> we<00:02:27.890> already

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
so I'm pressing the berries we already

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.690 
so I'm pressing the berries we already
have<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.280> little<00:02:28.490> bit<00:02:28.580> of<00:02:28.640> juice<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:32.590> Kim's<00:02:33.700> in

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
have a little bit of juice so Kim's in

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.490 
have a little bit of juice so Kim's in
the<00:02:34.850> fermentation<00:02:35.180> tank<00:02:38.230> absolute<00:02:39.230> moral

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
the fermentation tank absolute moral

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:48.640 
the fermentation tank absolute moral
keen<00:02:42.700> more<00:02:43.700> skin<00:02:44.560> good<00:02:46.030> so<00:02:47.030> every<00:02:47.959> hour<00:02:47.989> over

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
keen more skin good so every hour over

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.400 
keen more skin good so every hour over
two<00:02:48.800> hours<00:02:48.950> with<00:02:49.459> we<00:02:49.760> we<00:02:50.390> pump<00:02:50.630> it<00:02:50.750> over<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:51.380> we

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
two hours with we we pump it over so we

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.740 
two hours with we we pump it over so we
take<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.770> juice<00:02:51.950> from<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.640> bottom<00:02:52.970> we<00:02:53.360> put<00:02:53.630> in

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
take the juice from the bottom we put in

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.430 
take the juice from the bottom we put in
the<00:02:53.870> top<00:02:54.080> just<00:02:54.739> keep<00:02:54.890> moving<00:02:55.220> it<00:02:55.900> this<00:02:56.900> is<00:02:57.080> to

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
the top just keep moving it this is to

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.900 
the top just keep moving it this is to
help<00:02:58.250> us<00:02:58.459> to<00:02:58.489> mix<00:02:59.000> them<00:02:59.739> demamp<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:00.980> also<00:03:01.580> for

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
help us to mix them demamp and also for

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.010 
help us to mix them demamp and also for
the<00:03:02.030> east<00:03:02.239> to<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:03.110> go<00:03:03.380> through<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:05.020> similar

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
the east to to go through a similar

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.259 
the east to to go through a similar
fermentation<00:03:06.860> in<00:03:06.980> all<00:03:07.340> around<00:03:07.670> all<00:03:07.910> over<00:03:08.000> the

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
fermentation in all around all over the

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.340 
fermentation in all around all over the
tank<00:03:09.640> so<00:03:10.640> after<00:03:11.090> three<00:03:11.480> four<00:03:11.780> or<00:03:11.870> five<00:03:11.900> hours

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
tank so after three four or five hours

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.380 
tank so after three four or five hours
they<00:03:12.620> eat<00:03:13.070> will<00:03:13.489> start<00:03:13.790> eating<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.209> sugar

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
they eat will start eating the sugar

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.270 
they eat will start eating the sugar
they<00:03:15.140> will<00:03:15.320> multiply<00:03:16.930> theirselves<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.280> will

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
they will multiply theirselves and will

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.509 
they will multiply theirselves and will
start<00:03:20.080> increasing<00:03:21.080> slowly<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:22.100> alcohol

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
start increasing slowly the alcohol

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.340 
start increasing slowly the alcohol
content<00:03:22.730> in<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.150> mass<00:03:23.330> and<00:03:23.540> reducing<00:03:24.260> the

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
content in the mass and reducing the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.789 
content in the mass and reducing the
sugar<00:03:24.620> level<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.180> when<00:03:26.180> you<00:03:26.299> get<00:03:26.510> around<00:03:26.799> six

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
sugar level and when you get around six

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
the mask we do something like this we

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.949 
the mask we do something like this we
have<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:34.970> brand<00:03:35.209> in<00:03:35.330> seventy<00:03:35.630> seven<00:03:35.840> percent

alcohol pretty strong we had around 20
percent<00:03:41.380> we<00:03:42.380> put<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:42.680> in<00:03:43.209> give<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:44.330> round<00:03:44.480> 24<00:03:44.840> a

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
percent we put it in give the round 24 a

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.030 
percent we put it in give the round 24 a
little<00:03:45.080> bit<00:03:45.170> more<00:03:45.910> we<00:03:46.910> want<00:03:47.120> from<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.959> east<00:03:48.769> to

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
little bit more we want from the east to

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.060 
little bit more we want from the east to
stop<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:49.870> now<00:03:50.870> we<00:03:50.930> have<00:03:51.320> around<00:03:51.530> 20<00:03:51.950> percent

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
stop and now we have around 20 percent

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.690 
stop and now we have around 20 percent
alcohol<00:03:52.489> in<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.030> must<00:03:53.239> and<00:03:54.160> with<00:03:55.160> 20<00:03:55.489> percent

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.560 
alcohol in the must and with 20 percent
alcohol<00:03:56.030> is<00:03:56.720> cannot<00:03:57.680> survive<00:03:58.340> they<00:03:59.269> stop

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
alcohol is cannot survive they stop

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.740 
alcohol is cannot survive they stop
eating<00:03:59.810> the<00:04:00.410> sugar<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:01.209> all<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.329> sugar<00:04:02.630> and

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
eating the sugar and all the sugar and

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.530 
eating the sugar and all the sugar and
is<00:04:02.870> still<00:04:03.079> left<00:04:03.260> in<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.709> mask<00:04:04.030> will<00:04:05.030> continue

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
is still left in the mask will continue

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.060 
is still left in the mask will continue
and<00:04:05.720> will<00:04:05.930> agent<00:04:06.320> with<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.620> wine

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
and will agent with the wine

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.670 
and will agent with the wine
so<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.390> fermentation<00:04:08.900> is<00:04:09.019> right<00:04:09.260> now<00:04:09.410> stop

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
so the fermentation is right now stop

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.930 
so the fermentation is right now stop
because<00:04:10.040> of<00:04:10.160> the<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.640> alcohol<00:04:11.150> and

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
because of the the alcohol and

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.270 
because of the the alcohol and
then<00:04:12.060> we<00:04:12.510> decant<00:04:12.870> this<00:04:13.050> we<00:04:13.710> take<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.100> juice

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
then we decant this we take the juice

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.699 
then we decant this we take the juice
out<00:04:14.550> of<00:04:14.580> course<00:04:15.030> we<00:04:15.720> put<00:04:15.930> in<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.200> barrels<00:04:16.560> and

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
out of course we put in the barrels and

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.630 
out of course we put in the barrels and
we<00:04:16.739> we<00:04:17.549> will<00:04:17.700> age<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:18.030> for<00:04:18.380> five<00:04:19.380> years<00:04:19.709> or<00:04:19.920> 50

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
we we will age it for five years or 50

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.640 
we we will age it for five years or 50
years<00:04:20.820> depends<00:04:21.239> on<00:04:21.330> what<00:04:21.959> what<00:04:22.230> you<00:04:22.350> want<00:04:22.530> to

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
years depends on what what you want to

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.390 
years depends on what what you want to
do<00:04:22.740> is<00:04:22.860> wine<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:24.060> this<00:04:24.480> is<00:04:24.570> pretty<00:04:24.750> simple<00:04:24.990> and

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
do is wine so this is pretty simple and

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.700 
do is wine so this is pretty simple and
the<00:04:26.400> big<00:04:26.580> difference<00:04:26.760> is<00:04:27.210> in<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.200> the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
the big difference is in the the

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.010 
the big difference is in the the
sweetness<00:04:29.100> of<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.310> wine<00:04:29.580> port<00:04:30.420> is<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:30.720> sweet

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
sweetness of the wine port is a sweet

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.620 
sweetness of the wine port is a sweet
wine<00:04:31.230> so<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.430> keep<00:04:32.610> this<00:04:32.790> sweetness<00:04:33.270> we<00:04:33.540> have

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
wine so to keep this sweetness we have

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.100 
wine so to keep this sweetness we have
to<00:04:33.780> add<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:34.370> brandy<00:04:35.370> around<00:04:35.610> 20%<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.750> stop<00:04:36.960> the

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
to add a brandy around 20% to stop the

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.100 
to add a brandy around 20% to stop the
fermentation<00:04:37.370> we<00:04:38.370> kill<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.730> east<00:04:38.910> and<00:04:39.120> we

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
fermentation we kill the east and we

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
fermentation we kill the east and we
have<00:04:40.200> port<00:04:40.470> wine<00:04:40.620> mate

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
have port wine mate

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.500 
have port wine mate
