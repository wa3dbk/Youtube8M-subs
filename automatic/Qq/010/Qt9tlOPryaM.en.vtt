00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Like I said in twitter summary of 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.540
 deep in life are not men who do not 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:14.280
 they manage to control their impulses play 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:16.460
 the blame on a woman the set and since the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.740
 People, if you have already seen them in the bookstores 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.750
 notre dame de paris de victor hugo and the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.769
 hugo notre dame hunchback 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.300
 is not not obsessed by the cathedral no 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.939
 very 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.669
 it's just a matter of entrance are the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.730
 first English edition of the book 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.399
 translated to the curious name and victor 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.410
 hugo marqueteiro as he was to receive the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.200
 name called more attention and ended 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.539
 leaving and this name I have in this 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.510
 version plus one name notre dame de paris 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.550
 covers much better content in the book 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.610
 because the great protagonist of the story 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.629
 is the cathedral of notre dame live what 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.050
 writing this book in 1828 and in 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.370
 By the time the cathedral had seen better 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.769
 days 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.720
 she had been totally looted and 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.799
 truth during the French revolution to 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.470
 emotion in which the miserable ones are not made 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.740
 and in order to attack with a 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.930
 restoration and with the solution and c demolish 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.810
 demolish a business that has 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.640
 centuries to be built architects 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.229
 who are watching this video with the year in 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.079
 world that I am not I would not have 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.509
 neither does Victor Hugo, nor does he 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.380
 could have written an article for the 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.380
 newspaper but it 's not that writing a novel 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.370
 to highlight the importance of 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.960
 historical and cultural center of the cathedral 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:49.960
 the exam he basically alone saved the 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.470
 cathedral of demolition joinha o victor 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.180
 hugo 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.760
 I think it's funny because the story is 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.130
 pass the middle age is time salvio is 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.800
 here, then, when in the 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.350
 truth is a historical novel but it is a 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.790
 old book about an older time 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.830
 still historical type within historical 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:13.300
 to count the value of the cathedral victor 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:16.630
 hugo presents 100 characters but the month 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.500
 each of them represents a 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.440
 social type of the time and each has a 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.900
 own relationship with the church is not this 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.400
 and is equal to what is correct is the chance 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.800
 in the sun area 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.680
 the game the flyer to the student more 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.640
 possible and our old 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.520
 known because of blind animation 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:45.400
 Emerald a monkey proposed takes the 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:47.650
 unique in medieval armor and 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.440
 multiplication of children 's efficiency 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.190
 the pronamp is horrible it is relatively 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.840
 well meant in the beginning it really 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.780
 believe in what he thinks until he is 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.280
 to listen to what does not justify attitudes 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.550
 that he took in the course of history 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.680
 but it's a character I like the most 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.560
 most admired animation begins 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.040
 a flash with this criticism that 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.140
 women were found guilty 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.690
 when in fact they were victims 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.720
 the idea of ​​typical cuisine a romantic 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.080
 of the romantic period she is very close 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.390
 but we know that the Roman ruins 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.730
 I 'm not the most female characters 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.470
 strong in publishing in general 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.810
 While I would like to be friends with 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.820
 animation emerald to book window 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.430
 It's like a new pinnacle that I 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.370
 I just want to shoot to see if a little bit of 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.440
 judgment in the head and at last the 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.820
 I'll tell something to anyone if 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.250
 to disappoint 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.870
 it appears very little in history but 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.190
 when there is this it gains another meaning 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.920
 I bet that if hugo knew that 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.810
 the audience responds so well to the emptiness of it 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.240
 would have appeared more than he is a 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.430
 incredible incredible incredible character 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.280
 all the excellent characters but 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.310
 almost sent it is something else 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.800
 was emphatically emphasizing that he is a 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.010
 character by what does not mean that 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.500
 he is nice is more like the good 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.049
 wild of the month or almost a year passed 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.420
 20 years inside the cathedral so he did not 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.750
 has social filter he acts by instinct 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.970
 we are also someone who enters that is rare 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.290
 It's going to be nice if that person 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.210
 treats you badly 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.340
 It is at this hour that the missionaries 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.770
 will not appear to speak the 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.990
 horrible crime I do not know that the cure 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.760
 committed the mickey gang but they 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.190
 decided to make a movie about which 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.540
 also condemns what is one of my 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.910
 favorites 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.000
 they analyzed a lot because 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.460
 oliver very heavy but the birth centers 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.710
 so much so that everyone works a 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.919
 when he finally understood the 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.050
 that the flu was singing is in more 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:58.169
 when you noticed that it best appears 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:05.020
 dancing in the middle of the flames igão dhabi 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:07.000
 same email servant as I did there 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.310
 You still have to train, I'm going 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.020
 I finish, I like and only about what 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.330
 condemned the verdade then I will leave the 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.599
 link of the inscription who coming back pro 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.419
 book made victor hugo does a lot of direction 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.520
 looking for sailing victor hugo so 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.490
 as the other romantics liked very much 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.090
 to give their opinion about a lot and 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:31.419
 not always clear in their native is 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:34.870
 common and create a separate chapter to 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:37.419
 argue on the subject x and in the body 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.349
 of ship give me darling with just 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.270
 starting 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:43.509
 in general the hunchback of notre dame 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:46.180
 It's such a croup book. Toro was 28 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:48.130
 years when he wrote that he is somewhat 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.810
 price as she will have a job that 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.889
 remember that a good photographer wrote 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:56.289
 spd clean 1721 victor hugo the teacher 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.870
 pain as we all have a period of one 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.819
 year to write the book but it was only 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.610
 joined notes writing a novel 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:06.099
 in the last four months 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.280
 Of course crossing the Victor Hugo is still 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:11.710
 much better than the book out there but 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.009
 this particularly affects this part 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:18.310
 directions because they come swimming 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:22.080
 I am wrong and it is they who explain 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:24.759
 history importance of the cathedral and setra 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:28.180
 keep a tip I walked there in the video 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:30.360
 on the miserable pulled does read 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.069
 cross-section of these chapters 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.529
 can exist if you do not need 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:37.750
 to assimilate all that at once does not 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:40.659
 There is a time you get picking up rhythm 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.639
 I'm particularly enjoying myself 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:44.740
 I love these digressions 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:48.159
 then I'm living there to get over the report 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.620
 which describes the city of walls and I 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:52.900
 I was like a crazy looking 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.210
 some documentary that tells the story 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.919
 I found the city very good 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.650
 documentary in four parts that will 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:00.259
 leave the name 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.570
 in the description it looks really good and 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:04.070
 until what gabriela rezende commented 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.930
 with me instagram 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:09.050
 he passes the information o victor hugo 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.000
 that you do not think and theoretical books by 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.770
 In that documentary there was a lot of 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.910
 information I had read from the world 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:20.360
 nine years plus a great read of 2015 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:22.400
 and another thing I advise you too much 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.410
 mother of Samson with notes of 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.060
 footer comments 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.430
 I enjoyed my reading much more 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.440
 buoy in this commented edition than in the 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:35.570
 first time I read that it's an issue 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:38.810
 just the same text joys when nokia sounds 

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:41.770
 they give it stopped here by chance 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.770
