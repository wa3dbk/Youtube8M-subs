take me down from that position we need

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.290 
take me down from that position we need
to<00:00:18.199> find<00:00:18.500> a<00:00:18.619> way<00:00:18.650> to<00:00:18.860> get<00:00:19.279> back<00:00:19.550> to<00:00:19.759> a<00:00:19.789> good<00:00:19.880> base

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
to find a way to get back to a good base

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
grips its most likely he's going to be

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.980 
grips its most likely he's going to be
closing<00:00:25.279> a<00:00:25.369> tight<00:00:25.580> grip<00:00:25.849> around<00:00:26.060> my<00:00:26.300> chest<00:00:26.689> or

there<00:00:30.070> let's<00:00:31.070> see<00:00:31.249> how<00:00:31.429> we<00:00:31.490> can<00:00:31.730> accomplish

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
there let's see how we can accomplish

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.050 
there let's see how we can accomplish
this<00:00:32.540> by<00:00:32.840> using<00:00:33.380> a<00:00:33.560> good<00:00:33.710> technique<00:00:34.160> Michael

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
some space and you can see that I need

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.190 
some space and you can see that I need
to<00:01:26.810> move<00:01:27.080> that<00:01:27.320> hip<00:01:27.590> back<00:01:28.210> he<00:01:29.210> controls<00:01:29.780> my<00:01:29.930> hip

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.530 
to move that hip back he controls my hip
I'm<00:01:30.800> a<00:01:30.860> goner<00:01:31.220> here<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:31.790> I<00:01:31.820> need<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.180> bring<00:01:32.390> my

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
I'm a goner here so I need to bring my

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.280 
I'm a goner here so I need to bring my
hips<00:01:32.780> back<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.170> move<00:01:33.560> away<00:01:33.740> from<00:01:33.920> him<00:01:35.050> now<00:01:36.050> if

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
hips back and move away from him now if

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.500 
hips back and move away from him now if
he's<00:01:36.470> controlling<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:37.280> lower<00:01:37.490> back<00:01:37.820> this<00:01:38.360> is

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
he's controlling the lower back this is

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.140 
he's controlling the lower back this is
very<00:01:38.720> strong<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:39.380> once<00:01:39.590> i<00:01:39.830> move<00:01:40.100> my<00:01:40.430> back<00:01:40.760> away

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
very strong so once i move my back away

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.730 
very strong so once i move my back away
from<00:01:41.210> him<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:41.810> can<00:01:41.930> see<00:01:42.080> that<00:01:42.260> that<00:01:42.290> grip

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
from him you can see that that grip

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.940 
from him you can see that that grip
slides<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.370> little<00:01:43.640> higher<00:01:44.530> so<00:01:45.530> now<00:01:45.740> i<00:01:45.770> can

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
slides a little higher so now i can

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.090 
slides a little higher so now i can
control<00:01:46.580> his<00:01:46.760> arms<00:01:47.180> near<00:01:47.420> his<00:01:47.659> elbows<00:01:48.260> and<00:01:49.070> the

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
control his arms near his elbows and the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.250 
control his arms near his elbows and the
way<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.400> break<00:01:49.700> this<00:01:49.970> is<00:01:50.270> by<00:01:50.510> controlling<00:01:51.020> a

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
way to break this is by controlling a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260 
way to break this is by controlling a
