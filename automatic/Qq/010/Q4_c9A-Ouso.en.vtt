00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.850
 game and today the mail just passed 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.850
 here to leave the 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:27.519
 take a look at it here yet all in 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:30.070
 balad just got here is the xbox 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.500
 one I bought there at the 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.520
 Good, I bought not sugar, I'll tell you 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.360
 everybody 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.150
 I bought them because it's the fastest 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.760
 What's the matter, do not you wait eight? 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.770
 days ten working days for a delivery that 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.480
 you do not know what time it will be 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.920
 they send for the run they send it 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.380
 jadlog and I think that in brazil is one of the 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.800
 best computer stores and the game 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.470
 and there is my play 4 also prevented the 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.670
 for them it is much cheaper than 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.980
 any other place 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.610
 Anyway I recommend the guys are very 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.590
 good people then guarantee and look at this 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.400
 as well as packaged a box of them 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.060
 same 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.060
 then they will start to open a stylus 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:32.979
 remembering that this is the kuan xbox 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:36.070
 which was launched 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:39.640
 these days, incidentally, was launched on Friday 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:47.409
 It is now the second time it was only the 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:49.990
 to deliver their guarantee if you 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.830
 have a problem and I already changed 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.690
 Thing not the guys I a lot of good people 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.590
 the other stores in Brazil could 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.590
 learn from them 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:16.650
 ah ah ah look how beautiful it looks and 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.650

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:28.350
 xbox one 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:37.270
 Only then I make an area right. 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:40.630
 the xbox one national model purchased at 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:44.080
 al there are many people who have done the worst since 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:54.520
 what you bought is this is where you go 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:55.810
 receive this no longer have received well 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:02.080
 next 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:05.220
 all my consoles will usually leave 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.220
 awaits the boxes 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.950
 Our house has one has an xbox symbol 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.090
 right here in high relief, right? 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.440
 in paperboard 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:35.100
 This is a new kinect that I read 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:38.440
 is much better than the other annual 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:46.120
 accessories code for you 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:50.980
 put anatel 's installation guide 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.120
 quick look at the headset a lot of people 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.490
 was presenting mainly in the 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.410
 oasis site even ours but this one 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:01.750
 edition comes with headset there personal have 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.760
 answered the network 7 here here the cable 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.590
 energy as the standard-making 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.670
 national and only I imagine because it is the 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.940
 source 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:19.630
 it is the size of the same xbox 360 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:24.940
 thing that more that we have 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:26.380
 Here expensive control of less than 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.030
 People watch video only on the 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.930
 internet people do not know how it is 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:40.500
 we put the hand that looks something 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:40.500
 beautiful and this throne 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:51.300
 two duracell batteries you can see here 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.300
 by the color of them will not open now 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.310
 are hdmi cable 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:12.169
 Damn my kinect with the most hair 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.690
 throughout the history of some peripheral 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.720
 I guess I've never seen a car like this before. 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.720
 size 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:25.900
 but nowadays everybody has tv 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:28.100
 Giant right 60 70 inch 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.449
 so I think anyone who wants to put the 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:36.380
 kinect on the television needs 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:45.880
 really a big car like him 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:45.880
 weighed carton 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:58.080
 doing with all the care of the world since 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.080
 the plastic 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:28.040
 ah ah ah ah look what a beautiful thing 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:31.370

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:35.970
 very very cool 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:38.400
 Look what the hell folks here are the drive. 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:43.130
 blu-ray with the touch button 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:46.770
 to connect the xbox rear inputs 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:50.490
 hdmi output power input 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:53.160
 optical cable at the sp dfi hdmi input 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.140
 which is a very different thing than what 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.510
 xbox has in fact the people already 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.750
 started to do tests to turn on play 4 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:04.380
 in xbox and I'll tell you here stays with 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:08.510
 very light and you can not play here 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:12.120
 the usb 3.0 high speed inputs 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:15.330
 two an entrance to the kinect one 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:18.290
 input via an infrared sensor and 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:22.400
 an input to the network cable 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:27.240
 This is it people who asked the 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:30.630
 arrive very fast my play 4 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:34.470
 It will probably arrive fast too. 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:38.640
 This is it I recommend it here it is more 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:42.150
 a videogame to make video for you 

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.740
