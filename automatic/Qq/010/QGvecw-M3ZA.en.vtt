00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:27.019
 the crochet hook I'm going 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.050
 use 6/0 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:33.949
 thick cotton yarn 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.860
 will be doubled then I 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:40.879
 I come with green and yellow 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.699
 you know you can adapt to the color 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.400
 desired separating the material and let 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.920
 start ours you should start the 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.559
 its execution with the string of 5 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:57.920
 the first skip the first 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:03.460
 second and third base point 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:08.929
 you should run a half high point 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:12.220
 there again and run your second 

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:16.479
 and a half point high 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:21.170
 once again ace and run your 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:24.920
 third means from the high point 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.009
 now we will also perform increases 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.930
 So to turn your career around, you 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:37.899
 will make one and two chains you had to turn the 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:43.850
 your work there if already on your first 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:46.460
 point perform 2 high points in the 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.990
 same base point 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:54.710
 the next point is made single single 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:59.210
 so here it is and last point of the 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:03.439
 career will also receive two 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.579
 high points then the first one I know and 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:10.100
 at the same point the second 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:12.620
 I make two more chains of my own 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.940
 to turn over my work 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:22.489
 I will come back and in the first point people 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:27.010
 again two half high points 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:33.200
 the others except the latter also 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:37.280
 received only a half high point 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:43.040
 on reaching the last point of the career 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:47.300
 then yes you will again have two 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.239
 high points at the same base point 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:55.610
 and here I am running my last 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:59.510
 point the bow tie and make two chains 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:03.379
 You had to turn work back on again. 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:07.880
 again increases then in the first 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.870
 career point execute 2 half points 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.579
 high 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:18.440
 here is in continuity the half point 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:24.700
 high for each base point then here 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:29.799
 I have my half high points being 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:34.250
 executed 1 to 1 until the arrival of the last 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:40.940
 in the latter again the encounter increases 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:42.680
 and perform 2 high points in the same 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.609
 base point 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.760
 two chains you had to come to work and 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:54.440
 so I'll run until I have the 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:58.549
 desired size notice here you already 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.980
 Can you see the shape of your good handkerchief? 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.310
 you must run until you 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.730
 achieve until you get a size 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.819
 big enough is that you can give 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.090
 around the neck so it stays the 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.940
 your criteria the size you want 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.440
 in the end he found the size 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.200
 wanted 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.900
 I come back here to show you 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.870
 continue execution as it is there then 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.470
 after I had run all my 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.320
 is not I got a size of 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:37.820
 scarf was as follows for 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:42.800
 one end to the other end I got 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.900
 almost a meter and from the top to the 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.220
 the beginning of those three chains that the 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.400
 I did right I got 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:55.020
 almost 50 centimeters so this is the 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:58.830
 size of the scarf I got the jewelry 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:02.760
 Good now we 'll make the outline of the 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:05.460
 then I'll separate the 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.310
 My stuff and I'll be right back here. 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:12.360
 I'm back with a stitch on the needle now. 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.970
 working with yellow and yellow yarn 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.120
 in my case it 's not you suddenly can 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:21.750
 until you are using the same colored yarn 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.110
 will know then the contour of the 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.380
 whole piece will be executed a point 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:33.210
 for each point in front of you 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:36.660
 all in low and worked it 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:39.870
 contour all around so I'm in the 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:43.350
 where I have the most amount of 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:47.640
 points and you observe that I perform a 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:51.630
 low for each point I have 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:56.250
 in front of me is just the outline of the 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:06:00.600
 Your piece is a low for each 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:03.620
 point you have in front of you then 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:08.240
 I'll run the outline of my piece 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:11.880
 whole and then I come back here for us 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:15.240
 let's continue together now the last 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.150
 of our execution when we have done 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.120
 then the whole contour with the second fiho 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.030
 you will make a chain to give the 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:27.479
 height and above the same base point 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:32.100
 you perform a low do 3 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:35.700
 the last one will be attached to 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:39.450
 first with a very low point and you 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:42.060
 you'll get a point so you're eyeing a 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:47.070
 base point and the next 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:52.290
 make a low again on the next 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:55.140
 dot little chains and down 3 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:58.349
 last one should be attached to the first 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.000
 very low point and so you get a 

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:03.240
 spike again 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.950
 I skip a base point and at the next point 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:11.550
 low on the next low too 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:15.300
 and again 3 as people you should 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:18.720
 continue running this exact form 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.750
 jewelry to have finished the outline 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.120
 all making the points low points 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:28.110
 peak the points dangerous point no 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:30.570
 and you will then have your piece closed and 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.669
 ready to be used good 

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:35.250
 one more time I pray that you have 

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:39.770
 tanned is not even the 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.770
 people are in our next video
