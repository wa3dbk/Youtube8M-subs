if<00:00:02.010> you<00:00:02.159> want<00:00:02.399> a<00:00:02.490> good<00:00:02.669> board<00:00:02.970> you<00:00:03.419> get<00:00:03.570> it<00:00:03.689> from

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
if you want a good board you get it from

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.690 
if you want a good board you get it from
a<00:00:03.899> good<00:00:04.140> shape<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:09.440> me<00:00:10.440> what<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.250> want<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.580> do<00:00:11.670> a

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
a good shape to me what I want to do a

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.370 
a good shape to me what I want to do a
dive<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.210> as<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.599> just<00:00:12.750> wanna<00:00:12.929> ride<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.230> wave

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
dive in as I just wanna ride the wave

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:40.110 
dive in as I just wanna ride the wave
like<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.650> do<00:00:13.920> surfing

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.810 

either<00:00:41.120> off<00:00:41.540> so<00:00:42.019> hard<00:00:42.230> riding<00:00:43.129> on<00:00:43.250> my<00:00:43.400> back<00:00:43.580> end

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
either off so hard riding on my back end

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.820 
either off so hard riding on my back end
I<00:00:44.030> think<00:00:44.930> in<00:00:45.260> surfing<00:00:45.949> it's<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.699> most<00:00:47.830> purest

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
I think in surfing it's the most purest

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.830 
I think in surfing it's the most purest
form<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:49.460> you<00:00:49.519> can<00:00:49.699> really<00:00:50.150> make<00:00:50.600> it<00:00:50.660> look

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
form and you can really make it look

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.170 
form and you can really make it look
like<00:00:51.140> artwork<00:00:51.590> this<00:00:52.129> particular<00:00:52.519> move<00:00:52.940> is

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
like artwork this particular move is

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.670 
like artwork this particular move is
just<00:00:53.210> a<00:00:53.540> standard<00:00:53.780> reentry

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
just a standard reentry

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.219 
just a standard reentry
and<00:00:54.769> it's<00:00:55.250> probably<00:00:55.729> the<00:00:55.879> most<00:00:56.000> common<00:00:56.420> move

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:57.229 
and it's probably the most common move

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.490 
and it's probably the most common move
to<00:00:57.530> do<00:00:58.299> on<00:00:59.299> your<00:00:59.449> backhand<00:00:59.659> or<00:01:00.049> even<00:01:00.290> on<00:01:00.409> your

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
to do on your backhand or even on your

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.410 
to do on your backhand or even on your
forehand<00:01:00.920> it's<00:01:01.370> been<00:01:01.640> around<00:01:01.909> since<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.360> very

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
forehand it's been around since the very

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.719 
forehand it's been around since the very
beginning<00:01:03.040> but<00:01:04.040> I<00:01:04.100> think<00:01:04.339> when<00:01:04.460> it's<00:01:04.580> done

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
beginning but I think when it's done

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.780 
beginning but I think when it's done
right<00:01:05.059> it<00:01:05.299> just<00:01:05.330> it<00:01:05.840> just<00:01:05.900> looks<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:06.650> good<00:01:06.920> when

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
right it just it just looks so good when

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.219 
right it just it just looks so good when
I'm<00:01:07.909> riding<00:01:08.240> backside<00:01:08.630> it's<00:01:08.869> all<00:01:09.020> about

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
I'm riding backside it's all about

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.289 
I'm riding backside it's all about
unhooking<00:01:09.770> it's<00:01:10.190> all<00:01:10.340> about<00:01:10.520> opening<00:01:11.000> up<00:01:11.119> my

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
unhooking it's all about opening up my

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.310 
unhooking it's all about opening up my
body<00:01:11.570> getting<00:01:12.200> really<00:01:12.830> good<00:01:13.250> drive<00:01:13.990> speed<00:01:14.990> and

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
body getting really good drive speed and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.710 
body getting really good drive speed and
power<00:01:15.830> off<00:01:16.070> my<00:01:16.250> bottom<00:01:16.580> turn<00:01:16.760> and<00:01:17.030> then<00:01:17.510> just

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
power off my bottom turn and then just

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.300 
power off my bottom turn and then just
hooking<00:01:18.020> into<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.470> lip<00:01:18.619> as<00:01:18.799> hard<00:01:19.070> as<00:01:19.220> I

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
hooking into the lip as hard as I

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.230 
hooking into the lip as hard as I
possibly<00:01:19.340> can

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
possibly can

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.510 
possibly can
you<00:01:20.659> can<00:01:20.780> see<00:01:20.930> here<00:01:21.229> I've<00:01:21.710> already<00:01:21.830> unhooked

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
you can see here I've already unhooked

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.730 
you can see here I've already unhooked
of<00:01:22.670> a<00:01:23.150> void<00:01:23.420> off<00:01:23.630> exactly<00:01:24.260> where<00:01:24.409> I<00:01:24.439> want<00:01:24.680> to

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
of a void off exactly where I want to

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.090 
of a void off exactly where I want to
here

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
here

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.480 
here
and<00:01:25.990> now<00:01:26.990> what<00:01:27.800> I'm<00:01:27.920> doing<00:01:27.950> is<00:01:28.280> I'm<00:01:28.460> just

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
and now what I'm doing is I'm just

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.820 
and now what I'm doing is I'm just
generating<00:01:29.330> speed<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:29.930> drive<00:01:30.140> off<00:01:30.350> my<00:01:30.500> bottom

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
generating speed and drive off my bottom

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.960 
generating speed and drive off my bottom
turn<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:32.050> just<00:01:33.050> aiming<00:01:33.350> at<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.650> lip<00:01:33.830> just<00:01:34.430> to

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
turn and just aiming at the lip just to

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.330 
turn and just aiming at the lip just to
throw<00:01:35.210> everything<00:01:35.600> that<00:01:35.900> I<00:01:35.990> can<00:01:36.230> into<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:36.560> when

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
throw everything that I can into it when

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.400 
throw everything that I can into it when
I'm<00:01:37.460> driving<00:01:37.670> off<00:01:37.970> my<00:01:38.120> back<00:01:38.270> end<00:01:38.540> I'm<00:01:38.750> lowering

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
I'm driving off my back end I'm lowering

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.900 
I'm driving off my back end I'm lowering
my<00:01:39.530> center<00:01:39.800> of<00:01:39.830> gravity<00:01:39.890> like<00:01:40.520> I'm<00:01:40.670> almost

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
my center of gravity like I'm almost

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.390 
my center of gravity like I'm almost
sitting<00:01:41.360> on<00:01:41.510> a<00:01:41.540> seat<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:42.560> really<00:01:42.980> drives<00:01:43.190> you

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
sitting on a seat this really drives you

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.450 
sitting on a seat this really drives you
bored<00:01:43.640> with<00:01:44.570> my<00:01:44.750> back<00:01:44.930> foot<00:01:45.200> I'm<00:01:45.680> pushing<00:01:46.160> off

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
bored with my back foot I'm pushing off

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.880 
bored with my back foot I'm pushing off
it<00:01:46.640> really<00:01:46.850> hard<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.450> I'm<00:01:48.110> using<00:01:48.350> it<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.710> point

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
it really hard and I'm using it to point

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.080 
it really hard and I'm using it to point
me<00:01:49.040> in<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.130> direction<00:01:49.220> that<00:01:49.550> I<00:01:49.700> want<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:49.940> go

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
me in the direction that I want to go

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.780 
me in the direction that I want to go
but<00:01:50.330> leading<00:01:50.840> leading<00:01:51.560> with<00:01:51.860> my<00:01:51.890> front

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
but leading leading with my front

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.340 
but leading leading with my front
shoulder<00:01:53.180> when<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:53.690> come<00:01:53.870> up<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:54.140> you<00:01:54.230> hit

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
shoulder when you come up and you hit

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.700 
shoulder when you come up and you hit
the<00:01:54.470> lip<00:01:54.650> you<00:01:55.990> want<00:01:56.990> to<00:01:57.200> try<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:57.470> go<00:01:57.590> as

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
the lip you want to try and go as

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.640 
the lip you want to try and go as
vertical<00:01:58.220> as<00:01:58.460> you<00:01:58.670> possibly<00:01:59.030> can<00:01:59.650> remembering

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
vertical as you possibly can remembering

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.290 
vertical as you possibly can remembering
the<00:02:00.800> more<00:02:01.010> drawing<00:02:01.340> out<00:02:01.490> your<00:02:01.640> bottom<00:02:01.909> turn<00:02:02.090> is

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
the more drawing out your bottom turn is

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.420 
the more drawing out your bottom turn is
the<00:02:02.659> more<00:02:03.620> vertical<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.400> can<00:02:04.430> actually<00:02:04.700> go

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
the more vertical you can actually go

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.300 
the more vertical you can actually go
basically<00:02:07.430> when<00:02:08.030> your<00:02:08.179> board<00:02:08.619> gets<00:02:09.619> halfway

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
basically when your board gets halfway

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.630 
basically when your board gets halfway
up<00:02:10.940> above<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.599> lip<00:02:11.890> that's<00:02:12.890> when<00:02:13.159> you<00:02:13.310> want<00:02:13.519> to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
up above the lip that's when you want to

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.140 
up above the lip that's when you want to
jam<00:02:14.180> really<00:02:14.750> hard<00:02:14.989> on<00:02:15.470> your<00:02:16.010> tail<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.550> then

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
jam really hard on your tail and then

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.089 
jam really hard on your tail and then
move<00:02:17.510> all<00:02:17.959> your<00:02:18.200> weight<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:18.709> your<00:02:18.890> momentum

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
move all your weight and your momentum

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.960 
move all your weight and your momentum
to<00:02:19.549> your<00:02:19.849> front<00:02:20.180> foot<00:02:20.420> it's<00:02:20.870> going<00:02:21.140> to

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
to your front foot it's going to

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.460 
to your front foot it's going to
obviously<00:02:22.970> change<00:02:23.060> your<00:02:23.840> direction<00:02:24.170> from

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
obviously change your direction from

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.530 
obviously change your direction from
your<00:02:24.620> heel<00:02:24.860> slide<00:02:25.129> to<00:02:25.340> your<00:02:25.459> toe<00:02:25.640> side<00:02:25.940> but

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
your heel slide to your toe side but

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.240 
your heel slide to your toe side but
it's<00:02:26.659> going<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.930> really<00:02:27.260> push<00:02:27.530> your<00:02:27.709> tail<00:02:27.980> and

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
it's going to really push your tail and

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.330 
it's going to really push your tail and
then<00:02:29.150> also<00:02:29.840> keep<00:02:30.200> your<00:02:30.349> momentum<00:02:30.560> in<00:02:31.010> moving

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
then also keep your momentum in moving

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.699 
then also keep your momentum in moving
forward<00:02:31.730> which<00:02:32.330> is<00:02:32.480> really<00:02:32.750> important<00:02:33.200> if<00:02:33.590> you

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
forward which is really important if you

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.590 
forward which is really important if you
don't<00:02:33.980> keep<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:34.370> momentum<00:02:34.610> in<00:02:35.150> moving

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
don't keep that momentum in moving

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.250 
don't keep that momentum in moving
forward<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.950> will<00:02:37.720> basically<00:02:38.720> just<00:02:39.140> get

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
forward you will basically just get

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.500 
forward you will basically just get
caught<00:02:39.560> up<00:02:39.800> in<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.040> lip<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:41.120> wave<00:02:41.270> will

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
caught up in the lip and the wave will

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.340 
caught up in the lip and the wave will
leave<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.780> behind

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
leave you behind

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.080 
leave you behind
I<00:02:42.380> want<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:42.860> kite<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.100> not<00:02:43.430> be<00:02:43.580> pulling<00:02:43.880> me<00:02:44.000> at

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
I want the kite to not be pulling me at

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.750 
I want the kite to not be pulling me at
all<00:02:44.240> I<00:02:44.420> want<00:02:44.660> it<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.900> be<00:02:45.050> above<00:02:45.440> my<00:02:45.680> head<00:02:45.860> but<00:02:46.550> as

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
all I want it to be above my head but as

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.030 
all I want it to be above my head but as
I<00:02:46.940> come<00:02:47.300> back<00:02:47.480> down<00:02:47.810> I<00:02:48.110> also<00:02:48.380> want<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:48.860> bring

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
I come back down I also want to bring

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.340 
I come back down I also want to bring
the<00:02:49.160> kite<00:02:49.400> down<00:02:49.790> low<00:02:50.060> so<00:02:50.390> it's<00:02:50.570> moving<00:02:51.020> in<00:02:51.290> the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
the kite down low so it's moving in the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.340 
the kite down low so it's moving in the
forward<00:02:51.890> momentum<00:02:52.070> that<00:02:52.580> I<00:02:52.610> am<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:54.140> when<00:02:54.320> I

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
forward momentum that I am to so when I

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.350 
forward momentum that I am to so when I
do<00:02:54.470> get<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.100> bottom<00:02:55.370> of<00:02:55.460> the<00:02:55.550> wave<00:02:55.670> I'm

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
do get to the bottom of the wave I'm

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.600 
do get to the bottom of the wave I'm
also<00:02:56.690> going<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:56.990> keep<00:02:57.140> flying<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.770> kite<00:02:57.950> in

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
also going to keep flying the kite in

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.580 
also going to keep flying the kite in
that<00:02:58.790> forward<00:02:59.120> motion<00:02:59.330> so<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.200> kite<00:03:00.440> doesn't

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
that forward motion so the kite doesn't

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.340 
that forward motion so the kite doesn't
stall<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.640> pass<00:03:02.300> by<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.600> and<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:02.990> falls<00:03:03.200> out

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
stall and I pass by it and it falls out

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.750 
stall and I pass by it and it falls out
of<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.530> sky<00:03:04.150> doing<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.210> backside<00:03:05.420> reentry<00:03:06.230> is

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
of the sky doing a backside reentry is

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.180 
of the sky doing a backside reentry is
one<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:07.940> simplest<00:03:08.300> moves<00:03:08.630> you<00:03:09.470> can<00:03:09.620> do<00:03:09.800> but

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
one of the simplest moves you can do but

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.890 
one of the simplest moves you can do but
to<00:03:10.310> do<00:03:10.460> it<00:03:10.550> properly<00:03:10.820> it<00:03:11.120> does<00:03:11.300> get<00:03:11.540> quite

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
to do it properly it does get quite

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.230 
to do it properly it does get quite
technically<00:03:12.620> challenging<00:03:13.490> the<00:03:14.000> most

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
technically challenging the most

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.940 
technically challenging the most
important<00:03:14.690> thing<00:03:14.900> is<00:03:15.140> getting<00:03:15.380> drive<00:03:15.650> out<00:03:15.860> of

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
important thing is getting drive out of

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.400 
important thing is getting drive out of
your<00:03:16.070> bottom<00:03:16.220> turn<00:03:16.550> and<00:03:16.790> really<00:03:17.630> hooking<00:03:18.230> into

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
your bottom turn and really hooking into

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.080 
your bottom turn and really hooking into
the<00:03:18.590> lift<00:03:18.800> as<00:03:18.980> hard<00:03:19.220> as<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.430> possibly<00:03:19.460> can

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
the lift as hard as you possibly can

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.690 
the lift as hard as you possibly can
remember<00:03:20.900> you<00:03:21.410> want<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.680> kite<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:22.220> be

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
remember you want the kite to be

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.240 
remember you want the kite to be
straight<00:03:23.210> up<00:03:23.240> above<00:03:24.050> your<00:03:24.230> head<00:03:24.440> without<00:03:24.830> any

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
straight up above your head without any

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.970 
straight up above your head without any
pulling<00:03:25.640> power<00:03:25.790> during<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.420> turn<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:26.930> as<00:03:27.740> you

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
pulling power during the turn and as you

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.620 
pulling power during the turn and as you
come<00:03:28.190> back<00:03:28.220> down<00:03:28.460> from<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:28.970> turn<00:03:29.180> that's

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
come back down from the turn that's

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.300 
come back down from the turn that's
where<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:29.930> want<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:30.140> fly<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.410> kite<00:03:30.740> in<00:03:31.190> a

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
where you want to fly the kite in a

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.610 
where you want to fly the kite in a
forward<00:03:31.670> motion<00:03:31.850> so<00:03:32.570> that<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:33.290> your<00:03:33.350> kite

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
forward motion so that you and your kite

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.240 
forward motion so that you and your kite
can<00:03:33.920> ride<00:03:34.130> out<00:03:34.310> of<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.490> move<00:03:34.640> perfectly
