00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
American flag that we just flew the

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.119 
American flag that we just flew the
performance<00:05:13.150> is<00:05:13.360> ok<00:05:13.870> it's<00:05:14.139> a<00:05:14.259> slow<00:05:14.500> flyer<00:05:14.830> and

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
performance is ok it's a slow flyer and

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.179 
performance is ok it's a slow flyer and
it's<00:05:15.849> not<00:05:16.029> a<00:05:16.060> nightmare<00:05:16.689> when<00:05:17.349> it<00:05:17.469> comes<00:05:17.680> to<00:05:17.830> RC

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:18.189 
it's not a nightmare when it comes to RC

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:20.279 
it's not a nightmare when it comes to RC
flying<00:05:18.430> in<00:05:18.610> real<00:05:18.789> life<00:05:18.969> it<00:05:19.150> is<00:05:19.180> so<00:05:19.750> I<00:05:19.779> was

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
flying in real life it is so I was

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:22.589 
flying in real life it is so I was
having<00:05:20.439> fun<00:05:20.770> it's<00:05:21.099> a<00:05:21.370> little<00:05:21.729> nice<00:05:21.939> fun<00:05:22.300> plane

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599 
having fun it's a little nice fun plane

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:24.929 
having fun it's a little nice fun plane
apart<00:05:23.289> from<00:05:23.529> that<00:05:23.919> we<00:05:24.219> still<00:05:24.490> need<00:05:24.610> to<00:05:24.789> adjust

00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:24.939 
apart from that we still need to adjust

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:28.079 
apart from that we still need to adjust
the<00:05:25.300> landing<00:05:25.629> gear<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:26.080> retracts<00:05:27.089> perfectly

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:28.089 
the landing gear the retracts perfectly

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:29.579 
the landing gear the retracts perfectly
so<00:05:28.360> that<00:05:28.479> we<00:05:28.629> can<00:05:28.779> get<00:05:28.930> some<00:05:29.110> good<00:05:29.229> landings

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:29.589 
so that we can get some good landings

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:39.010 
so that we can get some good landings
let<00:05:29.979> me<00:05:30.069> set<00:05:30.279> the<00:05:30.430> CG<00:05:30.819> and<00:05:31.089> we'll<00:05:31.270> fly<00:05:31.569> it<00:05:31.629> again

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.080
