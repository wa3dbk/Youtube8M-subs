00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.599 

alright<00:00:28.660> basically<00:00:29.660> to<00:00:30.199> start<00:00:30.470> off<00:00:30.590> you<00:00:31.490> need

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
alright basically to start off you need

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.700 
alright basically to start off you need
to<00:00:31.669> learn<00:00:31.910> how<00:00:32.239> to<00:00:32.300> either<00:00:32.599> double<00:00:32.989> peg<00:00:33.140> feeble

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
to learn how to either double peg feeble

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.100 
to learn how to either double peg feeble
or<00:00:34.100> Smith<00:00:34.790> whichever<00:00:35.329> grind<00:00:35.570> you<00:00:35.720> all<00:00:35.870> alone

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
or Smith whichever grind you all alone

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.960 
or Smith whichever grind you all alone
to<00:00:36.440> hardware<00:00:36.829> you<00:00:37.010> need<00:00:37.040> to<00:00:37.280> actually<00:00:37.519> learn

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
to hardware you need to actually learn

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.850 
to hardware you need to actually learn
that<00:00:38.239> grain<00:00:38.480> first<00:00:38.809> and<00:00:39.079> be<00:00:39.140> able<00:00:39.260> to<00:00:39.410> lock<00:00:39.649> the

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
that grain first and be able to lock the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.240 
that grain first and be able to lock the
grinding<00:00:40.309> that's<00:00:41.269> almost<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:42.739> don't<00:00:43.190> be

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
grinding that's almost so don't be

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.829 
grinding that's almost so don't be
trying<00:00:43.489> to<00:00:43.550> do<00:00:43.670> the<00:00:43.790> trick<00:00:43.970> before<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.570> can<00:00:44.690> do

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
trying to do the trick before you can do

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:51.310 
trying to do the trick before you can do
the<00:00:44.960> grinding<00:00:45.290> block<00:00:46.180> don't<00:00:47.180> run<00:00:47.390> before<00:00:50.320> but

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
the grinding block don't run before but

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.860 
the grinding block don't run before but
anyway<00:00:51.589> yeah<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:51.980> learn<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:52.579> grains<00:00:52.870> and

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
anyway yeah so learn the grains and

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.060 
anyway yeah so learn the grains and
basically<00:00:54.230> once<00:00:54.470> you've<00:00:54.589> learned<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:54.829> ground

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
basically once you've learned the ground

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.240 
basically once you've learned the ground
I<00:00:55.839> prefer<00:00:56.839> to<00:00:56.870> do<00:00:57.110> double<00:00:57.649> peg<00:00:57.829> so<00:00:58.010> how<00:00:58.100> do<00:00:58.160> we

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
I prefer to do double peg so how do we

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.040 
I prefer to do double peg so how do we
want<00:00:58.430> to<00:00:58.460> either<00:00:58.609> i<00:00:58.760> find<00:00:59.030> that<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.570> easiest

want to either i find that the easiest

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.450 
want to either i find that the easiest

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.490 
trick them like the easiest way for me
to<00:01:01.550> do<00:01:01.699> holidays<00:01:01.940> is<00:01:02.239> with<00:01:02.449> that<00:01:02.480> trick<00:01:02.930> so

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
to do holidays is with that trick so

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.620 
to do holidays is with that trick so
i'll<00:01:03.829> teach<00:01:04.009> you<00:01:04.070> how<00:01:04.129> to<00:01:04.220> do<00:01:04.369> that<00:01:04.489> way<00:01:04.670> i'm

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
i'll teach you how to do that way i'm

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.749 
i'll teach you how to do that way i'm
going<00:01:05.720> to<00:01:05.810> start<00:01:06.050> off<00:01:06.280> double<00:01:07.280> peg<00:01:07.429> in<00:01:07.550> a<00:01:07.610> rail

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
going to start off double peg in a rail

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.120 
going to start off double peg in a rail
being<00:01:08.240> able<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:08.450> get<00:01:08.570> off<00:01:08.899> the<00:01:09.140> rail<00:01:09.259> or<00:01:09.590> off

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
being able to get off the rail or off

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.400 
being able to get off the rail or off
the<00:01:10.190> end<00:01:10.610> of<00:01:10.880> any<00:01:11.210> rail<00:01:11.509> like<00:01:11.990> basically

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
the end of any rail like basically

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.410 
the end of any rail like basically
because<00:01:12.920> when<00:01:13.399> you<00:01:13.490> do<00:01:13.580> off<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:13.789> side<00:01:14.060> of<00:01:14.090> rail

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
because when you do off the side of rail

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.359 
because when you do off the side of rail
it's<00:01:14.750> a<00:01:14.899> lot<00:01:15.110> harder<00:01:15.350> than<00:01:15.590> doing<00:01:15.890> it<00:01:16.039> up<00:01:16.190> it

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
it's a lot harder than doing it up it

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.490 
it's a lot harder than doing it up it
off<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.700> end<00:01:16.789> off<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:17.360> end<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:17.869> can<00:01:18.020> like

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
off the end off the end you can like

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.080 
off the end off the end you can like
clear<00:01:18.830> your<00:01:18.979> back<00:01:19.160> end<00:01:19.369> and<00:01:19.550> it<00:01:19.759> makes<00:01:19.940> it<00:01:20.030> a

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
clear your back end and it makes it a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.499 
clear your back end and it makes it a
lot<00:01:20.179> easier<00:01:20.360> so<00:01:21.229> start<00:01:21.770> off<00:01:22.000> peg<00:01:23.000> up<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.360> rail

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
lot easier so start off peg up the rail

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.560 
lot easier so start off peg up the rail
i<00:01:24.009> prefer<00:01:25.009> to<00:01:25.039> do<00:01:25.369> when<00:01:25.789> i<00:01:25.820> land<00:01:26.090> on<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.360> pegs

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
i prefer to do when i land on the pegs

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.210 
i prefer to do when i land on the pegs
has<00:01:27.050> i'm<00:01:27.200> getting<00:01:27.440> towards<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.770> end<00:01:27.890> of<00:01:28.159> the

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
has i'm getting towards the end of the

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.210 
has i'm getting towards the end of the
ground<00:01:28.550> I'll<00:01:29.090> lean<00:01:29.509> my<00:01:29.780> bike<00:01:30.020> like<00:01:30.679> I<00:01:30.830> grind<00:01:31.099> on

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
ground I'll lean my bike like I grind on

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.620 
ground I'll lean my bike like I grind on
the<00:01:31.310> right<00:01:31.489> so<00:01:31.670> I'll<00:01:31.789> leave<00:01:32.000> my<00:01:32.209> bike<00:01:32.360> over

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
the right so I'll leave my bike over

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.570 
the right so I'll leave my bike over
towards<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.200> right<00:01:33.259> as<00:01:33.649> i<00:01:33.920> get<00:01:34.039> to<00:01:34.160> the<00:01:34.220> end<00:01:34.399> so

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
towards the right as i get to the end so

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.080 
towards the right as i get to the end so
I've<00:01:34.700> got<00:01:34.880> more<00:01:35.090> full<00:01:35.840> on<00:01:36.520> like<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.700> bike<00:01:37.849> to

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
I've got more full on like the bike to

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.240 
I've got more full on like the bike to
get<00:01:38.209> it<00:01:38.360> up<00:01:38.509> into<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:38.899> air<00:01:39.050> you<00:01:40.039> basically

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250

want to pull off oh don't pull to the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.760 
want to pull off oh don't pull to the
side<00:01:43.819> like<00:01:44.149> no<00:01:44.780> loads<00:01:45.020> of<00:01:45.229> people<00:01:45.319> make<00:01:45.619> this

side like no loads of people make this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.160 
side like no loads of people make this
mistake<00:01:45.830> and<00:01:46.399> it<00:01:46.550> doesn't<00:01:46.789> work<00:01:46.940> you<00:01:47.630> like<00:01:47.780> you

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
mistake and it doesn't work you like you

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.650

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.260 
or something you don't do a flip off a
rail<00:01:59.750> should<00:02:00.739> Mike<00:02:00.860> Escamilla<00:02:01.539> stuntman<00:02:03.160> yeah

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
rail should Mike Escamilla stuntman yeah

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.119 
rail should Mike Escamilla stuntman yeah
there's<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.420> hard<00:02:05.599> way<00:02:05.720> 180<00:02:06.050> it's<00:02:06.530> easy<00:02:06.800> it's

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
there's the hard way 180 it's easy it's

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.249 
there's the hard way 180 it's easy it's
just<00:02:07.429> about<00:02:07.640> pulling<00:02:08.000> or<00:02:08.330> it's<00:02:08.899> not<00:02:09.080> about

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
just about pulling or it's not about

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.020 
just about pulling or it's not about
pulling<00:02:09.679> side<00:02:09.890> just<00:02:10.280> remember<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.759> if<00:02:10.940> you

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
pulling side just remember that if you

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.490 
pulling side just remember that if you
pull<00:02:11.209> up<00:02:11.360> at<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.569> end<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.020> rail<00:02:12.170> you'd<00:02:12.410> be

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
pull up at the end of the rail you'd be

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:30.550 
pull up at the end of the rail you'd be
able<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.709> do<00:02:12.860> it

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.500 

that's<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.310> hard<00:02:31.459> way<00:02:31.580> 18<00:02:32.800> hard<00:02:33.800> way<00:02:33.950> threes

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
that's the hard way 18 hard way threes

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.690 
that's the hard way 18 hard way threes
again<00:02:35.510> like<00:02:36.260> these<00:02:36.770> are<00:02:36.980> like<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.190> little<00:02:37.550> bit

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
again like these are like a little bit

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.059 
again like these are like a little bit
harder<00:02:38.060> but<00:02:38.540> if<00:02:39.380> you<00:02:39.500> can<00:02:39.620> do<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.800> hard<00:02:39.980> way

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
harder but if you can do the hard way

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.130 
harder but if you can do the hard way
180<00:02:40.340> then<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:41.090> pretty<00:02:41.390> much<00:02:41.510> do<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.780> hard<00:02:41.989> or

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
180 then you pretty much do a hard or

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.330 
180 then you pretty much do a hard or
three<00:02:42.349> if<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:42.530> can<00:02:42.650> do<00:02:42.709> a<00:02:42.739> hard<00:02:42.950> way<00:02:43.040> 180

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
three if you can do a hard way 180

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.100 
three if you can do a hard way 180
because<00:02:43.640> it's<00:02:43.790> just<00:02:43.849> like<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.720> have<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:44.989> do<00:02:45.080> a

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
because it's just like you have to do a

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.830 
because it's just like you have to do a
180<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:45.560> 360<00:02:46.160> they're<00:02:46.400> too<00:02:46.550> easy<00:02:46.730> tricks<00:02:47.090> it

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
180 and 360 they're too easy tricks it

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.660 
180 and 360 they're too easy tricks it
was<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.019> same<00:02:48.200> pretty<00:02:48.440> much<00:02:48.620> all<00:02:49.099> it<00:02:49.310> is<00:02:49.430> is

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
was the same pretty much all it is is

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.600 
was the same pretty much all it is is
going<00:02:50.030> quicker<00:02:50.420> and<00:02:50.860> pulling<00:02:51.860> off<00:02:52.010> harder

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
going quicker and pulling off harder

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.420 
going quicker and pulling off harder
like<00:02:52.819> pulling<00:02:53.330> you<00:02:53.780> get<00:02:53.959> that<00:02:54.110> start<00:02:54.590> it's

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
like pulling you get that start it's

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.940 
like pulling you get that start it's
like<00:02:55.550> when<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:55.910> do<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.060> 360<00:02:56.630> when<00:02:57.319> you<00:02:57.410> as<00:02:57.800> you

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
like when you do a 360 when you as you

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.830 
like when you do a 360 when you as you
start<00:02:58.250> off<00:02:58.340> on<00:02:58.519> doing<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.760> pony<00:02:58.910> up<00:02:59.060> three<00:02:59.330> you

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
start off on doing a pony up three you

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.300 
start off on doing a pony up three you
pull<00:02:59.870> loads<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:00.769> then<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:00.980> keep<00:03:01.190> yourself

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
pull loads and then you keep yourself

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.880 
pull loads and then you keep yourself
centered<00:03:01.849> on<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.239> bike<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.989> as<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.260> do<00:03:03.440> it's

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
centered on the bike and as you do it's

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.289 
centered on the bike and as you do it's
exactly<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.400> same<00:03:04.580> as<00:03:04.730> soon<00:03:04.910> as<00:03:05.030> your<00:03:05.150> hard

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
exactly the same as soon as your hard

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:06.940 
exactly the same as soon as your hard
way<00:03:05.450> off<00:03:05.569> the<00:03:05.690> rail<00:03:05.870> keep<00:03:06.410> yourself<00:03:06.709> centered

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
way off the rail keep yourself centered

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.370 
way off the rail keep yourself centered
on<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.220> bike<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.670> it<00:03:07.880> will<00:03:07.970> pull<00:03:08.180> around

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
on the bike and it will pull around

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.890 
on the bike and it will pull around
exactly<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.470> same<00:03:09.650> as<00:03:09.799> a<00:03:09.830> three<00:03:10.180> yeah<00:03:11.180> as<00:03:11.690> I
