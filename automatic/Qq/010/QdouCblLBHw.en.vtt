00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.720
 food poisoning 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.330
 one of the important systems in 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.270
 our organism is the system 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:20.060
 digestive which is responsible for processing 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:23.190
 all the foods that we consume 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.860
 corresponds to a tube that connects the 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.450
 mouth with anus 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.640
 In between there are different 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.220
 organs such as the esophagus the 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.910
 stomach and intestines that will have 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.100
 mainly two functions 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.070
 first the digestion of the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.370
 food is to say the breaking of these 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.760
 in small pieces and in second place 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.830
 the absorption of nutrients since the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.110
 main function of the food in 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.460
 our body is to give us the 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.170
 nutrients that our body 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.170
 need to work properly 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.700
 to food intake 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.190
 means to introduce into our body 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.460
 external objects the digestive system 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.340
 must have specially reinforced a 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.680
 system of defenses to prevent the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.250
 The food we eat can damage 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.860
 the organism 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.680
 despite this, many times 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:28.110
 foods can cause us damage as 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.110
 a mechanism known as poisoning 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.200
 this can occur for two reasons 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.009
 different 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.090
 the first place may be that they exist 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.690
 microorganisms in the foods that 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.740
 we consume 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.880
 These are mainly of three types 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.880
 they can be bacteria 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.260
 operation 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.189
 if the food we consume 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.740
 they contain microorganisms in an easy 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.840
 gateway for these so that 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.770
 enter our body and from there 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.570
 can damage 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.310
 There are different types of 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.920
 microorganisms that are considered 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.220
 pathogens is able to cause 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.319
 diseases and several of these have their 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.560
 port of entry as per the system 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.560
 digestive 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.440
 a second option for poisoning 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.370
 by food is the presence in expos 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.980
 of toxins 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.590
 the toxins are not organisms but 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.220
 they are chemical substances capable of damaging 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.950
 our tissues and that can reach 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.980
 the food either by pollution 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.950
 of these directly by chemicals or 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.930
 because there was at some point the essence 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.230
 of organisms that produced these 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.230
 toxins 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.570
 in general terms intoxication 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.930
 by toxins can be easier to 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:01.150
 handle since it should only be counteracted 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.150
 the effect they have on the body 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.000
 the microorganisms in turn must 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.310
 beat the defense barriers and the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.090
 digestive system has 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.280
 in general terms this means 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.590
 traverse a layer of cells that 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.959
 they exist throughout the entire system 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.959
 digestive called epithelium 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.840
 in this epithelium besides having cells 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.690
 very closely linked and that prevent 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.940
 the step of anything there 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.970
 cells of the immune system called 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.970
 white blood cells 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.430
 for this so that a microorganism 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.370
 can invade our body from the 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.760
 digestive system must first of all 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.780
 be able to cross the epithelium and in 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.120
 second place must be able to outwit 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.830
 the white blood cells to be able to invade 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.620
 the tissues without being caught and attacked 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.620
 when this is achieved by some 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.830
 middle of the ring this can cause a 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.230
 disease either in the same tissue of the 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.680
 digestive system or invading others 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.680
 tissues 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.239
 in general terms the poisonings 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.859
 for food they have pretty symptoms 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.259
 classics 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.949
 These are mainly associated with 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:32.599
 abdominal pains or colic presence 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:36.050
 of diarrhea nausea and vomiting weakness 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:37.500
 body fights and chills and pain 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.240
 head 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.370
 many of these symptoms are 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.530
 consequences of reactions that the 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.200
 digestive system has to try 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.810
 expel the foods that are 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.419
 damaging 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.940
 for this same reason the treatments 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:56.110
 many times they focus instead on 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.110
 fight the simple 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.830
 symptoms such as diarrhea and 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.040
 constant vomiting can occur in the 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.750
 organism a dehydration is because of this 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.030
 which is often necessary 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.310
 administer liquids in a 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.440
 intravenous to avoid 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:17.140
 Dehydration of the person 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.200
 They also usually administer medications 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.510
 that control diarrhea to prevent 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.750
 a dehydration that can be very 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.750
 serious 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.350
 usually accompanied by medicine 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.660
 symptomatic is to say medications that 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.870
 can lighten some of the symbols 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.630
 as for example analgesic to remove 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.450
 the headache or antispasmodic 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.780
 to relieve the pain produced by the 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.780
 Colic 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.680
 because there is a weakness 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.750
 body is generally recommended 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.169
 rest during the time it lasts 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.169
 poisoning 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:00.239
 finally in the event that the 

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:03.089
 intoxication was caused by 

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:05.070
 bacteria found in the 

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:07.440
 foods 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.780
 if you use the application 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.350
 antibiotics to combat the action of 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.350
 the bacteria
