that's<00:02:57.920> just<00:02:58.129> me<00:02:58.250> my<00:02:58.879> personal<00:02:59.209> opinion<00:02:59.629> I

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
that's just me my personal opinion I

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.380 
that's just me my personal opinion I
should<00:03:00.170> have

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.200 

I<00:03:03.420> had<00:03:04.260> not<00:03:04.500> even<00:03:04.770> register<00:03:05.370> opinion<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:05.910> think

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
I had not even register opinion I think

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.090 
I had not even register opinion I think
perhaps<00:03:06.420> it's<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.140> little<00:03:07.380> bit<00:03:07.470> ignorant<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:08.010> I

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
perhaps it's a little bit ignorant and I

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.070 
perhaps it's a little bit ignorant and I
think<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.550> as<00:03:08.670> we<00:03:08.700> matured<00:03:09.390> grow<00:03:09.840> as<00:03:10.050> a

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
think that as we matured grow as a

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.590 
think that as we matured grow as a
society<00:03:10.830> we<00:03:11.340> become<00:03:11.670> less<00:03:11.850> ignorant<00:03:12.150> and

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
society we become less ignorant and

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.640 
society we become less ignorant and
that's<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.930> good<00:03:13.140> thing

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
that's a good thing

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.070

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080
