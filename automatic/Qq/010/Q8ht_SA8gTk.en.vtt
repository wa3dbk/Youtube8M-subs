00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.519
 already done when time must vinyl 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.230
 because well here that we arrived on 17 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.759
 how it has been like that and in the hive 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.770
 the 25 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.390
 Esteban Andrade can tell me 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.550
 briefly or if you do not want briefly 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.779
 long the hive experience that 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.460
 it's a classic point of sale of music 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.199
 that was the hive 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.109
 and now they calmed down a place for life 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.109
 real and it was sold said this vinyl 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:39.090
 on the street not on the street 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.500
 It was a strategic site to get 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.230
 music of all kinds that at that time 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.230
 it was getting understood exactly by 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.500
 what hive room was this in chile what 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.480
 knew more before because the site that 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.480
 It was the only place that sold rock 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.610
 well on vinyl how many sellers today in 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.340
 the hive approximately let's say how 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.550
 10 20 sellers about 10 15 of 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.830
 they got me how many kilograms 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:11.380
 in the middle and those in the middle are by 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:14.230
 for the union because you like it 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.000
 sell vinyl records said and live the 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.760
 women is part of life as is the 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.960
 different sound music and reading 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.960
 is part of any person they are not 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.960
 as well 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:35.470
 and part of black sabbath the beatles 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.200
 and another thing feels like there's like 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.510
 revive the life of vinyl in the 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.890
 recent years has always been stable 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.340
 interest of the people 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.830
 vinyl was good status in 90 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.820
 then it appeared to decide if the vinyl 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.520
 went down to 5 percent for those I did this 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.180
 and it came as 10 years later now 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.400
 people to return around the world in 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.690
 everyone is not only the world is and 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.580
 what people who just search 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.200
 vinyl sometimes sell the 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.900
 collectors any kind of 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.780
 collector up but now 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.380
 Mostly young people are these 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.120
 because your parents tell you that the 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.980
 vinyl has other sounds and that to see 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.410
 If it is clean, they are coming to 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.940
 young patients how many disks I think 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.690
 who have gone through their effort are 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.690
 during the years 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:33.650
 I do not remember because the 95 lost in the 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:35.000
 space I do not remember in 125 as if as 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.849
 in the era of andrade 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.140
 draw from the hive and only from the 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.220
 then you record them and from there what 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.830
 they took out 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.830
 at 25 and I do not know how much 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:53.360
 to see part of material and a group 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:57.319
 psychedelic of drummer of the group that 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.190
 hired me is the products when not 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.750
 I found him this from the friend Creek in 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.680
 hives you in real life not the 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.500
 I found in the afternoon 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.930
 I despaired and started looking in 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.209
 ideology to rank the veil with running 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.370
 lara and I said here do not go for 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:21.980
 please come and turn and I said this where 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.769
 they are selling alcohol right now 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.870
 or from the hive I got kirk right and 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.190
 it's here and now it's in that 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.650
 elections back tells me the old man is 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.920
 collector 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.450
 because you sell records and good 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.410
 like that sheet and different from any 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.060
 chamba 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.880
 this work 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.620
 has known people during the years of 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.459
 enough collectors of everything if 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.930
 comes from several countries in the world of 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.170
 Brazil Chile 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.340
 but this space in kiel that is unique 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.459
 in the whole city there are no other similar 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.519
 Do not go back to the Brazilian gallery but if there 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:03.090
 but the quantity of companies the quality 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:05.430
 and this one that tells you the people who come and 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.930
 for the first time of vinyls to be 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.870
 quite surprising because when the 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.269
 the amount of vinyl surprised 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:18.760
 and they do not have time that little pork 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:20.500
 amount that has had difficult discs 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:27.400
 of getting and of which 60 and 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:29.650
 proud and difficult groups 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.560
 Peruvians as tarcos 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:36.010
 it's hard not clear if half of 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.360
 the arcs in spanish this one 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.639
 the vocalist is an argentinian singer 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.500
 Spanish I thought especially as 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.770
 tends part deborah readable and a little 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.169
 up until you remove it band your 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.190
 gender in people mostly 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.140
 Question 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.760
 good especially to the law of the 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:56.740
 seekers like pink floyd 2 and 3 are pele 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.780
 a little tree 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.830
 today they are asking the king for bob 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.380
 marley 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.620
 already go 2 people come of all ages or 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.930
 older people of all ages fall between 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.580
 young and adults 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:19.720
 and when the product for example where 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:22.090

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:27.060

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.060
