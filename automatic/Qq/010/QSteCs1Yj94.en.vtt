00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.340
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.810
 this video is my vote unfortunately 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.580
 I also have a bit of a scratch 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.860
 now a few such a sore throat 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.000
 moderately you get hold was a bit 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.550
 huh yes to this video with the title like 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.699
 the title will be I'll wait 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.800
 Thank you exactly yes and that to that 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:38.910
 maybe some noticed when 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.449
 last video that had the title like 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.949
 as well as the bvb boss doubt games exactly 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.600
 because I have a dislike bot on it 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.210
 that means I had about 50 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.960
 discs or so but against the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:57.119
 current time 252 likes so the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.330
 Of course, dislike sting out clearly 

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:02.729
 in the end I do not care so much 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.229
 the ones those channel can me 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.619
 happy to continue dislike button I have no 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.420
 problem with is their cause 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.640
 yes, I do not do that because 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.130
 I know there are no legitimate 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.510
 discs and those can parent my videos 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.280
 find a shit when someone says hey 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.710
 because the video was not that good because of that 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.890
 and the dislike I understand is okay 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.899
 but I guess I just was not me 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.450
 When moment is there I clearly ask 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.530
 hey why but in the end it is one 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.840
 decision because I want nothing off 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.070
 change and otherwise I just want to 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.179
 little to say about the video 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.799
 bit it, I have yes 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.210
 said hey a bit pop is coming back 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.189
 others found the decision correct 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.259
 Cool on the frame I do not care what 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.659
 you bring without you want there you 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.140
 written i believe my self 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:50.340
 I'll take a look at my own 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.780
 Exactly he says you can even barbie on 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.789
 bring the pony farm or something 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.439
 I watch because of you and find that 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.030
 I'm correct in the background 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.619
 By the way, we think we're all round 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.240
 me to her does not play that correct 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.859
 It's something that Ramsau generally writes 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.749
 written and wrote yes 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.520
 clear pvp is really like times 

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:10.020
 varied and so I have to too 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.400
 I not only play two games have 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.880
 sometimes even need a bed or even 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.230
 Clear games can also be done 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.580
 and certainly not 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.390
 Three times a week so come 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.740
 I do not mean that now only me 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.690
 bring two games or something or just 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.720
 pvp and then once a week motto 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.920
 No, I'll try 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.930
 But if I have a bock do 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.610
 to record video but just for 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.500
 motto view no buck or no time has 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.670
 then usually fast nickels 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.390
 doubt games I do not have to 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.370
 necessarily win 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.780
 I'm not that someone who says so 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.180
 must win every round and otherwise 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.990
 nothing high except me but really in 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:52.370
 He has the first ten seconds as well 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:55.100
 and otherwise exactly to the relations 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.140
 I really saw mine then 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.730
 the people who can watch the videos 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.170
 really be really active 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.830
 because the video has the right now 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.350
 I call for 2000 clicks is for 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.520
 my abozahlen of course, very little 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:14.240
 but for that now has 250 likes 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.400
 and especially 120 comments I think 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.510
 the exaggeratedly cool course at 2,000 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.470
 war I think honestly hot 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.840
 inactivity, but then I see 120 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.650
 comments at 2,000 clicks that's the case 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.769
 unbelievably much and that is without joke 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.700
 so 120 comments at 2,000 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.840
 clicks and I do not even have 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.510
 somehow in the video actually said 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.739
 ey com with her please so much and me 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.030
 I just plain freedom as the 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.580
 do you think that I do that and 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.980
 so and that of the 120 comments arise 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.570
 I found really really sick I am 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.000
 kinda cool but no i wanted that 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.130
 people who say now I like pvp 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.200
 you are not shit or just suits 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.790
 not to you it does not look it will 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.470
 at most once a week 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.940
 maybe even a week comes 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.400
 Not so I do not want to do that often 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.690
 and if the pc starts then that falls 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.299
 Anyway, I'll just do it 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.890
 bbc and nature use someone has in the 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.600
 Comment decide what you do 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.850
 I actually do and I do 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.690
 on my old channel what I want 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.549
 and of course, take into account suggestions 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.989
 there a little bit but when she says so 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.090
 I do not like that again 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.830
 then I do not do that 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.479
 yes and even if that somehow right 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.640
 Well, war would give me that 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.290
 do not make it at bbc i'm hoping 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.280
 then, of course, that's overkill 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.260
 arrives because the first and second 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.120
 Staffel also really crass arrived 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.470
 but it does me too 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.650
 exaggerated fun that's what I think 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.030
 to take the project that is that 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.599
 project which makes me the most fun 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.190
 was pixeln son data without doubt 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:42.410
 games or the whole pvp st 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.890
 against the bz nothing old without joke the 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.180
 is nothing and yes I'm looking forward to it 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.400
 every time right what I can 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.860
 not exactly say I say now pi times 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.320
 sometimes thumb three four five weeks 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.480
 perhaps because before I know it starts 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.070
 I will not tell anything specific 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.240
 just takes a bit longer and in 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:04.070
 the time may come a few 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:06.950
 doubt bender games videos or something 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.770
 like games and so no idea 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.300
 Maybe everything will come , but I thought so 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.830
 not good way as well as when on 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.690
 Tuesday offered the optically can not you 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.640
 could go ahead if we were 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.170
 against it, fans really blatantly like 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.610
 now at 52 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.460
 if you hold it against blatant against 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.770
 I would not do that anyway 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.430
 even less than they are not now 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.080
 itches so cool but that many so 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.880
 had a lot of understanding had the big 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.010
 really understanding that pvp 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.020
 wants to do and as I said it will stop 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.550
 just not so much pvp this video 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.900
 will somehow hopefully be okay 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.610
 come today on sunday 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.560
 I do not have that much time today 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.480
 has to do a lot but that sounds 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.550
 I'm still only 56 minutes video 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:52.280
 now and otherwise yes so much they have 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:55.190
 but excited as such someone offered and 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.510
 Dislike that's how I think so blatantly that me 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.640
 still such a community from the 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.770
 so blatant to me though I think so much 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.300
 energy and how active I realize 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.340
 that they are such a community 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.800
 and I think that's right 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.560
 cool of you stay so please change that 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.730
 not and I keep trying so content 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.380
 to bring and possibly you one 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.370
 a little bit to laugh and with it 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.650
 as it is always a bit 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.270
 harder because they really say that 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.650
 me myself I want you something 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.320
 teach I'd say I want what I 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.390
 teach and not funny 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.650
 be and the plaster the youtuber the world 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.320
 but really teach you out 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.169
 but at bbc will loose so much again 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.000
 funny arise and yes well then what 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.890
 is with us the hotline until then and 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.450
 20 liked that there only positive 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.750
 reviews comments david me very much 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:41.660
 happy and then I say people and skin 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:45.040
 It's like a mirror you see yourself 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.040
 yes so people
