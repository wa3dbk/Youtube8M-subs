kind of details on the side of these

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.260 
kind of details on the side of these
things<00:01:48.720> but<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.340> there<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.090> can

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
things but it's it's there you can

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.639 
things but it's it's there you can
customize<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.810> wheels<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.530> can

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
at this and thought this would be like a

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.160 
at this and thought this would be like a
really<00:02:22.930> slow<00:02:23.730> van<00:02:24.730> or<00:02:25.120> truck<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.990> it's

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
really slow van or truck and it's

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.290 
really slow van or truck and it's
actually<00:02:26.470> really<00:02:26.770> fast<00:02:27.130> I<00:02:27.370> mean<00:02:27.550> cook<00:02:27.760> for<00:02:28.150> how

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
actually really fast I mean cook for how

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.850 
actually really fast I mean cook for how
it<00:02:28.480> looks<00:02:28.720> it's<00:02:28.870> not<00:02:28.990> fast<00:02:29.170> compared<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.500> sport

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
it looks it's not fast compared to sport

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.770 
it looks it's not fast compared to sport
far<00:02:30.070> but<00:02:30.490> it's<00:02:30.610> very<00:02:30.820> nip<00:02:31.120> it's<00:02:31.360> got<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.510> really

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
far but it's very nip it's got a really

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.720 
far but it's very nip it's got a really
cool<00:02:32.020> sound<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:32.680> actually<00:02:33.100> kind<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.430> sounds

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
cool sound to it actually kind of sounds

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.310 
cool sound to it actually kind of sounds
like<00:02:33.790> nothing<00:02:34.240> else<00:02:34.390> in<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.630> game<00:02:34.780> you'll

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
like nothing else in the game you'll

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.540 
like nothing else in the game you'll
notice<00:02:35.530> once<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:35.920> start<00:02:36.160> driving<00:02:36.489> this

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
notice once you start driving this

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.190 
notice once you start driving this
around<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.450> this<00:02:37.600> has<00:02:37.780> some<00:02:37.989> decent

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
around and this has some decent

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.080 
around and this has some decent
customization<00:02:39.010> options<00:02:39.340> obviously<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:39.910> can

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
customization options obviously you can

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.660 
customization options obviously you can
change<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:41.140> color<00:02:41.680> of<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:42.040> paint<00:02:42.400> as<00:02:42.640> well
