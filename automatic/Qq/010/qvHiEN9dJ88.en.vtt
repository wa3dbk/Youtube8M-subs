00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.240
 mexicana on the Aztec stadium 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.490

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.619

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.930

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.540
 leave that personality with essence 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.480
 daring and therefore has no doubt that 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.450
 your team the tricolor at home will happen 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.190
 above the first New Zealanders 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.230

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.780
 let's win I say finalize the series 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.910
 I hope that's the idea we 're not thinking 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.500
 then we are very firmly already 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.539
 thinking that we put an end to take a 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.910
 marker that practically gives us the 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.620
 possibility to finalize the series here 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.410
 then already secondary not that yes no 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.300
 I can not say so surely 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.979
 as I know we 're going to win the peak he wants 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.289
 let your players have fun live 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.470
 feel enjoy the game in front of 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.470
 new zealand because only thus considered 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.750
 to the key to success in the game 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.410
 messages from the beginning this is a 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.700
 game that we started the children having 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.640
 that desire to do things as a 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.780
 game that do not forget about that with the 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.090
 responsibility that brings us that is 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.500
 our profession then we have a lot 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.870
 responsibility to bring mexico to 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.270
 world but let's not forget that it is 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.470
 a game and when you do it best is 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.510
 when you have more fun you have to 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.220
 have fun to full so that people 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.320
 come out very funny stadium very happy 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.090
 finally herrera shared what would be 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.220
 that marker that would leave him calm 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.160
 face the duel back in front of the 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.650
 kiwis above 3 goals is already a good 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.030
 and goals are are very good but or 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.190
 when it is a very good advantage 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.229
 up 3 goals do not like trying to 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.970
 do the goals that we get that 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.940
 let us allow them for what we 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.190
 allow good play and forcefulness 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.190
