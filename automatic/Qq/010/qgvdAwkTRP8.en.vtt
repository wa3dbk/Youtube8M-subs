00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.060 
really find out exactly what I wanted to
know<00:00:17.880> about<00:00:18.060> pack<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:18.779> first<00:00:19.050> off<00:00:19.320> we're<00:00:19.890> going

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.090 
know about pack so first off we're going
to<00:00:20.220> be<00:00:20.340> doing<00:00:20.750> 7.5<00:00:21.750> k-pax<00:00:22.350> trying<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.710> find<00:00:22.920> out

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
to be doing 7.5 k-pax trying to find out

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.189 
to be doing 7.5 k-pax trying to find out
if<00:00:23.310> they're<00:00:23.609> worth<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:24.119> how<00:00:24.570> much<00:00:24.840> money<00:00:25.050> you

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
if they're worth it how much money you

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.040 
if they're worth it how much money you
get<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.650> average<00:00:25.949> back<00:00:26.400> from<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.730> or<00:00:27.050> 7,500

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
get on average back from you or 7,500

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.750 
get on average back from you or 7,500
coins<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.529> put<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.160> want<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.369> find<00:00:29.519> out

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
coins you put in so we want to find out

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.569 
coins you put in so we want to find out
if<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.539> average<00:00:30.720> about<00:00:31.050> 5000<00:00:31.920> coins<00:00:32.040> back<00:00:32.340> if

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
if we average about 5000 coins back if

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.040 
if we average about 5000 coins back if
we<00:00:32.610> average<00:00:32.820> four<00:00:33.239> thousand<00:00:33.630> if<00:00:33.750> we<00:00:33.930> average

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
we average four thousand if we average

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.930 
we average four thousand if we average
two<00:00:34.500> thousand<00:00:35.010> coins<00:00:35.100> back<00:00:35.340> from<00:00:35.550> each<00:00:35.640> pack

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
two thousand coins back from each pack

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.049 
two thousand coins back from each pack
and<00:00:36.420> then<00:00:36.540> probably<00:00:37.020> go<00:00:37.290> on<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.739> compare<00:00:38.430> that

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
and then probably go on and compare that

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.110 
and then probably go on and compare that
result<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:40.140> maybe<00:00:40.500> 5,000<00:00:41.309> coin<00:00:41.460> packs<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.000> see

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
result to maybe 5,000 coin packs and see

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.660 
result to maybe 5,000 coin packs and see
if<00:00:42.210> they're<00:00:42.510> worth<00:00:42.719> opening<00:00:43.040> in<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.550> know

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
if they're worth opening in you know

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.920 
if they're worth opening in you know
comparison<00:00:45.239> because<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.450> may<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.600> able<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
comparison because you may be able to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.110 
comparison because you may be able to
get<00:00:46.140> 5,000<00:00:47.039> coin<00:00:47.190> packs<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.670> actually<00:00:47.940> get

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
get 5,000 coin packs and actually get

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.090 
get 5,000 coin packs and actually get
four<00:00:48.510> thousand<00:00:48.899> coins<00:00:48.989> back<00:00:49.260> from<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.829> packs

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
four thousand coins back from the packs

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.880 
four thousand coins back from the packs
you<00:00:50.610> know<00:00:50.730> by<00:00:50.879> selling<00:00:51.300> everything<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:52.350> that's

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
you know by selling everything so that's

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.740 
you know by selling everything so that's
the<00:00:53.070> idea<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:53.910> we're<00:00:54.090> going<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.690> in

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the idea now we're going to do this in

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.869 
the idea now we're going to do this in
five<00:00:55.320> different<00:00:55.559> parts<00:00:56.070> we're<00:00:56.250> going<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.610> open

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
five different parts we're going to open

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.959 
five different parts we're going to open
up<00:00:57.000> ten<00:00:57.629> gold<00:00:58.350> premium<00:00:58.800> packs<00:00:59.250> for<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.730> five

up ten gold premium packs for the five

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.049 
up ten gold premium packs for the five
parts<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.840> each<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.739> them<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.670> will<00:01:02.850> sell

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
parts in each of them and I will sell

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.030 
parts in each of them and I will sell
everything<00:01:03.570> possible<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.589> I'm<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.860> going

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
everything possible on so I'm not going

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.440 
everything possible on so I'm not going
to<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.220> selling<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.670> healing<00:01:06.090> cards

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
to be selling on the healing cards

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.630 
to be selling on the healing cards
probably<00:01:07.020> not<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> bad<00:01:07.590> kit<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.189> I'll<00:01:08.280> sell<00:01:08.490> on

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
probably not the bad kit so I'll sell on

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.580 
probably not the bad kit so I'll sell on
the<00:01:08.670> good<00:01:08.939> badges<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.510> kits<00:01:09.720> though<00:01:09.930> i'll<00:01:10.380> be

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the good badges and kits though i'll be

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.140 
the good badges and kits though i'll be
trying<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.860> sell<00:01:11.010> absolutely<00:01:11.580> everything<00:01:11.850> so

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
trying to sell absolutely everything so

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.310 
trying to sell absolutely everything so
i'm<00:01:12.240> going<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.570> split<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.140> i'll

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
i'm going to have to split up so i'll

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.719 
i'm going to have to split up so i'll
put<00:01:13.530> everything<00:01:13.799> straight<00:01:14.189> into<00:01:14.400> my<00:01:14.490> trade

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
put everything straight into my trade

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.910 
put everything straight into my trade
pass<00:01:14.909> try<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.479> sell<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.799> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
pass try and sell it on and if it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.410 
pass try and sell it on and if it
doesn't<00:01:17.220> sell<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.549> i'll<00:01:17.790> probably<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
doesn't sell on i'll probably have to

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.149 
doesn't sell on i'll probably have to
discard<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.439> hour<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.920> there<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.130> go

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
discard it in the hour so there we go

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.560 
discard it in the hour so there we go
that's<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.640> how<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:20.970> work<00:01:21.060> at

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
that's just how it's going to work at

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.749 
that's just how it's going to work at
the<00:01:21.750> end<00:01:21.869> i<00:01:22.140> will<00:01:22.290> obviously<00:01:22.920> show<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.430> how

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
the end i will obviously show you how

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.910 
the end i will obviously show you how
much<00:01:23.939> money<00:01:24.000> we<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.540> spent<00:01:24.780> how<00:01:25.409> much<00:01:25.590> money

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
much money we have spent how much money

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.490 
much money we have spent how much money
we've<00:01:26.220> got<00:01:26.250> back<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.049> that'll<00:01:28.049> be<00:01:28.140> basically

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
we've got back and that'll be basically

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.960 
we've got back and that'll be basically
be<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> end<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> episode<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.700> we'll<00:01:29.820> just

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
be the end of the episode and we'll just

we actually made back from our packs so
you<00:05:18.620> can<00:05:18.830> see<00:05:18.980> that<00:05:19.010> we<00:05:19.220> have<00:05:19.490> now<00:05:19.700> sold

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
everything from those packs we end up on

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.640 
everything from those packs we end up on
a<00:05:22.790> total<00:05:23.300> of<00:05:23.419> two<00:05:23.780> million<00:05:24.050> five<00:05:24.620> hundred

a total of two million five hundred

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.100 
a total of two million five hundred
thousand<00:05:25.430> four<00:05:25.850> hundred<00:05:25.880> and<00:05:26.360> fifty-three

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
thousand four hundred and fifty-three

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.800 
thousand four hundred and fifty-three
where<00:05:27.860> I<00:05:27.890> actually<00:05:28.160> started<00:05:28.760> the<00:05:29.150> episode<00:05:29.570> on

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
where I actually started the episode on

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.600 
where I actually started the episode on
two<00:05:30.290> million<00:05:30.680> five<00:05:31.130> hundred<00:05:31.160> forty<00:05:32.919> 4838<00:05:33.919> that

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
two million five hundred forty 4838 that

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.700 
two million five hundred forty 4838 that
means<00:05:34.850> that<00:05:34.970> we<00:05:35.270> have<00:05:35.300> actually<00:05:35.930> lost<00:05:36.260> from

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
means that we have actually lost from

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.890 
means that we have actually lost from
opening<00:05:37.130> those<00:05:37.340> 75<00:05:37.760> thousand<00:05:38.330> coins<00:05:38.450> worth<00:05:38.750> of

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
opening those 75 thousand coins worth of

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.500 
opening those 75 thousand coins worth of
packs<00:05:39.729> 44,000<00:05:41.350> 385<00:05:42.350> coins<00:05:42.770> so<00:05:43.430> on<00:05:43.669> average<00:05:44.060> we

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
packs 44,000 385 coins so on average we

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.670 
packs 44,000 385 coins so on average we
are<00:05:44.690> losing<00:05:46.450> 4439<00:05:47.450> coins<00:05:47.870> per<00:05:48.140> pack<00:05:48.440> and

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
are losing 4439 coins per pack and

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.890 
are losing 4439 coins per pack and
regaining<00:05:50.380> 3061<00:05:51.380> for<00:05:51.860> each<00:05:51.950> 7,500<00:05:52.760> coin<00:05:53.570> pack

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
regaining 3061 for each 7,500 coin pack

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.230 
regaining 3061 for each 7,500 coin pack
so<00:05:54.140> that<00:05:54.290> means<00:05:54.530> we're<00:05:54.710> actually<00:05:54.860> losing<00:05:55.370> more

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
so that means we're actually losing more

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.150 
so that means we're actually losing more
than<00:05:56.300> half<00:05:56.780> the<00:05:57.020> value<00:05:57.110> of<00:05:57.380> the<00:05:57.470> pack<00:05:57.680> every

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
than half the value of the pack every

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.130 
than half the value of the pack every
time<00:05:58.310> we<00:05:58.490> open<00:05:58.520> one<00:05:58.940> so<00:05:59.540> that's<00:05:59.810> the<00:05:59.990> average

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
time we open one so that's the average

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.409 
time we open one so that's the average
for<00:06:00.350> this<00:06:00.740> episode<00:06:01.280> obviously<00:06:02.120> what<00:06:02.330> we're

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
for this episode obviously what we're

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.060 
for this episode obviously what we're
going<00:06:02.540> to<00:06:02.660> do<00:06:02.780> is<00:06:02.870> do<00:06:03.020> it<00:06:03.050> again<00:06:03.470> and<00:06:03.710> again<00:06:03.830> and

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
going to do is do it again and again and

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.010 
going to do is do it again and again and
again<00:06:04.490> so<00:06:04.729> we<00:06:04.820> repeat<00:06:05.240> the<00:06:05.390> test<00:06:05.630> to<00:06:05.840> make<00:06:05.960> sure

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
again so we repeat the test to make sure

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.990 
again so we repeat the test to make sure
that<00:06:06.350> we<00:06:06.410> don't<00:06:06.590> have<00:06:06.860> any<00:06:07.010> variance<00:06:07.520> we're

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
that we don't have any variance we're

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.490 
that we don't have any variance we're
also<00:06:08.120> going<00:06:08.419> to<00:06:08.510> be<00:06:08.630> looking<00:06:08.870> out<00:06:08.990> for<00:06:09.320> you

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
also going to be looking out for you

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.710 
also going to be looking out for you
know<00:06:09.620> how<00:06:09.830> often<00:06:10.100> or<00:06:10.460> how<00:06:10.490> frequently<00:06:11.240> we<00:06:11.330> pull

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
know how often or how frequently we pull

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.060 
know how often or how frequently we pull
out<00:06:11.870> a<00:06:11.900> big<00:06:12.229> player<00:06:12.500> which<00:06:12.770> will<00:06:12.950> obviously

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
out a big player which will obviously

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.600 
out a big player which will obviously
change<00:06:13.550> the<00:06:14.210> amount<00:06:14.450> but<00:06:15.110> it<00:06:15.470> seems<00:06:16.010> that<00:06:16.370> from

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
change the amount but it seems that from

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.060 
change the amount but it seems that from
the<00:06:16.760> evidence<00:06:17.180> in<00:06:17.570> this<00:06:17.600> pack<00:06:18.169> opening<00:06:18.650> that

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
the evidence in this pack opening that

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.880 
the evidence in this pack opening that
if<00:06:19.250> you<00:06:19.490> want<00:06:19.729> to<00:06:19.940> make<00:06:20.150> your<00:06:20.870> money<00:06:21.140> back<00:06:21.380> just

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
if you want to make your money back just

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.469 
if you want to make your money back just
make<00:06:22.040> your<00:06:22.160> money<00:06:22.370> back<00:06:22.550> so<00:06:22.760> break<00:06:23.030> even

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
make your money back so break even

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.330 
make your money back so break even
you're<00:06:23.870> going<00:06:24.140> to<00:06:24.260> have<00:06:24.380> to<00:06:24.500> pull<00:06:24.710> out<00:06:24.979> of<00:06:25.070> all

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
you're going to have to pull out of all

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.000 
you're going to have to pull out of all
those<00:06:25.550> packs<00:06:25.910> one<00:06:26.690> player<00:06:27.020> that's<00:06:27.440> worth<00:06:27.650> more

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
those packs one player that's worth more

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.100 
those packs one player that's worth more
than<00:06:28.340> forty<00:06:28.729> four<00:06:28.940> thousand<00:06:29.419> coins<00:06:29.540> that

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
than forty four thousand coins that

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.839 
than forty four thousand coins that
seems<00:06:30.410> a<00:06:30.530> bit<00:06:30.560> unrealistic<00:06:31.160> at<00:06:31.490> this<00:06:31.610> stage<00:06:31.820> of

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:31.849 
seems a bit unrealistic at this stage of

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:33.700 
seems a bit unrealistic at this stage of
the<00:06:32.000> game<00:06:32.090> there<00:06:32.660> isn't<00:06:32.960> any<00:06:33.229> team<00:06:33.560> of<00:06:33.650> the

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
the game there isn't any team of the

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.110 
the game there isn't any team of the
