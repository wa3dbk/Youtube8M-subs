00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.910
 therefore I want to present today 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.120
 this cable 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.120
 exactly the same as that 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:13.539
 which is provided by the landi for 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.209
 the connection 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.240
 at the PC 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.240
 must control units like cars omegas plus 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.339
 lc 0 2 lc 0 1 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.399
 this is the connector located on the top of the machine 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:29.810
 near switchboard 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.280
 is the wiring that comes out. from the same 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.340
 using this cabbage 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.890
 gifted. of interface 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.300
 como 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.370
 there is the possibility of connecting 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.250
 to the control unit 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.510
 and to be able to make all the possible configurations 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.530
 that can be carried out 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.910
 to connect to the PC is necessary 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.360
 have it equipped 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.360
 i a door to como 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.230
 and if you are not 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.000
 possession of a pc with the door as needed 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.100
 get an adapter 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.299
 orestes vi 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.330
 como 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.340
 this adapter has the fundamental characteristic of having an inside 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.550
 city ​​of harry effects 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.070
 without this chip most likely the cable 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.160
 may not work 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.240
 as 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.210
 there is not 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.950
 a sufficiently powerful incipit 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.630
 for dialogue 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.820
 usually Chinese dogs 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.009
 they are not good 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.000
 they work sometimes yes sometimes not 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.280
 PC connection 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.190
 it happens this way 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.280
 on one side it connects 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.770
 the cable 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.770
 car bow ark 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.610
 via the connector present 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.470
 switchboard pool 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.470
 ah cabbage properly grafted 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.470
 on the box containing 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.960
 the interface 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.450
 this red bed lights up and indicates that the interface is 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.790
 correctly 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.459
 connected 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.079
 to the central na 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:12.949
 lpg 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:14.360
 at this point 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.949
 let's enter 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:19.319
 the adapter we already have 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.079
 connected to the output as a cable 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.409
 at the PC 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.950
 at this point they launch the landi renzo program 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.019
 as you can see this the main screen 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:37.349
 of the program 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.869
 at this point 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:40.609
 we're going to choose the menu 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.359
 connection 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.979
 the comment item 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.979
 at this point this screen will appear 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:52.329
 which indicates that it is reading the data of the control unit progressively 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:54.389
 as you see 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.239
 very simple mind program 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.769
 and here is 10 functions broken down 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.160
 indicative via the china f1 gp keys 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.280
 obviously reachable with the simple click of the mouse 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:11.759
 in the s1 for example 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:13.599
 we could go and see 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.789
 the settings of this car 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:19.789
 carburetion fuel type lpg 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.319
 or methane 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.829
 Here we set other settings like the displacement, the type of engine, the size 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:34.799
 the various features 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.949
 that these have 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:41.849
 as you can see below there are some parameters like for example 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.649
 the engine indication at this time would be fueled with petrol oh 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:47.909
 the values ​​of the lambda probe 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:51.379
 this time the engine is off 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.809
 doing again and on for example we will see in the display menu 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:00.349
 always by machine only, it turns off the number of engine revolutions 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:05.619
 if at this moment that is the signal signal if we see ourselves under petrol 

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:08.089
 or agip pls 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:10.129
 here too it is indicated 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.029
 the pressure in the boat 

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:13.199
 of the 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.799
 of the gpl 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.230
 as well as the water temperature 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.260
 in the tile literature 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.270
 people must start the engine 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.830
 we'll see 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.219
 such as 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:27.169
 in reality 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.729
 these parameters will be updated 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.729
 in real time 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:36.129
 photo we turned on the engine 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:39.509
 as you can see 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.680
 the engine revolutions are shown on the left side 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.779
 while on the right side 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:50.029
 we have the petrol injection time at this time the machine still 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.210
 gasoline and therefore does not give us the injection time 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.129
 to gpl 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.400
 also here if we go out from this menu we have the possibility to make the 

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.999
 diagnosis 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:04.209
 see for example all these various configurations 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.300
 tc milano what are the controls 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.580
 that are carried out by the control unit in the lower part of the original time 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.249
 machine operation 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:21.379
 to cassano the times in which lpg worked with the possibility of azerar these 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.659
 times and therefore virginar the control unit or we will have the possibility 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:30.879
 to clear the errors in the case in which, for example, I don't know about the multiplayer had not 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.309
 worked properly 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:36.699
 continuing. with this 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:41.419
 explanation we will have the possibility for example to carry out a calibration 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.289
 automatic ie the first time you install rim an installation or in the case in 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.009
 which I wanted walls I would say we can follow a simple one 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:54.610
 procedure that you start by pressing the enter key and that will allow us to compris 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.990
 simple steps to adjust 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.930
 in full automatic mode 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.219
 LPG carburation 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:04.749
 in this others 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:07.939
 oar screen possibility to change 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:11.150
 some features 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.979
 we will be able to save the current configuration if 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.219
 mentally, we wanted to save 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:21.339
 upload new configuration if we have it 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.150
 previously saved 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.240
 program the bu new ECU firmware if it was a 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.440
 update as you can see are available I want daily for both 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.990
 the 3 and 4 cylinders 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.990
 Italy films in the network today 8 cylinders 

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:40.699
 and finally the ski function 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.830
 as you can see the very simple program from available in 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.249
 many languages 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:49.400
 I hope I have been helpful I remind you that football though is a 

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:55.439
 non-original cable r is however perfectly compatible has none 

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:58.770
 kind of difference indeed of the features more like you 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.770
 identifies corrected him 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.830
 for connection to the control unit itself
