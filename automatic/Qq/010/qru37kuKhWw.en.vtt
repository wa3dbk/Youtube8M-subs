 add - bagheria via 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.310
 - badoo dating advice 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.130
 even if we are in front of a boat we are always in san di rimini not there 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.969
 we are lost there is a whole section dedicated to this equipment 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:32.099
 but the one that struck us most is this one leg here we have one 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.290
 of the owners, Mr. zanolli 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.240
 this is why this is a gunship in a whole series of 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.750
 particularity 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.810
 and I wanted to know which ones 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.800
 then this good morning to all and leave all this and exclusive sole leg 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.170
 it is a solar electric boat 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.790
 electric motor thermostat of a kilowatt the photo pushes 4 nights 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.540
 great of the 2 battery accumulators that together with the only 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.790
 photovoltaic guarantee 6 hours of autonomy approximately 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.300
 is 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.090
 this prototype entrem a bit early 2011 and extract data in 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.740
 politilene 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.170
 100% cycling pressure 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.219
 we are still a boat. much to sustainability 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.860
 motor beds with polluting and silent emissions 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.000
 the boat is completely recyclable you studied to move 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.530
 when moving do - unda possible asped above all protected areas e 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.580
 in the channels where there is this need 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.420
 pleasure 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.870
 god ruin the bottom of being possible voices here but that's that between 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.550
 the other I see that then this is a prototype 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.640
 it is a prototype that is still going into production and I see them then 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.500
 from the images he has has two possibilities of being used ie 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.310
 with this front fairing and then instead with practically arranged solar panels 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.510
 on the deck of the exact boat we say that the maximum yield has it with this or 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.950
 text 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.979
 produces 1354 100 vaults on the bridge 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.660
 if he has a chance lilac made parquet parquet decreases because it is the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.709
 panels are reduced one meter square meter falls however there is always the 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.529
 contribution of the photovoltaic system that supports it 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:22.760
 and when we will then see hype primina so many fashion on the water then 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.459
 we will make delivery smoothies 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.019
 center May June let's say 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.699
 we will be able to have a product on stintino 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:32.209
 congratulations and thanks again
