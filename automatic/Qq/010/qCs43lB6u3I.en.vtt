can<00:02:08.130> this<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:09.709> already<00:02:10.709> had<00:02:10.910> Donkey<00:02:11.910> Kong<00:02:12.209> 64

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
can this I already had Donkey Kong 64

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.340 
can this I already had Donkey Kong 64
pre-loaded<00:02:13.440> into<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.770> memory<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.989> does<00:02:16.170> take

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
pre-loaded into the memory it does take

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.610 
pre-loaded into the memory it does take
about<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.590> minute<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:17.100> load<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:18.290> games<00:02:19.290> off<00:02:19.470> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
about a minute to load the games off the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.470 
about a minute to load the games off the
cd-rom<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.160> think<00:02:20.520> these<00:02:20.640> cd-rom<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:21.270> there's

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
cd-rom I think these cd-rom in there's

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.500 
cd-rom I think these cd-rom in there's
maybe<00:02:22.080> like<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.290> 4<00:02:22.590> speed<00:02:22.770> or<00:02:23.160> something<00:02:24.030> very

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
maybe like a 4 speed or something very

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.990 
maybe like a 4 speed or something very
slow<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.890> I'm<00:02:25.980> gonna<00:02:26.100> see<00:02:26.280> if<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:26.489> upgrade<00:02:26.880> that

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
slow so I'm gonna see if I upgrade that

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.810 
slow so I'm gonna see if I upgrade that
to<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.239> DVD<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.140> see<00:02:28.920> if<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.190> works<00:02:29.400> if<00:02:29.610> not

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
to a DVD and see if that works if not

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.970 
to a DVD and see if that works if not
I'll<00:02:30.540> get<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.870> faster<00:02:31.650> cd-rom<00:02:32.160> in<00:02:32.340> there<00:02:32.600> but

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
I'll get a faster cd-rom in there but

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.940 
I'll get a faster cd-rom in there but
the<00:02:34.980> games<00:02:35.190> work<00:02:35.459> just<00:02:35.670> fine<00:02:36.170> as<00:02:37.170> if<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.709> had<00:02:37.920> a

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
the games work just fine as if you had a

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.310 
the games work just fine as if you had a
cartridge<00:02:38.340> in<00:02:38.519> there<00:02:38.760> there's<00:02:39.600> no<00:02:39.870> cartridge

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
cartridge in there there's no cartridge

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.890 
cartridge in there there's no cartridge
in<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.560> slot<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:41.100> like<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.850> said<00:02:42.060> before<00:02:42.450> like

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
in the slot and like I said before like

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.320 
in the slot and like I said before like
I<00:02:43.410> showed<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.739> before<00:02:43.860> it's<00:02:44.280> um<00:02:44.580> actually
