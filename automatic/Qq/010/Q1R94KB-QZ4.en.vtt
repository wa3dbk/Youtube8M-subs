probably him in the knee because of the
all<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.390> legs<00:00:24.600> because<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.410> drop<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.800> the

hardcore<00:00:30.960> mode<00:00:31.109> using<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> expert<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.279> i<00:00:32.579> was

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
hardcore mode using the expert and i was

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.639 
hardcore mode using the expert and i was
using<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.149> balance<00:00:33.660> bolt<00:00:33.930> with<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.230> one<00:00:34.500> they

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
using the balance bolt with the one they

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.549 
using the balance bolt with the one they
are<00:00:34.770> not<00:00:34.950> where<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.670> have<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.940> unlock<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.559> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
are not where you have to unlock the the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.959 
are not where you have to unlock the the
assignment<00:00:37.980> we<00:00:38.040> have<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.610> sniper

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
assignment we have to do the sniper

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.630 
assignment we have to do the sniper
rifle<00:00:39.450> challenges<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.280> another<00:00:41.280> one<00:00:41.460> like

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
rifle challenges and another one like

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.750 
rifle challenges and another one like
I'm<00:00:41.820> exactly<00:00:42.450> what<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:43.219> but<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.370> balance

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
I'm exactly what it is but the balance

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.420 
I'm exactly what it is but the balance
bolt<00:00:44.969> really<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.570> good<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.950> hardcore<00:00:47.370> mode

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
bolt really is good in in hardcore mode

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.950 
bolt really is good in in hardcore mode
because<00:00:47.760> obviously<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.420> balance<00:00:48.719> bolt

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
because obviously the balance bolt

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.770 
because obviously the balance bolt
doesn't<00:00:49.590> actually<00:00:49.980> dip<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:50.789> much<00:00:51.000> as<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
doesn't actually dip as much as the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.340 
doesn't actually dip as much as the
explosive<00:00:52.530> dart<00:00:52.829> or<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.850> actual<00:00:54.750> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
explosive dart or the the actual you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.110 
explosive dart or the the actual you
know<00:00:55.469> regular<00:00:55.890> default<00:00:56.520> bolt<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.940> get

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
know regular default bolt that you get

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.869 
know regular default bolt that you get
with<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> expo<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.649> I'm<00:00:59.160> using<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.550> here<00:00:59.699> and

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
with the expo and I'm using it here and

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.549 
with the expo and I'm using it here and
as<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.300> see<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.570> soon<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.020> loaded<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
as you can see as soon as I loaded the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.039 
as you can see as soon as I loaded the
dart<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.190> crossbow<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:03.030> right<00:01:03.660> here

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
dart in the crossbow you see right here

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.200 
dart in the crossbow you see right here
it's<00:01:04.860> got<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.100> red<00:01:05.369> tip<00:01:06.260> so<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
it's got a red tip so the the the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.480 
it's got a red tip so the the the
explosive<00:01:09.750> dart<00:01:09.990> has<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.560> yellow<00:01:10.860> tip<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
explosive dart has the yellow tip the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.380 
explosive dart has the yellow tip the
balance<00:01:12.180> bolt<00:01:12.570> has<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.700> red<00:01:14.700> tip<00:01:14.970> which<00:01:15.270> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
balance bolt has the red tip which I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.219 
balance bolt has the red tip which I
thought<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.689> would<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:15.869> been<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> other<00:01:16.080> way

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
thought it would have been the other way

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.710 
thought it would have been the other way
around<00:01:16.259> surely<00:01:16.920> explosive<00:01:17.610> equals<00:01:18.150> read<00:01:18.479> in

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
around surely explosive equals read in

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.230 
around surely explosive equals read in
some<00:01:18.960> people's<00:01:19.380> minds<00:01:19.619> who<00:01:19.860> knows<00:01:20.060> but<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
some people's minds who knows but the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.050 
some people's minds who knows but the
the<00:01:21.540> what<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.900> balance<00:01:22.200> pot<00:01:22.380> does<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.220> it

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the what the balance pot does is that it

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.499 
the what the balance pot does is that it
doesn't<00:01:24.750> lose<00:01:25.369> it<00:01:26.369> doesn't<00:01:26.640> drop<00:01:26.880> anywhere

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
doesn't lose it doesn't drop anywhere

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.330 
doesn't lose it doesn't drop anywhere
near<00:01:27.750> as<00:01:27.930> much<00:01:28.140> as<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> first<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.860> box<00:01:29.100> the

near as much as the first to box the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.450 
near as much as the first to box the
unlock<00:01:29.750> so<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:31.140> really<00:01:31.350> am<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:32.340> can

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
it as you can see in this streak here

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.640 
it as you can see in this streak here
especially<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.570> hardcore<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.259> really

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
especially in hardcore it's really

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.370 
especially in hardcore it's really
really<00:01:37.890> good<00:01:37.920> fun<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.340> use<00:01:38.840> whereas<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.350> know

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
really good fun to use whereas you know

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.950 
really good fun to use whereas you know
in<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.100> regular<00:01:41.520> game<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.720> know<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.899> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
in the regular game you know in the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.990 
in the regular game you know in the
regular<00:01:43.259> game<00:01:43.409> modes<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.920> found<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.700> quite

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
regular game modes I found it quite

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.499 
regular game modes I found it quite
frustrating<00:01:46.159> because<00:01:47.159> first<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.210> all<00:01:48.360> it's

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
frustrating because first of all it's

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.969 
frustrating because first of all it's
not<00:01:48.720> always<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.049> one-shot<00:01:49.439> kill<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.770> got<00:01:49.920> to

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
to pull off the first kill with it but

to<00:02:15.990> use<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.800> definitely<00:02:17.160> takes<00:02:17.340> some<00:02:17.400> getting

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
to use it definitely takes some getting
