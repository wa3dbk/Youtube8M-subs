and<00:06:02.920> if<00:06:03.250> I<00:06:03.370> open<00:06:03.550> up<00:06:03.610> my<00:06:03.670> task<00:06:03.940> manager<00:06:04.770> should

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
and if I open up my task manager should

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.260 
and if I open up my task manager should
be<00:06:05.830> I<00:06:05.890> see<00:06:06.160> that<00:06:06.310> the<00:06:06.400> Omega<00:06:06.610> spread<00:06:06.970> is<00:06:07.090> not

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
be I see that the Omega spread is not

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.110 
be I see that the Omega spread is not
using<00:06:07.750> a<00:06:07.960> shit-ton<00:06:08.590> it<00:06:09.460> uses<00:06:09.850> a<00:06:09.910> bit<00:06:10.090> of

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
using a shit-ton it uses a bit of

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.290 
using a shit-ton it uses a bit of
resources<00:06:10.450> I<00:06:10.930> mean<00:06:11.740> I'm<00:06:11.890> not<00:06:11.980> gonna<00:06:12.130> lie<00:06:12.300> but

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
resources I mean I'm not gonna lie but

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.760 
resources I mean I'm not gonna lie but
it<00:06:13.840> uses<00:06:14.260> a<00:06:14.410> lot<00:06:14.650> less<00:06:14.710> than<00:06:15.130> it<00:06:15.250> should<00:06:15.570> so<00:06:16.770> I

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
it uses a lot less than it should so I

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.460 
it uses a lot less than it should so I
can<00:06:17.920> uncheck<00:06:18.280> this<00:06:18.490> and<00:06:18.870> stop<00:06:19.870> it<00:06:20.020> and<00:06:20.260> start

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
can uncheck this and stop it and start

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.100 
can uncheck this and stop it and start
it<00:06:20.590> again<00:06:20.790> as<00:06:21.790> you<00:06:22.000> can<00:06:22.030> see<00:06:22.300> it<00:06:22.390> spread<00:06:22.750> a<00:06:22.780> link

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
it again as you can see it spread a link

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.280 
it again as you can see it spread a link
in<00:06:23.380> the<00:06:23.830> time<00:06:24.040> that<00:06:24.070> I<00:06:24.370> was<00:06:24.490> doing<00:06:24.610> that<00:06:25.290> so

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
in the time that I was doing that so

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.620 
in the time that I was doing that so
let's<00:06:26.410> start<00:06:26.680> it<00:06:26.770> again

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
let's start it again

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:33.810 
let's start it again
just<00:06:28.630> give<00:06:28.750> it<00:06:28.840> a<00:06:28.900> second<00:06:29.290> it<00:06:29.350> should<00:06:29.440> show<00:06:29.650> it

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.560 

or<00:06:34.420> not<00:06:34.660> if<00:06:35.440> that's<00:06:35.620> the<00:06:35.800> case<00:06:35.950> I<00:06:36.340> think<00:06:36.820> I<00:06:37.360> have
