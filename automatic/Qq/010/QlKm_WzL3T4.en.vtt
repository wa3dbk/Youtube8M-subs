you<00:02:07.849> might<00:02:08.030> think<00:02:08.239> but<00:02:08.750> put<00:02:09.739> some<00:02:09.920> spinach<00:02:10.310> in

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.170 

I've<00:02:14.480> got<00:02:14.690> this<00:02:14.840> idea<00:02:15.110> from<00:02:16.510> Matt<00:02:17.510> ogus<00:02:17.690> I

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
I've got this idea from Matt ogus I

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.740 
I've got this idea from Matt ogus I
thought<00:02:20.180> he<00:02:20.329> was<00:02:20.450> crazy<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:21.049> tried<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.750> the

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
thought he was crazy I tried it and the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.780 
thought he was crazy I tried it and the
favor<00:02:23.989> of<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.170> protein<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.890> oats<00:02:25.160> it

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
favor of the protein and the oats it

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.710 
favor of the protein and the oats it
masks<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.450> flavor<00:02:26.540> of<00:02:27.970> of<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.180> spinach<00:02:29.540> and

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
masks the flavor of of the spinach and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.449 
masks the flavor of of the spinach and
so<00:02:30.560> basically<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:30.920> get<00:02:31.010> in<00:02:31.129> one<00:02:31.160> of<00:02:31.310> your

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
so basically you get in one of your

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.699 
so basically you get in one of your
five-a-day<00:02:31.959> straight<00:02:32.959> away<00:02:33.170> in<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.379> morning

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
five-a-day straight away in the morning

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:43.270 
five-a-day straight away in the morning
now<00:02:34.700> fill<00:02:35.209> that<00:02:35.359> with<00:02:35.510> water

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.130 

I<00:02:44.170> say<00:02:45.170> fill<00:02:45.410> that<00:02:45.530> up<00:02:45.650> with<00:02:45.830> water<00:02:47.140> probably

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
I say fill that up with water probably

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:57.600 
I say fill that up with water probably
to<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.770> first<00:02:49.280> line<00:02:49.610> there<00:02:52.930> put<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.020> on<00:02:54.140> here
