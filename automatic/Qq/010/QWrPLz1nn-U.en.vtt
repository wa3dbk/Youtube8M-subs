00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 yes here he is again I'm up here 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.800
 The map tank rally quite funny 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:16.010
 history all now have here in 24 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:19.500
 cities sports gets bansa rally yes 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.369
 all opponents to shove or the gap 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.850
 conquer circle 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.590
 that it is just a wild heated so here 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.910
 not at all for the Balkans 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.149
 we have so I would say something like that 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.920
 like Mario Kart, however, Mario Kart 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.920
 I have not played myself yet 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:44.159
 I only think so 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:48.229
 right while automatic targeting 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.229
 pure and always on the opponent 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.520
 then you can during the ride 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.910
 also a bit of damage when 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.910
 cause opponents 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.710
 whether st 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:17.750
 yes I think it is very important that you 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:20.020
 we receive automatic targeting 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.020
 at times 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.700
 Allied with the enemy team has me 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.700
 in automatic targeting in it 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.670
 I believe in it and who is there before 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.479
 with total shoots we will be too 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.479
 take a fire 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.560
 but 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.240
 not that the whole time 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.240
 hopefully soon 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.640
 not through 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:07.930
 I'm the last one here in things 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:12.900
 times author but we are already to 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.900
 I hope capcom 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.850
 greater 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.989
 every hit on the opponent before we 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.989
 were point, it is not wrong 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.880
 yes, even if few grenades go wrong 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.610
 without automatic targeting here 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.130
 I would have no chance for that 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.240
 I am officially glad that I inherit the 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.240
 stay on the track 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.880
 no matter 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:29.930
 after all, we have it now 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.930
 already three man in a circle like here 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.610
 and there we stuck and finished 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.700
 conquered that worked wonderfully 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.130
 this is my second victory with 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.170
 racer 2014 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.470
 you have also turned up where I am here 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.550
 always lost a whopping 403 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.880
 damage points made 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:17.829
 we come to the evaluation of 30 shots 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.720
 delivered 13 hits 18 effective hits 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.550
 that will be for me too 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.229
 three hits receive two 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.260
 Effective strike unit not 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.419
 do not break through 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.139
 repelled by armor and 50 years on 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:35.750
 Allied 24 always well with this 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:40.880
 Wild hunting can already happen there 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.600
 3 against a deck so what is great 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.889
 but anyway 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.490
 two opponents damaged 23 here 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:52.460
 defense points driven route 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:55.180
 4100 meters yes that's enough for me 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.950
 four to five fight the track 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.880
 flat rate reward for a 5000 victory 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:07.310
 Credit points then becomes ammunition 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:10.460
 replenished and so remain 4970 credit 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.289
 about flat rate reward for order 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:17.450
 here are always 1000 graduation 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:20.360
 points of experience that go to the 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.740
 crew the crew keeps you that 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.060
 You get a vehicle someday 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:28.460
 taken away and I'll say in just 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.190
 Tables hunt here so this is not 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.570
 from time to time something like gimmick 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:37.669
 Buemi, yes, but an entire game 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.490
 make it that year after year 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.960
 only this mode drives that would be 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.979
 nothing for burkhard who needs one 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:48.050
 bit of slowness stops away 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:51.850
 take a walk and not just a wild one 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:57.050
 hunting, of course, makes it fun 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:57.990
 and it is only believable 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.580
 thought 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.670
 it's okay if you can 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:06.390
 something every 12 months bring times 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.860
 remove it and then it should also here 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:11.370
 have been with me 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:14.060
 I myself am not a big friend of 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.830
 but there are many who like it 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.140
 and graphically with the exploding ones 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:23.370
 Of course it is also barrels and tanks 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.750
 a little eye-catcher yes what should I 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.070
 tell great fame here 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.790
 I'll just say good bye yours 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.790
 burkhard
