 means again it is written electronics means 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.210
 again without track numbers probed 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:23.090
 this is our soft ergonomic rowers 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:28.789

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.789

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.379
 do you want the package without track numbers come 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:46.500

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:52.129
 gripes so glad let's open let's see 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:56.390
 ordinary ergonomic handles me not 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.390
 metal Tatars 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:07.110
 try to ride so here are the pens 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:12.500
 then you can see very soft compressed 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:16.680
 pressed rubber nice to hand 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.670
 metal-to-metal clamped under the bolts 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.570
 hexagon 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.800
 in two sides with this and this side 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:31.710
 so here is grooved ahead 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:36.690

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:59.360
 Now we unpack it and see the handle 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:02.069

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.090
 fingers under the pillow is very cool 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:10.080

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.979

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.979
