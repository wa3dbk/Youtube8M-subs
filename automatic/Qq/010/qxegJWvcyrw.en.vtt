00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:11.340
 take and conquer the European market and 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:14.309
 by all means trying to change attitudes 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.279
 buyers to what they do they 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.840
 took and absolutely not worried about what 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.330
 people will think later how the design has changed 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.050
 packaging and not only packaging but also 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.850
 gadgets company for i. took and 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:36.149
 released a gadget called nubia z5 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.110
 Here in such a composite box 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.239
 it comes in a transparent case 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.360

 charger plug and charger itself 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.390

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.180
 parts of the box she who is no longer

 transparent there is such a device 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.340
 I would say that it is of course new to 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.710
 Chinese 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.570

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.610
 there were some such sane 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.890
 metal frame outlines but I would 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.770
 said that this is very similar to what 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.920
 did htc company with its previous 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.340
 by generation especially look here on 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.820
 the camera bezel is red however 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.960
 this is nice this is a very lightweight gadget 126 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.790
 grams five inch ips display with 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.829

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.590
 regret no slot for expansion 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:07.960
 memory using micro sd cards to 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.099
 Unfortunately, but there is a port below 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.940
 microusb 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.860
 on the left side there is such a wide regulator 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.860
 volume, which is also not bad before it 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.690

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.340

 megapixels say not only saying yes 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.989
 I and myself now looked at the camera 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.489

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:55.269

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.750
 what are the rules of the third 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.299
 quite an interesting interface which 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.970
 It will help those who may not yet be 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.319

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.959

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.700
 Shooting can be made in addition it

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.800
 even before you can already buy in Russian

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.390
 Well, considering the fact that here is quite a 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.760
 flagship characteristics are quite here 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.080
 the characteristics of this year those 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.400
 gadgets that are now on the market 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.860
 for example xperia 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.290
 sony xperia z galaxy s4 which nac 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.970
 wolves 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.270
 but it's pretty competitive price 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.140
 and competitive design I would 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.880
 he said only that of course who 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.570

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.010
 more promoted brands 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.360
 This is of course the problem of the Chinese in 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.000
 the rest of the gadget is pretty good 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.520

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.980
 milliampere hour is also an average of 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.799
 hospital 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.299
 not bad well I hope that the Chinese have something 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.340

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.090

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.750
 long ago it took place and took almost completely 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.730
 starts they move too and somehow 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.919

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.610
 little bit and will share the progress 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.460
 soon because all that 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.960
 Now do bison let's say this 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:53.140
 produces devices with a larger diagonal 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.140
 So it goes
