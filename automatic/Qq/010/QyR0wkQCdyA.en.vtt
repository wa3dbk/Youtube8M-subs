00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
how do you see this one girl start you

how do you see this one girl start you
Kristen<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:09.030> think<00:00:09.870> Rotherham<00:00:10.230> could<00:00:10.440> take

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
Kristen I think Rotherham could take

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.370 
Kristen I think Rotherham could take
this<00:00:10.710> one<00:00:11.120> probably<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.480> think<00:00:12.809> under<00:00:13.019> fancied

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
this one probably I think under fancied

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.200 
this one probably I think under fancied
but<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:13.889> just<00:00:14.099> like<00:00:14.219> Kieran<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.639> guard<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:14.969> just

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
but I just like Kieran a guard I just

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.420 
but I just like Kieran a guard I just
think<00:00:15.389> he's<00:00:15.660> got<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.080> much<00:00:16.260> potential<00:00:17.220> there

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
think he's got so much potential there

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.150 
think he's got so much potential there
as<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.420> young<00:00:18.690> guy<00:00:18.810> who<00:00:18.869> started<00:00:19.680> at<00:00:19.800> Everton

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
as a young guy who started at Everton

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.769 
as a young guy who started at Everton
had<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.430> drop<00:00:20.580> down<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.480> lower<00:00:21.630> leagues

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
had to drop down to the lower leagues

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.290 
had to drop down to the lower leagues
with<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.140> oval<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:23.400> think<00:00:23.640> his<00:00:23.910> season

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
with the oval and I think his season

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.790 
with the oval and I think his season
will<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:24.630> continue<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.080> grow<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.350> this

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
will just continue to grow in this

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.769 
will just continue to grow in this
playoff<00:00:26.130> run<00:00:26.220> both<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.119> matches<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
playoff run both the matches in the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
regular season ended in draws so said to

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.600 
regular season ended in draws so said to
be<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> tight<00:00:30.840> one<00:00:30.869> isn't<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.470> think<00:00:32.399> so

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
be a tight one isn't it I think so

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.910 
be a tight one isn't it I think so
rather<00:00:33.059> am<00:00:33.300> one<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.230> those<00:00:34.350> clubs<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.860> have

rather am one of those clubs that have

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.400 
rather am one of those clubs that have

that<00:01:42.390> right<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.990> right<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.259> was<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.500> long<00:01:43.649> time

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
that right and right I was a long time

that right and right I was a long time
ago<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.670> was<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> long<00:01:45.360> long<00:01:45.630> time<00:01:45.899> ago

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620

a<00:01:49.410> long<00:01:49.650> time<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:49.920> think<00:01:50.130> he's<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> good<00:01:50.880> bloke

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
a long time I think he's a good bloke

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.910 
a long time I think he's a good bloke
and<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.540> hope<00:01:51.960> he<00:01:52.080> does<00:01:52.230> well<00:01:52.260> don't<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.770> to

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
and I hope he does well don't have to

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.380 
and I hope he does well don't have to
convince<00:01:53.130> not<00:01:53.400> in<00:01:53.520> as<00:01:53.640> well<00:01:53.760> I<00:01:53.820> didn't

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
convince not in as well I didn't

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.270 
convince not in as well I didn't
challenge<00:01:54.600> yeah<00:01:54.990> as<00:01:55.290> well<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:55.830> no<00:01:55.980> I<00:01:56.010> think<00:01:56.130> I

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
challenge yeah as well but no I think I

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.530 
challenge yeah as well but no I think I
think<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.580> should<00:01:56.730> be<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> cracking<00:01:57.390> going

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
think I should be a cracking going

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.430 
think I should be a cracking going
really<00:01:57.630> looking<00:01:57.870> forward<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.080> seeing<00:01:58.260> them

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
really looking forward to seeing them

schools<00:02:02.160> talking<00:02:02.370> about<00:02:02.460> bigger<00:02:02.880> clubs<00:02:03.240> and

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
schools talking about bigger clubs and

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.990 
schools talking about bigger clubs and
rather<00:02:04.800> and<00:02:05.010> could<00:02:05.160> be<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> me<00:02:05.430> Preston<00:02:05.850> or<00:02:05.970> a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
rather and could be I me Preston or a

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.730 
rather and could be I me Preston or a
massive<00:02:06.330> club<00:02:06.540> hmm<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.170> know<00:02:07.290> they<00:02:07.410> should<00:02:07.620> be

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
massive club hmm you know they should be

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.130 
massive club hmm you know they should be
at<00:02:07.860> least<00:02:08.010> a<00:02:08.310> division<00:02:08.670> above<00:02:09.540> and<00:02:09.720> i<00:02:09.780> think<00:02:10.050> i

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
at least a division above and i think i

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.870 
at least a division above and i think i
think<00:02:10.260> the<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.619> pressure<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.370> probably<00:02:11.700> on

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
think the the pressure is probably on

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.370 
think the the pressure is probably on
there<00:02:12.060> being<00:02:12.210> the<00:02:12.360> bigger<00:02:12.540> side<00:02:12.780> but<00:02:13.020> i<00:02:13.050> think

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
there being the bigger side but i think

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.380 
there being the bigger side but i think
you<00:02:13.950> know<00:02:13.980> there<00:02:14.250> i<00:02:14.280> think<00:02:14.430> their<00:02:14.730> seventh<00:02:15.120> in

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
you know there i think their seventh in

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.890 
you know there i think their seventh in
the<00:02:16.580> indie<00:02:17.580> form<00:02:17.850> table<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.480> rather<00:02:18.630> on<00:02:18.840> i

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
the indie form table and rather on i

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.330 
the indie form table and rather on i
think<00:02:18.960> of<00:02:19.140> 15<00:02:19.500> suppress<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.070> i<00:02:20.100> think<00:02:20.280> a

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
think of 15 suppress and i think a

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.610 
think of 15 suppress and i think a
little<00:02:20.520> bit<00:02:20.670> more<00:02:20.850> momentum<00:02:21.510> going<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.530> to

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
little bit more momentum going in to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.080 
little bit more momentum going in to
talk<00:02:22.740> about<00:02:22.890> momentum<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.490> lot<00:02:23.640> in<00:02:23.730> playoffs

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
talk about momentum a lot in playoffs

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.760 
talk about momentum a lot in playoffs
