of character you want to create for

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.600

most affected by the laws in this

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.570 
most affected by the laws in this
dystopian<00:03:36.150> world<00:03:36.420> are<00:03:37.170> children<00:03:37.799> children

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
dystopian world are children children

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.220 
dystopian world are children children
they<00:03:38.700> have<00:03:38.880> to<00:03:39.060> go<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.390> fight<00:03:39.660> in<00:03:39.989> The<00:03:40.110> Hunger

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.979 
they have to go and fight in The Hunger
Games<00:03:40.459> so<00:03:41.459> if<00:03:41.640> your<00:03:41.910> character<00:03:42.390> was<00:03:42.540> in<00:03:42.780> that

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
Games so if your character was in that

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.750 
Games so if your character was in that
age<00:03:43.200> group<00:03:43.530> where<00:03:43.769> they<00:03:43.920> could<00:03:44.160> be<00:03:44.310> sent<00:03:44.580> to

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
age group where they could be sent to

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.030 
age group where they could be sent to
fight<00:03:45.200> they're<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.350> ones<00:03:46.530> who<00:03:46.680> are<00:03:46.709> going<00:03:46.920> to

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
fight they're the ones who are going to

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.060 
fight they're the ones who are going to
be<00:03:47.190> most<00:03:47.430> affected<00:03:48.470> so<00:03:49.470> think<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:49.860> character

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
be most affected so think of a character

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.500 
be most affected so think of a character
to<00:03:50.459> go<00:03:50.640> in<00:03:50.760> your<00:03:50.910> setting

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
to go in your setting

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.400 
to go in your setting
now<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:52.500> third<00:03:52.769> thing<00:03:53.040> was<00:03:53.190> conflict

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
now that third thing was conflict

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.840 
now that third thing was conflict
obviously<00:03:55.410> you<00:03:55.500> have<00:03:55.769> a<00:03:55.799> lot<00:03:55.920> of<00:03:56.100> conflict<00:03:56.700> in

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
obviously you have a lot of conflict in

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.060 
obviously you have a lot of conflict in
this<00:03:57.000> world<00:03:57.330> you<00:03:57.810> need<00:03:58.080> to<00:03:58.230> survive<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.980> and

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
this world you need to survive it and

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.729 
this world you need to survive it and
it's<00:03:59.370> very<00:03:59.610> difficult<00:03:59.910> but<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:00.989> can<00:04:01.019> add<00:04:01.410> more

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
it's very difficult but you can add more

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.340 
it's very difficult but you can add more
conflict<00:04:02.360> don't<00:04:03.360> just<00:04:03.690> make<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.170> the

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
conflict don't just make it the
