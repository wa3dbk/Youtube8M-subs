millimetres if I'm not mistaken the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.050 
millimetres if I'm not mistaken the
length<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.019> four<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.410> half<00:00:28.470> inches<00:00:29.060> they

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
length is four and a half inches they

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.759

they dive three to five feet and they
are<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.770> suspending<00:00:35.840> variety<00:00:36.840> which<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.469> don't

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
are the suspending variety which I don't

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.799 
are the suspending variety which I don't
think<00:00:37.649> they<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:38.149> others<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.480> rainbow

anyway these are both boasting their
their<00:01:34.940> weight<00:01:35.940> transfer<00:01:36.540> balance<00:01:37.170> system

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
their weight transfer balance system

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.920 
their weight transfer balance system
whatever<00:01:37.950> they<00:01:38.100> call<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.509> meaning<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.540> when

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
whatever they call it meaning that when

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.380 
whatever they call it meaning that when
you<00:01:40.250> when<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.340> cast<00:01:41.580> them<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.060> makes<00:01:42.210> them

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
you when you cast them and makes them

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.889 
you when you cast them and makes them
the<00:01:42.990> weight<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.950> steel<00:01:44.520> or<00:01:44.910> tungsten<00:01:45.270> ball

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
the weight the steel or tungsten ball

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.740 
the weight the steel or tungsten ball
bearing<00:01:46.200> that's<00:01:46.289> in<00:01:46.500> them<00:01:46.679> is<00:01:47.300> full<00:01:48.300> word<00:01:48.509> so

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
bearing that's in them is full word so

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.560 
bearing that's in them is full word so
when<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.990> dive<00:01:49.200> when<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.710> goes<00:01:49.890> diving<00:01:50.160> down

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
when you dive when it goes diving down

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.090 
when you dive when it goes diving down
the<00:01:51.570> weight<00:01:51.840> falls<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.410> forward<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:52.979> this

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the weight falls and forward in this

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.859 
the weight falls and forward in this
chamber<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:55.460> it<00:01:56.460> sits<00:01:57.119> right<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.479> here<00:01:57.690> and<00:01:57.780> it

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
chamber and it sits right in here and it

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.540 
chamber and it sits right in here and it
makes<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.170> sit<00:01:58.410> forward<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> water<00:01:59.280> and

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
makes it sit forward in the water and

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.389 
makes it sit forward in the water and
then<00:01:59.820> when<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.149> reel<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:00.929> and<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.560> sits<00:02:02.159> up

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
then when you reel it in and it sits up

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.969 
then when you reel it in and it sits up
you<00:02:03.240> can<00:02:03.390> hear<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.690> bearing<00:02:04.289> inside<00:02:04.740> there

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
you can hear that bearing inside there

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.160 
you can hear that bearing inside there
fall<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.000> rear<00:02:06.179> part<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.570> chamber<00:02:06.960> and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
fall to the rear part of the chamber and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.840 
fall to the rear part of the chamber and
it<00:02:07.470> just<00:02:07.649> helps<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.009> cast<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.519> it<00:02:08.550> doesn't

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
it just helps it cast so it doesn't

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.890 
it just helps it cast so it doesn't
helicopter<00:02:09.360> out<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:10.790> know<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.300> RAM<00:02:12.660> does

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
helicopter out I know that the RAM does

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.630 
helicopter out I know that the RAM does
have<00:02:13.110> something<00:02:13.380> similar<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.459> X

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
have something similar to that the X

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.530 
have something similar to that the X
wraps<00:02:14.910> here<00:02:15.920> but<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.670> me<00:02:17.790> I've<00:02:17.940> had<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.150> little

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
wraps here but to me I've had a little

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.610 
wraps here but to me I've had a little
bit<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.840> problem<00:02:19.019> it's<00:02:19.290> not<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.440> deal

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
bit of a problem it's not a deal

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.560 
bit of a problem it's not a deal
deal-breaker<00:02:20.250> but<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.940> seems<00:02:21.299> like<00:02:21.450> you

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
deal-breaker but it seems like you

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.270 
deal-breaker but it seems like you
almost<00:02:21.720> gotta<00:02:22.019> kind<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.410> shake<00:02:22.709> it<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:23.040> get<00:02:23.190> it

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
almost gotta kind of shake it to get it

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.490 
almost gotta kind of shake it to get it
to<00:02:23.400> go<00:02:23.579> to<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.209> rear<00:02:24.390> part<00:02:24.660> right<00:02:25.019> before<00:02:25.260> you

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
to go to the rear part right before you

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.819 
to go to the rear part right before you
cast<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.070> it<00:02:26.370> goes<00:02:26.790> goes<00:02:27.329> forward<00:02:27.810> but<00:02:27.989> you

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
cast it so it goes goes forward but you

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.259 
cast it so it goes goes forward but you
almost<00:02:29.010> got<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.280> kind<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.519> shake<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.150> get

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
almost got to kind of shake it to get

review<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.810> did<00:02:33.930> on<00:02:34.410> this<00:02:34.950> bomber<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:36.690> can<00:02:36.840> see

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
review I did on this bomber you can see

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.990 
review I did on this bomber you can see
the<00:02:37.140> balls<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.500> are<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.680> here<00:02:38.010> but<00:02:38.910> it

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
the balls that are in here but it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.780 
the balls that are in here but it
doesn't<00:02:39.239> have<00:02:39.329> a<00:02:39.390> chamber<00:02:39.660> inside<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.350> so

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
doesn't have a chamber inside of it so

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.420 
doesn't have a chamber inside of it so
the<00:02:41.790> cast<00:02:42.060> ability<00:02:42.660> may<00:02:43.350> not<00:02:43.530> be<00:02:43.709> as<00:02:43.920> good<00:02:44.220> with

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
the cast ability may not be as good with

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.840 
the cast ability may not be as good with
this<00:02:44.730> guy<00:02:45.030> as<00:02:45.360> with<00:02:45.780> these<00:02:45.959> guys<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:47.250> still
