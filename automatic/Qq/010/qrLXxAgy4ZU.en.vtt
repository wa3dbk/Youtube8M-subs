00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.260
 Dear friends leewards 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:13.869
 Was 25 years old 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:16.869
 and first grew up in Munich 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.679
 That's the first time in my life I have been to see 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.179
 he had 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.429
 Swabian 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.429
 and percent 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.910
 Diana was Mitchell 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.910
 too short 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.840
 in all directions 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.510
 and as 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.970
 so it's one 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.560
 Picture was 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.560
 had the microscope 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.000
 few minutes later, the second bank already used reports 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.740
 This alone shows the age of the Banks had begun 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.610
 that was earlier 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.560
 80 years ago 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.200
 in Munich 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.200
 I would too 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.820
 two years later 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.400
 with Kaufhof, for example, smoking in Essen 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.530
 the mannequins look exactly like collectors 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.410
 beautiful 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.210
 and pretty 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.210
 now at my bank not about action 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.730
 Deputy construction branch manager 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.740
 is also a fact 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.740
 yes so prepare yourself on the bench 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.240
 around the world 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.079
 and there are fans everywhere now when politics in the bakery 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.370
 Finalists were over left Banks 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.010
 Women and Schmidt Ellwanger 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.009
 Of course there are again 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:17.129
 a whole new kind of Padang 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.129
 it is that 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:24.699
 more about other programs 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.849
 I do not care about her 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.209
 the swans October from love 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.509
 that's percent 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:36.509
 but he too 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.699
 Micheal Jackson is not a pop I think 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.409
 also turn off Barak said Neumann 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.269
 for example 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.269
 the straitjacket bank school desk 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:01.109
 percent 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.229
 and in England where they mostly used the word was the point 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:07.209
 was that different b 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.359
 so would 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.229
 the Russian is 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:14.229
 the rule 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.739
 that is here 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.849
 impressed for me 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.849
 in Paris in the bad 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:26.899
 Obama 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:29.049
