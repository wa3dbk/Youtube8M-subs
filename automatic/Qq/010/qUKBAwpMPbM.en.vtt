00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:08.230
 Hi everyone, it's about to leave the ghost mine from now 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:11.440
 It's a slow Reimu or something I missed my self-introduction last time 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:15.429
 So I 'll say it right here and slowly Marisa 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:19.240
 But it slowly franc was missing greeting of the previous Marisa Speaking 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.060
 It's sudden and bad, but hook shots are quite useful, aren't they ? 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.590
 Certainly quite 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.340
 Even if it is too long, it will not wear too long 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.660
 I guess 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:33.470
 I Well then a little before I I hope because only receive damage equipment from broken Well 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:38.360
 It was not a bit, but I think thanks to this equipment 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.050
 Certainly I think that it would have been quite tough for this defense mine if there were no extendable equipment 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.180
 After all protective gear is important 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:49.829
 Finally of armor it because I think I was dead in it Well much attack Uke' Panashi If it were not for armor 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.340
 It is the guy I made the marking of this diamond a long time ago when I understood the importance 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.059
 The 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:59.370
 I would not take it now, but did not come to me 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.040
 It can not be helped also to not be taken diamond I neither need to come to the twilight Well in the recording table to it 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.520
 Just because 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:08.290
 I would not have noticed that there was a ghost mine at that time 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.980
 We were too careful at that time, but I think not too much 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.040
 But 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.550
 I think the limelight was the crown of head me that ghost alpine 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.990
 And it was dark and it was hard to see from the outside 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:25.150
 Well, I didn't mean I was not careful enough , it was good 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.440
 When I'm searching for some attention, I use it with care but it won't change so much 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.780
 I think it's about 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:35.570
 Hey Kke frayed or damaged Nante crow to Speaking twilight Toka when looking for a crow after twilight 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:40.520
 In other words, I can not make a map for jaundice without crows 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:44.510
 That's why it's essential for sloppy or dusky, but it may be that if you say it 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:49.130
 I didn't even notice at all I think everyone is solid 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.170
 I'm sorry I thought I 'm sorry but I thought there is a freeger hammer and I don't have one in my hand 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.560
 I think it's good 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:59.369
 Because if you push it by mistake, you don't have to be Bokan, but if there is something important 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:03.630
 Because it do Ja not there Datte likely to disappear become collateral 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:08.520
 Freeger Hummer I thought it would be better not to have it in my hand 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:13.050
 I was wondering if I had a hand in hand and I was in the inventory 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.550
 I was consistent with what Reimu was saying, but I wonder if that's not it 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:20.170
 I thought I'm sorry Oochochochoi me 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.760
 If so, I'm pretty scared, but I 'm sure Reimu is too busy, but there 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.500
 Isn't it not bad? 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:31.540
 But Well certainly that so because I think that there was no such a thing actually up here 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.840
 If it is something that seems to be really true and it can not be helped, it will smell like a flag. 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.580
 Oh dear 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.060
 As for the result , I had already done a magma dive a little while ago but I did not receive any damage at all 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.230
 Ne 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.010
 Now I know that I'm getting more and more happy with my protective gear . 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.160
 Is not there 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:50.680
 That's because I knew the goodness of the armor 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.860
 But to fine us I have Toka I quite frequently repair but I think that thanks to the armor 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.510
 So rough in 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.550
 I don't think I'm using it , but I guess it's because the reason I'm repairing it often is broken 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.020
 But it's kind of that kind of thing 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:09.560
 If it were to be repaired naturally it would have been weird 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:11.850
 If I in the grammar issues that I myself may not Ayaman separately ze I was sorry I had thought 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.590
 Well then, because there are three beacons next time 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.370
 Shall we make a nine- rail gun? Oh , I think it would be super strong if it was an ordinary super-electromagnetic gun 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.700
 Right 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:26.190
 Certainly the power of that was certainly about 74 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.720
 And because it can hit it in bursts, it 's super strong , so I can hit it in bursts I 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.840
 I didn't even know 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:35.530
 Oh yes I can't hit it in a row at the stage of the prototype super gun, though 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.849
 If you use an ordinary super electromagnetic gun from there , you will be able to hit it in a row. 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:44.379
 Well I know for the first time but what is the material to do that 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:47.019
 Well I know that I need a trial railgun, but in addition to the trial super gun 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.790
 I need 8 Nether Stars 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:54.140
 So I guess that pretty difficult to make well 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:59.060
 So the cost is there, et al around I've got a thing I not a balance collapse without collapse 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:02.719
 It was good, because if it breaks down, it will no longer really work as a movie. 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:07.340
 I think it doesn't mean that it will not be viable as a movie, though 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:09.780
 Ze I is understood that by Marv Tsu not certainly videos'm not collapse 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.260
 I think it will be finished early as it becomes a spotlight Nurge 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:18.060
 Well I wanted to say that kind of thing 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.190
 As expected, franc is quick to interpret, but it is such a trial railgun was made 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.680
 But what do you do from now on 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:29.800
 Now is not I'm talking about you were was Once Yasen Toka ne Well evening But I think good night depends now 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:35.169
 Would n't it be like you would go to the twilight again? 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.090
 And I feel that before or say eggs or why just now came back over here in the world was found in the 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.539
 I do, but why? 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:44.949
 I Ah things like that you did not know simply look now Yea 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:49.790
 I also understood that I was relieved with such a good daily thing 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:53.930
 That's why the word ending is sometimes strange that's why I 'm going to the dusk next time 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:59.300
 So has entered the twilight for what I we also say gold 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:04.280
 As I said, I defeated the crows and got some feathers for jaundice. 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.730
 I guess that's what it is like to make a map and go on an adventure 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.090
 It is 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.300
 I'm feeling that that was found barely purpose of coming to the twilight 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.479
 Oh dear 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.900
 I'm talking about what will be the adventure 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:19.159
 That's why I think it's okay either way 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:23.659
 I still want to see the franc as it is not to make it a video clip 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:26.750
 Well I think that's fine with that, but is it okay to have some energy? 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:28.320
 I don't know well but I think it's almost like that 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.970
 I would like to eat it 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:37.290
 Even so , it's not quite crows but crows spawn near the obsidian tower 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:41.310
 Because it's a talk to do, I think it's impossible to find it first 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:44.850
 It's not obsidian when it comes to this or anything 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:48.310
 It is a solid brick no matter how it is added if I add it further 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:52.030
 I still did not finish 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:58.060
 Hook shot is useful but I also said in the beginning of the video 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:06:03.160
 I'm certain that the range is clear, I think it's true, I guess it's absolutely true 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:05.140
 Something really Gas I'm reaching farther than I thought large still likes this pretty 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.300
 It looks like a version that doesn't enter 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:12.229
 It was no Oh I see examples array of and say, Are' 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:16.639
 It's too difficult, but I can remember all these things 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:17.420
 Tsu was not a whole world why other things are yet'm have forgotten this kind of the I 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:22.160
 Follow 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.970
 I say if it is a thing I read such a mon such of whether Rutte Well that is, remember what not a previous work 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.190
 But 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:33.620
 Do'm wondering now I mean Is the so ambiguous looking have of not it is not found even if alternative 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:37.409
 The tower of obsidian seems to be quite colored , and the appearance rate seems low. 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:41.729
 Sokontoko what about kana is I wonder even now told Sokontoko and 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:46.229
 I can't meet and can only say to the Meiji Tower I wonder if I will go to the Meiji Tower from now 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:50.639
 Certainly is told rich but I think it was the location I the boss here if something millionaire of 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:54.119
 There is only an image , but I think it is not a location like that 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:57.430
 Besides , I think that rich lives in a slightly more luxurious house 

00:06:54.119 --> 00:07:02.380
 I say Marisa, but because it is a tower here, head Oshiro 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:04.780
 I've been told you a minute- I do not know why I said it now but now 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:08.560
 It's not a word to tell me 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:14.290
 I 've been to the end of the day and I've been in a riot 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:17.420
 The first time out the location that you What library or example to sober to I'm sorry that I softening Meiji tower's okay 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:20.780
 It's just a good story if you don't care 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:24.860
 I think it doesn't really matter 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:30.230
 But after all I think it would be awkward to live in real condition 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:31.340
 Well certainly everywhere around but it becomes painful to the play-by-play basis is somehow in our talk skills 

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:36.650
 I should do it 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.830
 Need Are not only for the story to be this I goods recovered Is'm wondering now whether say 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.660
 The 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:42.320
 Cormorant I guess is what was I to become the story if Re live with far not matter how goods recovered p 

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.820
 The Lord 

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:49.850
 Oh no, it 's easy to damage us only the ticket 

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:54.530
 I'm mob I've been wondering I Is not What of vanilla 

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:56.820
 It's certainly not in the middle, but I have a ranged weapon, so that might be the case. 

00:07:54.530 --> 00:08:02.100
 So this time and ended here, et al sides Ko' 

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:04.190
 It's pretty bad in the middle of Kana Meiji Tower , but then thank you for watching 

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.190
 The
