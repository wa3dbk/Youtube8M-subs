this<00:00:22.429> rod<00:00:23.449> realign<00:00:24.449> together<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.679> I<00:00:25.769> like<00:00:26.039> to

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
this rod realign together and I like to

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.759 
this rod realign together and I like to
for<00:00:26.759> you<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.910> touch<00:00:27.810> on<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.169> from<00:00:28.349> two<00:00:28.560> angles

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.390 
for you to touch on this from two angles
one<00:00:29.460> what's<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.060> optimum<00:00:30.810> combination<00:00:31.589> and

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
one what's the optimum combination and

second question you know the biggest
mistake<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.260> finesse<00:00:46.500> fishing<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.130> think

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
mistake and finesse fishing is I think

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.580 
mistake and finesse fishing is I think
most<00:00:48.030> people<00:00:48.240> assume<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.990> if<00:00:49.350> you're

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
most people assume that if you're

rods that I use in my finesse fishing
you<00:01:07.680> know<00:01:07.800> in<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> first<00:01:08.220> one<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.810> what

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
you know in the first one is is is what

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.740 
you know in the first one is is is what
I<00:01:10.140> call<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.410> jig<00:01:10.770> head<00:01:10.800> rod<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> rod

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
I call a jig head rod and this is a rod

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.260 
I call a jig head rod and this is a rod
that<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.140> use<00:01:13.410> for<00:01:14.160> any<00:01:14.370> application<00:01:15.240> that's

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
that I use for any application that's

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.770 
that I use for any application that's
got<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.930> single<00:01:16.890> hook<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> shaky<00:01:18.570> head

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
got a single hook like like a shaky head

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.680 
got a single hook like like a shaky head
like<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> mushroom<00:01:19.890> head<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.550> flick<00:01:21.420> shake

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
like a mushroom head like a flick shake

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.140 
like a mushroom head like a flick shake
head<00:01:21.870> with<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> big<00:01:22.770> single<00:01:23.310> hook<00:01:23.520> you

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
head with with a big single hook you

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.300 
head with with a big single hook you
know<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.300> shaky<00:01:24.659> heads<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.990> finesse<00:01:25.260> bait<00:01:25.530> but

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
know a shaky heads a finesse bait but

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.280 
know a shaky heads a finesse bait but
just<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.760> Texas<00:01:27.240> rig<00:01:27.450> worm<00:01:27.690> fishing<00:01:28.140> you've

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
just like Texas rig worm fishing you've

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.130 
just like Texas rig worm fishing you've
got<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.680> drive<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.130> hook<00:01:29.280> home<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.120> I<00:01:30.510> want

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
got to drive the hook home so I want

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.610 
got to drive the hook home so I want
raaah<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.830> a<00:01:31.860> 60/40<00:01:32.760> mix<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.900> like<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> six

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
raaah with a 60/40 mix and I like a six

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.410 
raaah with a 60/40 mix and I like a six
six<00:01:34.830> rod<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> lot<00:01:35.370> of<00:01:35.490> people<00:01:35.700> say<00:01:35.850> why<00:01:36.150> do<00:01:36.210> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
six rod a lot of people say why do you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.750 
six rod a lot of people say why do you
use<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.050> six<00:01:37.350> six<00:01:37.590> rod<00:01:37.830> for<00:01:38.100> shaky<00:01:38.430> heading

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
use the six six rod for shaky heading

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.450 
use the six six rod for shaky heading
first<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.659> seven<00:01:40.050> foot<00:01:40.320> or<00:01:40.530> even<00:01:40.860> longer<00:01:41.130> and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
first is a seven foot or even longer and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.000 
first is a seven foot or even longer and
and<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.390> answer<00:01:42.690> simple<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.380> shorter<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
and the answer simple the shorter the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.820 
and the answer simple the shorter the
rod<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:45.330> less<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.960> move<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.350> bank<00:01:46.560> or<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
rod the less you move the bank or the

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.590 
rod the less you move the bank or the
slower<00:01:47.190> you<00:01:47.430> move<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.700> bait<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.180> forces

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
slower you move the bait so it forces

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.510 
slower you move the bait so it forces
you<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.840> slow<00:01:49.020> down<00:01:49.140> if<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.860> think<00:01:50.100> about<00:01:50.370> if

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
you to slow down if you think about if

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.710 
you to slow down if you think about if
you<00:01:50.610> throw<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.970> worm<00:01:51.180> out<00:01:51.390> there<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.630> you've

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
you throw that worm out there and you've

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.230 
you throw that worm out there and you've
got<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.930> rod<00:01:52.200> that's<00:01:52.440> seven<00:01:52.830> six<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.400> you<00:01:53.940> pull

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
got a rod that's seven six and you pull

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.289 
got a rod that's seven six and you pull
from<00:01:54.600> from<00:01:55.110> three<00:01:55.440> o'clock<00:01:55.740> up<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.190> 12<00:01:56.490> you're

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
from from three o'clock up to 12 you're

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.600 
from from three o'clock up to 12 you're
moving<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.750> lot<00:01:57.930> more<00:01:58.110> line<00:01:58.409> than<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.460> you're

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
moving a lot more line than if you're

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.370 
moving a lot more line than if you're
using<00:01:59.760> a<00:01:59.970> six<00:02:00.210> six<00:02:00.360> rod<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:00.780> force<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.170> slow

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
using a six six rod so force to slow

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.160 
using a six six rod so force to slow
down<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.590> little<00:02:01.799> bit<00:02:02.010> my<00:02:02.640> second<00:02:03.090> rod<00:02:03.270> climbing
