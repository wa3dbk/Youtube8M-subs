00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.466
- I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TEXTING
TODAY.

00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.666
I ASSUME YOU ALL TEXT.

00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.633
HOW MANY--YOU ALL TEXT, RIGHT?
PEOPLE TEXT?

00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:06.633
[cheers and applause]

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:07.766
ONE PERSON?

00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:08.800
WELL, I'LL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.966
IT'S A THING ON A PHONE.

00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.533
UH, AND WHEN YOU TEXT,

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.733
THERE ARE THESE THINGS
CALLED EMOJIS WHEN YOU TEXT.

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.133
YOU KNOW, THESE EMOJIS THINGS?

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.900
OKAY, EMOJIS,
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE?

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.233
NO.
OKAY.

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:23.066
I'M GONNA HELP YOU
THE ENTIRE TIME, MA'AM.

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.400
THEY'RE LITTLE ICONS,
AND WHAT THEY ARE--

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.866
THEY'RE PICTURES
OF DIFFERENT THINGS

00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.966
TO SHOW YOU, LIKE,
HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.533
INSTEAD OF JUST TYPING
A SENTENCE,

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.366
YOU'D SAY, LIKE, "I'M AT
'THE ELLEN SHOW' RIGHT NOW.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.500
SMILEY FACE."

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.066
SO THAT THEY KNOW,
"OH, I'M HAPPY."

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.766
YOU KNOW, OR "I JUST WALKED
INTO A TELEPHONE POLE

00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:37.766
"WHILE I'M TEXTING.

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.066
SAD FACE," YOU KNOW?

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.966
PEOPLE HAVE TO SHOW EMOTION,
'CAUSE WE'RE TEXTING SO MUCH,

00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.666
WE DON'T KNOW,
"WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?"

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.166
SO--LIKE,
BACK IN THE OLDEN DAYS,

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.166
LIKE IN 2005, YOU'D MAKE FACES

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.333
WITH, LIKE, A PARENTHESIS
AND A COLON,

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.666
AND, YOU KNOW, IT TOOK FOREVER.

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.766
AND SO THEN THEY MADE
THIS WHOLE MENU

00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.133
WHERE THERE'S PICTURES

00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.466
AND YOU CAN JUST CLICK ON
AND YOU CAN JUST CHOOSE.

00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:02.533
AND THIS IS ONE PAGE OF FACES
JUST TO CHOOSE FROM RIGHT HERE.

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.000
THIS IS A RANGE OF EMOTION.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.733
I CALL THIS
THE MERYL STREEP PAGE.

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.133
[laughter]

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.600
THERE'S SO MUCH EMOTION HERE

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.933
THAT YOU CAN SHOW PEOPLE
HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:16.366
THIS GUY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT HERE.

00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.600
THAT'S LIKE--DID HE TASTE
SOMETHING BAD?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.666
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOUR MOUTH
EVEN DOES THAT.

00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.800
YOU CAN TRY TO--
I'VE BEEN TRYING ALL DAY

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.266
TO MAKE MY MOUTH...

00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:28.700
[laughter]

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.200
ANYWAY, THAT'S WHY THAT'S THERE:

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.300
'CAUSE WE CAN'T DO IT OURSELVES.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.833
BUT IT'S NOT JUST FACES ANYMORE.

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:37.466
THERE'S ANOTHER PAGE
OF JUST ANIMALS RIGHT HERE.

00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:39.733
THERE'S A SNAKE,
AND THERE'S CHICKENS

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:44.433
AND LADYBUGS
AND TROPICAL FISH DOWN HERE.

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:46.366
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:47.400
WHY WOULD YOU NEED A--

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.533
"SEE YOU IN 20 MINUTES,
TROPICAL FISH."

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.466
LIKE...

00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:52.833
WHY WOULD YOU NEED A TROPICAL--

00:01:52.833 --> 00:01:54.433
THE WHOLE BOTTOM ROW
IS BASICALLY

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:56.433
MY TATTOOS ON MY BACK.

00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:58.000
[laughter]

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.600
I THINK AT LEAST THIS PAGE,
IT'S--

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.600
THE LEAST USEFUL PAGE
IS THIS ONE RIGHT HERE.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.600
I MEAN, LETTERS AND MAILBOXES?

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.833
NO ONE EVEN USES MAIL ANYMORE.

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:10.900
AND LOOK AT THE GRAPHS
RIGHT DOWN HERE,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.766
LIKE WE USE MATH OR SOMETHING.

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:14.233
THAT'S CRAZY.

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:16.166
WE'RE TOO BUSY
PLAYING "CANDY CRUSH."

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:17.800
AND IN THE MIDDLE
OF ALL THE MAILBOXES,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.333
THERE'S A FRENCH HORN
FOR NO REASON.

00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:22.500
[laughter]

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.833
WHAT'S THAT DOING THERE?

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:25.466
WHAT EMOTION IS THAT?

00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:28.100
HOW CAN YOU FEEL HORN--
NEVER MIND. OKAY.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.200
[laughter]

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.666
I GOT IT.
I FIGURED IT OUT.

00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:33.600
I JUST--

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.933
AND THEN THERE'S THIS PAGE
RIGHT HERE,

00:02:35.933 --> 00:02:38.966
AND THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
DANCING,

00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:41.266
BUT LOOK AT THESE GIRLS
UP HERE ON--

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:43.333
IT LOOKS LIKE THE TWINS
FROM "THE SHINING."

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:46.000
[laughter]

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.500
ACTUALLY, I USE THAT ONE
ALL THE TIME,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.833
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHAT PORTIA AND I WEAR

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:50.233
WHEN WE DANCE TOGETHER AT HOME.
