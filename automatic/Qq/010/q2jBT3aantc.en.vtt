00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
okay the third example triplets - six

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.180 
okay the third example triplets - six
dates<00:00:09.570> all<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.290> these<00:00:10.469> beats<00:00:10.710> are<00:00:10.889> going<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.099> be

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
dates all of these beats are going to be

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.070
