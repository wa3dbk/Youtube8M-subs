00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.960
 don't be surprised this channel is about oxford 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:10.160
 but today we will be speaking out 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.360
 ancient greek city Chersonesos 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.110
 which is now part 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.079
 Sevastopol but here we had a chance here 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.490
 turn up today I will be a little 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:22.400
 reddish shades but that's not because 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.880
 I burned out, or even something as simple as 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.029
 it is now a sunset theme that I would like 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.279
 light up learning english in 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.710
 particular as I personally taught 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.050
 english to be 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.320
 in court my situation is very 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.590
 non-standard and I don't think anyone 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.110
 still she can repeat because i 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.600
 didn't speak english perfectly then 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.900
 there is literally I could not even support 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.540
 phrase or even explain anything 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.000
 to ask how to get somewhere and the 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.980
 more understand how to get somewhere mine 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.190
 learning English began 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.710
 when i moved to ireland and it was there 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.080
 I was not there already 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.240
 how to learn English in another way 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.730
 language i was completely social 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.350
 isolated nobody was talking to me 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.530
 Well, of course I could not support 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.780
 conversation and I had to start teaching him 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.930
 I had to learn a language quickly and 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.360
 intense literally every day and need 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.590
 say i didn't use for this 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.290
 any textbooks i used 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.350
 English program it is called 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.990
 english discovery is absolutely ancient 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.210
 but very comfortable there is used 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.360
 first a little theory all on 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.460
 English and explanation of tasks all but 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.360
 starts from a very primitive level 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.420
 then it gets more complicated in that 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.820
 course there is a theory and then 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.830
 practice which manifests itself in food and 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.590
 audio lessons video lessons and some 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.320
 tests I said that efficiency 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.150
 absolutely awesome when 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.630
 such interactive is used here 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.019
 course 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.060
 and then literally here going to the store 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.630
 right after class you should use 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.320
 these words are the momentum about 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.300
 villa in reality that is there mastering 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.150
 the material goes just colossal 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.880
 the pace and in principle I would all 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.940
 recommended that no tutorials 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:33.020
 no lessons will replace the real 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.990
 communicating in English so if 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.400
 you want to really learn a language and 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.890
 easy to communicate on it 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.980
 will definitely need to go to 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.630
 English speaking country and in that sense 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.120
 by the way I would recommend by no means 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.430
 case not england because she is very 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.460
 dear there is a wonderful country 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.770
 ireland which is near and i would 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.200
 scary on worth well maybe 3 times 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:03.200
 cheaper I did a preliminary calculation 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:06.140
 and according to rough estimates having about a thousand 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.390
 euro you can go to ireland to the city 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.090
 limerick to local 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.520
 language center as much as a whole month 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.640
 this money principle should be enough for 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.320
 training on food well grandfather said that 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.050
 this sum principle is available it seems to me 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.820
 student that is, he may well 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.420
 to accumulate the same amount once some 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.150
 part-time work for the year so that in the summer on 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.300
 month go to ireland it will be 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:39.980
 interesting it will be very informative 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:43.190
 and new culture new country new 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.490
 Irish climate is very very interesting 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.280
 very friendly very open I don't want 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.100
 make it seem like an advertisement but I 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.500
 lived in this country for three years and I can 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.640
 say i liked it a lot 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.560
 all except for the climate there is very 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.530
 a lot of rain but if you're lucky with 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.010
 the weather will just make an impression 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.950
 incredible of course here to study 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.970
 language important system well you just need 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.670
 learn vocabulary typeset of course 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.140
 regularly also definitely but many 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.890
 say need to watch movies on 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.490
 English 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.800
 need maybe just know in 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.080
 Internet radio station to find 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.800
 English speaking 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.569
 don't just listen to her and slowly here 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.599
 if you study simultaneously 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:38.710
 words rule you gradually by a little bit 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:41.259
 start to understand what they are talking about what 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.680
 sing songs and it's so very interesting 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:46.810
 the process he himself happened to me here 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.379
 live in principle with a large enough 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:54.819
 speed when i lived in ireland but it 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:57.750
 it was interesting to say so when you live in 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:05:00.930
 2 in the English language environment 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:05.139
 the process of learning English he 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:09.190
 very specific first you think on 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:12.190
 Russian and little by little every word 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:17.830
 every phrase you are trying to translate to 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:20.680
 English then with time when you have 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:24.189
 in biysk it gets better and better you 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.919
 start to understand that you are not thinking 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:31.930
 what language do you think wild 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:34.560
 images and then here for these images you 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.870
 can snatch say either 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.960
 linguistic structures from Russian 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:44.250
 either from english but what 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:48.400
 interesting then as language 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.919
 getting better and better i started 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.539
 understand that I'm just some moments 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:55.000
 too, and began to think not images 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:58.360
 and here on anything in English I 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.259
 I think either in Russian in general such here 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.110
 metamorphosis 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:04.650
 maybe you too will be something 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.659
 like watching by the way how would 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.039
 I have not studied intensively the language he has from me 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:12.190
 all the same 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:14.569
 Well, it was given with great difficulty to me 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.710
 seems like penchant for languages 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:20.419
 but an interesting thing happened after 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.209
 half a year training in Irish 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:24.020
 graduate school I was just told that go 

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:26.869
 teach 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:30.469
 I tell them how can you see it 

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:34.129
 i'm generally not ready enough 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:38.689
 but in terms of language so that they do not 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:41.119
 Well, the guy is burning, and you have had half a year, we 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:43.879
 they give you a head start and you as we did 

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:47.029
 doesn't concern these you taught at all i 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:47.839
 went to teach this study 

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:51.199
 English 

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:53.899
 I smoked more probably several times 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:56.659
 that harsh reality children need everything 

00:06:53.899 --> 00:07:00.080
 helps suck language learning 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:02.719
 if you want to learn more about something new 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.839
 tom how to get into oxford like people
