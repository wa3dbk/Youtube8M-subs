00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.889
 hi here I wanted to introduce you the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.580
 way that I found to make a 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.350
 efficient tracking with the gopro 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.619
 regardless of the soil that sometimes can 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.119
 to be in the forest for example chaotic for 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.000
 these I will first introduce you 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.010
 the material prerequisites first for 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.869
 start you need the girl alone 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.030
 as far as I'm concerned I managed to 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.130
 to have her son coils she who 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.130
 represents about 100 m 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.930
 the second major element of your 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.210
 zip line is this piece that is 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.719
 feasible for a budget quite 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.789
 modest since the casters that are 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.090
 return pulleys cost only 1 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.010
 euro 50 pieces the rail is easily 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.960
 recoverable from the moment it 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.600
 is pierced at the places you have 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.309
 need and fixing of go pro is everything 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.619
 simply a case fixation is that 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.180
 I reuse in Persian 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.340
 to note we can also do it with a 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.460
 fixation which is not just a c that's 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.049
 we can simply set the rhein 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.930
 the implementation it is very simple 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.189
 you just have to fix our rope a 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.290
 point to another 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.500
 remote from the length of your son 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.659
 she is thus roll out the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.420
 zip line on this rope with the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.000
 camera fixed above as you can 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.850
 see downhill use is very 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.960
 easy just let go of the zip line 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.549
 and the camera goes down on its own for a 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.850
 use on flat ground 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.850
 two options if you are alone attached 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.500
 the zipline to your body she will you 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.770
 will follow as and when your 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.670
 evolution 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.719
 if you asked for the help of an accomplice to 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.000
 using a fishing rod 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:58.810
 it can pull effect on the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.130
 zip line you can also note that 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.649
 the use of the fishing rod can 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.020
 to be very useful creepy to do 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.659
 back up the camera and so be able to 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.220
 to make several shots here are you 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.230
 know everything so now what I 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.230
 offers some images of the rendering
