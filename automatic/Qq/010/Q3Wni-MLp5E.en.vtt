moving only 3 to 5 inches the mess and

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.700 
moving only 3 to 5 inches the mess and
the<00:01:36.180> heaviest<00:01:36.630> spot<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.229> head<00:01:37.439> up<00:01:37.560> a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
the heaviest spot is you head up a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.289 
the heaviest spot is you head up a
little<00:01:38.100> bit<00:01:38.310> farther<00:01:38.579> out<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> west<00:01:39.180> look
