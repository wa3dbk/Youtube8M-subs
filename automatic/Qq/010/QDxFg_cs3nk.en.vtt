00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:10.070
 here today we have an iphone 5 16 gb 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:13.170
 everyone knows about ios 6.1 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.809
 which is also the latest version of the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.359
 means on the current condition 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.369
 we were trying today in the pesto too 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.779
 that means we want to go 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.400
 the important things access that is 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.070
 contacts we want the others 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.880
 watch injured yes voicemail 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:34.170
 listen and so on we follow mist 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.610
 first of all a few things in the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.649
 order to commit that means once 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.860
 emergency call 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:44.100
 yes that was a small park of that 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.360
 iphone still on distress then one 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.550
 call emergency number 110 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.079
 that is, the 112 is short, for example 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.030
 call again hang up 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.640
 Now you have to go to the top once 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.070
 standby button is pressed again killed 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.890
 bring it back then very easy 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.960
 no part is necessary to relax 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.480
 very important that means he does not want it 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.150
 somehow rushing or something 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.820
 Now you have to go three or four 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.260
 for seconds, press the power switch 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.360
 and then during the emergency call 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.590
 click on switch 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.140
 but all the time on the power button 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.790
 it can not stay on it 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.470
 works when it works 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.159
 the whole again from the beginning 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.799
 to repeat 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.720
 that means know first on emergency 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:32.570
 then call the 112 hang up in the 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:38.850
 Standby mode unlock back 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:44.210
 123 call not once again too 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:48.149
 Emergency calls are the 112 call hang up 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:54.750
 stand was unlock a standby out 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:55.560
 and the current 123 emergency call still has 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.100
 not quite worked out 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:08.009
 Try a fourth time to see if 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:10.259
 it now works like this 1234 and that 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.380
 topic because he is that we are here right now 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.540
 just in favorites so far 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.430

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.470
 now in the phone moser adds bar is 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.690

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.070
 Here you can see the favorites then 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.490
 go now once in the caller list 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.710

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.780

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.350
 also completely edit completely 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.420
 importantly, the phone number does not have to be 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.680
 a lot if you do not have sim card and 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.700
