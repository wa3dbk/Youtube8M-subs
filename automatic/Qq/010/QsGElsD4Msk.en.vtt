today we are going to be constructing a
little<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.950> guess<00:00:25.950> you<00:00:26.070> could<00:00:26.130> say<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.370> mob<00:00:26.670> trap

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.030 
little I guess you could say a mob trap

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.380 
little I guess you could say a mob trap
that<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.720> saw<00:00:28.590> one<00:00:28.860> of<00:00:28.950> my<00:00:29.100> friends<00:00:29.910> fulltext

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
that I saw one of my friends fulltext

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.160 
that I saw one of my friends fulltext
build<00:00:31.050> today<00:00:31.350> or<00:00:32.310> recently<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.090> i<00:00:33.960> thought

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
build today or recently and i thought

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.350 
build today or recently and i thought
i'd<00:00:34.350> share<00:00:34.530> with<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.800> guys<00:00:34.830> I<00:00:35.360> can

incorporate a little bit of red stone
but<00:00:38.040> mostly<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:38.970> just<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:40.170> pretty<00:00:40.559> cool<00:00:41.489> thing

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
but mostly it's just a pretty cool thing

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.820 
but mostly it's just a pretty cool thing
that<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.180> could<00:00:42.300> do<00:00:42.450> with<00:00:42.660> your<00:00:42.780> house<00:00:42.930> it

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
that you could do with your house it

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.070 
that you could do with your house it
actually<00:00:44.010> doesn't<00:00:44.489> require<00:00:45.090> redstone<00:00:45.870> though

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
actually doesn't require redstone though

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.490 
actually doesn't require redstone though
redstone<00:00:46.500> doesn't<00:00:46.830> make<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> lot<00:00:47.220> more

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
redstone doesn't make it a lot more

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.180 
redstone doesn't make it a lot more
convenient<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.890> use<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.950> does<00:00:52.950> require

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
convenient to use so it does require

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.220 
convenient to use so it does require
making<00:00:53.790> a<00:00:53.880> house<00:00:54.060> it's<00:00:54.420> kind<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.720> a<00:00:54.900> house

do is just make a glass house so that we

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:16.090 
do is just make a glass house so that we
have<00:01:08.160> maximum<00:01:10.610> vision<00:01:12.979> say<00:01:13.979> huh<00:01:14.580> I'd<00:01:15.420> say<00:01:15.630> four

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
have maximum vision say huh I'd say four

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
I'm using a tool called voxel editor

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:35.240 
I'm using a tool called voxel editor
oops<00:01:25.380> ah<00:01:29.060> wait<00:01:31.310> okay<00:01:32.990> but<00:01:33.990> yeah<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.410> tool<00:01:34.800> is

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
oops ah wait okay but yeah this tool is

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.320 
oops ah wait okay but yeah this tool is
called<00:01:35.640> voxel<00:01:36.240> editor<00:01:36.509> very<00:01:37.850> useful<00:01:38.850> tool<00:01:39.060> if

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
called voxel editor very useful tool if

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.660 
called voxel editor very useful tool if
you<00:01:39.539> haven't<00:01:40.440> even<00:01:40.500> noticed<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.280> much<00:01:41.459> you<00:01:41.550> can

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
you haven't even noticed so much you can

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.520 
you haven't even noticed so much you can
do<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.970> all<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.810> buildings<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.289> see<00:01:43.319> in

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.699 
do with it all the buildings you see in
the<00:01:43.590> background<00:01:43.880> they're<00:01:44.880> all<00:01:45.590> thanks<00:01:46.590> to

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
the background they're all thanks to

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:48.380 
the background they're all thanks to
voxel<00:01:47.130> editor<00:01:47.429> otherwise<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.970> would<00:01:48.060> take<00:01:48.240> me

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
voxel editor otherwise it would take me

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.760 
voxel editor otherwise it would take me
forever<00:01:48.690> to<00:01:49.580> do<00:01:51.679> so<00:01:52.679> 20<00:01:53.550> that<00:01:53.789> would<00:01:53.910> be<00:01:54.000> glass

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
forever to do so 20 that would be glass

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.980 
forever to do so 20 that would be glass
go<00:01:55.770> back<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.369> our<00:01:57.020> perch<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:59.780> this<00:02:00.780> time

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
go back up to our perch and this time

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.410 
go back up to our perch and this time
I'll<00:02:01.170> remember<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.679> change<00:02:02.429> the<00:02:02.819> brush<00:02:03.679> to

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
I'll remember to change the brush to

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.279 
I'll remember to change the brush to
Knoxville<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:07.130> what<00:02:08.130> we're<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.459> do<00:02:09.289> is

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
Knoxville and what we're going to do is

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.600 
Knoxville and what we're going to do is
lock<00:02:10.979> down<00:02:11.310> some<00:02:11.340> glass<00:02:11.910> here<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:13.610> pretty

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
lock down some glass here and pretty

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.740 
lock down some glass here and pretty
much<00:02:14.700> we're<00:02:15.000> going<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.180> make<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.300> big<00:02:15.510> glass

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
much we're going to make a big glass

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.530 
much we're going to make a big glass
house<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.380> we're<00:02:17.190> going<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.340> use<00:02:17.550> this<00:02:17.910> to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
house and we're going to use this to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.370 
house and we're going to use this to
then<00:02:19.440> put<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.870> book<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.500> little<00:02:23.400> trap<00:02:23.730> in

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
then put the book the little trap in

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.780 
then put the book the little trap in
that<00:02:25.380> way

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.250 

you<00:02:29.790> have<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.000> very<00:02:30.269> good<00:02:30.450> demonstration<00:02:30.750> as

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
you have a very good demonstration as

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.160 
you have a very good demonstration as
opposed<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:31.709> building<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.580> wall<00:02:33.140> got<00:02:34.140> a

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
opposed to just building a wall got a

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.280 
opposed to just building a wall got a
10-second<00:02:34.860> little<00:02:35.099> Isles<00:02:35.220> here<00:02:35.489> took<00:02:35.760> me<00:02:36.290> very

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
10-second little Isles here took me very

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.589 
10-second little Isles here took me very
little<00:02:37.560> time<00:02:37.730> pretty<00:02:38.730> much<00:02:38.909> there<00:02:39.390> we<00:02:39.510> go

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
little time pretty much there we go

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.410 
little time pretty much there we go
that'll<00:02:39.900> be<00:02:39.989> our<00:02:40.110> doorway<00:02:40.379> and<00:02:43.310> okay<00:02:44.420> involves

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
that'll be our doorway and okay involves

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.830 
that'll be our doorway and okay involves
trap<00:02:46.110> doors<00:02:46.410> which<00:02:46.890> are<00:02:47.400> fairly<00:02:48.209> new<00:02:48.599> to

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
trap doors which are fairly new to

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.470 
trap doors which are fairly new to
Minecraft<00:02:49.769> so<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.370> don't<00:02:50.549> know<00:02:50.640> how<00:02:51.209> many<00:02:51.239> of

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
Minecraft so I don't know how many of

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.089 
Minecraft so I don't know how many of
you<00:02:51.660> have<00:02:51.900> really<00:02:53.390> utilized<00:02:54.390> them<00:02:54.810> but<00:02:55.530> i'll

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
you have really utilized them but i'll

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:03.350 
you have really utilized them but i'll
just<00:02:56.430> do<00:02:56.549> one<00:02:56.760> side<00:02:57.110> for<00:02:58.110> times<00:02:58.620> sake<00:02:59.010> and<00:03:02.360> it's

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
just do one side for times sake and it's

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.839 
just do one side for times sake and it's
going<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.690> clear<00:03:04.079> we<00:03:05.069> need<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.310> just<00:03:05.489> clear<00:03:05.819> out

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
going to clear we need to just clear out

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.660 
going to clear we need to just clear out
a<00:03:05.970> little<00:03:06.120> moat<00:03:06.510> here<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.250> some<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.459> might

actually already kind of know what might

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.470 
actually already kind of know what might
be<00:03:12.660> going<00:03:12.959> on<00:03:13.200> here<00:03:13.819> so<00:03:14.819> what<00:03:14.970> I'm<00:03:15.060> going<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.239> do

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
needed to do just to make it a little

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:43.479 
needed to do just to make it a little
bit<00:03:34.829> quicker<00:03:36.440> will<00:03:37.440> mess<00:03:37.829> up<00:03:37.859> again<00:03:38.569> all<00:03:39.569> right

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.300 

okay<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:45.139> basically<00:03:46.139> you<00:03:46.739> put<00:03:46.980> your<00:03:47.130> water

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
okay and basically you put your water

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.930 
okay and basically you put your water
here<00:03:47.669> so<00:03:48.599> you<00:03:48.660> got<00:03:48.840> water<00:03:49.079> slows<00:03:49.650> down<00:03:49.940> pretty

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
here so you got water slows down pretty

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.569 
here so you got water slows down pretty
simple<00:03:51.200> whip<00:03:52.200> out<00:03:52.349> your<00:03:52.410> trap<00:03:52.680> doors<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.340> bam

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
simple whip out your trap doors and bam

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:59.000 
simple whip out your trap doors and bam
bam<00:03:54.030> bam<00:03:54.450> bam<00:03:56.239> mm-hmm<00:03:57.239> no<00:03:57.690> I'm<00:03:57.959> not<00:03:58.139> gonna<00:03:58.260> I'm

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
not going to take the time to really

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.140 
not going to take the time to really
conceal<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:01.410> redstone<00:04:01.859> should<00:04:02.819> be<00:04:02.970> pretty

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
conceal the redstone should be pretty

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.569 
conceal the redstone should be pretty
easy<00:04:03.299> know<00:04:03.750> what<00:04:03.930> we<00:04:04.440> can<00:04:04.590> do<00:04:05.120> just<00:04:06.120> something

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
easy know what we can do just something

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:13.150 
easy know what we can do just something
something<00:04:08.579> very<00:04:08.819> simple<00:04:10.010> get<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.040> voxel<00:04:11.609> sand

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
something very simple get a voxel sand

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.089 
something very simple get a voxel sand
places<00:04:14.160> glass<00:04:14.819> with<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:15.419> and<00:04:16.729> then<00:04:17.729> maybe

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
places glass with it and then maybe

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:23.140 
places glass with it and then maybe
bring<00:04:20.099> it<00:04:20.220> out<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.959> middle<00:04:22.169> here<00:04:22.530> and

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
bring it out to the middle here and

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.779 
bring it out to the middle here and
really<00:04:24.150> I<00:04:24.180> mean<00:04:24.419> I<00:04:24.919> doubt<00:04:25.919> most<00:04:26.310> of<00:04:26.550> you<00:04:26.699> are

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
really I mean I doubt most of you are

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.420 
really I mean I doubt most of you are
going<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:27.030> have<00:04:27.120> a<00:04:27.180> solid<00:04:27.620> house<00:04:28.620> made<00:04:29.070> out<00:04:29.099> of

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
going to have a solid house made out of

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.629 
going to have a solid house made out of
glass<00:04:29.930> but<00:04:30.930> in<00:04:31.770> case<00:04:31.979> you<00:04:32.010> don't<00:04:32.310> know<00:04:32.370> when

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
glass but in case you don't know when

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.610 
glass but in case you don't know when
stone<00:04:32.880> cannot<00:04:33.120> be<00:04:33.270> placed<00:04:33.479> on<00:04:33.750> glass<00:04:34.050> that's

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
stone cannot be placed on glass that's

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.490 
stone cannot be placed on glass that's
why<00:04:34.830> I'm<00:04:35.330> York<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:36.539> trapdoors<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:37.140> that's

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
why I'm York and trapdoors and that's

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.320 
why I'm York and trapdoors and that's
why<00:04:37.710> I'm<00:04:37.860> using

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
why I'm using

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.680 
why I'm using
see<00:04:40.330> actually<00:04:40.960> what<00:04:40.990> I<00:04:41.170> need<00:04:41.590> to<00:04:41.620> do<00:04:44.130> is<00:04:45.130> really

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
see actually what I need to do is really

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.710 
see actually what I need to do is really
it's<00:04:46.690> difficult<00:04:47.170> for<00:04:47.260> me<00:04:47.440> to<00:04:48.330> do<00:04:49.330> it<00:04:49.450> from<00:04:49.600> the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
it's difficult for me to do it from the

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.230 
it's difficult for me to do it from the
inside<00:04:49.840> you<00:04:50.170> so<00:04:50.380> what<00:04:50.530> I'm<00:04:50.620> going<00:04:50.740> to<00:04:50.800> do<00:04:51.240> I'm

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
inside you so what I'm going to do I'm

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.500 
inside you so what I'm going to do I'm
just<00:04:52.330> going<00:04:52.810> to<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:53.880> mean<00:04:54.880> it's<00:04:55.030> not<00:04:55.240> going<00:04:55.420> to

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
just going to I mean it's not going to

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.560 
just going to I mean it's not going to
look<00:04:55.810> ideal<00:04:56.940> but<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:59.020> will<00:04:59.230> work<00:04:59.530> and<00:05:00.420> it's<00:05:01.420> not

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
look ideal but it will work and it's not

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.990 
look ideal but it will work and it's not
like<00:05:01.720> moth<00:05:01.990> you're<00:05:02.320> gonna<00:05:02.700> destroy<00:05:03.700> your

like moth you're gonna destroy your
redstone<00:05:04.420> not<00:05:04.840> that<00:05:05.080> I<00:05:05.110> would<00:05:05.700> necessarily

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
redstone not that I would necessarily

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.730 
redstone not that I would necessarily
recommend<00:05:07.630> doing<00:05:07.720> it<00:05:07.900> this<00:05:07.990> might<00:05:08.170> affect<00:05:08.320> I

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
recommend doing it this might affect I

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.550 
recommend doing it this might affect I
don't<00:05:09.550> even<00:05:09.610> know<00:05:09.820> if<00:05:09.910> that's<00:05:10.090> gonna<00:05:10.560> say

I'll show you the way that he

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.800 
I'll show you the way that he
constructed<00:05:16.930> it<00:05:17.400> really<00:05:18.400> you<00:05:19.360> don't<00:05:19.660> even

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
constructed it really you don't even

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.390 
constructed it really you don't even
need<00:05:21.450> redstone<00:05:22.450> but<00:05:22.930> more<00:05:23.290> or<00:05:23.380> less<00:05:23.560> you

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
need redstone but more or less you

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.780 
need redstone but more or less you
walked<00:05:24.670> in<00:05:25.620> church<00:05:26.880> did<00:05:27.880> all<00:05:28.030> of<00:05:28.060> these<00:05:28.330> and

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
walked in church did all of these and

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.200 
walked in church did all of these and
what<00:05:30.790> you<00:05:30.880> could<00:05:31.150> do<00:05:31.450> oh<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:33.490> of<00:05:33.850> course<00:05:33.910> you

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
what you could do oh and of course you

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.780 
what you could do oh and of course you
can't<00:05:34.450> get<00:05:34.570> the<00:05:34.660> corners<00:05:35.080> Oh<00:05:35.610> without<00:05:36.610> words

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
can't get the corners Oh without words

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.620 
can't get the corners Oh without words
down<00:05:37.060> but<00:05:37.390> you<00:05:38.260> could<00:05:38.590> use<00:05:38.700> repeat<00:05:39.700> repeaters

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
down but you could use repeat repeaters

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.900 
down but you could use repeat repeaters
to<00:05:40.960> be<00:05:41.080> able<00:05:41.170> to<00:05:41.350> get<00:05:41.470> all<00:05:41.590> of<00:05:41.740> these<00:05:41.910> since

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
to be able to get all of these since

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.510 
to be able to get all of these since
repeaters<00:05:43.450> don't<00:05:43.840> you<00:05:44.260> know<00:05:44.380> take<00:05:44.650> red<00:05:45.220> stone
