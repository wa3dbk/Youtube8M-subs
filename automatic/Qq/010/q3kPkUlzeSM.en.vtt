if it's not as great as you hope because

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.600 
if it's not as great as you hope because
you<00:03:17.870> took<00:03:18.019> too<00:03:18.230> much<00:03:18.350> time<00:03:18.410> on<00:03:18.680> it<00:03:18.890> because

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
you took too much time on it because

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.800 
you took too much time on it because
quality<00:03:20.330> is<00:03:20.570> way<00:03:20.630> better<00:03:21.440> than<00:03:21.620> quantities

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
you should be able to have fun without

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.370 
you should be able to have fun without
getting<00:03:25.790> way<00:03:26.209> out<00:03:26.330> of<00:03:26.390> control<00:03:26.450> because<00:03:27.080> it's

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
getting way out of control because it's

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.199 
getting way out of control because it's
really<00:03:27.500> easy<00:03:27.799> to<00:03:27.920> have<00:03:28.160> so<00:03:28.370> much<00:03:28.430> fun<00:03:28.580> but<00:03:29.060> then

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
really easy to have so much fun but then

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.910 
really easy to have so much fun but then
within<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.600> matter<00:03:29.780> of<00:03:29.900> minutes<00:03:30.170> so<00:03:30.709> we<00:03:30.769> think

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
within a matter of minutes so we think

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.430 
within a matter of minutes so we think
can<00:03:31.130> just<00:03:31.430> go<00:03:32.090> way<00:03:32.420> out<00:03:32.450> of<00:03:32.780> proportion<00:03:32.870> and

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
can just go way out of proportion and

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.020 
can just go way out of proportion and
out<00:03:33.560> of<00:03:33.739> control<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.160> it<00:03:34.519> will<00:03:34.640> all<00:03:34.760> blow<00:03:34.940> up

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
out of control and it will all blow up
