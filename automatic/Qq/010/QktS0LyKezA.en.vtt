00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.190
 so hello everyone so here I 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.660
 introduce you to a new product 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.910
 finally new in quotation marks that 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.640
 arrive on the site 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.290
 for the little story for the little 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.470
 History gave in points as 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.059
 originally it was an internet site 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.830
 finally I was even installed on ebay and 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.080
 I finally parallel my site 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.820
 we were specialized in objects 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.680
 personalized until the day I am 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.150
 fallen into the art and until the day 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.050
 bin was fully tilted was 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.559
 stopped selling items 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.860
 customized to focus on 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.140
 entirely in hennaert the worry is 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.480
 that I still have a lot of people who 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.460
 contact for all to buy 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.410
 again again and again and again 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.270
 protects them checkbook because it's a 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.920
 product that I was the only one to do in 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.070
 la France 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.600
 I make myself manufacture in a 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.780
 factory not far 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.100
 the pro tech and that is transparent to 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.570
 originally I even bought that from the states 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.770
 united but it was it was all 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.960
 just Chinese shit and 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.649
 frankly it held his outfit very little 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.970
 of time the peculiarity of this 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.009
 plastic then it's a little 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.180
 completely transparent does that it's 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:35.110
 a relatively thick plastic you 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.090
 and frankly me mine finally in 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.380
 three years it will perhaps three years 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.240
 and a half that I let him see even 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.799
 moreover I even know more I have 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.289
 had to change maybe once because 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.670
 that he was broken 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.470
 it may be the one I have but 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.300
 it does not matter mine in three years I 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.740
 call him change once what they are 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.950
 really super resistant if we get 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.060
 take care will do so here's the thing 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.670
 is it is protected that is 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.580
 completely transparent and fully 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.970
 customizable thanks to low all 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.239
 simply inserts we go 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.799
 to add in I started with the 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.000
 door slams then the door cards it's 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.890
 a really simple thing that this 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.680
 that what I can give for example the 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.560
 bank with up a pocket on one side 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.400
 one sleeve of the other so you can 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.230
 to print 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.540
 if you want to change what is to 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.570
 inside you can print them 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.950
 at home and then after it's great 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.950
 easy to insert them from doha 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.830
 the device aside that's old 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.830
 the rest of me is lara fabian 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.030
 normally I do not need the tape 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.070
 because I was banned but it's 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.210
 an old thing that I had so here 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.700
 fully customizable card holder 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.070
 hop you can put a map of 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.090
 cards or even 2d other cards 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.710
 behind so that's for the door cards 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.290
 then 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.640
 Then I will go to the pen 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.670
 we also have pens 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.570
 fully customizable advantage 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.840
 so basically that's it 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:22.370
 if he does the picture then it is enough 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.850
 simply to disassemble the tube of 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.960
 slide the photo between the two and you 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.630
 then have a custom pen so 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.450
 it's done for pen then 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.480
 that I have two then there are three 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.800
 checkbook formats I do not have 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.080
 the third because frankly he 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:47.209
 has gone almost from an American format 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.610
 maybe I actually do not know 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.459
 more common is the strain format to 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:56.660
 left so along so that opens fit 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.010
 like that and the other one is a format 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.310
 portfolio is the one I sell the 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.750
 more in fact so yours will protect 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.040
 hot months does everything upside down your 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.040
 checkbook prosthesis often suffer 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.590
 like that so the advantage so there I 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.430
 made little kitties I made 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.350
 little kitties like this in a greenhouse 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.940
 and the prints the bar of machin 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.169
 tight mill then when you want 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.510
 buy on the site me I tell you I 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.260
 you sell it with a photo ie 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.640
 I sell it 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.290
 completely virgin it's you who 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.220
 choose the photo or you will 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.480
 see you send your photo then 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.890
 send me big pictures because 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.240
 that every time I ask customers 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.660
 to send big pictures of good 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.490
 quality 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.940
 there every time they send me photos 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.140
 completely rotten and so small 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.250
 be really careful when you tell me 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.840
 see the photos really need that 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.420
 the super big photo of the 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.060
 nice quality to have an impression 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:52.610
 nickel because I have I use when 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.610
 even big pictures what so that's it 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.900
 So that's your protege 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.640
 after you make that once 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.380
 you have it you bought it yourself 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.900
 do you want to get tired of the photo 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.580
 you want the trip you printed a 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.970
 other you give another one you 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.050
 can you can customize your 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.090
 protected who throughout the year 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.270
 with Christmas photos with photos 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.750
 of the spring of the summer I do not know so 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.170
 that's the second advantage of the format 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.670
 for wallet format 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.900
 is that if you do not have if you 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.300
 have left cat information by 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.810
 example you can also use that or 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.340
 even if you have a checkbook of this 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.950
 format there you can also use it 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.460
 while storing all your receipts 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.780
 your ID driver's license 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.620
 it's a little a little storage 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.760
 super nice in fact and so here I have 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.340
 many requests for these products 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.170
 again and cemac me I think that 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.720
 super convenient because completely 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:55.140
 personalized because we can remove the 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.980
 picture because we can we can put back 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.740
 something else so 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.320
 that's it if you do not feel comfortable 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.420
 to try and anyway I'm sure 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.910
 you will be convinced so here we go 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.290

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.080
 reappear on the site 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:13.860
 by popular demand so here is the 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:19.570

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.230
 on plastic and you will not be able to 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.470
