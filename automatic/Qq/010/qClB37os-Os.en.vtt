00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
just take it easy major chord which is e

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.990 
just take it easy major chord which is e
G<00:00:12.719> sharp<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.230> B<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.070> then<00:00:14.610> we're<00:00:14.730> going<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.940> go

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
G sharp and B and then we're going to go

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.189 
G sharp and B and then we're going to go
up<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.389> when<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.660> see<00:00:15.839> just<00:00:16.020> an<00:00:16.170> e7<00:00:18.199> it's

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
up to when you see just an e7 it's

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.640 
up to when you see just an e7 it's
actually<00:00:19.650> gonna<00:00:19.830> be<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.400> flat<00:00:21.320> seven<00:00:22.320> so

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
actually gonna be a flat seven so

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.349 
actually gonna be a flat seven so
instead<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.039> being<00:00:23.340> like<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.670> here's<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.119> major

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
instead of being like it here's a major

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.880 
instead of being like it here's a major
seven<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> dominant<00:00:25.619> seven<00:00:25.859> chord

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
seven so it's a dominant seven chord

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.250 
seven so it's a dominant seven chord
will<00:00:26.189> always<00:00:26.400> be<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.789> flat<00:00:27.300> seven<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.720> top<00:00:27.930> with

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
will always be a flat seven on top with

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.150 
will always be a flat seven on top with
a<00:00:28.650> major<00:00:29.250> chord<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> bottom<00:00:30.740> okay<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
a major chord in the bottom okay so and

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.459 
a major chord in the bottom okay so and
then<00:00:32.250> these<00:00:32.369> typically<00:00:32.790> work<00:00:33.120> because<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
then these typically work because in the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.080 
then these typically work because in the
key<00:00:34.820> it's<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.059> fifth<00:00:36.300> degree<00:00:36.980> chord<00:00:38.090> degree

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
key it's the fifth degree chord degree

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.410 
key it's the fifth degree chord degree
naturally<00:00:39.510> occurring<00:00:39.989> chord<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> key<00:00:40.680> of

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
naturally occurring chord and a key of

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.610 
naturally occurring chord and a key of
one<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:42.840> case<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.770> 1<00:00:44.070> 2<00:00:44.309> 3<00:00:44.520> 4<00:00:44.820> 5<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.329> have

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
one in this case a so 1 2 3 4 5 we have

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.229 
one in this case a so 1 2 3 4 5 we have
give<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.039> these<00:00:47.160> naturally<00:00:47.760> occurs<00:00:47.969> and

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
give a that these naturally occurs and

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.459 
give a that these naturally occurs and
then<00:00:49.100> thumb<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.430> resolves<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:51.059> an<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.469> major

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
then thumb and it resolves to an a major

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.430 
then thumb and it resolves to an a major
which<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:54.649> sharpening<00:00:56.809> so<00:00:57.809> how<00:00:58.140> we're<00:00:58.289> going

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
which is a sharpening so how we're going

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.689 
which is a sharpening so how we're going
to<00:00:58.500> use<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.829> time<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.190> what<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.640> do

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
to use it this time is what I like to do

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.880 
to use it this time is what I like to do
is<00:00:59.820> rearrange<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.480> chord<00:01:00.809> ok<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.739> I'm<00:01:01.800> gonna

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
is rearrange that chord ok and I'm gonna

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.369 
is rearrange that chord ok and I'm gonna
put<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> fifth<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.550> top<00:01:03.110> or<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> bottom

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
put the fifth on top or on the bottom

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.830 
put the fifth on top or on the bottom
rather<00:01:04.769> which<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.070> B<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.060> D<00:01:06.240> which

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
rather which is B then we have D which

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.590 
rather which is B then we have D which
is<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.020> 7<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.920> root<00:01:08.130> which<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.430> e<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.000> then

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
is the 7 the root which is e and then

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.810 
is the 7 the root which is e and then
that<00:01:09.750> g<00:01:09.930> sharp<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.380> 3rd<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.979> we're<00:01:11.460> gonna<00:01:11.549> go

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
that g sharp the 3rd and we're gonna go

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.550 
that g sharp the 3rd and we're gonna go
from<00:01:12.060> E<00:01:12.150> chord<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.409> then<00:01:13.560> resolve<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.130> an

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
from E chord and then resolve it to an

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:25.100 
from E chord and then resolve it to an
a7<00:01:16.560> hey<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.830> a
