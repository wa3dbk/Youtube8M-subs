18-wheeler<00:01:28.250> trucks<00:01:28.960> traveling<00:01:29.960> at<00:01:30.110> a<00:01:30.200> high

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
18-wheeler trucks traveling at a high

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.640 
18-wheeler trucks traveling at a high
rate<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.950> speed<00:01:31.130> in<00:01:31.820> my<00:01:32.150> direction<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:33.049> as<00:01:33.500> I

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
rate of speed in my direction and as I

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.140 
rate of speed in my direction and as I
was<00:01:33.770> turning<00:01:33.979> I<00:01:34.250> saw<00:01:34.460> them<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.760> I<00:01:34.820> had<00:01:34.940> to<00:01:35.030> make

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
was turning I saw them and I had to make

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.649 
was turning I saw them and I had to make
a<00:01:35.210> like<00:01:35.690> a<00:01:35.810> split-second<00:01:36.619> decision<00:01:37.580> and<00:01:38.390> so<00:01:38.540> my

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
a like a split-second decision and so my

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.550 
a like a split-second decision and so my
decision<00:01:39.049> was<00:01:39.140> I<00:01:39.320> need<00:01:39.590> to<00:01:39.710> turn<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:41.030> avoid

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
decision was I need to turn to avoid

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.980 
decision was I need to turn to avoid
hitting<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:43.130> trucks<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:44.479> then<00:01:44.600> I<00:01:44.630> when<00:01:44.960> I

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
hitting the trucks so and then I when I

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.780 
hitting the trucks so and then I when I
