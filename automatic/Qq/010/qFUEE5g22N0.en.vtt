 hello to all guys welcome back to the 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.010
 channel by playing flash air france 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.130
 I am crazy and today I bring you a 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:27.150
 attack the first one you see in channel i 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:31.240
 master the troops I will be using are 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.390
 you see are quite expensive 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:39.870
 Tamers Witches Barbarian Wizards Archers 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:44.920
 a mixed strategy between farming 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:47.770
 the attack tamers and wizards though I said 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.260
 why not do it so much not to use 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.890
 the barbarian public archers would be 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.440
 it was much more boring and it was a lot 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.960
 with us before starting the attack 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.730
 live one thing to say to me or that 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.250
 we will start making a series 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.850
 let us know what you think it is 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.820
 will call true revenge true revenge for 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.550
 who knows trucebaldazzi rose already the 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.630
 name of one of his songs searched on 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.450
 youtube 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.950
 if you don't know what the series really is 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.530
 will consist of attacking people there 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.340
 they attacked in turn then 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.340
 take revenge 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.170

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.470
 the unassailable or at least for me 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.830
 see for 205 thousand chan 200 elixirs 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:50.240
 millions in practice gold that added to 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.330
 any bonus from the master would go 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:02:00.649
 plus 75,000 both so let's start 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:02.890

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.890
