00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.940
 And then there will be beauty with you guys 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.550
 So let's see what we do for 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.820
 conserve our fishery expectation 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.820
 come on 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.750
 I'm going out, guys, a quick vine tip there. 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.910
 one thing I usually use whenever 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.559
 I go fishing mostly on the beach're 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.540
 is because of the size of the listening because 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.090
 I'm not a very big that I take 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.030
 then such folks for us save 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.100
 escape easy enough time 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:56.269
 you can take, for example, a box of 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:59.119
 normal rabbit with the rabbit we can 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.250
 Take for example shrimps understand the 

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:03.320
 that we are going to spend some time not 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.239
 very long of the beach fishing an end of the 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.520
 Some afternoon, we can 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:16.939
 Take the prawns in here and 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:20.540
 put this gel is a gel inside you 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:23.630
 keeps frozen in the freezer and 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.070
 When you go fishing in here, only 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.259
 that this one is a little per year and 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.080
 here too 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.780
 in this case here it was very easy 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.530
 In this case, the small eu 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:42.590
 would recommend another type of gel inside 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:44.300
 only plastic is plastic and he 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:02:25.190
 also has gel inside only that it is well 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:02:28.190
 thin that you put in the background a 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:34.520
 thin pouch you also keeps the 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:37.520
 freezer and it stays hours 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.870
 Campinas another nice galley 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:45.020
 would also be used there 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.400
 this example here is that're there I 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.020
 I recommend that you bring a small shrimp 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.240
 something like that to make an end of 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.930
 I spent only two hours fishing and such 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.540
 but a two three lines that is for 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.220
 record other things and can already lead 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.840
 example shrimp you can also take 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.820
 squid 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.720
 you can take some rusty 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.240
 is also whole or even the fillet of it that 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.860
 come on time you just wake up the tops 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.900
 to do list 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.440
 and then in case you use the same thing is 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:27.350
 only this greater talent is frozen 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:30.650
 It's very simple, you put it on. 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.050
 there then places within the shrimp cost 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:38.000
 student or whatever 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:40.520
 cap and ready to go to josuÃ© fishery 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.260

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:50.360
 You'll have plenty of time there from cold 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:04:00.430
 under the sun warmer than in the river 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:04:03.580
