an adjustable handlebars this is the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.690 
an adjustable handlebars this is the
same<00:03:23.330> on<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.600> SX<00:03:24.019> and<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.440> sx<00:03:24.830> s<00:03:25.070> where<00:03:25.670> you

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
same on the SX and the sx s where you

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.250 
same on the SX and the sx s where you
can<00:03:25.940> move<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.269> bar<00:03:26.480> so<00:03:26.690> there's<00:03:26.810> another<00:03:26.989> hole

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
can move the bar so there's another hole

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.350

here<00:03:27.290> we<00:03:27.650> can<00:03:27.799> move<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.040> bars<00:03:28.220> back<00:03:28.459> plus<00:03:29.180> you

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
here we can move the bars back plus you

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.470 
here we can move the bars back plus you
can<00:03:29.510> flip<00:03:29.810> these<00:03:30.019> clamps<00:03:30.350> 180<00:03:30.980> degrees<00:03:31.400> so<00:03:32.360> it

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
can flip these clamps 180 degrees so it

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.690 
can flip these clamps 180 degrees so it
gives<00:03:32.630> you<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.750> total<00:03:33.019> of<00:03:33.079> four<00:03:33.320> positions<00:03:33.890> to

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
gives you a total of four positions to

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.770 
gives you a total of four positions to
mount<00:03:34.910> these<00:03:35.090> handlebars

and<00:03:38.370> let's<00:03:39.390> talk<00:03:40.390> about<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.750> aluminum<00:03:41.110> swing

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
and let's talk about the aluminum swing

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.490 
and let's talk about the aluminum swing
arm<00:03:41.760> but<00:03:42.760> just<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.150> really<00:03:43.450> like<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:44.320> said<00:03:44.470> a

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
arm but just to really like I said a

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.920 
arm but just to really like I said a
high<00:03:44.740> performance<00:03:45.370> bike<00:03:46.060> is<00:03:46.360> basically<00:03:46.810> just

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
high performance bike is basically just

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.470 
high performance bike is basically just
like<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.620> bigger<00:03:47.800> bikes<00:03:48.100> only<00:03:49.000> smaller

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
like the bigger bikes only smaller

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.590 
like the bigger bikes only smaller
so<00:03:49.840> when<00:03:50.470> you're<00:03:50.590> looking<00:03:50.800> at<00:03:50.920> a<00:03:51.060> 125sx<00:03:52.060> this

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
so when you're looking at a 125sx this

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.350 
so when you're looking at a 125sx this
is<00:03:52.780> just<00:03:52.990> a<00:03:53.080> smaller<00:03:53.380> version<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.890> that<00:03:53.950> bike

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
is just a smaller version of that bike

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.020 
is just a smaller version of that bike
very<00:03:55.360> high<00:03:55.600> performance<00:03:56.490> great<00:03:57.490> bike<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:57.910> get

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
very high performance great bike to get

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.240
