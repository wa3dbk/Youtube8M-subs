 and half a teaspoon of yeast 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.020
 chemical for them to ride guys 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.699
 we start by adding the half 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.010
 teaspoon of baking powder in 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:29.310
 the family and we even mix very 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.260
 complicated I take my butter that I 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:41.670
 previously leave a little 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:43.620
 softened and I add the above but at 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.070
 electric mixer to obtain a paste 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.420
 very smooth 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.420
 I mix everything 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.129
 for you can also wait for her 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.129
 industry I do not like to wait 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.310
 then a dough that is smooth we go 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:27.610
 can continue but play all 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:27.610
 two a teaspoon of salt 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.180
 and 2 teaspoons of extract flaw 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.740
 to mix for another minute we learn 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:01.170
 we add the eggs and now 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:06.030
 but the flour and mix all the good blood 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.030
 why strong and flour 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:35.330
 near is a little to work the dough 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:36.950
 and then then and pecan and in 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.870
 function of the consistency of the pac me 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.500
 it is quite dense so I 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.550
 go a little can flatten but who 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.780
 never your dough is really very 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.340
 soft in this case rather makes 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.080
 balls because they will tend to his 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.819
 girl do the cooking who knows they 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.079
 are good but perfectly regular 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.700
 now here we put in the oven some 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.230
 the shots they 're ready to benfica 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.620
 they are clean on the outside 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.620
 do not come 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.120
 cut out the ten minutes it's cooked 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.830
 we will go out of the oven and we will 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.810
 let rest two nights on the plate 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.610
 baking and then will remove the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.610
 hardly since you are ready days 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.780
 wanted to cool 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.340
 two minutes after leaving them on 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.260
 the hob is put on a 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.870
 grid so that they can dried by in 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.440
 below and above 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.440
