00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.700
 Updated to build time 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.880
 I told you I was going to come to the end. 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.579
 If it is finally 13, it will be the end. 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.720
 So with Joe's new alpha version 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:31.059

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:38.320

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:43.329

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.829
 These weapons have disappeared, but according to Choi's news, 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.980
 There. 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:51.160

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.929

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.980
 User does not fire 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:07.350
 It is not a word that I do not turn off the lights before the law adhere to the fire at all 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.079
 I tried to do geolro deoraguyo management 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.360
 So the fire is moving around 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.360
 Player and fire have disappeared. 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:22.439
 And what else has changed? 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.400
 This is seen when the skin Skin 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:30.030
 When you make a selection, it becomes a skinny pin. 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.140

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.630
 However, there are other numbers in which areas 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.630
 Oh, I went to the water. 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:54.070
 Now, this moment is a moment when the taste 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:56.330
 So he's bouncing. So he's still on the ball. 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.620
 Then 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:04.070
 I can throw a snowball or a burning egg in the boat . 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.940

 Well, Pocket Edition is a bit different. 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.250
 It's a little out of place with the pc version . 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.660
 At third person 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.660

 I do not know how you change. 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:26.350
 Some of the considerations have been modified, but there is still some heat left over. 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:29.070
 Well, the field is evil billions and nothing else . 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.070
