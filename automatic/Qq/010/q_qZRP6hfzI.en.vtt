absolutely dominated because the source

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.560 
absolutely dominated because the source
law<00:05:06.430> people<00:05:06.760> is<00:05:06.820> going<00:05:06.970> to<00:05:07.030> be<00:05:07.120> bomb<00:05:07.300> and<00:05:07.450> pass

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
me all day long and it's probably not a

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.710 
me all day long and it's probably not a
good<00:05:09.430> idea<00:05:09.490> but<00:05:10.090> i<00:05:10.120> thought<00:05:10.300> you<00:05:10.420> know<00:05:10.450> what

really<00:05:13.930> was<00:05:14.080> wrong<00:05:14.380> it<00:05:14.770> really<00:05:15.070> works<00:05:15.520> out

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
really was wrong it really works out

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.690 
really was wrong it really works out

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
particularly amazing and they just kind

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.610 
particularly amazing and they just kind
of<00:06:06.970> like<00:06:07.210> Messi<00:06:07.840> gets<00:06:08.020> the<00:06:08.169> ball<00:06:08.350> from<00:06:08.500> a

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
of like Messi gets the ball from a

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.870 
of like Messi gets the ball from a
decent<00:06:08.950> way<00:06:09.040> out<00:06:09.160> and<00:06:09.280> just<00:06:09.400> kind<00:06:09.580> of<00:06:09.610> finishes

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
decent way out and just kind of finishes

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.210 
decent way out and just kind of finishes
it<00:06:10.090> really<00:06:10.330> well<00:06:10.540> but<00:06:10.870> there<00:06:11.710> was<00:06:11.830> no<00:06:11.980> like

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
it really well but there was no like

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.950 
it really well but there was no like
long<00:06:12.520> way<00:06:12.700> in<00:06:12.760> strikes<00:06:13.150> or<00:06:13.270> anything<00:06:13.540> but<00:06:13.810> I

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
long way in strikes or anything but I

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.270 
long way in strikes or anything but I
suppose<00:06:14.260> it<00:06:14.470> didn't<00:06:14.680> really<00:06:14.770> matter<00:06:14.980> i<00:06:15.130> mean

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
suppose it didn't really matter i mean

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.700 
suppose it didn't really matter i mean
at<00:06:15.790> this<00:06:15.940> point<00:06:16.000> for<00:06:16.540> me<00:06:16.690> Messi's<00:06:17.230> got<00:06:17.440> more

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
at this point for me Messi's got more

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.770 
at this point for me Messi's got more
girls<00:06:18.100> than<00:06:18.460> he<00:06:18.580> has<00:06:18.700> played<00:06:18.940> games<00:06:19.300> so<00:06:19.660> he
