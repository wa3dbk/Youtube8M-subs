00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.920
 hello to everyone solvent 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.880
 I talk about the process 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.730
 i obviously 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.730
 carlos pavón 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.479
 It's my first boxing pireo in Spanish 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:19.810
 yes all right and zilli in two guys comments and all that 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.470
 weapons 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.730
 if it is not a success in itself it is a failure because it is 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.730
 to fuck and can not do more 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.749
 Well I'm here and to talk to you 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.449
 eads in me added comparative ricardo mayorga 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.970
 mmmm March 12 but mm the fairs said plan both united states 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.350
 I already made a video in me in English about 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.160
 in this fight 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.559
 but now I want to erase 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.690
 in Spain 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.720
 obviously 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.190
 I think 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.710
 Miguel Cotto for Canada this fight 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.710
 by relatively easy 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.770
 relatively easy 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.120
 correlatively peace 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.320
 for one hundrerd 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.550
 ricardo mayorga has fought only once the pnud 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.360
 in the last years 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.360
 buy any 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.530
 I do not see it very complicated 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.530
 he is also 37 years old 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.560
 he said 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.370
 at the press conference last week 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.860
 last week 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.180
 Miguel Cotto was very touched is very beaten is already 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.900
 finished face 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.470
 well 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.900
 I do not think that 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.330
 nor bounded 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.230
 in him thousand 4 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.430
 let yourself be seen two or three years 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.210
 I agree with that 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.880
 but nevertheless 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.070
 ricardo mayorga also 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.060
 is 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.990
 very beaten 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.170
 My cover page 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.849
 has been knocked out by things of the oea por pérez trinidad 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.299
 that's why in monsoon 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.579
 i 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.579
 for me 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:21.599
 Miguel Cotto has still 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.039
 enough 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.299
 to win him by applying mallorca 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.299
 also with the hand he turned in his corner 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.609
 I think it's coming 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.939
 he is boxing more 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.989
 As little is said, he admitted that his career 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.739
 that was one of the pivot poles auto grandson 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:47.519
 I think that after he hit a couple of dangerous assaults 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:49.549
 the Mallorcan 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.269
 when he's going to spend his energy trying and art 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.109
 I will try 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.289
 to knock out Miguel Cotto 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:58.999
 miguel duck 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:04.239
 will start until connecting with specific hits specifically the popes at 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.219
 body 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.619
 and I think it's real going to stop 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:09.949
 ricardo mayorga 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.139
 with a blow to the body 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:13.469
 what is a 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.599
 its six most common mosul sum 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.599
 Apple tree 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:22.339
 after 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:23.499
 maybe 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:25.969
 we will see a fight a rematch 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:29.099
 three fourth grade of Jewish Victor something like that 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.729
 they are talking about this 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.979
 or maybe the foal against sergio martínez 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.979
 do not rule out this possibility 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:38.879
 but he stops 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:39.999
 still finished 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:42.999
 I say this constant fight 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:46.839
 no peace and peace and but constant 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:52.539
 facundo photo ap monsoon 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:55.539
 went to córdoba 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:58.979
 dc united have 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.979
 your comments i 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.479
 12 and I'm talking a lot of trash 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:08.699
 They tell me 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.729
 I was silenced 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:16.159
 If things would be dismissed, why do more in Spain? 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:19.789
 especially when they are two losers d 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.430
 Latin America 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.039
