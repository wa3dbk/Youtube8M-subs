where you can pick it up and walk around
with<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:34.829> you<00:03:34.920> know<00:03:34.950> which<00:03:35.489> is<00:03:35.639> really

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
with it and you know which is really

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.580 
with it and you know which is really
cool<00:03:36.299> or<00:03:36.630> you<00:03:36.780> know<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:37.019> can<00:03:37.139> set<00:03:37.290> just<00:03:37.410> in<00:03:37.500> the

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
cool or you know you can set just in the

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.020 
cool or you know you can set just in the
ground<00:03:37.799> may<00:03:37.920> go<00:03:38.010> since<00:03:38.400> you're<00:03:38.519> gonna<00:03:38.639> picks
