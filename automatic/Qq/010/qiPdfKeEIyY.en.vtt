canvas<00:00:18.770> I<00:00:19.010> want<00:00:19.520> to<00:00:19.610> try<00:00:19.880> this<00:00:19.940> method<00:00:20.300> so<00:00:21.170> here

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
canvas I want to try this method so here

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
canvas I want to try this method so here
I<00:00:21.470> am<00:00:21.590> going<00:00:22.400> to<00:00:22.730> cap<00:00:23.000> a<00:00:23.030> point<00:00:23.420> on<00:00:23.930> a<00:00:24.500> very<00:00:24.890> cold

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
I am going to cap a point on a very cold

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.330 
I am going to cap a point on a very cold
morning<00:00:28.480> first<00:00:29.480> I<00:00:29.690> sketch<00:00:30.080> the<00:00:30.590> background

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
morning first I sketch the background

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.220 
morning first I sketch the background
which<00:00:31.640> is<00:00:31.820> an<00:00:32.000> island<00:00:32.450> far<00:00:32.689> away<00:00:34.690> very<00:00:35.690> simple

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
which is an island far away very simple

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.270 
which is an island far away very simple
and<00:00:36.980> then<00:00:37.519> I<00:00:37.550> do<00:00:37.699> the<00:00:38.120> mid-ground<00:00:38.839> rocks<00:00:39.499> in

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
and then I do the mid-ground rocks in

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.000 
and then I do the mid-ground rocks in
the<00:00:41.239> ocean<00:00:43.780> finally<00:00:44.780> I<00:00:44.809> do<00:00:45.019> the<00:00:45.440> foreground

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
the ocean finally I do the foreground

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.059 
the ocean finally I do the foreground
rocks<00:00:46.370> and<00:00:46.730> I<00:00:47.359> take<00:00:47.629> it<00:00:47.749> home<00:00:47.960> and<00:00:48.199> I<00:00:48.649> start<00:00:48.949> a

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:49.069 
rocks and I take it home and I start a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:01:54.450 
rocks and I take it home and I start a
new<00:00:49.219> canvas<00:00:49.729> in<00:00:49.879> color

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.420 

so<00:01:55.460> that's<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.970> Edward<00:01:56.750> C<00:01:57.020> go<00:01:57.229> way<00:01:57.530> do<00:01:58.400> a

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
so that's the Edward C go way do a

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.750 
so that's the Edward C go way do a
little<00:01:58.640> sketch<00:01:59.080> take<00:02:00.080> it<00:02:00.200> home<00:02:00.729> make<00:02:01.729> a

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
little sketch take it home make a

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.120 
little sketch take it home make a
painting<00:02:02.119> from<00:02:02.420> it

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
painting from it

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.889 
painting from it
fascinating<00:02:04.160> I<00:02:04.369> must<00:02:05.030> say<00:02:05.149> did<00:02:05.390> wonders<00:02:05.869> for

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
fascinating I must say did wonders for

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.860 
fascinating I must say did wonders for
my<00:02:06.259> confidence
