yeah highly delighted yes nobody more
surprised<00:00:28.989> than<00:00:29.110> me<00:00:29.200> I<00:00:29.320> don't<00:00:29.590> think<00:00:29.800> right

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
surprised than me I don't think right

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.510 
surprised than me I don't think right
why<00:00:30.550> do<00:00:30.820> you<00:00:31.029> think<00:00:31.119> you<00:00:31.329> won<00:00:32.190> why<00:00:33.190> do<00:00:33.250> we<00:00:33.489> think

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
why do you think you won why do we think

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.380 
why do you think you won why do we think
we<00:00:33.970> won<00:00:35.220> very<00:00:36.220> difficult<00:00:36.670> question<00:00:37.030> that<00:00:37.210> one

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
we won very difficult question that one

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.889 
we won very difficult question that one
I<00:00:38.160> think<00:00:39.160> possibly<00:00:39.519> because<00:00:40.179> the<00:00:40.539> trains

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
I think possibly because the trains

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.099 
I think possibly because the trains
there's<00:00:41.769> lots<00:00:42.219> of<00:00:42.370> movement<00:00:42.960> there's<00:00:43.960> always

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109 
there's lots of movement there's always

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:45.930 
there's lots of movement there's always
something<00:00:44.500> running<00:00:44.649> either<00:00:45.399> on<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.760> main

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
something running either on the main

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.150 
something running either on the main
line<00:00:46.179> or<00:00:46.210> on<00:00:46.449> branch<00:00:46.780> and<00:00:47.559> obviously<00:00:47.890> there's

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
line or on branch and obviously there's

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.880 
line or on branch and obviously there's
the<00:00:48.219> trolley<00:00:48.550> line<00:00:48.789> as<00:00:49.000> well<00:00:49.679> that's<00:00:50.679> always

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
the trolley line as well that's always

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.619 
the trolley line as well that's always
going<00:00:51.219> round<00:00:51.460> around<00:00:51.789> so<00:00:52.089> there's<00:00:52.480> always

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
going round around so there's always

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.950 
going round around so there's always
something<00:00:52.899> moving<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:54.399> scenery<00:00:54.789> I<00:00:55.179> suppose

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
something moving the scenery I suppose

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.020 
something moving the scenery I suppose
that<00:00:56.499> had<00:00:56.620> something<00:00:56.920> to<00:00:57.039> do<00:00:57.159> with<00:00:57.190> it

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
that had something to do with it

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.079 
that had something to do with it
we<00:00:58.780> spent<00:00:59.019> an<00:00:59.109> awful<00:00:59.170> lot<00:00:59.440> of<00:00:59.469> time<00:00:59.679> on<00:00:59.890> it<00:01:00.089> lots

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
we spent an awful lot of time on it lots

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:03.689 
we spent an awful lot of time on it lots
of<00:01:01.239> people<00:01:01.510> were<00:01:01.629> involved<00:01:02.190> too<00:01:03.190> in<00:01:03.609> the

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
of people were involved too in the

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.880 
of people were involved too in the
scenery<00:01:03.909> the<00:01:04.330> cell<00:01:04.540> brought<00:01:04.930> me<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.470> one<00:01:05.770> or

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
scenery the cell brought me and one or

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.690 
scenery the cell brought me and one or
two<00:01:05.920> others<00:01:06.250> from<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.520> club

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
two others from the club

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.420 
two others from the club
I<00:01:08.759> would<00:01:09.450> assume<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.649> one<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.979> over<00:01:11.280> as

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
I would assume that that one it over as

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.100 
I would assume that that one it over as
well<00:01:11.610> as<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:11.909> movement<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> train<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.960> I

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
well as the movement of the train and I

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.959 
well as the movement of the train and I
think<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.619> two<00:01:13.860> layouts<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.460> one<00:01:14.610> isn't<00:01:14.880> it

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:14.969 
think it's two layouts and one isn't it

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:17.300 
think it's two layouts and one isn't it
nicely<00:01:15.390> separated<00:01:15.600> yes<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.680> or<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.860> curving

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
nicely separated yes it or the curving

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.300 
nicely separated yes it or the curving
mountainside<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.600> was<00:01:18.899> it<00:01:19.380> was<00:01:19.649> it<00:01:20.009> was<00:01:20.130> done

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
mountainside it was it was it was done

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.700 
mountainside it was it was it was done
deliberately<00:01:20.759> when<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.179> first<00:01:21.450> actually<00:01:22.020> put

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
deliberately when we first actually put

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.029 
deliberately when we first actually put
the<00:01:22.799> plan<00:01:23.039> down<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.759> paper<00:01:24.470> we've<00:01:25.470> got<00:01:25.679> a

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
the plan down on paper we've got a

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:27.830 
the plan down on paper we've got a
little<00:01:26.399> committee<00:01:26.670> together<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> look

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
little committee together to have a look

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.749 
little committee together to have a look
to<00:01:28.049> see<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.500> want<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:29.009> because<00:01:29.490> we

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
to see what we want to do because we

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.319 
to see what we want to do because we
lost<00:01:29.909> their<00:01:30.149> premises<00:01:30.509> from<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.899> old<00:01:31.049> one<00:01:31.259> and

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
lost their premises from the old one and

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.870 
lost their premises from the old one and
we<00:01:33.329> came<00:01:33.569> up<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:33.869> three<00:01:34.049> different<00:01:34.439> things

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
we came up with three different things

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.910 
we came up with three different things
I've<00:01:35.880> always<00:01:36.210> wanted<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.569> do<00:01:36.719> something<00:01:37.380> along

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
I've always wanted to do something along

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.350 
I've always wanted to do something along
the<00:01:38.069> ocean<00:01:39.469> Rodney<00:01:40.469> is<00:01:40.590> always<00:01:40.860> want<00:01:41.069> to<00:01:41.130> do

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
the ocean Rodney is always want to do

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.870 
the ocean Rodney is always want to do
touchscreen<00:01:42.360> Luke<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.099> Ken<00:01:44.099> always<00:01:44.490> wanted

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
touchscreen Luke and Ken always wanted

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.270 
touchscreen Luke and Ken always wanted
to<00:01:44.970> do<00:01:45.090> something<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.959> cityscape<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.950> what

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
to do something of a cityscape so what

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.889 
to do something of a cityscape so what
we<00:01:47.429> did<00:01:47.549> was<00:01:47.759> we<00:01:48.060> put<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.479> brake<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
we did was we put the brake in the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.050 
we did was we put the brake in the
middle<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.319> with<00:01:49.470> mounting<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.189> did<00:01:50.939> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
middle and with mounting and did the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.999 
middle and with mounting and did the
ocean<00:01:51.360> one<00:01:51.539> side<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.409> cityscape<00:01:52.709> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
ocean one side and the cityscape the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.919 
ocean one side and the cityscape the
other<00:01:53.099> I<00:01:53.489> think<00:01:53.880> with<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> long<00:01:54.239> train<00:01:54.539> so<00:01:54.899> you

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
other I think with a long train so you

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.569 
other I think with a long train so you
run<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.409> layout<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.039> works<00:01:56.250> very

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
run on this layout so it works very

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.850 
run on this layout so it works very
effectively<00:01:57.479> indeed<00:01:58.140> doesn't<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.679> see

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
effectively indeed doesn't it you see

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.410 
effectively indeed doesn't it you see
them<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.099> the<00:01:59.189> distance<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.819> see<00:01:59.849> them<00:02:00.179> coming

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
them in the distance you see them coming

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.569 
them in the distance you see them coming
right<00:02:00.630> they<00:02:00.720> disappear<00:02:01.319> they<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.159> have<00:02:02.310> here

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
right they disappear they we have here

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.370 
right they disappear they we have here
they<00:02:02.759> disappear<00:02:03.270> again<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.720> then<00:02:03.869> we<00:02:04.049> appear

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
they disappear again and then we appear

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.449 
they disappear again and then we appear
for<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.619> third<00:02:04.860> time

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
for a third time

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.910 
for a third time
yeah<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:07.289> not<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.619> straight<00:02:07.860> line

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
yeah and it's not in a straight line

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.789 
yeah and it's not in a straight line
either<00:02:08.310> as<00:02:08.549> there<00:02:08.759> are<00:02:08.970> curves<00:02:09.329> and<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:10.590> goes

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
either as there are curves and it goes

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.979 
either as there are curves and it goes
behind<00:02:11.009> glass<00:02:11.489> because<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.480> isn't<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.780> massive

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
behind glass because it isn't a massive

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.979 
behind glass because it isn't a massive
layout<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.100> now<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:15.239> total<00:02:15.540> length<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
layout is it now the total length of the

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.550 
layout is it now the total length of the
layout<00:02:16.200> was<00:02:16.350> only<00:02:16.500> 24<00:02:16.889> feet<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.370> it's<00:02:18.269> only

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
layout was only 24 feet and it's only

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.190 
layout was only 24 feet and it's only
six<00:02:19.560> feet<00:02:19.739> deep<00:02:20.660> with<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.750> mountain<00:02:22.019> of<00:02:22.109> the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
six feet deep with the mountain of the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.160 
six feet deep with the mountain of the
front<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.549> think<00:02:24.060> with<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.780> mountain<00:02:25.049> at

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
front so I think with the mountain at

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.580 
front so I think with the mountain at
the<00:02:25.230> front<00:02:25.470> on<00:02:25.859> the<00:02:26.160> curve<00:02:26.359> it<00:02:27.359> allows<00:02:28.109> you<00:02:28.410> to

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
the front on the curve it allows you to

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.400 
the front on the curve it allows you to
not<00:02:28.889> see<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.280> train<00:02:29.489> all<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.359> the<00:02:30.450> time<00:02:30.690> or<00:02:31.049> all

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
not see the train all of the time or all

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.800 
not see the train all of the time or all
of<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.799> train<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:33.359> gives<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.630> impression

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
of the train so it gives the impression

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.840 
of the train so it gives the impression
that<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.350> trains<00:02:34.950> are<00:02:35.100> actually<00:02:35.430> longer<00:02:35.670> than

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
that the trains are actually longer than

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.940 
that the trains are actually longer than
what<00:02:36.090> they<00:02:36.239> are<00:02:36.329> because<00:02:37.200> they're<00:02:37.530> going<00:02:37.769> in

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
what they are because they're going in

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.910 
what they are because they're going in
and<00:02:38.130> out<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.340> tunnels<00:02:38.519> crossing<00:02:39.299> bridges

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
and out of tunnels crossing bridges

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.460 
and out of tunnels crossing bridges
going<00:02:40.920> around<00:02:41.130> Bluffs

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
going around Bluffs

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.860 
going around Bluffs
so<00:02:42.710> and<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.040> forth<00:02:43.250> well<00:02:43.880> we<00:02:43.970> think<00:02:44.120> it's<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.510> we

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
so and so forth well we think it's a we

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.450 
so and so forth well we think it's a we
think<00:02:45.050> it's<00:02:45.170> great<00:02:45.380> layout<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.100> worthy

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
think it's great layout and a worthy

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.190 
think it's great layout and a worthy
