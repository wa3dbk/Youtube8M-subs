00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.760
 that we read the 45th roger ghosts 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.929
 vegas 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.519
 I'm not with the chip leader 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.290
 november to jorryt's hoof that 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.400
 yesterday the final table of the medium 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.020
 and has achieved 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.670
 jorrit it is now about 12 hours ago 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.289
 that you have reached the final table 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.420
 for what kind of emotions what kind of 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.910
 things have you endured in this 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.670
 last 12 hours 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.560
 yes that is completely unreal 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.130
 actually it really is a very bizarre one 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:37.040
 experience has we go very bold one 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:40.890
 super grateful that i am really you 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.540
 sharply bizarre as yesterday's 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.760
 played poker all day long of course 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.340
 all of you started with 27 players after the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.289
 played the last nine and how are you 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.700
 to not be allowed to play on such a day 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.149
 very many players will ever have it in their 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.149
 career 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.949
 so don't describe every brother 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.920
 the first day was just great to do 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.489
 participate in main event 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.200
 marco pretty much looking forward to being me 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.210
 pretty impulsive of rules gone to me 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.650
 after five years not nothing the meteor 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.360
 and then the second day 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.049
 In addition, you're happy the second day 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.450
 made it 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.430
 young man and yes there is another one 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.259
 bit the grime you actually already know and 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.930
 maybe the third day after my 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.270
 or money clearer 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.040
 so then it becomes even more beautiful through the day 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.350
 bubble came 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.470
 So I searched want very quickly and 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.850
 how nice and then the fifth day 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.670
 but seriously about us just now 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.399
 so be what i really do one 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.869
 educate ok i really have to be me 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.979
 focus happy person hell you know because it 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.600
 being no longer important should one be 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.180
 few days so I may already have him free 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.850
 well i was really really cool and the sixth 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.829
 day was brothers still have c process the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.560
 crazy there seven days 187 fascists there 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.000
 exactly the same day as was actually 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.119
 for me the exciting day I really think 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.950
 whole rollercoaster 2 million 4 million 2 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.140
 million 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.759
 so close to 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.000
 then it is right to say so that 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.590
 was relaxed back to is then 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.850
 the bubble i mean the hand played of 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.560
 position 27 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.690
 still big swinxs just one more 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.400
 while the chip lead and then you can suddenly 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.590
 play for that for that biggest bubble 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.520
 in poker yes you say yes the debate became 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.220
 it just very unreal 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.630
 actually the tension said it was 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.739
 neurons whole from Monday 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.709
 I had a lot of faith in that 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.190
 moment I also thought it was very good 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.660
 yes x it is going to play nicely the notion 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.480
 park assist is also nice 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:47.250
 And yes it's just a whole 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.080
 a sewer moment actually what everything there 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.550
 to go very far 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.380
 You see you at the last 9 November 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.400
 you come back with 8 opponents that 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.410
 still try you 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.420
 what to keep from those ten million 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.850
 do you think of the opposition 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.239
 sometimes people are very serious players 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.239
 table 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.630
 said i do n't know much about all that 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.209
 player then I do not have the queen whole 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.549
 bad for all of us but one came 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.680
 while and cure with 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.360
 with the most seated at the table and me 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.790
 have already heard something and I know the 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.400
 storms of the name already a bit 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.160
 so for smeets best of heavy table 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.290
 actually and now you prepare 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.910
 have a lot of time to say isp 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.600
 and watch broadcasts to you 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.160
 to prepare 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.750
 to retrain you a bit from alma 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.450
 play cash games after moving to no limit 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.239
 hold'em tournament how to play the tournament 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.790
 is that process going to be a thing 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.970
 yes i want to be there for the past two years 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.700
 hardly played open so I can 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.060
 so we use a little practice 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.420
 i despise going more to never play and 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.950
 I can pretty much easily do a lot 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.299
 but practical and get practicing and 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.220
 maybe after maybe a little live 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:00.010
 tournaments too and I just think so 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.180
 extra hours poken study and worrying 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.220
 physically also completely fit you go for 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.030
 $ 10 million play in November 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.030
 think a little bit by 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.710
 well yeah i do n't know it feels real 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.650
 yet yesterday was feeling something worse 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.030
 something more royal 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.799
 and but i have name it is also one 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.350
 bit there comes in a the tournament was 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.700
 I really, really, really just like the hand 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:30.220
 best decision and try to take 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.900
 each and not thinking of what is there 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.520
 after that happens or you are already in it 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.080
 had that in mind 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.730
 then distract what I was around and that thought 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.530
 quietly let go on out of trees say 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.990
 but not on focusing because I want 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.790
 a poker and that's why it was 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.560
 unreal him that feeling number 6 one 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.290
 little market starts it there now 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.910
 actually beginning a little 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.680
 day viewer of head still has three 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.330
 months in order to practice before 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.690
 the biggest final table of bread goes 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.460
 play 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.440
 keep focusing on pure focus 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.180
