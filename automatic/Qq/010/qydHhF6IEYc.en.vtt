00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.940
 that we did not get here I already got it 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:12.580
 very busted we released we showered and 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.230
 pass everything to the computer and other 2x and it's 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.940
 everything is a nonsense of hair 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.039
 it does not matter then I comb my hair and because now 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.779
 I just woke up asked me to 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.510
 bring breakfast here to the room 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.789
 that is a myth and that cabbage has fallen because 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.310
 I'm editing a sack but good now 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.439

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.179
 Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday we have it 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.770
 completely free although we already have 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.170
 enough activities programmed by 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.300

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.149

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.710
 cream to see if he has prepared me a 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.840
 tattoo or theoretically we're going to 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.030
 endow almost all we told our you 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.680
 we counted our stone our idea and 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.539
 to see good that we could have breakfast and 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.270
 has left today's video scheduled 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.520
 lie not good that you already ready already 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.300
 we are ready and prepared and prepared 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.250
 benjamÃ­n us to come get well 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.590
 let's see if he comes for us and 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.199
 we are going to see if the 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:13.360
 seen he did not even teach me so very 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:15.039
 let's see the tail working 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.659
 We have a piece here but it is so 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.850
 low with the whip we catch up 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.070
 with the red dailys and does not know either 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.950
 where is it going to take truth not even what or 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.390
 where and I have not seen the design 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.299
 I explained the concept and I think that 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.490
 will be in Benjamin's head but 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.810
 I do not know where I calf in the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.810
 arm and shoulder blade 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:47.690
 the arm has not been committed but still 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.700
 I did not see the drawing either, so we 're 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.700
 all the same waiting for benjamin 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.410
 but my favorite 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.410
 wikileaks 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.270
 let's see if we eat a little 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:13.260
 Here, Benjamin brought us to eat before 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.260
 the tattoos we are getting firm 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.200
 Y 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.940
 and we are here where Benjamin the first 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.340
 session will be for easy 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.000
 there is finishing the design for the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.000
 space 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.640
 and here we can see the coast working 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.870
 all right 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.580
 or not 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:05.769
 it seems to me when I spoke a lot 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:09.209
 pure bolton of the bitches hay said the 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.209
 phrase of the star 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.570
 We are already in your tattoo studio and 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.280
 we already have more or less a design we 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.920
 missing a bit of the size and the site 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.080
 but that if it is not clear that yes what 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.150
 has a key is great that you already know that 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.560
 will do a minimal design is very 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.160
 minimal that design that is there are two 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.840
 pictures I'm not going to do 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:01.400
 it's first g and it's a little scary 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.400
 will have to get used 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.070
 if not 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.060
 ah 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.060
 rabid 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
 here 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.590
 preparing make the crazy oil 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.050
 goodbye 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.090
 in the body 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:09.310
 four years later years with 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.310
 women against vertigo 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:17.130
 the hypocrisy of the imposed 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.130
 baratta 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.930
 will understand the imposed 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.440
 the face is looking 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.440
 to her 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:44.949
 that is not right line we are guilty and 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:49.240
 sentenced we are is the end of the day 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:49.240
 telecinco until after 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:06:01.240
 It surprises me because I imposed it cheap 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.240
 well we do not want to say here it will be 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.170
 like all the fates of the whole world 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.810
 like all museums on Mondays 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.610
 it's something internal like that and also because 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.990
 now of all the sheet 200 but so for 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.690

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.400
 so many times there is a grandmother living 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.910
 Here he has made a cardigan to the tree 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:29.080
 if you are cold you know the typical grandmother 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:30.380
 that makes a sleeve to a whole case 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.640
 to the tree 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:36.790
