00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.089
 Yellow house pick up a deal that I 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.700

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.429
 I was in the integration of the macaxeira I got 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.769
 where the macaxeira mud stolen bus 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.529
 there is no room where the person breathes 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.020
 a lot get away from here after a 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.900
 workday between to complete the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.800
 pastor situation within the mec 1 bus 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.880
 it was enough in a business that is what 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.480
 closed which does not have the condition of the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.520
 if you go out and start preaching to my people 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.190
 but I was not preaching normal not 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.129
 because even and gave peace and accept not 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.100
 they started to scream saying that everything 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.620
 world was in the power of Jesus and was 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.750
 tied to a satan that everyone who 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.690
 I was in that business there started 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.539
 talk more than the make and jesus 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.579
 disrespecting the other religions 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.410
 who he said that was not evangelical would 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.710
 die in the mouth of hell 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.960
 my people you can be everything you can 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.090
 be what you want one more thing 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.309
 You can not make respect for the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.510
 religion because I leave me in that 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.939
 same time 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.670
 You do not know not but I still 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.640
 I hold and hold on because you have 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.890
 a lot of people but he opened his mouth to it 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.670
 opened that mouth began to speak 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.979
 jesus was evangelical my people where 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.560
 she wants to use the evangelical 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.299
 church exists at that time where I 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.490
 You want to use evangelicals and the church of 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.880
 jesus was the people in the disco business is 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.590
 evangelical and Catholic faith in his 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.079
 of religion there that was born after 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.450
 floor of the ta ta of globalization and 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.420
 retailing in the dispatch staff or 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.159
 To breathe but I rebelled so much I 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.549

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.070

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.250
 my mouth he did not like his heat 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.820
 because you can imagine the people climbing 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.969
 through the walls and told where is that jesus 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.820

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.560

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.349
 it means that he was monk you what 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.380
 you one you are what asks your story 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.360
 in a public place that the person can 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.450
 leave the field you go picking up that 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.430
 No one is obliged to listen to this. 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.830
 No one is obligated, not my people. 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.370
 because I'm on a bus with you 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.370
 you do not know there's no room for the person 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.630
 put one foot on the bus when I 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.880
 I revolted a wheel in April and he did not 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.730
 they are having my wine because it goes 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.240
 preach where he wants but for me tang 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.730
 and a corner that the person has the right to 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.260
 If you leave, you do not have to keep it there. 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.990
 from the ear the person speaking ill of santo 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.780
 in the time of Jesus because my people 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.090
 Let's improve and we will improve what 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.970
 Let's improve what we're going to improve. 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.780
 that we will improve respect because I 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.600
