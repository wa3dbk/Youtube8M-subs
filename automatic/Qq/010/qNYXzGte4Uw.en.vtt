 hello welcome to a like in this 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.930
 tutorial I will show you how to wrap a 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:19.560
 book with a piece of cloth first of 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:24.119
 everything to place is the book at one end 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.109
 and I 'll double it until I get to the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.109
 opposite end 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.920
 now I turn it 'aces' 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.810
 and all you have to do is make 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.980
 a knot 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.980
 here in the center 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.790
 and even if you have too long you can 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.990
 make another knot so that it is double or 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.990
 even a tie 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.080
 and here you would have like wrapping a book 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.080
 in a very original way 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.250
 I wrapped this package with a 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.890
 scarf for the neck but what 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.660
 important is that you use a piece of 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.180
 fabric or a handkerchief that has a shape 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.310
 square and that is the right size to the 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.740
 gift that we are going to wrap whenever 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.420
 be bigger than the gift is 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.460
 technique of wrapping gifts with fabric 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.410
 comes from japan 'and it's called furoshiki 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.570
 and it's a way to take care of the environment 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.090
 environment since using it avoids 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.700
 use wrapping paper that in the end 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.950
 always ends up in the trash so I 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.860
 I encourage you to practice with our 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.690
 videos and that you learn to use it 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.100
 I hope you liked it and do not let 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.100
