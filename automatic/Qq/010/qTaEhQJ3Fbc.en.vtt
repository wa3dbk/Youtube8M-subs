00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.080
 arthur and the minimoys is a movie 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.490
 that tells us the adventures of a child 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.369
 called art 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.760
 he goes on vacation with his grandparents 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.370
 but your grandmother is in a crisis because 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.180
 they want to take his house for lack of 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.550
 payments so artur is going to look for the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.110
 treasure of his grandfather he 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.239
 archibald who disappeared 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.519
 mysteriously so I had to 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.000
 look for him because of the stories he told him 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:58.020
 your grandmother keeps track until you get 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.780
 to the kingdom of the minimoys there already 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.470
 transformed into a minimum and falls in love 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:09.140
 of the selenia princess and also now 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.140
 know the real danger sea 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.350
 what can you want to end the kingdom of 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.630
 the same 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:23.830
 and besides this film he made us 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.369
 something horrible because he cut all the 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.280
 love story of artur and selenium and 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:35.390
 with those cuts completely ruined 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:39.050
 to the movie in the usa and then so 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.280
 in the United States it was not even known 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.500
 this movie but the director luc 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.470
 BessÃ³n says it was because of the cuts that 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.410
 they made this movie but he did not 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.550
 he was looking at us he was looking at his 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:59.979
 country france and when he saw that in his country 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.020
 this movie reached 6 million 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.539
 box office 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.539
 he decided that he had to 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.240
 in two other movies 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.660
 apart from madonna she made the voice of that 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.910
 line and arthur and the minimoys 1 but 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.590
 she would no longer do the line voice in the 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:27.850
 next two so lowers the quality well 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:32.110
 started artur and the same 2 the 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:36.820
 revenge of maltazard here fed up after 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:39.520
 of ten moons a year he returned 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.640
 with his grandparents and now he was part 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.880
 of the great circle of nature but 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.489
 had inconveniences their parents and their 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.670
 parents apparently did not like anything 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.820
 where their grandparents lived and they wanted to go 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.680
 from there as soon as possible artur then 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.670
 logically he did not want that because he wanted 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.670
 see your princess 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.900
 but I had to obey until 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:09.590
 he got a message on a grain of rice 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:12.380
 and saying help and he supposed it was from 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.340
 the minimums so he is sometimes his 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.940
 parents and gets into the world of minimums 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.860
 but not by the telescope he used a 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:26.190
 very dangerous technique 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.980
 they entangled him ropes and they squeeze everything 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.890
 and fell in the kingdom the same more 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.640
 concretely in the pair of meters here 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:39.720
 he is at pemex and he is 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.510
 as a prisoner of unicorns like that 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.350
 that frees him and looks in the way of 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.350
 back home 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.170
 when they arrive they discover that they were not 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:55.180
 the minimums indiscriminately but that 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:59.350
 it was maltazard so that the passage was 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.200
 open and he could grow back if 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.820
 because before it was big 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.970
 thinking that the small universe was 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.090
 better but now he discovered that 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.980
 It is not like this 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:17.340
 then the passage opened and baltasar 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.570
 he entered the human world and he again had 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.790
 its tall size 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:29.340
 the passage the telescope broke and 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.340
 he's pretty stuck in what he is 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:38.970
 in the USA, even if you do not believe it, this movie 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:43.360
 never opened because according to the 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:46.780
 criticism this was the loosest movie 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:52.120
 of the whole trilogy of art and then for 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:55.390
 that did not open in the USA not only in 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.410
 dvds nothing else so it is born was born 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:01.980
 and on the other hand the creator launched a 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:06.180
 video game for the playstation3 for 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:09.460
 promote the movie but this was not 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.940
 successful and apart had nothing to do 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.720
 with him 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.720
 a movie 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.030
 arthur and the war of the worlds' or 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.220
 simply actor josh minimal stress 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.860
 due to the failure of the second part 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.890
 they had to make this part the 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.920
 most spectacular of all so that then 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:37.030
 it was not trilogy not to be so close 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:41.240
 then here in that movie maltazard 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:43.220
 use a potion to summon your 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.720
 army and that also be made of 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:50.780
 Real size while artur idea 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.150
 princess selenia and peta month they are 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.210
 looking now for the way for artur 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.600
 be great again 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.680
 of course he gave everyone a night of love 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.680
 do line 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:10.139
 and here they are looking for something to 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:14.580
 make it come back to reality 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:19.430
 then they search until they find a 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:23.849
 potion of a royal jelly and then 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:26.969
 artur women size however kills 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:30.300
 sari his gesture are attacking with ethics 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:32.419
 that is the tree city then it was 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.139
 necessary to have to call the army 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:42.380
 to record it 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:45.110
 if they did not finish and finally bad rate falls 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:49.360
 now more random would be the new 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:52.129
 scaled the tree family and so 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:56.589
 how do I finish 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:07:00.259
 now yes in this movie in the usa 

00:06:56.589 --> 00:07:01.999
 neither did it premiere what 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:05.360
 did the united states were 

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:08.119
 put together the second and third parts and 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.069
 call her artur and the great adventure for 

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:13.809
 so the second part would not have 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:16.440
 had so empty if arthur and the 

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:19.890
 minimoys 3 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:23.160
 without achieving although a minimum 2 does not 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:26.720
 he looked not so manchester so he 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.720
 they joined and already 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:32.920
 can rehabilitate what is the film of 

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:36.400
 artur that you liked the most for me 

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:38.770
