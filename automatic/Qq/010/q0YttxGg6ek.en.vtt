00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.730 
you just saw one of the little tubs here
tubs<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.520> eyeshadow<00:01:30.180> fall<00:01:30.479> out<00:01:30.780> I've<00:01:31.470> never

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
tubs of eyeshadow fall out I've never

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.280 
tubs of eyeshadow fall out I've never
had<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> problem<00:01:32.340> with<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.390> packaging<00:01:33.869> from<00:01:34.110> BH

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
had a problem with the packaging from BH

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.109 
had a problem with the packaging from BH
before<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.740> that's<00:01:34.860> definitely<00:01:35.490> something

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
before so that's definitely something

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.660 
before so that's definitely something
new<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.960> me<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.470> know<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.159> some<00:01:38.340> other<00:01:38.490> people

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
new for me I know that some other people

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.969 
new for me I know that some other people
have<00:01:39.170> experienced<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.259> before<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.799> I

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
have experienced that before but I

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.190 
have experienced that before but I
believe<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:42.329> wasn't<00:01:42.509> glued<00:01:42.960> down

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
believe that it just wasn't glued down

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.050 
believe that it just wasn't glued down
enough<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.220> didn't<00:01:44.430> break<00:01:44.729> so

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
enough it's not like it didn't break so

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.940 
enough it's not like it didn't break so
that's<00:01:45.329> good<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.380> I'll<00:01:46.470> show<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.860> you
