00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.589
 this is based on a very perverse logic that we Colombians accept and 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:07.650
 colombianas a long time ago 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.829
 and is that see what health education 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:15.250
 food housing are not rights 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.080
 but rather they are private goods that we buy in the market in accordance with 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.039
 that dynamic 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.349
 and that only the poor deserve they deserve state resources 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.369
 we have accepted that we have interviewed deeply 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.749
 in education 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:35.830
 the issue is solved then saying we incorporate the poor into the market 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.860
 but 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.770
 Higher education institutions must compete in the market 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.490
 and save yourself in that market as you can 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.650
 which is exactly what we have seen in the health sector 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.470
 the effects on health have already begun to be seen in higher education 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.010
 and I want to remind you in any case that one of the main flaws in the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.510
 Health sector 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.280
 liquidation 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.470
 of public assurance institutions 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.900
 social security forecast box and all that you want 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.649
 and the liquidation and transformation of hospitals 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.929
 in some agents of the business of providing services 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.920
 those who have adapted have done so from an exhibition 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.350
 labor precariousness 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.560
 and the amount of difficulties that have affected the quality of service 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.380
 and that's like we have not accepted as if they were October 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.770
 our proposal 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.160
 is that we first see what effects are not just 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.880
 in the future but that they are already presenting in higher education 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.930
 in the universities of pamplona tolima sookoo atlantic de los llanos 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.420
 among other 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.640
 that have been adapting 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.930
 increasing their coverage at all costs 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.880
 and at all costs starting with the linking of teachers 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.290
 decreasing the teachers' floor by increasing the flexible plant 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.920
 Occasional and portfolio decreases of research decrease of assignment 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.059
 and adapting to the market 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.169
 work and work training 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:25.199
 in synthesis and to finish 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.689
 we do not agree with the project that has been presented 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.879
 deepening the contrary a long-term trend that we do not believe 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.329
 convenient that it has already shown its health effects and we do not expect that 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.689
 cover education 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.819
 and we prefer rather to oppose the country 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.529
 that we assume higher education 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:48.529
 not only as a training for work 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:53.349
 education as the unesco assembly has recently proposed is 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:59.269
 a public good a human right that allows to consolidate témoc asia justice 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.739
 solidarity 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.549
 autonomy and sovereignty of nations 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.259
 in the middle the social knowledge 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:11.559
 therefore states must assume this as a priority investment front 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:12.829
 sustained 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:13.800
 public 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.840
 expand strategic 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.650
 with a minimum goal of 1% of GDP in investment in public universities 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.509
 in the shortest possible time 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:27.019
 goal of which we are very far still with the approval of the project 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.499
 presents 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.969
 but we insist that the one tone is only of resources 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.829
 it is possible to identify new sources to sustain the investment 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.619
 for example go to oil rent 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.639
 to income whisper to estamos in bonanza of gold 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:47.139
 a redistribution of royalties for example among others then it is not a 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.920
 problem of lack of resources without organization of sources 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:55.249
 but there are also problems of the public policy model 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:59.109
 in countries where investment has predominated public congratulations 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.800
 stable 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.689
 with long-term vision 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.669
 and strategic scientific areas in processes of broad consensus 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.249
 regional and national 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:13.300
 the results in the medium and long term are much better 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.300
 that those who are concentrated in coverage for the poor 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.150
 universalize that is more effective than focusing 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.629
 when it comes to issues that affect the entire population 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:29.900
 education and health are more important are the most important 

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:30.580
 media 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.129
 to develop human capabilities 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.949
 and democracy in society 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.229
 in my condition then of representative of professors 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.379
 of the national university before the superior council 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:45.090
 I make a call to Colombian society 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.870
 to political forces 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.550
 to the presidential candidates who continue to believe that the problem of 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.550
 subsidies 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:56.160
 even 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.210
 to students teachers this baccalaureate and families 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:06.240
 so that we can change the model of higher education policy 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:13.879
 and let's get out of this culture that has us absolutely settled and minimized 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:17.360
 that remembers a lot the famous phrase pambelé 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.120
 it's better to be rich and healthy that is poor and sick 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.400
 we overcome that with tere universal facts at least for health and 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.580
 pedra education
