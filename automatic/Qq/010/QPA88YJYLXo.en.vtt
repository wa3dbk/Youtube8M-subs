200 degree Celsius that is 400 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:03:56.769> we<00:03:57.190> started<00:03:57.819> with<00:03:58.030> for<00:03:58.299> about<00:03:58.420> 10

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
Fahrenheit we started with for about 10

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.809 
Fahrenheit we started with for about 10
minutes<00:03:59.109> and<00:03:59.380> then<00:03:59.440> see<00:03:59.950> what<00:04:00.190> will<00:04:00.430> happen

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
minutes and then see what will happen

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.660 
minutes and then see what will happen
after<00:04:01.810> 10<00:04:02.230> minutes<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.739> baking<00:04:02.889> let<00:04:03.310> me<00:04:03.489> open

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
after 10 minutes of baking let me open

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.150 
after 10 minutes of baking let me open
this<00:04:04.000> up<00:04:04.209> and<00:04:04.780> see<00:04:05.310> they<00:04:06.310> are<00:04:06.370> still<00:04:06.730> not<00:04:07.030> ready

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160

let's<00:04:11.769> make<00:04:12.250> them<00:04:12.489> upside<00:04:13.209> down<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:13.780> that<00:04:13.810> they

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
let's make them upside down so that they

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:28.270 
let's make them upside down so that they
