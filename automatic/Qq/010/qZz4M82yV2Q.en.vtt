00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.279
 eyebrows and I'm taking this 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.410
 crayon of the be sure brand that is a 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.289
 water proof is in the number 2 tone is 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.050
 a coffee and it really is a has a 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.940
 a red sub tone but it does not show much 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.670
 can serve us for the newspaper 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.559
 perfectly and well this one that I'm going 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.260
 to seal with some of the shadows of 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.230
 the palettes my land of viso we have 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.359
 the options in the one of puebla has a 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.730
 darker hue of the more with the 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:51.820
 darker coffee in the de jalisco comes 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.320
 a medium tone is the most clear and 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.269
 the intermediate that comes in the 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.510
 Veracruz that is the one that I will occupy 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.579
 to seal the final part of the eyebrow and 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.020
 then I'm going to go up to the 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.110
 head 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.880
 what are you approaching towards the nose and 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.950
 you with this we already have an eyebrow 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.080
 quite presentable those patients 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.090
 use a foundation that already 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.100
 do not occupy that I am going to occupy this one that is 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.440
 one of my favorites that is julia's 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.740
 Sanchez in beige tone that is one more tone 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.690
 clear that mine but that serves quite 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.670
 and it has very good coverage as can 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.620
 measure can serve us even for 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.830
 as a prebase of shadows I am 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.750
 occupying to mark the eyebrow below 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.479
 and as a prebase of shadows can 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.250
 seal with a translucent powder or so 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.910
 then I'm going to take this shadow that I 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.250
 love is a white with its pink tone 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.050
 mate that comes in the palette of people and 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.020
 I will occupy it to illuminate the bone 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.070
 of the eyebrow the lacrimal and the eyelid 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.600
 I'm going to compact and blur it 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.369
 then take the shade of a blush 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.970
 that comes from veracruz that is a 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.040
 orange tonality with its very pink tone 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.660
 I'm going to blur it in the crease 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.700
 it's going to be our transition color 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.979
 then we can select any 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.090
 of the three coffee shades that already 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.610
 I had mentioned them from the pallets 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.580
 and I'm going to occupy the two darker ones for 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.459
 mark the fold of the eye I'm going to 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.900
 diffuse inward eyelid 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.819
 as much as you want our 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.950
 elevated enlarge the dimension of the eye and 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.840
 I will also blur it below 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.819
 the lower lashes and what they were a 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.069
 little more closed the smoked can 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.510
 use a smaller brush is I'm going 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.489
 to mix these two tonalities that 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.610
 they come in the one from Jalisco which is a color 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.650
 mole and it's a silver and I'm going to mix them 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.540
 and I'm going to compact them in the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.160
 external eyelid can 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.930
 use any of the other colors 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.060
 but it seems to me that this is more proper 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.000
 to go to work for example 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.340
 then take a pencil eyeliner that 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.989
 occupy the one of Ã©motifs that I have but 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.360
 I really recommend you I could not 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.459
 find the one in visu in black color is 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.500
 against water and it would serve us much better 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.060
 then I'm going to curl the lashes with 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.310
 this subtracter that I recommend a lot 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.930
 of the Aldana Paris brand that made it 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.120
 the eyelashes and they do not leave them very 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.730
 squares does not leave them very well and does not 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.790
 pinch the skin after I will apply 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.310
 mascara on many layers 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.170
 of the Sanssouci brand and he held this 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.810
 because it's against water 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.599
 that lifts my eyelashes and this is the 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.390
 final result without false eyelashes 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:26.150
 nothing very dramatic something very presentable 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.920
 with what we can go to work for 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.370
 with what we are going to feel comfortable 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.470
 nothing scandalous very neutral and up 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.040
 elegantly and easily we can 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.600
 turn into an evening look by adding 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.239
 most marked eyeliner and maybe a 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.650
 little bit of glitter in the lacrimal 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.000
 then I will occupy the blushes be 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.830
 The ones I like the most are those of 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.500
 veracruz puebla and chiapas and I'm going to 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:52.010
 Mix in my brush to apply them 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.260
 slightly on the cheeks with this this 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.790
 brooch that is very loose and then 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.130
 I'm going to make a recommendation this 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.260
 shadow in champagne color also from the 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.620
 brand to give to paris serves us very well 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.230
 it's creamy enough to light up the most 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.700
 high of our cheeks the little bone what 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.920
 let's contact with your fingers and 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.780
 then blurs for the lips I'm 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.989
 occupying this the skin will also already give 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.180
 which is on one side is duo on one side is 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.040
 matte and the other side is the brightness without 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.200
 However, I only occupied the part 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.720
 material that right now is 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.490
 very fashionable and really if it remains matt what 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.590
 only unique comment is that the 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.410
 product if it stays very sticky 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.350
 as time goes by and for that reason 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.260
 I recommend in the soft made version 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.780
 nights and the mix that is much more 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.250
 creamy and does not dry lips and then 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.470
 that's all girls I hope you have them 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.880
 really liked this tutorial for 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.370

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.500

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.000
