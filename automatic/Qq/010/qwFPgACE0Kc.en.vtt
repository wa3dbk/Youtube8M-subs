00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.439 

so<00:00:01.319> this<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:01.680> what<00:00:01.829> it's<00:00:01.979> all<00:00:02.129> about<00:00:02.700> non-stop

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
so this is what it's all about non-stop

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.070 
so this is what it's all about non-stop
operation<00:00:03.689> for<00:00:04.500> ampere<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.250> we're<00:00:06.029> John<00:00:06.240> from

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
operation for ampere and we're John from

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.789 
operation for ampere and we're John from
the<00:00:07.470> wall

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
the wall

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.190 
the wall
hi<00:00:07.890> John<00:00:08.189> I<00:00:08.309> know<00:00:08.429> we've<00:00:08.820> got<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.420> selection<00:00:09.990> of

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
hi John I know we've got a selection of

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.839 
hi John I know we've got a selection of
batteries<00:00:10.620> here<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.580> like<00:00:11.730> the

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
batteries here and this is like the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.120 
batteries here and this is like the
evolution<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.660> arteries<00:00:13.080> over<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.410> last<00:00:13.620> 15

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
evolution of arteries over the last 15

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.760 
evolution of arteries over the last 15
or<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:14.490> years<00:00:14.519> no<00:00:15.450> we've<00:00:16.139> came<00:00:16.320> right<00:00:16.560> up<00:00:16.710> to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
or so years no we've came right up to

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.790 
or so years no we've came right up to
the<00:00:17.039> present<00:00:17.369> day<00:00:17.400> we've<00:00:17.730> got<00:00:17.850> four<00:00:18.330> ampere

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
the present day we've got four ampere

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.320 
the present day we've got four ampere
left<00:00:19.800> him<00:00:19.949> iron<00:00:20.100> barley<00:00:20.400> from<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.850> wall<00:00:21.000> what

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
left him iron barley from the wall what

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.750 
left him iron barley from the wall what
was<00:00:21.660> special<00:00:21.960> about<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.490> well<00:00:23.490> it's<00:00:23.609> really

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
was special about this well it's really

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.849 
was special about this well it's really
just<00:00:23.910> giving<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.539> an<00:00:24.750> incredible<00:00:25.529> amount<00:00:25.710> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
just giving you an incredible amount a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.589 
just giving you an incredible amount a
runtime<00:00:26.279> compared<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.000> what<00:00:27.150> batteries<00:00:27.510> have

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
runtime compared to what batteries have

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.779 
runtime compared to what batteries have
been<00:00:27.720> available<00:00:27.930> before<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.740> even<00:00:29.250> compared

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
been available before and even compared

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.490 
been available before and even compared
to<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.720> last<00:00:30.929> year<00:00:31.140> when<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:31.289> launched

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
to the the last year when we launched

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.920 
to the the last year when we launched
the<00:00:31.650> 3<00:00:31.859> ampere<00:00:32.189> has<00:00:32.430> given<00:00:32.669> me<00:00:32.840> 33%<00:00:33.840> more

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
the 3 ampere has given me 33% more

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.590 
the 3 ampere has given me 33% more
runtime<00:00:34.590> there<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.579> it's<00:00:35.760> also<00:00:35.940> exactly<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
runtime there and it's also exactly the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.020 
runtime there and it's also exactly the
same<00:00:36.870> way<00:00:37.110> as<00:00:37.320> before<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.460> know<00:00:38.520> again

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
same way as before so you know again

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.209 
same way as before so you know again
benefit<00:00:39.719> some<00:00:39.870> more<00:00:39.989> run<00:00:40.170> time<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.010> same

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
benefit some more run time in the same

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.760 
benefit some more run time in the same
way<00:00:41.280> as<00:00:41.610> well<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.149> incredible<00:00:42.739> what<00:00:43.739> I

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
way as well so it's incredible what I

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.639 
way as well so it's incredible what I
noticed<00:00:44.250> was<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.789> week<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.469> compared<00:00:46.469> to

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
noticed was the week that compared to

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.580 
noticed was the week that compared to
that<00:00:46.800> no<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.120> linked<00:00:49.050> evening<00:00:49.379> is

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
that no this is linked evening is

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.110 
that no this is linked evening is
technology<00:00:49.950> if<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.370> look<00:00:50.489> back<00:00:50.670> at<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:50.969> one

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
technology if you look back at this one

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.660 
technology if you look back at this one
this<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.420> original<00:00:51.809> maked<00:00:52.489> technology<00:00:53.489> to

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
this is a original maked technology to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.639 
this is a original maked technology to
amperes<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.449> was<00:00:54.629> launched<00:00:55.350> pretty

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
amperes and this was launched pretty

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.650 
amperes and this was launched pretty
much<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.980> early<00:00:56.219> nineties<00:00:56.550> right<00:00:56.760> mid<00:00:57.239> 90s

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
much the early nineties right mid 90s

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.020 
much the early nineties right mid 90s
and<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.930> original<00:00:58.680> Dewalt<00:00:58.980> range<00:00:59.190> saw<00:00:59.430> 2<00:00:59.670> ampere

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
and a original Dewalt range saw 2 ampere

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.020 
and a original Dewalt range saw 2 ampere
that<00:01:00.300> then<00:01:00.870> developed<00:01:01.850> entered<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
that then developed entered in a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.759 
that then developed entered in a
chemical<00:01:03.359> hybrid<00:01:03.690> which<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.409> could<00:01:04.619> get

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
chemical hybrid which you could get

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.160 
chemical hybrid which you could get
higher<00:01:05.010> capacity<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.450> then<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.930> come<00:01:07.080> out

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
higher capacity and then I come out

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.750 
higher capacity and then I come out
hydrate<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.710> means<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.070> could<00:01:08.220> get<00:01:08.340> bigger

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
hydrate that means you could get bigger

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.640 
hydrate that means you could get bigger
amperes<00:01:09.150> or<00:01:09.420> two<00:01:09.600> point<00:01:09.810> six<00:01:09.990> amperes<00:01:10.380> more

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
amperes or two point six amperes more

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.280 
amperes or two point six amperes more
Hrunting<00:01:11.540> don't<00:01:12.540> say<00:01:12.689> then<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.900> come<00:01:13.049> behind

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
Hrunting don't say then I come behind

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.899 
Hrunting don't say then I come behind
rigs<00:01:13.560> or<00:01:13.680> was<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.310> didn't<00:01:14.549> quite<00:01:14.640> get<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
rigs or was you didn't quite get the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.490 
rigs or was you didn't quite get the
same<00:01:15.060> amount<00:01:15.270> or<00:01:15.390> reach<00:01:15.570> out<00:01:15.720> cycles<00:01:16.229> as<00:01:16.320> naked

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
same amount or reach out cycles as naked

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.969 
same amount or reach out cycles as naked
however<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.700> did<00:01:17.909> get<00:01:18.350> more<00:01:19.350> run<00:01:19.530> time<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
however you did get more run time of the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.890 
however you did get more run time of the
battery<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.729> was<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> bit<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.540> balancing

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
battery so it was a bit of a balancing

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.480 
battery so it was a bit of a balancing
act<00:01:22.020> rest<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.439> what<00:01:22.560> was<00:01:22.710> best<00:01:22.920> for<00:01:23.070> what<00:01:23.280> use

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
act rest of what was best for what use

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.420 
act rest of what was best for what use

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.219 
mind and then there's a two hour and
then<00:01:29.549> last<00:01:29.790> year<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.030> launched<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> 3<00:01:30.869> ampere

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
then last year we launched the 3 ampere

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.030 
then last year we launched the 3 ampere
XR<00:01:31.829> which<00:01:32.040> has<00:01:32.159> been<00:01:32.369> an<00:01:32.549> incredible

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
XR which has been an incredible

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.890 
XR which has been an incredible
revolution<00:01:35.040> for<00:01:35.400> us<00:01:35.520> basically<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:36.689> been<00:01:36.810> a

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
revolution for us basically it's been a

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.340 
revolution for us basically it's been a
major<00:01:37.200> success<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:37.829> us<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.400> then<00:01:38.520> to

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
major success for us and then to

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.810 
major success for us and then to
strengthen<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.530> we've<00:01:41.040> now<00:01:41.189> developed<00:01:41.369> that

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
strengthen that we've now developed that

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.120 
strengthen that we've now developed that
the<00:01:42.659> market<00:01:43.079> leader<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.320> for<00:01:43.680> ampere<00:01:44.100> of

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the market leader and for ampere of

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.760

part<00:01:56.330> on<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.140> job<00:01:57.350> say<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:58.100> realtor<00:01:58.520> we've

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
part on the job say and realtor we've

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.219 
part on the job say and realtor we've
tested<00:01:59.270> this<00:01:59.950> ourselves<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.720> we've<00:02:02.720> got<00:02:02.930> some

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
tested this ourselves and we've got some

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.260 
tested this ourselves and we've got some
donors<00:02:03.530> say<00:02:03.650> there's<00:02:03.979> go<00:02:04.100> 1,600<00:02:04.970> screws

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
donors say there's go 1,600 screws

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.899 
donors say there's go 1,600 screws
there's<00:02:05.840> one<00:02:06.050> battery<00:02:06.530> charge<00:02:06.759> so<00:02:07.759> that's

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
there's one battery charge so that's

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.990 
there's one battery charge so that's
amazing<00:02:08.479> that's<00:02:08.920> again<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.280> I'm<00:02:10.369> dependent<00:02:10.880> on

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
amazing that's again so I'm dependent on

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.850 
amazing that's again so I'm dependent on
what<00:02:11.630> tool<00:02:11.840> you'd<00:02:12.050> use<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.470> what<00:02:12.650> type<00:02:12.830> of

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
what tool you'd use and what type of

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.440 
what tool you'd use and what type of
screws<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:13.340> using<00:02:13.880> of<00:02:14.000> what<00:02:14.150> you're<00:02:14.300> putting

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
screws you using of what you're putting

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.199 
screws you using of what you're putting
into<00:02:14.660> but<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.440> safest<00:02:16.130> way<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.459> explain<00:02:17.030> is

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
into but the safest way to explain is

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.030 
into but the safest way to explain is
the<00:02:17.360> 4<00:02:17.569> ampere<00:02:17.900> has<00:02:18.110> given<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:18.470> so<00:02:18.770> whatever

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
the 4 ampere has given you so whatever

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.260 
the 4 ampere has given you so whatever
you've<00:02:19.250> been<00:02:19.280> doing<00:02:19.489> before<00:02:19.670> with<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.120> 3

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
you've been doing before with the 3

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.320 
you've been doing before with the 3
ampere<00:02:20.660> you're<00:02:21.080> going<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.380> get<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.530> genuine<00:02:22.330> 33%

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
ampere you're going to get a genuine 33%

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.590 
ampere you're going to get a genuine 33%
more<00:02:23.420> run<00:02:23.900> thing<00:02:24.170> from<00:02:24.800> it's<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.850> new<00:02:26.000> battery

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
more run thing from it's the new battery

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.180 
more run thing from it's the new battery
that's<00:02:26.840> exactly<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.290> same<00:02:27.500> fitment<00:02:27.920> as<00:02:28.010> well

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
that's exactly the same fitment as well

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.590 
that's exactly the same fitment as well
so<00:02:28.519> they're<00:02:28.850> all<00:02:28.970> compatible

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
so they're all compatible

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.720 
so they're all compatible
oh<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.019> 18<00:02:30.260> volt<00:02:30.500> stuff<00:02:30.769> so<00:02:30.920> compatible<00:02:31.340> yeah

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
oh the 18 volt stuff so compatible yeah

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.850 
oh the 18 volt stuff so compatible yeah
so<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.269> what<00:02:32.690> differences<00:02:33.080> this<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.530> yellow

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
so the what differences this is yellow

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.680 
so the what differences this is yellow
and<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.130> torque<00:02:34.340> not<00:02:34.550> exactly<00:02:34.880> what<00:02:35.360> one<00:02:35.510> other

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
and a torque not exactly what one other

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.140 
and a torque not exactly what one other
media<00:02:36.320> development<00:02:37.250> we've<00:02:37.430> put<00:02:37.640> on<00:02:37.760> this<00:02:37.940> note

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
media development we've put on this note

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.330 
media development we've put on this note
is<00:02:38.360> there<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:39.170> state<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.590> charge<00:02:39.800> indicator

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
is there the state of charge indicator

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.640 
is there the state of charge indicator
right<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:40.940> again<00:02:41.600> before<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.930> go<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.260> say<00:02:42.470> in

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
right so again before you go and say in

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.900 
right so again before you go and say in
the<00:02:42.739> morning<00:02:42.860> you<00:02:43.250> can<00:02:43.430> just<00:02:43.610> press<00:02:43.730> the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
the morning you can just press the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.160 
the morning you can just press the
button<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.269> see<00:02:44.420> exactly<00:02:44.690> what<00:02:44.900> you've<00:02:45.019> got

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
button to see exactly what you've got

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.960 
button to see exactly what you've got
left<00:02:45.350> in<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.590> fuel<00:02:45.830> tanks<00:02:46.220> or<00:02:46.430> you're<00:02:46.820> not

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
left in a fuel tanks or you're not

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.780 
left in a fuel tanks or you're not
charging<00:02:47.330> batteries<00:02:48.640> unnecessarily<00:02:49.640> and

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
charging batteries unnecessarily and

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.729 
charging batteries unnecessarily and
also<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:50.540> don't<00:02:50.660> think<00:02:50.989> about<00:02:51.110> this<00:02:51.410> feel

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
also you don't think about this feel

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.050 
also you don't think about this feel
feel<00:02:52.100> recharged<00:02:52.459> you're<00:02:52.640> not<00:02:52.760> going<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:53.000> go

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
feel recharged you're not going to go

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.190 
feel recharged you're not going to go
all<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.239> way<00:02:53.360> up<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.780> top<00:02:53.989> of<00:02:54.140> the

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
all the way up to the top of the

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.290 
all the way up to the top of the
building<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:54.650> then<00:02:55.040> find<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.459> it's<00:02:56.060> flat

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
building and then find it it's flat

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.479 
building and then find it it's flat
quickly<00:02:56.690> so<00:02:56.870> it's<00:02:57.290> safely<00:02:57.920> tells<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.340> exactly

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
quickly so it's safely tells you exactly

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.699 
quickly so it's safely tells you exactly
so<00:02:58.820> we've<00:02:58.970> got<00:02:59.120> two<00:02:59.299> thoughts<00:02:59.570> when<00:03:00.350> you<00:03:00.500> turn

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
so we've got two thoughts when you turn

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.979 
so we've got two thoughts when you turn
one<00:03:01.310> bar<00:03:01.579> left<00:03:01.610> as<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:02.239> thought<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.630> charge

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
one bar left as I thought the charge

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.509 
one bar left as I thought the charge
exactly<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:03.950> long<00:03:04.040> as<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.250> think<00:03:04.430> the

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
exactly and the long as it think the

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.170 
exactly and the long as it think the
charges<00:03:04.820> on<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.620> 70<00:03:06.620> minutes<00:03:06.890> for<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.670> 4<00:03:07.850> ampere

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180
