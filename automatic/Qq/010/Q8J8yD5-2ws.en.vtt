yeah<00:03:29.799> it<00:03:29.950> becomes<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.310> little<00:03:30.340> awkward<00:03:31.120> once

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
yeah it becomes a little awkward once

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.650 
yeah it becomes a little awkward once
you<00:03:31.600> take<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:31.900> out<00:03:32.049> putting<00:03:32.650> it<00:03:32.739> back<00:03:32.890> together

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
you take it out putting it back together

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.500 
you take it out putting it back together
at<00:03:34.660> times<00:03:34.930> leave<00:03:35.230> some<00:03:35.470> gaps

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
at times leave some gaps

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.960 
at times leave some gaps

at the back the ultrapixel camera and

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.949 
at the back the ultrapixel camera and
there's<00:03:47.709> LED<00:03:48.069> flash<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.579> below<00:03:49.239> this<00:03:49.480> is<00:03:49.900> a

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
there's LED flash and below this is a

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.619 
there's LED flash and below this is a
fingerprint<00:03:50.739> scanner<00:03:50.819> now<00:03:51.819> the<00:03:52.150> fingerprint

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
fingerprint scanner now the fingerprint

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.300 
fingerprint scanner now the fingerprint
scan<00:03:52.840> it's<00:03:52.989> pretty<00:03:53.260> cool<00:03:53.439> because<00:03:53.650> you<00:03:54.280> can

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310
