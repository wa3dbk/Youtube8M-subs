anyway<00:00:32.489> it's<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.180> good<00:00:33.329> map<00:00:33.570> it's<00:00:33.899> really<00:00:34.200> big

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
anyway it's a good map it's really big

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.440 
anyway it's a good map it's really big
so<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.920> suggested<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.820> people<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.329> get

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
so I I suggested the people that get

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.880 
so I I suggested the people that get
teleported<00:00:36.780> something<00:00:37.350> like<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.590> country

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
teleported something like that country

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.860 
teleported something like that country
teleport<00:00:38.820> they're<00:00:39.059> weak<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.329> heal<00:00:39.510> by<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.719> way

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
teleport they're weak to heal by the way

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.330 
teleport they're weak to heal by the way
I<00:00:39.899> guess

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
I guess

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.280 
I guess
anyway<00:00:41.760> Drake's<00:00:42.059> brakes<00:00:42.510> are<00:00:42.750> very<00:00:43.110> good

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
anyway Drake's brakes are very good

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.170 
anyway Drake's brakes are very good
