00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
now before we started before we start

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.630 
now before we started before we start
writing<00:01:22.049> JavaScript<00:01:22.799> there's<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.189> couple<00:01:23.460> of

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
writing JavaScript there's a couple of

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.660 
writing JavaScript there's a couple of
things<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.030> need<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.210> know<00:01:24.530> first<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.890> can't

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
things you need to know first I can't

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.899 
things you need to know first I can't
stress<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.659> enough<00:01:27.890> but<00:01:28.890> JavaScript<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
stress this enough but JavaScript and

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.960 
stress this enough but JavaScript and
Java<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:31.400> completely<00:01:32.400> different<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:33.090> two

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
Java is completely different it's two

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.580 
Java is completely different it's two
different<00:01:35.970> languages<00:01:36.320> one<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.409> them

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
different languages one of them

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.429 
different languages one of them
javascript<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:39.119> whip<00:01:39.420> based<00:01:39.840> programming

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
javascript is a whip based programming

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.080 
javascript is a whip based programming
language<00:01:40.799> or<00:01:40.979> scripting<00:01:41.400> language<00:01:41.899> Java<00:01:42.899> is

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
language or scripting language Java is

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.740 
language or scripting language Java is
more<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:46.079> desktop<00:01:46.860> programming<00:01:47.460> language

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
more of a desktop programming language

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.719 
more of a desktop programming language
if<00:01:48.750> that's<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.500> right<00:01:49.649> way<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.890> say<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.159> Java

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
if that's the right way to say it Java

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.670 
if that's the right way to say it Java
is<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.420> C<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.320> C++<00:01:53.689> whereas<00:01:54.689> JavaScript<00:01:55.439> is

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
is like C and C++ whereas JavaScript is

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.600 
is like C and C++ whereas JavaScript is
completely<00:01:56.490> web-based<00:01:57.619> okay<00:01:58.619> before

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
completely web-based okay before

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.700 
completely web-based okay before
learning<00:02:00.149> JavaScript<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.320> need<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.590> know

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
learning JavaScript you need to know

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
learning JavaScript you need to know
HTML

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
HTML

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.410 
HTML
and<00:02:03.820> CSS<00:02:04.560> it's<00:02:05.560> you<00:02:06.280> need<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.550> know<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.880> basic

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
and CSS it's you need to know the basic

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.920 
and CSS it's you need to know the basic
understanding<00:02:07.780> of<00:02:08.460> those<00:02:09.460> two<00:02:09.670> it's<00:02:10.240> highly

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
understanding of those two it's highly

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.510 
understanding of those two it's highly
recommended<00:02:11.530> because<00:02:11.680> what<00:02:12.010> JavaScript

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
recommended because what JavaScript

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.990 
recommended because what JavaScript
basically<00:02:12.730> does<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.830> chain<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:15.700> can<00:02:15.820> use

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
basically does is chain you can use

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.560 
basically does is chain you can use
JavaScript<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.780> change<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.800> HTML<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.640> CSS<00:02:19.000> of

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
JavaScript to change the HTML and CSS of

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.710 
JavaScript to change the HTML and CSS of
your<00:02:20.560> website<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:21.250> make<00:02:21.640> your<00:02:21.970> website<00:02:22.450> look

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
your website to make your website look

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.320 
your website to make your website look
as<00:02:23.110> if<00:02:23.380> it's<00:02:23.560> moving<00:02:23.800> say<00:02:24.400> for<00:02:24.610> example<00:02:25.060> you

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
as if it's moving say for example you

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.140 
as if it's moving say for example you
have<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.930> website<00:02:26.680> with<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.340> background<00:02:27.670> color

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
have a website with a background color

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.950 
have a website with a background color
of<00:02:28.390> blue<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:31.060> visitor<00:02:31.450> presses<00:02:31.930> a

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
of blue and you the visitor presses a

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.170 
of blue and you the visitor presses a
button<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:33.310> background<00:02:33.670> color<00:02:33.910> changes

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
button and that background color changes

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.710 
button and that background color changes
to<00:02:34.660> yellow<00:02:34.750> that's<00:02:35.650> not<00:02:35.860> really<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.720> practical

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
to yellow that's not really a practical

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.830 
to yellow that's not really a practical
example<00:02:38.140> however<00:02:39.130> it's<00:02:39.760> still<00:02:40.030> an<00:02:40.330> example<00:02:40.750> to

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
example however it's still an example to

visitor that you need to type in stuff
in<00:05:19.570> here<00:05:19.930> so<00:05:20.530> if<00:05:20.950> I<00:05:21.370> say<00:05:21.820> for<00:05:22.150> example<00:05:22.320> one<00:05:23.320> name

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
jar or anything and I press send email

that<00:05:26.860> bit<00:05:27.100> because<00:05:27.280> it's<00:05:27.730> filmed<00:05:28.060> in<00:05:28.210> goes

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
that bit because it's filmed in goes

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.060 
that bit because it's filmed in goes
back<00:05:29.169> to<00:05:29.350> weight<00:05:29.500> but<00:05:30.130> if<00:05:30.190> I<00:05:30.340> delete<00:05:30.669> it<00:05:32.070> it

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
back to weight but if I delete it it

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.090 
back to weight but if I delete it it
goes<00:05:33.310> to<00:05:33.340> red<00:05:33.910> telling<00:05:34.870> the<00:05:35.169> visitor<00:05:35.590> that

goes to red telling the visitor that

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.830 
goes to red telling the visitor that
there's<00:05:36.520> an<00:05:36.700> error<00:05:36.970> you<00:05:37.360> need<00:05:37.570> to<00:05:37.720> actually

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
there's an error you need to actually

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.510 
there's an error you need to actually
put<00:05:38.080> in<00:05:38.620> stuff<00:05:39.100> here

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
put in stuff here

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.420 
put in stuff here
so<00:05:40.270> that's<00:05:40.570> JavaScript<00:05:41.260> and<00:05:41.560> also<00:05:42.250> when<00:05:42.400> I

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
so that's JavaScript and also when I

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.300 
so that's JavaScript and also when I
click<00:05:42.730> on<00:05:43.000> the<00:05:43.720> Contacts<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.650> surrounding

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
click on the Contacts the surrounding

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.950 
click on the Contacts the surrounding
becomes<00:05:46.380> darker<00:05:47.380> so<00:05:47.980> that<00:05:48.190> you<00:05:49.120> can<00:05:49.300> focus<00:05:49.600> on

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
becomes darker so that you can focus on

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.330 
becomes darker so that you can focus on
the<00:05:50.169> form<00:05:50.410> itself<00:05:51.180> and<00:05:52.180> that's<00:05:52.900> why<00:05:53.050> it

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
the form itself and that's why it

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.090 
the form itself and that's why it
javascript<00:05:54.340> is<00:05:54.520> really<00:05:55.090> cool<00:05:55.450> it's<00:05:56.440> a<00:05:56.740> really

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
javascript is really cool it's a really

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.510 
javascript is really cool it's a really
fun<00:05:57.430> language<00:05:57.790> to<00:05:57.940> learn<00:05:58.060> HTML<00:05:59.050> CSS<00:05:59.370> HTML<00:06:00.370> was

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
fun language to learn HTML CSS HTML was

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.400 
fun language to learn HTML CSS HTML was
basically<00:06:00.910> a<00:06:01.030> markup<00:06:01.450> language<00:06:01.480> so<00:06:02.050> it<00:06:02.290> only

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
basically a markup language so it only

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.550 
basically a markup language so it only
used<00:06:02.770> tags<00:06:03.550> to<00:06:04.000> describe<00:06:04.450> the<00:06:04.900> website<00:06:05.260> and

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
used tags to describe the website and

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.659 
used tags to describe the website and
CSS<00:06:06.190> only<00:06:06.870> change<00:06:07.870> or<00:06:08.350> you<00:06:08.710> declared<00:06:09.340> the<00:06:09.490> way

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
CSS only change or you declared the way

roughly<00:06:41.009> on<00:06:42.000> the<00:06:42.300> basic<00:06:42.629> of<00:06:42.720> JavaScript<00:06:43.319> and

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
roughly on the basic of JavaScript and

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.600 
roughly on the basic of JavaScript and
I'm<00:06:44.250> thinking<00:06:44.970> of<00:06:45.090> doing<00:06:45.120> about<00:06:45.629> like<00:06:45.870> a

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610 
I'm thinking of doing about like a

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.279 
I'm thinking of doing about like a
playlist<00:06:47.610> series<00:06:48.419> for<00:06:48.930> each<00:06:49.139> project<00:06:49.949> say

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:51.289 
playlist series for each project say

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:55.249 
playlist series for each project say
fully<00:06:52.289> working<00:06:52.770> for<00:06:53.669> validating<00:06:54.270> or<00:06:54.720> I<00:06:54.780> don't

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:55.259 
fully working for validating or I don't

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:57.350 
fully working for validating or I don't
know<00:06:55.500> like<00:06:55.680> a<00:06:55.740> calculator<00:06:56.370> in<00:06:56.789> your<00:06:56.970> website

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
know like a calculator in your website

know like a calculator in your website
and<00:06:57.539> so<00:06:57.750> on<00:06:57.949> something<00:06:58.949> like<00:06:59.039> that<00:06:59.190> I<00:06:59.220> haven't

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
and so on something like that I haven't

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.540 
and so on something like that I haven't
decided<00:06:59.729> yet<00:06:59.940> but<00:07:00.599> yeah<00:07:00.919> stay<00:07:01.919> tuned<00:07:02.190> for<00:07:02.400> more
