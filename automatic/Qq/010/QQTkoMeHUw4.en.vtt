00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.670
 or the people who are welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.069
 in this opportunity I want to introduce you 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.920
 the difference between a battery of 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.110
 samsung original and one that is not 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:17.279
 original an imitation the copy 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.890
 good at first glance they look good both 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.050
 they say samsung and everything 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.050
 they even say where they are made 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.530
 the percentage of threshing when it goes to 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.870
 last two thousand 500 thousand empires 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.690
 but the big difference is in the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.660
 colors although both have a different 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.760
 color one is more the colors are more more 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.440
 real ones stronger and the other are the 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.859
 colors as well as 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.370
 you see you do not see what a good copy is 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:54.900
 the right is the original and that of the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.210
 left is the one that is imitation 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.820
 the other difference that I want to show you 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.670
 between this one that is imitation and this one that 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.570
 It is original 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.060
 when they see the positive side and 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.680
 negative you here in where you do not 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.649
 it's original they're going to see a simple 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.500
 triangle and in which it is original they go to 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.500
 see what says positive and negative see it 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.530
 well and now we have both turned this 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.750
 it's still imitation and this one continues 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.480
 being the original is also followed 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.580
 seeing a triangle in the room and 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.410
 in the other one you see 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.260
 positive or negative good to the camera not 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.050
 reaches of the sun 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.570
 but this is a big difference that 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.270
 also the colors in the part of 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.360
 positive and negative and we go for another 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.090
 good difference and also wanted 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.820
 tell them something very important when 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.290
 you see here where will you go 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.290
 connected to the cell phone 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:02.450
 you will notice that the real one is one more color 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.810
 orange and fake is one more color 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.780
 yellow and 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:14.750
 I want to emphasize that the false 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.750
 what is there has is a little more 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.180
 as I tell you more deeper and the other 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.410
 the original stands out more so that is 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.410
 one of the big differences 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.170
 already good these are one of the few 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.660
 things that I could find something else 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.260
 What I want to mention is that the batteries 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.150
 false imitations will never yield 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.450
 equal to the original and that everyone 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.300
 he knows 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.580
 because the fake battery when you put it on 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.160
 to the device I realized that the 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.940
 battery sometimes does not tell you how much is going 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.459
 to pay to the cell phone 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.580
 it just goes off and that's not good 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.010
 it's not good for the cell phone it's like a 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.120
 computer what happens when it shuts down like this 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.239
 immediately 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.060
 it's the same and that's why I do not 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.180
 I recommend for nothing 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.950
 This is a battery that practically if 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.099
 you can get out of trouble in some 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.420
 moments but not more so I 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.690
 I recommend buying second battery 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.450
 original 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.150
 that they investigate in the companies of 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.430
 samsung in your country in your locality or 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.400
 simply with the dresser that would be 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.040
 a very very good idea to buy a 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.380
 anything original battery 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.780
 you want to know or ask me 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.330
 just leave me a comment I'll 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.610
 I will respond to the seriousness and I hope 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.890
 that the video was useful for him 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.950
 For future purchases 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.530
 and by the way I wanted to tell you finally 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.430
 that when they buy a battery, look 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.960
 that comes sealed that come packages 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:57.069
 those are original you already know how to detect 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.019
 which is false and which is not so good 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.359
 I wait for you in the next video I hope 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.420
 subscribe and thank you very much for your 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.420
 Attention
