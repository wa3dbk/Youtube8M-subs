00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
here's my skateboard it's supposed to be

here's my skateboard it's supposed to be
a<00:00:39.390> seven-point<00:00:39.989> 75<00:00:41.300> that's<00:00:42.300> what<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.600> ordered

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
but I believe this is an 8 which if you

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.119 
but I believe this is an 8 which if you
don't<00:00:47.160> know<00:00:47.340> there's<00:00:47.820> sizes<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.719> stuff<00:00:49.129> and

got some tensor truck right here that if

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.759 
got some tensor truck right here that if
somebody<00:02:46.269> gave<00:02:46.359> me<00:02:46.420> because<00:02:46.900> they<00:02:47.290> snap<00:02:47.530> one

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
of the board so I had before I got a

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.539 
of the board so I had before I got a
good<00:02:49.299> board<00:02:49.739> which<00:02:50.739> I<00:02:50.859> don't<00:02:50.980> really<00:02:51.069> care<00:02:51.280> for

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
good board which I don't really care for

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.270 
good board which I don't really care for
wood<00:02:52.950> got<00:02:53.950> some<00:02:54.129> Spitfire<00:02:54.640> wheels<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.269> some

wood got some Spitfire wheels and some

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.660 
wood got some Spitfire wheels and some
basically<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:59.349> cheap<00:02:59.650> bearings<00:03:00.099> I<00:03:00.400> think

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
basically the cheap bearings I think

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.789

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
take off the shot from landing on the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.629 
take off the shot from landing on the
skateboard<00:03:22.650> lands<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:23.829> then<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:24.069> pushes<00:03:24.280> down

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
skateboard lands and then it pushes down

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.360 
skateboard lands and then it pushes down
on<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.910> board<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:25.410> he<00:03:26.410> basically<00:03:26.980> cracks

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
on the board and he basically cracks

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.330 
on the board and he basically cracks
your<00:03:27.549> board<00:03:27.730> some<00:03:28.180> sometimes<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.220> just

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
your board some sometimes and it just

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.920 
your board some sometimes and it just
wears<00:03:30.519> out<00:03:30.760> it<00:03:30.910> wears<00:03:31.299> it<00:03:31.450> out<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.690> this<00:03:31.750> will

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
wears out it wears it out and this will

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.390 
wears out it wears it out and this will
take<00:03:32.049> the<00:03:32.200> shot<00:03:32.410> so<00:03:32.829> basically<00:03:33.129> it's<00:03:33.280> like<00:03:33.310> a

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
take the shot so basically it's like a

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.949 
take the shot so basically it's like a
shock<00:03:33.639> pad<00:03:33.849> but<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:34.180> one's<00:03:34.389> not<00:03:34.569> very<00:03:34.780> good

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
shock pad but this one's not very good

wheeler<00:04:22.919> that<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.370> can<00:04:23.640> basically<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.960> the

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
wheeler that you can basically and the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.950 
wheeler that you can basically and the
trucks<00:04:25.500> action<00:04:26.630> so<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:30.270> pieces<00:04:30.630> fall<00:04:30.780> in<00:04:30.900> a

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
trucks action so the pieces fall in a

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.140 
trucks action so the pieces fall in a
bit<00:04:31.220> but<00:04:32.220> this<00:04:32.460> is<00:04:32.580> basically<00:04:32.669> where<00:04:32.940> I<00:04:33.000> keep

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
bit but this is basically where I keep

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.570 
bit but this is basically where I keep
almost<00:04:33.330> get<00:04:33.570> big<00:04:33.720> stuff<00:04:34.100> here's<00:04:35.100> the<00:04:35.190> kingpins

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
almost get big stuff here's the kingpins

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.520 
almost get big stuff here's the kingpins
there's<00:04:39.410> think<00:04:40.410> they'll<00:04:40.560> go<00:04:40.770> it's<00:04:41.730> also<00:04:42.530> not

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
there's think they'll go it's also not

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:51.860 
there's think they'll go it's also not
sure<00:04:43.740> why<00:04:43.890> only<00:04:46.280> varying<00:04:47.280> oil<00:04:47.460> in<00:04:50.660> update<00:04:51.660> this

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
sure why only varying oil in update this

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.840 
sure why only varying oil in update this
once<00:04:52.470> I<00:04:52.740> get<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:54.020> grip<00:04:55.020> state<00:04:55.229> then<00:04:55.850> maybe

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
once I get the grip state then maybe

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.080 
once I get the grip state then maybe
I'll<00:04:57.030> do<00:04:57.150> a<00:04:57.180> video<00:04:57.390> be<00:04:57.750> putting<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:58.080> arms<00:04:59.090> maybe

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
I'll do a video be putting it arms maybe

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.409 
I'll do a video be putting it arms maybe
but<00:05:00.690> we'll<00:05:01.050> see<00:05:01.229> can't<00:05:01.860> wait<00:05:01.970> only<00:05:02.970> focus<00:05:03.270> all

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
but we'll see can't wait only focus all

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.159 
but we'll see can't wait only focus all
on<00:05:03.570> there<00:05:03.750> but<00:05:03.990> I<00:05:05.479> think<00:05:06.479> I<00:05:06.570> better<00:05:06.690> wait<00:05:06.930> till
