00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
space next to your pickaxe so basically

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.830 
space next to your pickaxe so basically
what<00:01:41.610> my<00:01:41.729> brother<00:01:41.909> will<00:01:42.090> do<00:01:42.180> now<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.630> he'll

what my brother will do now is he'll
start<00:01:43.140> mining<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:44.369> furnace<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.970> basically

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
start mining be furnace and basically

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.969 
start mining be furnace and basically
what's<00:01:45.960> gonna<00:01:46.079> happen<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.590> when<00:01:46.770> he<00:01:46.860> gets

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
what's gonna happen is is when he gets

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.249 
what's gonna happen is is when he gets
to<00:01:47.220> brink<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.850> about<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.540> get<00:01:48.899> destroyed

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
to brink of is about to get destroyed

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.690 
to brink of is about to get destroyed
he's<00:01:49.409> going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> swap<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.549> going<00:01:50.640> to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
he's going to swap and it's going to

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.030 
he's going to swap and it's going to
vanish<00:01:50.909> from<00:01:51.180> do<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.049> then<00:01:52.680> he's<00:01:52.829> gotta

vanish from do that and then he's gotta
do<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.340> part<00:01:53.640> where<00:01:53.850> he<00:01:53.939> holds<00:01:54.180> down<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.600> and

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
do this part where he holds down a and

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.749 
do this part where he holds down a and
constantly<00:01:55.619> Hassan<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> diamond<00:01:56.670> he's

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
constantly Hassan a in the diamond he's

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.550 
constantly Hassan a in the diamond he's
picking<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.060> diamonds<00:01:57.479> up<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.079> putting<00:01:58.439> it

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
picking the diamonds up and putting it

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.859 
picking the diamonds up and putting it
back<00:01:58.619> into<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.219> furnace<00:01:59.670> this<00:02:00.420> will<00:02:00.600> break

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
back into the furnace this will break

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.459 
back into the furnace this will break
for<00:02:01.110> furnace<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.680> first<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.700> vanished

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
for furnace and first is just vanished

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.690 
for furnace and first is just vanished
and<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.649> hasn't<00:02:04.890> dropped<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.159> diamond<00:02:05.520> driver

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
and it hasn't dropped a diamond driver

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.120 
and it hasn't dropped a diamond driver
and<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.420> could

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
and that could

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.030 
and that could
that<00:02:09.130> as<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.310> possibility<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:11.320> glitch<00:02:11.530> can

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
that as a possibility the glitch can

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.100 
that as a possibility the glitch can
mess<00:02:12.460> up<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.450> can<00:02:13.690> cause<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:14.230> to

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
mess up and that can cause it to

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.370 
mess up and that can cause it to
basically<00:02:17.110> be<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.320> problem<00:02:18.990> so<00:02:19.990> basically<00:02:20.320> my

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
basically be a problem so basically my

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.030 
basically be a problem so basically my
brother's<00:02:20.590> gonna<00:02:20.680> get<00:02:20.830> some<00:02:20.950> more

what you want to do is the moment you've

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.720 
what you want to do is the moment you've
done<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.470> glitch<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.769> have<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.130> quickly<00:03:42.310> hold

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
done the glitch you have to quickly hold

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.610 
done the glitch you have to quickly hold
down<00:03:42.880> a<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.120> keep<00:03:43.480> making<00:03:44.050> that<00:03:44.080> dime<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:44.560> go

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
down a and keep making that dime and go

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.220 
down a and keep making that dime and go
like<00:03:44.800> that<00:03:45.010> of<00:03:45.310> wise<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.510> faster<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.050> do<00:03:47.200> it

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
like that of wise the faster you do it

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.340 
like that of wise the faster you do it
the<00:03:47.350> better<00:03:47.760> I'll<00:03:48.760> see<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.570> bed<00:03:49.750> that's<00:03:50.110> who

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
the better I'll see the bed that's who

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.690 
the better I'll see the bed that's who
and<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.370> better<00:03:51.580> timing<00:03:51.880> you<00:03:52.150> have<00:03:53.700> the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
and the better timing you have the

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.160 
and the better timing you have the
better<00:03:55.150> time<00:03:55.390> that<00:03:55.570> we<00:03:55.660> just<00:03:55.690> lost<00:03:55.959> two

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
better time that we just lost two

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.110 
better time that we just lost two
diamonds<00:03:56.620> so<00:03:57.160> now<00:03:57.370> my<00:03:57.550> office<00:03:57.790> is<00:03:57.910> going<00:03:58.060> to

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
diamonds so now my office is going to

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.440 
diamonds so now my office is going to
use<00:03:58.239> oil<00:03:58.450> instead<00:03:59.250> there<00:04:00.250> isn't<00:04:00.610> like<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:01.090> does

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
use oil instead there isn't like it does

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.140 
use oil instead there isn't like it does
work<00:04:01.800> it's<00:04:02.800> uh<00:04:03.100> you<00:04:03.430> got<00:04:03.580> to<00:04:03.640> be<00:04:03.700> yet<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.030> get

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
work it's uh you got to be yet to get

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.880 
work it's uh you got to be yet to get
good<00:04:04.330> timing<00:04:04.870> see<00:04:05.080> my<00:04:05.200> brother<00:04:05.380> destroy<00:04:05.709> it<00:04:05.830> a

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
good timing see my brother destroy it a

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.100 
good timing see my brother destroy it a
bit<00:04:06.070> too<00:04:06.100> late<00:04:06.430> then<00:04:06.640> you<00:04:07.360> have<00:04:07.540> to<00:04:07.690> get<00:04:07.989> to

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
bit too late then you have to get to

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.870 
bit too late then you have to get to
swap<00:04:08.380> hands<00:04:08.650> just<00:04:09.610> before<00:04:09.820> it<00:04:10.120> breaks<00:04:10.330> and

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
swap hands just before it breaks and

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.040 
swap hands just before it breaks and
basically<00:04:12.880> I<00:04:13.000> use<00:04:13.209> a<00:04:13.330> pick<00:04:13.570> axe<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:14.019> the

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
basically I use a pick axe and the

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.720 
basically I use a pick axe and the
moment<00:04:14.620> this<00:04:14.680> patch<00:04:14.860> but<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:15.130> can<00:04:15.280> swap<00:04:15.550> to

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
moment this patch but you can swap to

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.120 
moment this patch but you can swap to
your<00:04:15.850> normal<00:04:16.030> fist<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:17.500> also<00:04:17.770> you<00:04:17.859> did<00:04:18.010> it<00:04:18.100> a

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
your normal fist and also you did it a

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.970 
your normal fist and also you did it a
bit<00:04:18.250> too<00:04:18.280> late

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
bit too late

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.660 
bit too late
there<00:04:19.250> again<00:04:20.590> basically<00:04:21.590> he's<00:04:21.830> got<00:04:22.070> you<00:04:22.640> know

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
there again basically he's got you know

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.730 
there again basically he's got you know
he<00:04:22.880> got<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.120> get<00:04:23.210> it<00:04:23.330> perfect<00:04:23.480> timing<00:04:23.960> of<00:04:24.290> an

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
he got to get it perfect timing of an

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.410 
he got to get it perfect timing of an
after<00:04:24.980> my<00:04:25.070> god<00:04:25.250> as<00:04:25.370> fast<00:04:25.640> as<00:04:25.790> possible<00:04:25.820> is

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
after my god as fast as possible is

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.190 
after my god as fast as possible is
holding<00:04:26.690> down<00:04:26.780> a<00:04:27.850> it's<00:04:28.850> quite<00:04:29.720> hard<00:04:29.960> to<00:04:30.050> get

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
holding down a it's quite hard to get

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.810 
holding down a it's quite hard to get
timing<00:04:30.590> he<00:04:30.740> messed<00:04:31.040> it<00:04:31.190> up<00:04:31.280> he's<00:04:31.640> going<00:04:31.760> to

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
timing he messed it up he's going to

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.350 
timing he messed it up he's going to
