one of the rods I picked out I'm just
kind<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.730> trying<00:00:35.969> out<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.270> reel

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
kind of trying out the reel

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.360 
kind of trying out the reel
it's<00:00:36.989> been<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> pretty<00:00:37.350> good<00:00:37.500> reel<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.920> far<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
it's been a pretty good reel so far the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.959 
it's been a pretty good reel so far the
rod<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.000> combo<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:39.980> not<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.190> good<00:00:41.370> but

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
rod on the combo it's not that good but

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.500 
rod on the combo it's not that good but
I<00:00:42.000> all<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.930> can<00:00:43.230> afford<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.620> $70<00:00:44.309> or<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:45.270> guess

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
I all you can afford is $70 or I guess

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.729 
I all you can afford is $70 or I guess
there's<00:00:45.690> 60<00:00:46.530> or<00:00:46.620> 70<00:00:46.950> dollars<00:00:47.280> then<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.690> think<00:00:49.440> I

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
there's 60 or 70 dollars then I think I

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.799 
there's 60 or 70 dollars then I think I
would<00:00:49.920> recommend<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.700> reel<00:00:51.000> pick<00:00:51.539> up<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
would recommend this reel pick up the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.049 
would recommend this reel pick up the
rod<00:00:51.989> if<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> can't<00:00:53.100> afford<00:00:53.280> another<00:00:53.579> one<00:00:53.789> and

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
rod if you can't afford another one and

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.520 
rod if you can't afford another one and
save<00:00:54.449> your<00:00:54.600> money<00:00:54.719> for<00:00:54.840> another<00:00:55.079> rod<00:00:55.350> because

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.160 
like you would a spinning rock you just
it's<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.220> smooth<00:01:53.520> cast<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:55.140> to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
it's just a smooth cast so I like to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.590 
it's just a smooth cast so I like to
start<00:01:55.530> off<00:01:55.649> with<00:01:55.920> sidearm<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.420> when<00:01:57.570> I

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
start off with sidearm and when I

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.539 
start off with sidearm and when I
teaching<00:01:58.020> people<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.380> also<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:59.100> them<00:01:59.250> start

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
teaching people I also have them start

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.039 
teaching people I also have them start
off<00:01:59.670> with<00:01:59.820> sidearm<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.299> just<00:02:00.479> easier<00:02:00.869> you

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
off with sidearm it's just easier you

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.319 
off with sidearm it's just easier you
have<00:02:01.079> less<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.710> tendency<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:03.000> whip<00:02:03.180> it

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
have less of a tendency to to whip it

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.649 
have less of a tendency to to whip it
like<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.630> would<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.840> spinning<00:02:04.530> rod<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:05.659> I'd

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
like you would a spinning rod so I'd

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.910 
like you would a spinning rod so I'd
recommend<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.140> go<00:02:07.229> out<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.469> yard<00:02:07.560> and
