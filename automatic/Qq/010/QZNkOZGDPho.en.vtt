00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.750
 brine is a very ancient process 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.360
 food preservation and its 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.430
 origins date back to the dawn of time 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.400
 leaves his wife is composed of water and 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.860
 salt of salt percentage to put 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.740
 inside the water can vary a 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.800
 depending on the case obtained these olives 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.040
 which are called pigeon eggs for that 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.140
 look like eggs to rest in 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.829
 brine for ten days 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.190
 in the case of olives, the brine in addition to 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.070
 allow the conservation of the product 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.469
 serves to refine the flavor you give up 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.800
 sweet we will put the olives in a jar 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:01:00.260
 with oregano salt, garlic, chilli pepper 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:05.840
 after which we will let them rest for one 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:08.920
 ten days and then we will taste 3 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.010
 garlic cloves 2 dried peppers 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:17.329
 oregano salt jar and of course 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:21.070
 olives I leave the garlic cloves with the 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.070
 peel and split in two 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.900
 you also need 2 chili peppers 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.560
 put it in the jar 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.049
 I add the olives now 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.110
 a little oregano 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.310
 water and salt 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.310
 I initially put a little salt in it 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.780
 because then I can adjust or 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.650
 later if you do it right away 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.280
 salted 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.280
 it will be a problem to mix well 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.750
 before closing the barter I put one 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.660
 cup over the olives to avoid that 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.330
 floating are assaulted by the 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.420
 mold and ruin so I insert the 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:40.720
 cup the water almost comes out 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.720
 from the container I put the cork 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:50.630
 I then let the olives rest 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.690
 in the dark for a good ten days 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.690
 appetite 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.070
 and a break 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.670
 never
