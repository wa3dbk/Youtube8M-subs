I'm<00:02:44.280> going<00:02:44.460> to<00:02:44.700> work<00:02:44.880> all<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.840> way<00:02:45.870> on<00:02:46.140> the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
I'm going to work all the way on the

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.699 
I'm going to work all the way on the
crease<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.810> very<00:02:48.810> gently<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:51.320> what<00:02:52.320> happened

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
crease and very gently so what happened

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.680 
crease and very gently so what happened
by<00:02:52.860> doing<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.610> you're<00:02:53.760> going<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.150> receive

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
by doing this is you're going to receive

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.010 
by doing this is you're going to receive
that<00:02:54.989> area<00:02:56.270> therefore<00:02:57.270> you're<00:02:57.420> going<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:57.780> have

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
that area therefore you're going to have

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.100 
that area therefore you're going to have
the<00:02:58.320> top<00:02:58.590> lid<00:02:58.800> showing<00:02:59.250> more<00:02:59.489> which<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.150> what

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
the top lid showing more which is what

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.510 
the top lid showing more which is what
happened<00:03:01.440> when<00:03:01.590> we<00:03:01.620> have<00:03:01.860> deep<00:03:02.070> set<00:03:02.310> eye

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
happened when we have deep set eye

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.479 
happened when we have deep set eye
because<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:04.350> idea<00:03:04.650> doesn't<00:03:04.830> show<00:03:05.280> much

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
because the the idea doesn't show much

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.479 
because the the idea doesn't show much
so<00:03:05.880> we<00:03:06.239> want<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.770> create<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:08.040> illusion<00:03:08.130> of

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
so we want to create the illusion of

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.640 
so we want to create the illusion of
having<00:03:08.670> more<00:03:09.000> eyelids<00:03:10.970> so<00:03:11.970> very<00:03:12.690> gently<00:03:13.230> here

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
having more eyelids so very gently here

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.590 
having more eyelids so very gently here
I'm<00:03:13.830> applying<00:03:14.280> my<00:03:15.320> dark<00:03:16.320> eyeshadow<00:03:17.420> and<00:03:18.420> I'm

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
I'm applying my dark eyeshadow and I'm

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.420 
I'm applying my dark eyeshadow and I'm
just<00:03:18.870> going<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.170> stay<00:03:19.440> on<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:19.980> crease

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.210 

that's<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.610> very<00:03:23.820> simple<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.810> easy<00:03:25.080> way<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:26.070> do

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
that's a very simple and easy way to do

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.040 
that's a very simple and easy way to do
it

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.830 

so<00:03:33.050> the<00:03:33.350> advantage<00:03:33.770> of<00:03:33.860> using<00:03:33.920> a<00:03:34.720> soft<00:03:35.720> brush

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
so the advantage of using a soft brush

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.780 
so the advantage of using a soft brush
like<00:03:36.410> this<00:03:36.590> is<00:03:36.740> that<00:03:36.770> it's<00:03:37.010> not<00:03:37.250> going<00:03:37.280> to<00:03:37.640> pick

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
like this is that it's not going to pick

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.330 
like this is that it's not going to pick
up<00:03:37.910> too<00:03:38.150> much<00:03:38.300> pigments<00:03:38.930> so<00:03:39.740> you<00:03:39.800> don't<00:03:40.100> risk

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
up too much pigments so you don't risk

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.520 
up too much pigments so you don't risk
to<00:03:40.610> put<00:03:40.790> too<00:03:41.150> much<00:03:41.360> because<00:03:42.020> you<00:03:42.260> don't<00:03:42.290> want

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
to put too much because you don't want

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.530 
to put too much because you don't want
to<00:03:42.620> create<00:03:42.800> something<00:03:43.100> too<00:03:43.520> dark<00:03:43.760> either<00:03:44.060> he's

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
to create something too dark either he's

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:57.670 
to create something too dark either he's
got<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:44.900> stay<00:03:45.460> fairly<00:03:46.460> natural<00:03:55.660> great<00:03:56.660> so<00:03:57.080> you

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
got to stay fairly natural great so you

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.800 
got to stay fairly natural great so you
shouldn't<00:03:58.040> go<00:03:58.220> too<00:03:58.280> much<00:03:58.790> higher<00:03:58.850> than<00:03:59.540> the

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
shouldn't go too much higher than the

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.570 
shouldn't go too much higher than the
middle<00:04:00.350> of<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.590> crease<00:04:00.830> you<00:04:01.010> shouldn't<00:04:01.340> see

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
middle of the crease you shouldn't see

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.690 
middle of the crease you shouldn't see
it<00:04:01.610> much<00:04:02.030> when<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:02.570> open<00:04:02.900> your<00:04:03.050> eyes<00:04:03.670> what<00:04:04.670> you

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
it much when you open your eyes what you

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.820 
it much when you open your eyes what you
should<00:04:05.090> really<00:04:05.300> see<00:04:05.600> is<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:06.110> top<00:04:06.320> of<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.650> lead

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
should really see is the top of the lead

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.460 
should really see is the top of the lead
with<00:04:07.220> your<00:04:07.250> bleach<00:04:07.610> recolor<00:04:08.060> that<00:04:08.360> is<00:04:08.450> showing

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:22.480 

do<00:04:12.470> same<00:04:12.890> on<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.190> other<00:04:13.220> side<00:04:20.950> so<00:04:21.950> all<00:04:21.980> the<00:04:22.340> way

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
do same on the other side so all the way

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.520 
do same on the other side so all the way
in<00:04:22.730> so<00:04:23.030> all<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.420> way<00:04:23.540> to<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.870> crease<00:04:24.140> you<00:04:24.170> use

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
in so all the way to the crease you use

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.010 
in so all the way to the crease you use
your<00:04:24.680> dark<00:04:24.920> color<00:04:25.330> but<00:04:26.330> make<00:04:26.540> sure<00:04:26.780> you<00:04:26.900> don't

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
your dark color but make sure you don't

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
your dark color but make sure you don't
use<00:04:27.260> too<00:04:27.560> much<00:04:27.590> on<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.190> inner<00:04:28.460> corner<00:04:28.850> just<00:04:33.040> so

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
use too much on the inner corner just so

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:51.900 
use too much on the inner corner just so
basically<00:04:34.400> you<00:04:34.550> do<00:04:34.700> like<00:04:34.880> a<00:04:34.910> line

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.690 

just<00:04:52.600> to<00:04:52.810> add<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.380> last<00:04:53.590> touch<00:04:53.950> you<00:04:54.250> go<00:04:54.400> back

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
just to add the last touch you go back

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.060 
just to add the last touch you go back
to<00:04:55.000> the<00:04:55.120> pink<00:04:55.360> you<00:04:55.570> are<00:04:55.720> using<00:04:55.930> with<00:04:56.200> your<00:04:56.230> flat

to the pink you are using with your flat
eyeshadow<00:04:57.310> brush<00:04:57.640> and<00:04:58.330> you<00:04:59.140> just<00:04:59.170> go<00:04:59.620> back

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
eyeshadow brush and you just go back

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.560 
eyeshadow brush and you just go back
onto<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:00.730> just<00:05:02.490> in<00:05:03.490> case<00:05:03.520> if<00:05:03.940> by<00:05:04.090> blending<00:05:04.510> the

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
onto it just in case if by blending the

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.330 
onto it just in case if by blending the
top<00:05:04.870> you've<00:05:05.110> removed<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:05.650> little<00:05:05.770> bit<00:05:06.070> of<00:05:06.190> your

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
top you've removed a little bit of your

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.490 
top you've removed a little bit of your
eyeshadow<00:05:06.760> so<00:05:07.660> you<00:05:07.750> want<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:08.020> to<00:05:08.140> be<00:05:08.260> quite

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
eyeshadow so you want it to be quite

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:20.190 
eyeshadow so you want it to be quite
intense<00:05:09.040> here<00:05:17.370> so<00:05:18.370> you<00:05:18.430> create<00:05:18.910> that<00:05:19.200> lovely

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
intense here so you create that lovely

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.380 
intense here so you create that lovely
contrast<00:05:20.440> with<00:05:21.190> your<00:05:21.370> nice<00:05:21.580> shimmery<00:05:22.090> color
