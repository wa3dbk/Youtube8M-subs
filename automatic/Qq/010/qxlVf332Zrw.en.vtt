00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
there on the front the other thing about

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.160 
there on the front the other thing about
this<00:02:05.259> is<00:02:05.320> it<00:02:05.590> says<00:02:05.830> dead<00:02:06.190> on<00:02:06.400> right<00:02:06.960> across<00:02:07.960> the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
this is it says dead on right across the

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.990 
this is it says dead on right across the
handle<00:02:08.940> it's<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:10.060> really<00:02:10.270> killer<00:02:10.540> little<00:02:10.869> tool

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
handle it's a really killer little tool

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.370 
handle it's a really killer little tool
it's<00:02:13.000> not<00:02:13.180> really<00:02:13.360> designed<00:02:13.660> for<00:02:13.989> killing

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380

zombies<00:02:14.830> but<00:02:15.100> uh<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.489> think<00:02:15.700> it<00:02:15.970> will<00:02:16.060> do<00:02:16.180> the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
zombies but uh I think it will do the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.350 
zombies but uh I think it will do the
trick<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:17.230> got<00:02:17.410> your<00:02:17.590> hammer<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:19.030> got<00:02:19.209> your

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
trick you got your hammer you got your

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.830 
trick you got your hammer you got your
sharp<00:02:19.630> edge<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.890> got<00:02:21.040> your<00:02:21.220> bone<00:02:21.459> breaker

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
sharp edge you got your bone breaker

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.750 
sharp edge you got your bone breaker
right<00:02:22.840> there<00:02:23.280> then<00:02:24.280> if<00:02:24.400> all<00:02:24.520> else<00:02:24.760> fails<00:02:25.120> i<00:02:26.760> get

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
right there then if all else fails i get

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.449 
right there then if all else fails i get
that<00:02:27.880> thing<00:02:28.060> off<00:02:28.209> of<00:02:28.360> there<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.890> got<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.070> jab<00:02:30.430> or
