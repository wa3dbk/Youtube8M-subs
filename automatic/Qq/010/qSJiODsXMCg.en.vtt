 he will be whole after ten minutes 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.750
 side provided so that the yeast ever 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.750
 can start working 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.879
 afterwards there will be more 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.320
 yeast

 smooth dough kneaded that can 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.520
 Do it with a food processor or 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.520
 by hand 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.060
 the dough is being shaped into a ball 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.250
 covered the bowl with 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.350
 Covered fresh foil and must for 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.250
 40 minutes to go until it reaches its volume 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.250
 has doubled 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.190
 at this time is currently again 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.350
 well kneaded and in new same 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.690
 servings divided gives particularly good 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.910
 with a scale the individual portions 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.910
 have a weight of about 90 grams 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.229
 these little dough pieces will be back 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.369
 shaped into balls and would have to be 20 again 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.560
 minutes to go 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.720
 important here is also with you again 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.160
 cover fresh foil so you 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.160
 no dry surface 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.720

 about 40 to 45 cm long strictly 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.570
 while the middle should be slightly thicker 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.570
 as the ends 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.290
 the ends are devoured twice 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.290
 and pressed firmly into the middle part 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.239
 After that, you will be put on a baking paper 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.730
 laid baking tray and must 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.780
 rest for another ten minutes 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.610
 at this time can ever 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.340
 be prepared natronlauge 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.830

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.870
 and cook the temperature below 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.160
 By the way, you get sodium 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.160

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.160
 Carefully placed in the hot arbor 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.319
 she is not allowed at this time 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.890
 cook more because the pretzels otherwise 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.890
 break quickly 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.800
 then let it drain briefly 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.930
 put it back on the baking tray and 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.930
 Sprinkle with coarse salt immediately 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.840
 to the conclusion, the oven in at 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.430
 Baked until 190 degrees 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:40.400
 golden brown and crispy 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:42.260
 That takes 15 to 20 minutes best 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.800
 the pretzels taste straight from the 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.390
