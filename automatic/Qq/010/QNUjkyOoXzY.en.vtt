lower beetle came down and be that's
right<00:00:17.699> here<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.720> was<00:00:19.170> living<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.529> right<00:00:19.619> there

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
right here I was living it right there

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.509 
right here I was living it right there
came<00:00:20.939> up<00:00:21.470> mandibles<00:00:22.470> open<00:00:22.769> trying<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.160> attack

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
came up mandibles open trying to attack

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.029 
came up mandibles open trying to attack
it<00:00:23.990> so<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.170> brings<00:00:25.320> us<00:00:25.529> back<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.800> that

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
it so that brings us back to that

question<00:00:26.430> are<00:00:26.699> they<00:00:27.330> corralled<00:00:27.779> or<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.830> that

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
question are they corralled or is that

seen the small hive beetle and what the
small<00:01:28.590> hive<00:01:28.770> beetle<00:01:28.800> does<00:01:29.340> reason<00:01:29.729> why<00:01:29.820> their

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
small hive beetle does reason why their

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.420 
small hive beetle does reason why their
problem<00:01:30.330> is<00:01:30.420> because<00:01:30.570> they<00:01:30.840> lay<00:01:31.140> eggs<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
problem is because they lay eggs in the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.270 
problem is because they lay eggs in the
nest<00:01:32.760> and<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.270> larvae<00:01:33.780> go<00:01:34.020> through<00:01:34.440> just

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
nest and the larvae go through just

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.680 
nest and the larvae go through just
destroying<00:01:35.910> the<00:01:36.330> comb<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.990> wax<00:01:37.229> comb<00:01:37.649> and

it's called sly mming the comb so the

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.389 
it's called sly mming the comb so the
larvae<00:01:42.479> leave<00:01:42.660> this<00:01:42.840> slime<00:01:43.290> trail<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.860> nasty

bees a girl that's for sure so generally

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.199 
bees a girl that's for sure so generally
you<00:02:24.569> find<00:02:24.989> small<00:02:25.379> hive<00:02:25.650> beetle<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.819> bottom

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
you find small hive beetle in the bottom

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.650 
you find small hive beetle in the bottom
super<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.560> back<00:02:28.980> frame<00:02:29.549> away<00:02:30.269> from<00:02:30.569> the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
super in the back frame away from the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.979 
super in the back frame away from the
entrance<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.440> hive<00:02:31.849> this<00:02:32.849> is<00:02:33.180> essentially

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
entrance of the hive this is essentially

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.720 
entrance of the hive this is essentially
that<00:02:34.230> but<00:02:34.530> in<00:02:34.620> an<00:02:34.739> observation<00:02:35.340> I've<00:02:35.459> so<00:02:35.610> it's

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
that but in an observation I've so it's

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.270 
that but in an observation I've so it's
the<00:02:35.819> bottom<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.420> it's<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.780> back<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.380> that's

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
the bottom and it's the back and that's

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.120 
the bottom and it's the back and that's
where<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.549> find<00:02:38.790> them<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:40.380> this<00:02:40.590> leads<00:02:40.799> me<00:02:40.920> to

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
where you find them so this leads me to

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.150 
where you find them so this leads me to
believe<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.870> Beatles<00:02:43.200> chose<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.980> be

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
believe that the Beatles chose to be

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.440 
believe that the Beatles chose to be
here<00:02:45.079> but<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.230> bees<00:02:46.410> know<00:02:46.680> they're<00:02:46.890> there<00:02:48.290> and

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
here but the bees know they're there and

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.550 
here but the bees know they're there and
there's<00:02:51.450> some<00:02:51.750> more<00:02:52.110> actually

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.870 

and<00:02:56.130> they're<00:02:56.310> just<00:02:56.640> artery<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.930> bees

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
and they're just artery to the bees

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.309 
and they're just artery to the bees
little<00:02:59.880> brats<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:01.580> so<00:03:03.020> that's<00:03:04.020> just<00:03:04.110> an

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
little brats and so that's just an

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.809 
little brats and so that's just an
interesting<00:03:04.860> shot<00:03:05.099> I<00:03:05.370> I'm<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:08.370> was<00:03:08.520> cool<00:03:08.790> to

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
interesting shot I I'm it was cool to

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.120 
interesting shot I I'm it was cool to
see<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.360> bees<00:03:09.599> trying<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.349> tax<00:03:10.620> on<00:03:10.860> but<00:03:11.010> it's

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
see the bees trying to tax on but it's

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.559 
see the bees trying to tax on but it's
still<00:03:11.280> not<00:03:11.489> cool<00:03:11.700> that<00:03:11.849> they're<00:03:11.970> in<00:03:12.150> there<00:03:12.390> I

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
still not cool that they're in there I

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.910 
still not cool that they're in there I
haven't<00:03:13.290> seen<00:03:13.530> any<00:03:13.709> evidence<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:15.920> larvae

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
haven't seen any evidence of the larvae

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.309 
haven't seen any evidence of the larvae
and<00:03:17.190> slamming<00:03:17.910> yet<00:03:18.120> but<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.360> have<00:03:18.569> not<00:03:18.780> opened<00:03:19.940> I

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
and slamming yet but I have not opened I

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.660 
and slamming yet but I have not opened I
haven't<00:03:22.319> opened<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.800> observation<00:03:23.340> hive<00:03:23.459> in<00:03:23.640> a

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
haven't opened the observation hive in a

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.250 
haven't opened the observation hive in a
while<00:03:24.620> since<00:03:25.620> i<00:03:25.860> installed<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.550> so<00:03:27.209> i<00:03:27.870> really

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
while since i installed it so i really

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.890 
while since i installed it so i really
have<00:03:28.470> no<00:03:28.500> idea<00:03:28.709> what's<00:03:29.600> going<00:03:30.600> on<00:03:30.720> because

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
have no idea what's going on because

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.920 
have no idea what's going on because
it's<00:03:31.049> 2<00:03:31.650> 2<00:03:31.980> 2<00:03:32.310> 2<00:03:32.670> frames<00:03:33.239> for<00:03:33.450> total<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.780> eight

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
it's 2 2 2 2 frames for total of eight

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.240 
it's 2 2 2 2 frames for total of eight
so<00:03:34.319> i<00:03:34.350> don't<00:03:34.470> really<00:03:34.500> know<00:03:34.650> what's<00:03:34.890> going<00:03:34.920> on

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
so i don't really know what's going on

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.860 
so i don't really know what's going on
the<00:03:35.340> inside<00:03:35.730> on<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.150> outside<00:03:36.569> we've<00:03:36.690> got<00:03:36.840> a

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
the inside on the outside we've got a

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.400 
the inside on the outside we've got a
lot<00:03:37.080> of<00:03:37.110> brood<00:03:39.410> not<00:03:40.410> much<00:03:40.680> food<00:03:41.090> so<00:03:42.290> I've<00:03:43.290> been

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
lot of brood not much food so I've been

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.390 
lot of brood not much food so I've been
feeding<00:03:43.680> them<00:03:43.860> like<00:03:44.040> crazy<00:03:44.480> got<00:03:45.480> this<00:03:46.400> bottle

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
feeding them like crazy got this bottle

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.420 
feeding them like crazy got this bottle
up<00:03:47.819> there<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.150> guess<00:03:48.480> it's<00:03:48.720> maybe

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.559 

I<00:03:52.140> don't<00:03:53.140> know<00:03:53.230> maybe<00:03:53.379> 3<00:03:53.859> 2<00:03:54.040> 500<00:03:55.000> ml<00:03:55.269> probably

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
I don't know maybe 3 2 500 ml probably

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.160 
I don't know maybe 3 2 500 ml probably
more<00:03:55.719> like<00:03:56.730> 300<00:03:57.730> ml<00:03:57.939> I<00:03:58.060> don't<00:03:58.239> know<00:03:58.299> maybe<00:03:58.810> 250

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
more like 300 ml I don't know maybe 250

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.440 
more like 300 ml I don't know maybe 250
but<00:03:59.859> they're<00:04:00.069> drinking<00:04:00.519> it<00:04:00.609> up<00:04:00.670> in<00:04:00.790> one<00:04:00.939> day<00:04:01.209> I

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
but they're drinking it up in one day I

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.229 
but they're drinking it up in one day I
just<00:04:01.930> put<00:04:02.079> in<00:04:02.170> yesterday<00:04:02.409> so<00:04:02.709> I'm<00:04:03.040> wondering

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
just put in yesterday so I'm wondering

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.250 
just put in yesterday so I'm wondering
where<00:04:04.239> it's<00:04:04.390> going<00:04:06.569> it<00:04:07.569> must<00:04:07.810> be<00:04:07.900> going<00:04:08.049> on<00:04:08.170> the

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
where it's going it must be going on the

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.170 
where it's going it must be going on the
inside<00:04:08.500> some<00:04:08.739> see<00:04:08.920> any<00:04:09.099> nectar<00:04:09.459> deposits

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
inside some see any nectar deposits

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.830 
inside some see any nectar deposits
inside<00:04:10.569> here<00:04:11.340> so<00:04:12.340> let's<00:04:12.730> just<00:04:13.090> see<00:04:13.269> if<00:04:13.299> we<00:04:13.659> can

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
inside here so let's just see if we can

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.379 
inside here so let's just see if we can
find<00:04:14.049> some<00:04:14.379> eggs<00:04:14.620> to<00:04:14.920> show<00:04:15.099> you<00:04:15.159> I<00:04:15.700> got<00:04:16.359> a

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
find some eggs to show you I got a

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.520 
find some eggs to show you I got a
better<00:04:16.810> image<00:04:17.320> of<00:04:18.190> some<00:04:18.430> larvae<00:04:18.789> today<00:04:19.530> to

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
better image of some larvae today to

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.360 
better image of some larvae today to
show<00:04:20.769> you<00:04:20.829> so<00:04:21.009> let's<00:04:21.070> see<00:04:21.280> if<00:04:21.340> we<00:04:21.400> can<00:04:21.519> see<00:04:21.639> that

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.600 

so<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:27.400> don't<00:04:27.639> see<00:04:27.880> any<00:04:28.030> eggs<00:04:28.740> here<00:04:29.740> but<00:04:30.340> this<00:04:30.430> is

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
so I don't see any eggs here but this is

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.430 
so I don't see any eggs here but this is
still<00:04:30.729> being<00:04:31.150> drawn<00:04:31.570> out<00:04:32.250> so<00:04:34.229> probably<00:04:35.229> won't

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
still being drawn out so probably won't

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.260 
still being drawn out so probably won't
see<00:04:35.740> eggs<00:04:35.979> for<00:04:36.340> a<00:04:36.370> while<00:04:36.720> but<00:04:37.720> here<00:04:38.320> this<00:04:38.530> is

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
see eggs for a while but here this is

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.510 
see eggs for a while but here this is
drawn<00:04:40.270> out<00:04:40.570> quite<00:04:41.320> a<00:04:41.349> bit<00:04:41.880> and<00:04:42.880> has<00:04:43.150> been

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
drawn out quite a bit and has been

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.589 
drawn out quite a bit and has been
trying<00:04:45.520> to<00:04:45.610> get<00:04:45.729> it<00:04:45.849> to<00:04:46.000> where<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.270> glare

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
trying to get it to where the glare

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.170 
trying to get it to where the glare
let's<00:04:47.050> minimize<00:04:47.320> on<00:04:47.830> camera<00:04:48.280> so<00:04:48.759> you<00:04:48.789> can<00:04:48.880> see

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
let's minimize on camera so you can see

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.390 
let's minimize on camera so you can see
the<00:04:49.330> larvae<00:04:49.780> in<00:04:49.960> there<00:04:50.280> if<00:04:51.280> you<00:04:51.820> strain<00:04:53.400> you
