00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.770 
transition going from one to another
flipping<00:01:04.680> interesting<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:06.210> hard<00:01:06.450> for

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
flipping interesting is really hard for

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.030 
flipping interesting is really hard for
most<00:01:06.840> people<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.229> do<00:01:07.350> because<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:07.770> hard<00:01:07.950> to

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
most people to do because it's hard to

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.260 
most people to do because it's hard to
know<00:01:08.189> where<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.430> are<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> air<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
know where you are in the air and the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.090 
know where you are in the air and the
airspace<00:01:09.689> really<00:01:10.020> helps<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.680> I've<00:01:10.920> never

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
airspace really helps and I've never

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.740 
airspace really helps and I've never
been<00:01:11.310> good<00:01:11.460> with<00:01:11.520> hand-eye<00:01:11.939> coordination<00:01:12.150> so

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
been good with hand-eye coordination so

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.770 
been good with hand-eye coordination so
I<00:01:12.810> don't<00:01:12.990> really<00:01:13.170> play<00:01:13.439> sports<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:13.830> balls

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780

fair fair enough

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.560 
fair fair enough
but<00:01:17.159> most<00:01:17.369> people<00:01:17.700> see<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.880> perfect<00:01:18.390> dive

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570
