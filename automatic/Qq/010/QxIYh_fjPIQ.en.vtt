00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.109
 hello speaks that in 112 and today we are in 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.059
 a redstone tutorial of the most 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.250
 basic the network are actually for 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.580
 those who are just beginning and do not know 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.640
 what will play with this network 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.760
 although the hardest thing I think about the game 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.090
 so good today we are going to show the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.720
 different types of what function 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.720
 each 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.590
 a sheet that is like I leave 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.870
 to protect your house more than anything else the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.059
 entry 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.420
 so well I wish you liked to prepare 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.420
 this 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.670
 Well, we started with the rapid bulls that 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.339
 is one of the easiest to do and so 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.680
 as a block that is whole with the 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.090
 author al con anders king tony rest 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.480
 obviously 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.510
 two blocks go both sides to 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.930
 torch the rest are above 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.510
 the two like this one also now 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.050
 and when they unite it as they see it is very 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.840
 Quick 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.640
 but you can also notice that it works 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.590
 much 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.479
 It serves more than anything for dispensers 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.870
 to throw fire with the blaze recharge 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.970
 real I show you 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:29.730
 they put a 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.730
 with repeater a canalis think 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.160
 and what do I know arrows 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.840
 I hope 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.909
 arrows respond 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.039
 in the strips very fast 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.530
 that is for pistons a lot are not used 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.909
 as in its use for this that requires the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.950
 specialty 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.200
 how fast so good 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.710
 we continue with the other 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.230
 you are the is has the same function and the 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:12.270
 functionality of 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:14.590
 the fast bours but do not cut as you see 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.660
 look at them I show you 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.230
 how they look and how the piston was before and 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.230
 how is it now 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.880
 it's a bit slower but since I do not know 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.480
 it locks in the other extra extremely 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.780
 fast but it works a lot like 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.410
 look like here 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.410
 good 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.160
 for example the dispenser 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.160
 I dont know 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.879
 the strips much slower than there 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.069
 then I 'll go for mechanisms a little bit 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:55.160
 require a little more slowly 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:58.069
 this mechanism is called faith clock and 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.200
 that is also easy but a little more 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.140
 complicated is very fast bulls 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.870
 consists of five blocks that you have to 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.489
 be whole also torch rector and 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:14.150
 peters and rest also put a here the 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:17.590
 rest though a torch block 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.989
 it also subtracts although one like that 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.790
 and that's when they reach the last one they have to 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.459
 take the last one to join with him 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.370
 first, well, that's how it starts to come and go 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:31.370
 the signal and so 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.610
 makes a signal and activates 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.610
 well it's easier and the next one is 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.130
 one of the new 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.210
 is the next thread mechanism or tail 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:47.680
 1.3 point 1 11 days ago more or less the 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.680
 new version of minecraft just fine day 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.390
 this consists of this that I do not remember 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.940
 what is it called that they have hooked with a 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.670
 thread 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.480
 that obviously every little thing that is 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.810
 hooks need a block yes or yes 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.830
 and any of the doubles changed by 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.660
 stone 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.750
 towards what we want it to be can be 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.030
 tnt a piston or a dispenser here like 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.730
 we step on and it activates 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.750
 we go out young that activated 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:23.889
 we go and that activity is how 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.040
 is that we did this supposed and when 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.639
 we pass is like a twist 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:34.919
 felt and when we left the place that 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.919
 it's the same thing would happen 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:42.509
 I would do this 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:45.539
 it can also be to throw us these 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.940
 things we step on 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.950
 strip 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.850
 this is one of the best things that 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.560
 they did it would also be like a plate 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.880
 pressure but much improvement because apart 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.120
 as you can see it is camouflaged because if one is 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.610
 this 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.430
 but healthy 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.940
 obviously then you can hide that 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.460
 it depends on you 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:16.360
 we already finished with tutorials of the rest 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.360
 but I bring you a badge that is this 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.190
 that is 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.140
 defense mechanism for their houses 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.950
 for example we go at night to be able 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.950
 program zombies 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.470
 to put it and if we take some of the 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.580
 zombies 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.800
 as you know 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:41.889
 after services that play online or 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.889
 if they play if they play alone for the modes 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.350
 Y 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.240
 in a zombie here has to be yes or yes 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.610
 gravel or flour what has transformed 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.690
 in your house curiously by the law of 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.690
 Gravity falls 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.860
 we do not change 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.060
 as they see they break or they are heard and 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:09.060
 deactivate 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:13.610
 and the zombie falls the pistons open 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.610
 falling the gravel to the lava 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.570
 in the mechanism is very easy has to 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.400
 put two pistons where they want to 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.710
 that is the fall around have to 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.440
 have two retweet ers and rest 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.640
 and they have to be united and be happy 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.950
 the signal has been cut off with the 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.810
 repeaters also here and good you 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.860
 activate 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.860
 It is very easy 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.990
 with this it remained like this 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.990
 and falls 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:53.100
 and well and that way you can insure your house 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:56.970
 so well this I can say arias has 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:59.610
 served in the mechanisms of rest and of 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:02.490
 defense too so good is more than 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:05.120
 nothing for beginners who do not know 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.120
 nothing of the game 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.630
 they are going to learn 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.230
 what I've been doing , says goodbye to the 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.230
 next video
