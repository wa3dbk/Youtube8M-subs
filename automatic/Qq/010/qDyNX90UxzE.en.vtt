can make these tools ready to leave
readily<00:01:19.920> available<00:01:24.350> we<00:01:25.350> need<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> get<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
readily available we need to get to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.219 
readily available we need to get to
these<00:01:25.950> first<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.869> get<00:01:27.869> these<00:01:28.049> out

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
these first because get these out

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:39.690 
these first because get these out
install<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.439> jig<00:01:32.540> itself

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.570 

I've<00:01:40.700> mounted<00:01:40.909> this<00:01:41.240> little<00:01:41.570> scrap<00:01:42.370> piece<00:01:43.370> of

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
I've mounted this little scrap piece of

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.210 
I've mounted this little scrap piece of
MDF<00:01:44.090> here<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:46.040> actually<00:01:46.280> missed<00:01:47.680> in<00:01:48.680> this

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
MDF here and it actually missed in this

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.710 
MDF here and it actually missed in this
pocket<00:01:52.030> like<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:53.320> so<00:01:54.320> that<00:01:54.440> way<00:01:55.390> this<00:01:56.390> area

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
pocket like so so that way this area

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.480 
pocket like so so that way this area
across<00:01:56.900> here<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.590> work<00:01:57.740> surface<00:01:57.920> is<00:01:58.130> flush

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
across here the work surface is flush

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.270 
across here the work surface is flush
with<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:58.880> work<00:01:59.090> surface<00:01:59.270> of<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.660> jig<00:01:59.920> mmm<00:02:00.979> to

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
with the work surface of the jig mmm to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.340 
with the work surface of the jig mmm to
get<00:02:01.430> support<00:02:01.729> longer<00:02:02.030> pieces<00:02:03.970> we<00:02:04.970> got<00:02:05.119> our

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
get support longer pieces we got our

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.900 
get support longer pieces we got our
best<00:02:06.350> collection<00:02:06.770> adapter<00:02:07.250> for<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.000> jig<00:02:08.259> and

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
best collection adapter for the jig and

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.490 
best collection adapter for the jig and
this<00:02:10.910> is<00:02:11.090> dovetailed<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:13.220> this<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:15.260> it's

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
this is dovetailed so this so it's

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.790 
this is dovetailed so this so it's
easily<00:02:15.680> slides<00:02:18.640> on<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.790> camera<00:02:20.239> in<00:02:21.200> here<00:02:21.590> like

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
easily slides on the camera in here like

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.990 
easily slides on the camera in here like
so<00:02:25.720> not<00:02:26.720> that<00:02:26.959> into<00:02:27.110> place<00:02:27.640> now<00:02:28.640> that's<00:02:28.850> all

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
so not that into place now that's all

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:41.810 
so not that into place now that's all
set<00:02:29.239> up

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:53.470 

[Music]

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:02.540 

and<00:02:54.480> across<00:02:54.690> like<00:02:55.020> so

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.979 

it's<00:03:03.550> usually<00:03:03.760> easier<00:03:04.269> with<00:03:04.390> two<00:03:04.540> things<00:03:04.780> but

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
it's usually easier with two things but

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.210 
it's usually easier with two things but
I'm<00:03:05.080> holding<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.379> camera<00:03:05.409> right<00:03:05.890> now<00:03:06.040> so

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.949 

there<00:03:12.220> we<00:03:12.310> go<00:03:12.430> I'm<00:03:13.269> just<00:03:13.330> kind<00:03:13.629> of<00:03:13.690> holds<00:03:13.870> it

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
there we go I'm just kind of holds it

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.110 
there we go I'm just kind of holds it
out<00:03:14.049> of<00:03:14.110> your<00:03:14.200> way<00:03:14.349> and<00:03:15.239> there<00:03:16.239> it<00:03:16.330> is<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.910> if

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
out of your way and there it is so if

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.009 
out of your way and there it is so if
you<00:03:19.239> have<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:19.420> long<00:03:19.660> piece<00:03:20.819> these<00:03:21.819> here<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.480> will

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
you have a long piece these here I will

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.410 
you have a long piece these here I will
say<00:03:23.170> 30<00:03:23.410> inches<00:03:23.819> you<00:03:24.819> can<00:03:24.910> set<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.209> in<00:03:25.299> your

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
say 30 inches you can set it in your

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.009 
say 30 inches you can set it in your
Craig<00:03:25.629> dig<00:03:26.099> and<00:03:27.099> it's<00:03:27.549> supported<00:03:28.060> across<00:03:28.780> this

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
Craig dig and it's supported across this

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:36.110 
Craig dig and it's supported across this
piece<00:03:29.260> here<00:03:31.650> clamp<00:03:32.650> it<00:03:32.769> into<00:03:32.980> your<00:03:33.220> business

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.280 

of<00:03:37.120> course<00:03:37.299> everything<00:03:37.690> goes<00:03:37.840> back<00:03:38.049> inside

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
of course everything goes back inside

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.650 
of course everything goes back inside
the<00:03:39.280> workstation<00:03:41.010> got<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.370> made<00:03:43.180> extra-long

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
the workstation got the made extra-long

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.150 
the workstation got the made extra-long
on<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:43.900> end<00:03:44.140> so<00:03:44.319> you<00:03:44.349> can<00:03:44.560> clamp<00:03:44.890> it<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.129> the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
on the end so you can clamp it to the

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160 
on the end so you can clamp it to the
table<00:03:45.370> if<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:45.760> needs<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:45.970> be<00:03:46.030> or<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.420> couple

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
table if it needs to be or a couple

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.339 
table if it needs to be or a couple
sawhorses<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:49.480> only<00:03:49.660> thing<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:49.900> have<00:03:50.019> left<00:03:50.200> to

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
sawhorses the only thing I have left to

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.130 
sawhorses the only thing I have left to
do<00:03:50.910> so<00:03:51.910> I<00:03:51.940> thought<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.150> might<00:03:52.209> install<00:03:52.660> handle

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
do so I thought I might install handle

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.770 
do so I thought I might install handle
here<00:03:53.319> somewhere<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:54.160> hold<00:03:54.280> on<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.670> but<00:03:54.910> it's

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
here somewhere to hold on to but it's

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.030 
here somewhere to hold on to but it's
kind<00:03:55.989> of<00:03:56.049> tight<00:03:56.290> in<00:03:56.319> this<00:03:56.470> area<00:03:56.650> with<00:03:56.920> the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
kind of tight in this area with the
