interesting you know last year at that

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.949 
interesting you know last year at that
point<00:03:04.850> we<00:03:05.060> were<00:03:05.180> definitely<00:03:05.360> out<00:03:05.720> of<00:03:05.750> the

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
point we were definitely out of the

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.920 
point we were definitely out of the
playoff<00:03:06.590> picture<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.330> they<00:03:08.330> were<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.870> know

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930
