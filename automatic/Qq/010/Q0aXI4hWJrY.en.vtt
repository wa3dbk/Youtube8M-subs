00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.230
 by 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.030
 this game has a value of 10 points 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.780
 they are ready 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.600
 very well then to play but mind 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.200
 you do not want to burn it rest away from the 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.960
 Polar cold 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.960
 but he will have brought suitable clothes 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.040
 ah 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.040

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.270
 which letter has the only garment that does not 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.270
 it was tried a lot 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.759
 and I had the opportunity to know the house 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.760
 of mickey is called igloo and it's all 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.410
 made with pieces of ice is 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.090
 incredible does not allow the cold to enter 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.000
 and that also does not draw the heat from inside 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.950
 that plin means that we no longer have 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.220
 let's see what the answer is 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.220

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.730

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.569
 we will be participating for 40 points 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.220
 we play fast 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.940
 I know animals that send us 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.599
 greetings from all over the world coyote myron 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.319
 from the disguised caiman desert 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.319
 from the swamp 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.370
 the curious pole of the pole 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.970
 the hidden bread among bamboo is 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.420
 the elegant elephant of the jungle 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:22.180
 good and bad greets us from the swamp 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.280
 and this tic tac tic tac tic tac tic tac 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.450
 means they have to choose one of 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.890
 the options that appeared in the 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.890
 screen and this 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.270
 is a bit late it means that I no longer 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.960
 we have more time let's see what is the 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.960
 correct answer 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.720
 It was the crocodile 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.830

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.830

 very well we will play for 50 watchful points 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.580
 because here goes to the next game and my 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.120

 give a guy a big hug 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.220

 spongy at his side 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.480

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.659
 walking needs to strengthen his legs 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:23.020
 so that you do not lose your socks 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:25.470
