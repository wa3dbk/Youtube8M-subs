in my kitchen to the other side up at
the<00:02:04.680> driveway<00:02:04.950> there's<00:02:05.790> like<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.049> how<00:02:07.170> to

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
the driveway there's like this is how to

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.070 
the driveway there's like this is how to
explain<00:02:07.619> if<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.489> think<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.759> lava<00:02:09.080> flowing

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
explain if you can think of lava flowing

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.850 
explain if you can think of lava flowing
down

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
down

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.610 
down
okay<00:02:11.009> designs<00:02:11.520> flowing<00:02:12.450> down<00:02:12.630> but<00:02:13.200> instead<00:02:13.560> of

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
okay designs flowing down but instead of

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.890 
okay designs flowing down but instead of
it<00:02:13.830> like<00:02:14.100> being<00:02:14.910> like<00:02:15.090> water<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.660> it's<00:02:15.780> like

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
it like being like water and it's like

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.920 
it like being like water and it's like
running<00:02:16.410> it's<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.250> wave<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:18.120> it's<00:02:18.780> like

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
running it's like a wave and it's like

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.510 
running it's like a wave and it's like
you<00:02:19.080> know<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.320> at<00:02:19.440> five<00:02:19.650> meter<00:02:19.890> thick<00:02:20.250> wave

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
you know like at five meter thick wave

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.810 
you know like at five meter thick wave
that<00:02:21.210> continues<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.900> come<00:02:22.140> down<00:02:22.440> but<00:02:23.280> what's

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
that continues to come down but what's

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.880 
that continues to come down but what's
left<00:02:24.090> behind<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.690> is<00:02:24.840> just<00:02:25.440> everything's

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
left behind it is just everything's

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.860 
left behind it is just everything's
burnt<00:02:26.190> everything<00:02:26.880> just<00:02:26.970> disintegrates<00:02:27.660> into

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
burnt everything just disintegrates into

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.080 
burnt everything just disintegrates into
black<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:29.040> there's<00:02:29.280> origins<00:02:29.640> like<00:02:29.760> ring

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
black and so there's origins like ring

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.660 
black and so there's origins like ring
or<00:02:30.480> wave<00:02:30.780> just<00:02:31.140> comes<00:02:31.380> down<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:32.040> we<00:02:32.280> do<00:02:32.490> it

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
or wave just comes down and we do it

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.920 
or wave just comes down and we do it
takes<00:02:32.820> like<00:02:32.940> three<00:02:33.090> seconds<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.720> dream

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
takes like three seconds in the dream

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.360 
takes like three seconds in the dream
and<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.440> whole<00:02:34.620> house<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:35.010> just<00:02:35.190> see<00:02:35.280> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
and the whole house you just see the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.310 
and the whole house you just see the
whole<00:02:35.490> house<00:02:35.700> like<00:02:35.910> melt<00:02:36.300> disintegrates<00:02:37.110> and

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
whole house like melt disintegrates and

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.199 
whole house like melt disintegrates and
then<00:02:37.830> you're<00:02:38.520> pretty<00:02:38.730> much<00:02:38.850> there<00:02:39.060> then<00:02:39.180> just

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
then you're pretty much there then just

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.930 
then you're pretty much there then just
burns<00:02:39.570> us<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.080> we<00:02:40.230> die<00:02:40.410> but<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.520> remember

fifty<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.830> five<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.660> this<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:06.810> what<00:03:06.989> was<00:03:07.110> weird

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
fifty to five and this is what was weird

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
the Sun was just coming up and it was

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.500 
the Sun was just coming up and it was
like<00:03:11.010> this<00:03:11.130> yellow<00:03:11.520> orange<00:03:11.850> great<00:03:12.150> glow

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
like this yellow orange great glow

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.650 
like this yellow orange great glow
across<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.560> water<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:14.180> that's<00:03:15.180> because

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
across the water and that's because

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.090 
across the water and that's because
that's<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.019> ocean<00:03:16.290> out<00:03:16.380> there<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.739> that's

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
that's the ocean out there and that's

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.410 
that's the ocean out there and that's
what<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.400> thought<00:03:17.580> what<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.940> fuck

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420

what I thought what the fuck
because<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:19.500> blood<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:21.930> obviously<00:03:22.380> it

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
because that blood and I obviously it

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.170 
because that blood and I obviously it
wasn't<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.769> fire<00:03:23.040> explosions<00:03:23.820> but<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.090> was

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
wasn't the fire explosions but it was

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.060 
wasn't the fire explosions but it was
just<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.480> clock<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:25.350> was<00:03:25.410> just<00:03:25.620> weird

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
just a clock it was just weird

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.160 
just a clock it was just weird
it'll<00:03:26.430> work<00:03:26.549> down<00:03:28.130> now<00:03:29.900> could<00:03:30.900> be<00:03:30.989> just<00:03:31.140> a

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
it'll work down now could be just a

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.509 
it'll work down now could be just a
random<00:03:31.320> fucking<00:03:31.860> dream

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
random fucking dream

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.880 
random fucking dream
yeah<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.090> mean<00:03:33.330> but<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.290> could<00:03:34.560> also<00:03:34.739> be

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
yeah I mean but it could also be

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.759

red laser that the it slays I could see

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.670

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
inside it was because I mean maybe they

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.810 
inside it was because I mean maybe they

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
and that's about it but otherwise

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.720 
and that's about it but otherwise
because<00:05:16.710> it<00:05:16.830> because<00:05:16.980> that<00:05:17.100> Hill<00:05:17.280> goes<00:05:17.520> down

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
because it because that Hill goes down

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.310 
because it because that Hill goes down
the<00:05:17.910> rock<00:05:18.060> walls<00:05:18.270> flat<00:05:18.630> and<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:18.990> hill<00:05:19.140> goes

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
the rock walls flat and the hill goes

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.900 
the rock walls flat and the hill goes
down<00:05:19.560> so<00:05:19.800> it<00:05:19.919> ranks<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:20.550> that's<00:05:20.730> why<00:05:20.850> it

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
down so it ranks and that's why it

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.650 
down so it ranks and that's why it
disappears<00:05:21.830> down<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:23.010> the<00:05:23.100> bottom<00:05:23.370> here<00:05:23.520> so<00:05:23.760> if

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
disappears down to the bottom here so if

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.820 
disappears down to the bottom here so if
there<00:05:24.900> was<00:05:25.020> never<00:05:25.350> but<00:05:25.500> there<00:05:25.620> would<00:05:25.740> have

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
there was never but there would have

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.920 
there was never but there would have
been<00:05:25.890> -<00:05:26.250> if<00:05:26.460> there<00:05:26.640> was<00:05:26.760> one<00:05:26.880> inside<00:05:27.210> because

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
been - if there was one inside because

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.510 
been - if there was one inside because
there<00:05:28.080> was<00:05:28.200> one<00:05:28.410> outside<00:05:28.770> at<00:05:29.040> the<00:05:29.130> same<00:05:29.280> time

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
there was one outside at the same time

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.880 
there was one outside at the same time
as<00:05:29.640> the<00:05:29.729> door
