release<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:58.670> more<00:00:58.910> good<00:00:59.510> news<00:00:59.719> I<00:01:00.079> guess<00:01:00.620> you

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
release the more good news I guess you

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.210 
release the more good news I guess you
could<00:01:00.920> say<00:01:01.100> we<00:01:02.000> already<00:01:02.120> have<00:01:02.480> a<00:01:03.010> alpha<00:01:04.010> build

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
could say we already have a alpha build

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.460 
could say we already have a alpha build
it's<00:01:05.059> a<00:01:05.150> far<00:01:05.330> cry<00:01:05.510> from<00:01:05.630> what<00:01:05.870> we<00:01:06.020> want<00:01:06.230> but

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
it's a far cry from what we want but

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.780 
it's a far cry from what we want but
it's<00:01:06.650> a<00:01:06.740> proof<00:01:06.950> of<00:01:07.070> concept<00:01:07.220> that<00:01:07.580> this

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
it's a proof of concept that this

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.179 
it's a proof of concept that this
launcher<00:01:08.119> does<00:01:08.240> work<00:01:08.650> so<00:01:09.650> on<00:01:09.799> to<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.009> main
