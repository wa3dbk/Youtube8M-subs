to Lightroom or to computing in general

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.540 
to Lightroom or to computing in general
there<00:00:18.380> are<00:00:18.440> two<00:00:18.500> types<00:00:18.590> of<00:00:18.950> multi<00:00:19.370> image

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
there are two types of multi image

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.099 
there are two types of multi image
selections<00:00:20.210> that<00:00:20.359> we<00:00:20.420> need<00:00:20.570> to<00:00:20.689> make<00:00:20.869> when

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
selections that we need to make when

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.859 
selections that we need to make when
we're<00:00:21.289> working<00:00:21.980> or<00:00:22.550> organising<00:00:23.150> our<00:00:23.300> files<00:00:23.330> in

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
we're working or organising our files in

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.259 
we're working or organising our files in
Lightroom<00:00:24.380> and<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:25.429> first<00:00:25.670> of<00:00:25.849> those<00:00:25.970> is<00:00:26.029> a

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
Lightroom and the first of those is a

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.380 
Lightroom and the first of those is a
sequential<00:00:27.490> selection<00:00:28.490> so<00:00:29.119> that's<00:00:29.269> a

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
sequential selection so that's a

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.089 
sequential selection so that's a
selection<00:00:29.839> of<00:00:29.929> images<00:00:30.080> say<00:00:30.470> from<00:00:30.679> this<00:00:30.830> first

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
selection of images say from this first

in<00:00:58.850> between<00:00:58.880> has<00:00:59.390> been<00:00:59.750> selected<00:01:00.230> we<00:01:00.920> can<00:01:01.100> now

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
in between has been selected we can now

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.980 
in between has been selected we can now
move<00:01:01.460> those<00:01:01.700> over<00:01:02.180> put<00:01:02.600> them<00:01:02.720> into<00:01:02.840> a

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
move those over put them into a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.190 
move those over put them into a
collection<00:01:03.260> if<00:01:03.740> we<00:01:03.860> wanted<00:01:04.250> or<00:01:04.990> send<00:01:05.990> them<00:01:06.110> off

collection if we wanted or send them off
to<00:01:06.530> photoshop<00:01:07.460> for<00:01:07.700> example<00:01:08.270> if<00:01:09.109> you<00:01:09.229> want<00:01:09.380> to

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
to photoshop for example if you want to

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.859 
to photoshop for example if you want to
deselect<00:01:09.770> or<00:01:10.759> get<00:01:11.179> rid<00:01:11.329> of<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:11.509> selection

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
deselect or get rid of that selection

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.499 
deselect or get rid of that selection
that's<00:01:12.229> as<00:01:12.350> simple<00:01:12.679> as<00:01:12.939> clicking<00:01:13.939> on<00:01:14.210> any

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
that's as simple as clicking on any

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.929 
that's as simple as clicking on any
image<00:01:14.689> that's<00:01:15.079> not<00:01:15.409> part<00:01:16.219> of<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.579> selection

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
image that's not part of the selection

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.719 
image that's not part of the selection
so<00:01:17.719> we<00:01:17.840> do<00:01:17.990> that<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:18.560> you'll<00:01:18.679> see<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.039> we<00:01:19.189> no

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
so we do that and you'll see that we no

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.200 
so we do that and you'll see that we no
longer<00:01:19.759> have<00:01:20.539> the<00:01:20.990> selection<00:01:21.399> active<00:01:22.399> a<00:01:22.549> fewer

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
longer have the selection active a fewer

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.719 
longer have the selection active a fewer
a<00:01:23.299> shortcut<00:01:23.960> key<00:01:24.229> junkie<00:01:24.740> like<00:01:24.859> myself<00:01:25.070> it's

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
a shortcut key junkie like myself it's

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.139

personally<00:03:23.510> find<00:03:23.720> a<00:03:23.810> lot<00:03:24.019> easier<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.650> work<00:03:24.890> up

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
personally find a lot easier to work up

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.420 
personally find a lot easier to work up
here<00:03:25.370> in<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.519> bigger<00:03:25.780> grid<00:03:26.780> view<00:03:27.250> so<00:03:28.250> now<00:03:28.370> the

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
here in the bigger grid view so now the

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.130 
here in the bigger grid view so now the
final<00:03:28.640> very<00:03:29.239> cool<00:03:29.480> thing<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:29.720> want<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:29.930> show<00:03:30.080> you

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
final very cool thing I want to show you

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.500 
final very cool thing I want to show you
is<00:03:30.440> just<00:03:30.980> combining<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.820> two<00:03:32.000> methods

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
is just combining the two methods

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.770 
is just combining the two methods
sequential<00:03:33.380> and<00:03:33.560> non<00:03:33.769> sequential<00:03:34.780> selections

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
sequential and non sequential selections

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.009 
sequential and non sequential selections
so<00:03:36.440> so<00:03:36.860> make<00:03:37.070> a<00:03:37.100> sequential<00:03:37.750> selection<00:03:38.750> here

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
so so make a sequential selection here

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.590 
so so make a sequential selection here
using<00:03:39.530> Shift<00:03:40.130> key<00:03:40.400> these<00:03:40.910> first<00:03:41.209> three<00:03:41.450> images

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
using Shift key these first three images

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.140 
using Shift key these first three images
yeah<00:03:42.290> we<00:03:42.500> want<00:03:42.680> this<00:03:42.799> one<00:03:43.040> down<00:03:43.250> here<00:03:43.700> as<00:03:43.850> well

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
yeah we want this one down here as well

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.490 
yeah we want this one down here as well
we<00:03:44.840> just<00:03:45.019> simply<00:03:45.380> hold<00:03:45.560> down<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.989> ctrl<00:03:47.989> key<00:03:48.019> on

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
we just simply hold down the ctrl key on

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.170 
we just simply hold down the ctrl key on
Windows<00:03:49.150> or<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.180> command<00:03:50.420> key<00:03:50.959> on<00:03:51.140> Mac<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:52.459> we

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
Windows or the command key on Mac and we

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.810 
Windows or the command key on Mac and we
can<00:03:53.360> make<00:03:53.600> a<00:03:53.780> non<00:03:54.350> sequential<00:03:54.769> on<00:03:55.040> top<00:03:55.310> of<00:03:55.549> a

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
can make a non sequential on top of a

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.920 
can make a non sequential on top of a
sequential<00:03:57.010> look<00:03:58.010> at<00:03:58.100> that<00:03:58.540> so<00:03:59.540> I<00:03:59.570> hope<00:03:59.780> that's

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
sequential look at that so I hope that's

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.720 
sequential look at that so I hope that's
helped<00:04:00.260> you<00:04:00.410> understand<00:04:01.220> how<00:04:01.310> to<00:04:01.430> make

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
helped you understand how to make

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.870 
helped you understand how to make
selections<00:04:01.910> within<00:04:02.600> Lightroom<00:04:02.810> and<00:04:03.730> we<00:04:04.730> look

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
selections within Lightroom and we look

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.920 
selections within Lightroom and we look
forward<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.150> seeing<00:04:05.390> you<00:04:05.480> again<00:04:05.570> back<00:04:05.900> here
