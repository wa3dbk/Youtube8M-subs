00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.430
 we want to make an ariel cake in 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.020
 silhouette we have finished this photo of 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.820
 Internet 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.970
 Now to adjust it to our size 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.610
 of the sponge cake what we are going to do is 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.350
 print it in larger size a 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.130
 size that suits more 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.130
 the cake 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.300
 the idea is that when we put it in 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.669
 our base 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.179
 this will be the structure of the cake 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:33.250
 now we cut the silhouette and cut 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.440
 the sponge cake with the leftovers 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.149
 sponge cake we will make the pieces that we 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.149
 what we lack here is missing 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.890
 we put the silhouette that we have 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.590
 trimmed on top of our cake and 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.980
 mark with edible marker by 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.980
 over so we can then cut it 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.710
 Well, we have cut out silhouette 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.780
 what we had cut back we have 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.390
 put two pieces that we had other 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.340
 to form the queue now what we will do 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.460
 will give you a base that butter me 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.560
 to match and we have filled in as 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.210
 stuffed with chocolate then now 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.490
 we are having different fondant 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.829
 colors to make it 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.180
 to our silhouette that you see, not what 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.979
 we have said but we have changed a 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.649
 little the direction of the hand to be able 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.880
 put a little fish or something so what 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.310
 we do is apply the cream of 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.520
 butter that is above all this 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.920
 part of the tail we have trimmed our 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.979
 silhouette of the drawing and now what 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.030
 we are doing is telling the cake 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.970
 where is it going 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.159
 we have marked it with a scalpel we can 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.679
 also do it with edible marker 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.299
 is more let's also mark where it goes 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.789
 our little face 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.330
 well now we cut out his face and 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.330
 we mark 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.670
 we already know where we have to do the 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.360
 hair and where will the little face go next 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.350
 ok let's adjust the body part 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.350
 the first 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.280
 we adjust there and the arm 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.720
 we are putting it to hang 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.370
 two sides 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.780
 to do the body we have done what 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.080
 same we have trimmed his piece of the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.170
 puzzle and this piece will bend 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.290
 down on the arm instead if then 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.290
 we cut in this way 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.680
 now we will see how we paste it little to 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.930
 little we are adjusting as we have 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.379
 trimmed the face what we're going to do 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.870
 now we make a cmc ball of 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.489
 fondant color meat with a lot of cbc because 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.980
 we want it to dry soon to be able 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.200
 paint then face what we 're going to 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.620
 to do is cut out the silhouette of the 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.620
 little face 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.780
 and let dry for the hair let's 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.850
 cut out let's say the inside part of 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.250
 the silhouette because we want it to hang 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.630
 for the cake in everything we only remember a 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.630
 little bit where will the face go 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.500
 we cut well 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.160
 now put the little face that is 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.410
 on top of the body 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.410
 we carefully place the hair 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.599
 we mark a little what is the hair 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.180
 although now let's put a little more 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.150
 hair above 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.489
 like the little mermaid has a big mane 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.950
 we have put more red fondant for 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.950
 that gives more image as real that is 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.700
 there but 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.080
 we cut the trunk too 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.000
 then we will put on top of the bikini 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.800
 it does not matter that we do not stay together 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.960
 because I was just in a bikini 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.690
 we've put a little bit of stuffing and now 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.080
 We put the bra we put here the 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.240
 bra 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.880
 Well now we extend fondant 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.800
 green to make the tail a green piece 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.900
 let's cover the tail 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.800
 - just the end that we will put it with 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.800
 green more clarito 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.859
 we apply a bit of texture so that 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.260
 look like the scales we have put on 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.760
 one of the sides now we will put the 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.610
 another and the tail 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.120
 we put the tail we mixed green with 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.510
 White 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.090
 let's put the tail 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.510
 we finished off the tail with a pincer 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.580
 of edges we mark a bit the part of 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.590
 the tail 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.220
 we miss him a bit because we 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.810
 love 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.810
 and we have done some stripes 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.780
 well we have put a little bit of 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.070
 Glitter on the tail applying first 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.200
 a little diluted cmc 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.750
 Well, we take the little face and what 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.660
 we do is paint him from behind with pencil 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.220
 edible and now we're going to mark each 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.930
 one of the features on the face of the 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.970
 siren 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.650
 Well, it's already been marked 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.949
 first soft and then we have them 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:14.090
 colored with edible marker and 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.090
 this is our little mermaid
