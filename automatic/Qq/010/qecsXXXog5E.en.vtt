00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.020 
there's this bronze material and
sometimes<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.739> shows<00:03:01.890> up<00:03:02.069> as<00:03:02.220> marcasite<00:03:02.730> so

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
sometimes it shows up as marcasite so

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.600 
sometimes it shows up as marcasite so
always<00:03:03.360> mine<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.980> because<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.310> totally

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
always mine it because it totally

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.380 
always mine it because it totally
randomizes<00:03:06.480> how<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:06.959> spawns<00:03:08.150> so<00:03:09.150> then<00:03:09.299> you

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
randomizes how it spawns so then you

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.670 
randomizes how it spawns so then you
come<00:03:09.540> over<00:03:09.630> here<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.959> there's<00:03:10.230> another<00:03:10.410> node
