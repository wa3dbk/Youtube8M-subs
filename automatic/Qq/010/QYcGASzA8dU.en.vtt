00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.130 
mean to sound like Christina buddy I'm
trying<00:04:19.270> to<00:04:19.660> go<00:04:19.780> 100<00:04:20.260> percent<00:04:20.620> wrong<00:04:20.770> and<00:04:22.140> it's

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
trying to go 100 percent wrong and it's

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.740 
trying to go 100 percent wrong and it's
hard<00:04:23.470> because<00:04:23.740> it<00:04:24.550> takes<00:04:24.850> away<00:04:25.120> that<00:04:25.150> option

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
hard because it takes away that option

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.810 
hard because it takes away that option
of<00:04:25.840> eating<00:04:25.960> cooked<00:04:26.290> food<00:04:26.590> with<00:04:27.190> when<00:04:27.580> I'm<00:04:27.700> out
