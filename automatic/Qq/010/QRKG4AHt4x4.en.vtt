I<00:00:17.520> chose<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.880> review<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.420> week<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.810> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
I chose to review this week is the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.890 
I chose to review this week is the
benefit<00:00:19.890> boying

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
benefit boying

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.630 
benefit boying
concealer<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.980> am<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.789> color<00:00:24.000> one<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:25.640> I

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
concealer and I am the color one and I

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.090 
concealer and I am the color one and I
believe<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.060> this<00:00:27.180> comes<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.810> two<00:00:28.289> or<00:00:29.070> three

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
believe that this comes in two or three

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.580 
believe that this comes in two or three
shades<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:29.850> there's<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.150> one<00:00:30.510> two<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.230> maybe<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
shades so there's a one two and maybe a

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.259 
shades so there's a one two and maybe a
three<00:00:31.920> but<00:00:32.400> it<00:00:32.489> could<00:00:32.610> be<00:00:32.730> wrong<00:00:32.879> about<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.120> I

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.269 
three but it could be wrong about that I

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:34.759 
three but it could be wrong about that I
think<00:00:33.420> there's<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> one<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.440> know

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:34.769 
think there's just the one and I know

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:36.170 
think there's just the one and I know
for<00:00:35.010> sure<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.190> there's<00:00:35.430> someone<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.879> a<00:00:35.970> two

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
for sure that there's someone in a two

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.450 
for sure that there's someone in a two
but<00:00:36.510> I'm<00:00:36.630> not<00:00:36.750> sure<00:00:36.930> about<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.230> third<00:00:37.410> one<00:00:37.620> but

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
but I'm not sure about the third one but

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.280 
but I'm not sure about the third one but
this<00:00:38.610> has<00:00:38.790> lasted<00:00:39.210> me<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> while<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> think<00:00:40.020> I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910

half<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.069> time<00:02:14.310> maybe<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.910> third<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.569> time

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
half the time maybe a third of the time

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.370 
half the time maybe a third of the time
before<00:02:17.099> I<00:02:17.130> put<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.459> on<00:02:18.020> but<00:02:19.020> for<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.230> most

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
before I put this on but for the most

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.140 
before I put this on but for the most
part<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:20.010> know<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.220> goes<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.489> really<00:02:20.700> nice<00:02:20.940> and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
it's not cakey at all and the fact that

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.970 
it's not cakey at all and the fact that
it's<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.060> pot<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.660> not<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.170> squeeze<00:02:25.500> out<00:02:25.739> is

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
it you know it's a little bit on the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.760 
it you know it's a little bit on the
pricey<00:02:35.280> side<00:02:35.400> it's<00:02:35.790> about<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.590> think<00:02:37.590> it's

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
pricey side it's about I think it's

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.550 
pricey side it's about I think it's
about<00:02:37.800> 18<00:02:38.250> or<00:02:38.280> 19<00:02:38.400> dollars<00:02:39.060> but<00:02:39.989> for<00:02:40.230> six

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
about 18 or 19 dollars but for six

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.530 
about 18 or 19 dollars but for six
months<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.100> it's<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:41.550> good<00:02:41.700> concealer<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.209> think

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
months and it's a good concealer I think

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.440 
months and it's a good concealer I think
it's<00:02:42.660> worth<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:44.250> one<00:02:44.550> thing<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.390> I

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
it's worth it the one thing that I

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.080 
it's worth it the one thing that I
absolutely<00:02:45.950> hate<00:02:46.950> about<00:02:47.340> this<00:02:47.519> product<00:02:47.790> is

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
absolutely hate about this product is

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.320 
absolutely hate about this product is
the<00:02:48.300> packaging<00:02:48.720> not<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.800> way<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.519> know<00:02:50.640> the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
the packaging not the way you know the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.470 
the packaging not the way you know the
way<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.630> it's<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.870> screw<00:02:52.260> on<00:02:52.410> cap<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:54.360> it

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
way that it's a screw on cap so it

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.620 
way that it's a screw on cap so it
screws<00:02:54.810> instead<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.350> like<00:02:55.500> clipping<00:02:56.630> like

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
screws instead of like clipping like

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.390 
screws instead of like clipping like
something<00:02:57.900> like<00:02:58.019> this<00:02:58.200> where<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:59.010> know<00:02:59.130> it

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
something like this where it you know it

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.300

flips<00:02:59.790> open<00:02:59.970> it's<00:03:00.330> really<00:03:00.600> easy<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.989> open

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
flips open it's really easy to open

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.600

on<00:03:13.380> them<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:13.940> it<00:03:14.940> can<00:03:15.090> be<00:03:15.209> really<00:03:15.510> really<00:03:15.959> hard

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
on them so it can be really really hard

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.340
