00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
comfortable you know I mean as

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.840 
comfortable you know I mean as
comfortable<00:02:07.890> as<00:02:07.979> they<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.220> be<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.429> play<00:02:08.610> you

comfortable as they can be to play you
know<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.000> think<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.420> if<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.630> doctor<00:02:09.810> clears<00:02:10.140> you

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
know I think that if a doctor clears you

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.140 
know I think that if a doctor clears you
to<00:02:10.289> play<00:02:10.470> then<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:11.670> gives<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> lot<00:02:12.090> of

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
to play then that gives you a lot of

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.490 
to play then that gives you a lot of
confidence<00:02:12.480> going<00:02:12.660> up<00:02:12.900> there<00:02:13.080> knowing<00:02:13.380> that

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
confidence going up there knowing that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.780 
confidence going up there knowing that
you<00:02:13.560> can<00:02:13.680> play<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.130> take<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.310> hit<00:02:14.519> and<00:02:14.640> things

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
you can play and take a hit and things

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.229 
you can play and take a hit and things
like<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:16.040> I'm<00:02:17.040> not<00:02:17.220> concerned<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:18.090> it

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
like that so I'm not concerned is it

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.390 
like that so I'm not concerned is it
easy<00:02:18.390> for<00:02:18.510> something<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.350> did<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:20.280> know

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
easy for something like you did you know

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.800 
easy for something like you did you know

just get back out there and even after
missing<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.299> mounted<00:02:24.690> not<00:02:25.140> skip<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> beat<00:02:25.670> yeah

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
missing you mounted not skip a beat yeah

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.780 
missing you mounted not skip a beat yeah
I<00:02:26.730> mean<00:02:26.880> yeah<00:02:27.750> we've<00:02:27.930> got<00:02:28.519> know<00:02:29.519> there's<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.760> lot

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
I mean yeah we've got know there's a lot

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.250 
I mean yeah we've got know there's a lot
of<00:02:29.880> familiarity<00:02:30.239> there<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:30.780> think<00:02:31.080> we've

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
of familiarity there so I think we've

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.740 
of familiarity there so I think we've
you<00:02:32.250> know<00:02:32.280> we<00:02:32.400> should<00:02:32.580> be<00:02:32.730> able<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:33.030> find<00:02:33.600> each

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
you know we should be able to find each

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.440 
you know we should be able to find each
other<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.290> create<00:02:34.620> things<00:02:34.860> some<00:02:35.220> if<00:02:36.030> anything

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
other and create things some if anything

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.560 
other and create things some if anything
my<00:02:36.600> timing<00:02:37.049> maybe<00:02:37.260> hello<00:02:37.920> loft<00:02:38.160> but<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:38.790> think

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
my timing maybe hello loft but I think

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.030 
my timing maybe hello loft but I think
that's<00:02:39.780> something<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.170> hopefully<00:02:40.709> come

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
that's something that hopefully come

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.069 
that's something that hopefully come
pretty<00:02:41.250> quickly

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.470 

I<00:02:48.640> think<00:02:49.640> you're<00:02:49.730> trying<00:02:49.909> to<00:02:50.060> think<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.360> what<00:02:50.420> I

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
I think you're trying to think of what I

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.849 
I think you're trying to think of what I
think<00:02:50.719> once<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:50.989> get<00:02:51.109> in<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.260> game<00:02:51.409> and<00:02:51.680> you

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
think once you get in the game and you

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.319 
think once you get in the game and you
know<00:02:52.069> if<00:02:52.219> we<00:02:52.370> get<00:02:52.489> out<00:02:52.609> there<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.939> get<00:02:53.030> playing

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
know if we get out there and get playing

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:54.670 
know if we get out there and get playing
it's<00:02:53.750> not<00:02:53.870> something<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.290> think<00:02:54.409> about<00:02:54.500> a

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
it's not something to think about a

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.270 
it's not something to think about a
whole<00:02:54.799> lot<00:02:54.980> but<00:02:56.739> yeah<00:02:57.739> I<00:02:57.769> mean<00:02:57.890> I<00:02:58.069> don't<00:02:58.219> really

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
whole lot but yeah I mean I don't really

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.459 
whole lot but yeah I mean I don't really
know<00:02:58.599> how<00:02:59.599> I'm<00:02:59.689> going<00:02:59.870> to<00:02:59.930> kind<00:03:00.140> of<00:03:00.230> approach

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:00.469 
know how I'm going to kind of approach

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.130 
know how I'm going to kind of approach
that<00:03:00.680> until<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:00.980> play<00:03:01.219> right<00:03:01.459> but<00:03:02.019> you<00:03:03.019> know<00:03:03.079> I

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
that until I play right but you know I

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.780 
that until I play right but you know I
think<00:03:03.230> mentally<00:03:03.739> I<00:03:03.769> feel<00:03:03.859> confident<00:03:04.670> that<00:03:04.700> I

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
think mentally I feel confident that I

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.160 
think mentally I feel confident that I
can<00:03:04.909> go<00:03:05.030> out<00:03:05.090> there<00:03:05.299> and<00:03:05.420> blind<00:03:05.810> a<00:03:05.870> playoff

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
can go out there and blind a playoff

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.080 
can go out there and blind a playoff
game<00:03:06.200> so<00:03:06.680> hopefully<00:03:07.489> it's<00:03:07.640> not<00:03:07.730> something

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
game so hopefully it's not something

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.479 
game so hopefully it's not something
that<00:03:08.239> I'm<00:03:08.780> really<00:03:08.840> thinking<00:03:09.170> about<00:03:09.489> prepare

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
that I'm really thinking about prepare

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.209 
that I'm really thinking about prepare
for<00:03:10.609> those<00:03:10.730> guys<00:03:10.909> come<00:03:11.829> they<00:03:12.829> know<00:03:12.980> where<00:03:13.189> you

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:15.219 
for those guys come they know where you

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.970 
for those guys come they know where you
what<00:03:16.219> can<00:03:16.370> I<00:03:16.430> do<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:16.939> know<00:03:17.500> obviously<00:03:18.500> I'm<00:03:18.950> not

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
what can I do you know obviously I'm not

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.949 
what can I do you know obviously I'm not
going<00:03:19.400> out<00:03:19.459> there<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.909> look<00:03:20.150> in<00:03:20.569> to<00:03:20.599> get<00:03:20.810> hit

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
going out there to look in to get hit

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.710 
going out there to look in to get hit
but<00:03:21.230> if<00:03:21.980> that's<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.340> case<00:03:22.549> then<00:03:22.849> I<00:03:23.150> think

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
but if that's the case then I think

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.240 
but if that's the case then I think
there's<00:03:23.989> only<00:03:24.079> so<00:03:24.349> much<00:03:24.500> you<00:03:24.560> can<00:03:24.680> control<00:03:25.129> it

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
there's only so much you can control it

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.670 
there's only so much you can control it
there<00:03:25.430> so<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:26.870> know<00:03:26.959> I<00:03:26.989> think<00:03:27.230> if<00:03:27.349> they<00:03:27.470> really

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
there so you know I think if they really

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.550 
there so you know I think if they really
want<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.159> you<00:03:28.370> know<00:03:28.790> they<00:03:28.970> can<00:03:29.209> so<00:03:29.510> that<00:03:29.720> will

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
want to you know they can so that will

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.319 
want to you know they can so that will
kind<00:03:30.709> of<00:03:30.739> be<00:03:30.799> up<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.099> them<00:03:31.220> more<00:03:31.489> than<00:03:31.639> me<00:03:31.669> see

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
kind of be up to them more than me see

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.360 
kind of be up to them more than me see
how<00:03:32.480> was<00:03:32.599> that<00:03:32.720> limit

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.619 

uh<00:03:37.370> yeah<00:03:37.879> I<00:03:38.150> think<00:03:38.239> that<00:03:38.660> you<00:03:39.620> know<00:03:39.739> any<00:03:39.980> time

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
uh yeah I think that you know any time

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.820 
uh yeah I think that you know any time
you're<00:03:41.629> watching<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:42.260> get<00:03:42.349> a<00:03:42.410> chance<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:42.680> get

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
you're watching you get a chance to get

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.140 
you're watching you get a chance to get
back<00:03:42.860> in<00:03:43.069> the<00:03:43.160> lineup<00:03:43.310> touching<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.849> playoffs

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
back in the lineup touching the playoffs

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.809 
back in the lineup touching the playoffs
think<00:03:44.390> you're<00:03:44.510> always<00:03:44.660> excited<00:03:44.810> but<00:03:45.790> no<00:03:46.790> I

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
think you're always excited but no I

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.270 
think you're always excited but no I
think<00:03:46.940> I've<00:03:47.530> kind<00:03:48.530> of<00:03:48.560> been<00:03:48.680> preparing<00:03:49.160> this

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
think I've kind of been preparing this

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.180 
think I've kind of been preparing this
for<00:03:49.550> this<00:03:49.700> for<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:49.970> while<00:03:50.120> so<00:03:50.620> yeah<00:03:51.620> I<00:03:51.680> don't<00:03:51.890> I

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
for this for a while so yeah I don't I

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.400 
for this for a while so yeah I don't I
don't<00:03:52.670> think<00:03:53.030> there<00:03:53.900> was<00:03:53.989> too<00:03:54.230> much<00:03:54.349> going

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
don't think there was too much going

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.050 
don't think there was too much going
through<00:03:54.709> my<00:03:54.830> mind<00:03:55.010> besides<00:03:55.250> just<00:03:55.640> making<00:03:55.940> sure

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
through my mind besides just making sure

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.869 
through my mind besides just making sure
that<00:03:56.090> it's<00:03:56.330> ready<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.569> go<00:03:56.629> when<00:03:57.349> did<00:03:57.440> you

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
that it's ready to go when did you

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.759
