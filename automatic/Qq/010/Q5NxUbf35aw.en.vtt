00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.110 
got the Alpine head unit the iPod
adapter<00:03:36.659> and<00:03:37.379> Alpine<00:03:37.739> component<00:03:38.730> speakers<00:03:38.849> in

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
adapter and Alpine component speakers in

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.440 
adapter and Alpine component speakers in
the<00:03:39.209> door<00:03:39.420> with<00:03:40.319> an<00:03:40.469> Alpine<00:03:40.620> amp<00:03:44.239> and<00:03:45.239> then<00:03:45.299> the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
the door with an Alpine amp and then the

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.869 
the door with an Alpine amp and then the
final<00:03:45.780> thing<00:03:45.810> that<00:03:46.019> I<00:03:46.230> added<00:03:46.590> was<00:03:46.829> what<00:03:47.790> is

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
final thing that I added was what is

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.690 
final thing that I added was what is
called<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.180> sprint<00:03:48.510> booster<00:03:49.280> which<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.459> that

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
called a sprint booster which is that

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.289 
called a sprint booster which is that
switch<00:03:51.480> right<00:03:51.840> there<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:53.250> what<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.519> does<00:03:53.730> is

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
switch right there and what it does is

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.240 
switch right there and what it does is
the<00:03:55.109> red<00:03:55.349> means<00:03:55.620> that<00:03:55.829> it's<00:03:55.950> on<00:03:56.069> sport<00:03:58.250> no

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
the red means that it's on sport no

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.369 
the red means that it's on sport no
light<00:03:59.459> means<00:03:59.670> it's<00:03:59.879> stuck<00:04:01.069> the<00:04:02.069> green<00:04:02.280> light

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
light means it's stuck the green light

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.920 
light means it's stuck the green light
means<00:04:04.379> that<00:04:04.530> it's<00:04:04.769> in<00:04:05.280> between<00:04:05.760> stock<00:04:06.720> and

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
means that it's in between stock and

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.979 
means that it's in between stock and
sport<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.879> Sprint<00:04:09.120> Booster<00:04:09.450> basically

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
sport and the Sprint Booster basically

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.179 
sport and the Sprint Booster basically
what<00:04:10.079> it<00:04:10.169> does<00:04:10.290> is<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:10.590> eliminates<00:04:10.769> the

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
what it does is it eliminates the

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.990 
what it does is it eliminates the
throttle<00:04:11.989> electronic<00:04:12.989> throttle<00:04:13.169> delay<00:04:14.000> so

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
throttle electronic throttle delay so

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.159 
throttle electronic throttle delay so
that<00:04:15.030> when<00:04:15.389> you<00:04:15.480> get<00:04:15.599> on<00:04:15.689> the<00:04:15.780> gas<00:04:15.959> that

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
that when you get on the gas that

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.779 
that when you get on the gas that
responds<00:04:16.650> immediately<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:17.250> so<00:04:17.370> it<00:04:17.430> has<00:04:17.579> that

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
responds immediately and so it has that

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.319 
responds immediately and so it has that
delay<00:04:18.259> which<00:04:19.259> is<00:04:19.789> probably<00:04:20.789> one<00:04:20.910> of<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.060> nicer

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
delay which is probably one of the nicer

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.170 
delay which is probably one of the nicer
things<00:04:21.539> I've<00:04:21.720> done<00:04:22.520> so<00:04:23.520> that<00:04:23.669> when<00:04:23.820> you<00:04:23.910> get<00:04:24.060> on

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
things I've done so that when you get on

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.430 
things I've done so that when you get on
the<00:04:24.419> throttle<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:25.470> responds<00:04:25.830> immediately

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:42.020 

so<00:04:31.440> one<00:04:31.740> more<00:04:32.270> look<00:04:33.270> at<00:04:33.420> the<00:04:33.540> vehicle<00:04:41.030> lowered

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
so one more look at the vehicle lowered

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.320 
so one more look at the vehicle lowered
stance<00:04:42.300> gives<00:04:42.570> it<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.690> sporty<00:04:43.080> or<00:04:43.110> look<00:04:44.330> sporty

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
stance gives it a sporty or look sporty

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:57.220 
stance gives it a sporty or look sporty
ride

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.380 

and<00:04:57.680> that's<00:04:57.950> my<00:04:58.120> 2007<00:04:59.200> ford<00:05:00.200> edge
