going into the model bit but that's just
that's<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.079> my<00:01:46.290> personal<00:01:46.710> opinion<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:47.280> these

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
that's just my personal opinion in these

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.929 
that's just my personal opinion in these
are<00:01:47.850> still<00:01:48.540> subject<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.200> change<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.890> let's<00:01:50.729> see

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
are still subject to change so let's see

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.179 
are still subject to change so let's see
what<00:01:51.090> happens<00:01:51.420> let's<00:01:51.689> go<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.189> another

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
what happens let's go to another

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.100 
what happens let's go to another
hairstyle<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.119> hair<00:01:54.329> color<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.869> change

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
hairstyle so hair color you can change

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
up all the hair colors

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.870

could change earrings and bottles but it

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.290 
could change earrings and bottles but it

but<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:13.590> may<00:02:13.980> be<00:02:14.010> wrong<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.610> i<00:02:14.670> guess<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
but it may be wrong so i guess in the

but it may be wrong so i guess in the
comments<00:02:15.300> let<00:02:15.480> me<00:02:15.630> know<00:02:15.690> something<00:02:15.960> wrong<00:02:16.140> but

weird so that's the female model so it's

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.820 
weird so that's the female model so it's
going<00:03:00.210> to<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.420> male<00:03:00.570> model<00:03:00.960> so<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.680> male

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
going to the male model so the male

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.590 
going to the male model so the male
model<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.280> first<00:03:02.489> thing<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:02.760> noticed<00:03:03.180> was<00:03:03.330> the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
model the first thing I noticed was the

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.600 
model the first thing I noticed was the
muscle<00:03:03.840> tone<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.980> muscle<00:03:05.280> tone<00:03:05.430> on<00:03:05.550> the

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
muscle tone so the muscle tone on the

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.340 
muscle tone so the muscle tone on the
blood<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:05.850> was<00:03:06.030> definitely<00:03:06.360> male<00:03:06.989> blood<00:03:07.200> us

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
blood I was definitely male blood us

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.380 
blood I was definitely male blood us
have<00:03:07.530> been<00:03:07.560> increased<00:03:08.190> cuz<00:03:08.489> they<00:03:08.670> if<00:03:09.180> i

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
have been increased cuz they if i

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.850 
have been increased cuz they if i
remember<00:03:09.540> correctly<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.200> older<00:03:10.470> miles<00:03:10.680> they

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
remember correctly the older miles they

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.010 
remember correctly the older miles they
were<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:11.010> bit<00:03:11.250> skinny<00:03:11.670> little<00:03:11.910> bit<00:03:12.090> flimsy<00:03:12.570> my

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
were a bit skinny little bit flimsy my

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.410 
were a bit skinny little bit flimsy my
opinion<00:03:13.410> but<00:03:14.100> now<00:03:14.340> they<00:03:14.489> have<00:03:14.520> bigger<00:03:15.000> muscles

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
opinion but now they have bigger muscles

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.920 
opinion but now they have bigger muscles
so<00:03:16.050> i<00:03:16.370> guess<00:03:17.370> that's<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.670> good<00:03:17.790> thing<00:03:17.850> get<00:03:18.660> what

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
so i guess that's a good thing get what

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.150 
so i guess that's a good thing get what
i<00:03:19.050> was<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.230> little<00:03:19.350> bit<00:03:19.560> more<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:20.130> know
