Hey just wanted to make a quick video to address
a question that has been raised to me online a

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.130
number of times, through some youtube videos
and comments and such and a question that i

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:19.130
had before i purchased the iris plus does
the hero 4 fit the stock 2d gimbal that you

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.400
can purchase with the iris plus the simple
answer.... yes it fits perfectly. i have been

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.800
flying for about a month with thestock 2d
setupand the hero 4 ist worked perfectly i

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.640
know there were a lot of concerns with possibilities
of the hero 3 having a different weight ratio

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.970
or something like that with the batteries
being different and such.... i dont have a

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.350
hero 3 so i cannot compare it but i know that
this does work perfectly the only issue that

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.350
i have had is that the charging port / usb
port on the camera is not acessable when on

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.079
the gimbal as you cannot plug the USB cord
into it to download stuff / charge the camera

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.120
without removing it from the gimbal which
is kind of a pain each time since you have

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.120
to remove some screws on the back of the gimbal
so i went ahead and built this 90 degree adapter

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.560
for it. i ordered an adapter online and it
... didnt fit originally so you can see i

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.320
had to cut and pear it down to get it to fit
in there...... but it does fit into the camera

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:39.260
on the gimbal just fine so i can download
and charge the camera without having to take

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.619
it out of the gimbal so overall i have been
really impressed with the setup the gimbal

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.610
actually works quite well, take a look at
some of my youtube videos to see how well

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.060
it works go out and buy a hero 4 and strap
it on an iris plus its aewsome
