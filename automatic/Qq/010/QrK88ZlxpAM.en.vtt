00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.130
 tell you about some rules 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.929
 that exist in my kitchen during 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.790
 first you have to manage in half an hour 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.410
 the second rule, you'll need to 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.420
 cook for 4 servings 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.039
 and the last third rule you should 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.840
 be sure to use all those 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.140
 the ingredients that brought with them 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.570
 only one would like to clarify something 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.920
 regarding garnish akmaral you will 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.980
 cook rice yes just rice is pure white 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.079
 pure veins pure white riza and i'm so 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.329
 understand you want to add something 300 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.820
 the relics to draw arman does not like 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.190
 lumbago but I try not to contradict 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.020
 my not mind but taste 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.629
 preferences still la mano have 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.840
 some even if he bought them 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.780
 after marriage there but it's his 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.149
 preference as we should our 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.760
 man please your meals should be 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.160
 very similar if not in the same flight 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.960
 there will be nothing else to be a vegetable this 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.270
 arman can immediately guess what it is 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.939
 dish so i want to take an hour 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.330
 the solution is either you are cooking pure white rice 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.150
 either you cook it with vegetables 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.580

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.720

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.540

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.170
 there but she said that he likes to 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.530

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.810
 I like a normal mother, I must take into account 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.330

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.119

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.520
