00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
bevel is square all the way around I had

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.189 
bevel is square all the way around I had
a<00:00:20.100> question<00:00:20.369> as<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.850> which<00:00:21.090> flute<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.779> was<00:00:21.960> cut

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
a question as to which flute I was cut

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.490 
a question as to which flute I was cut
here<00:00:22.410> which<00:00:22.590> wing<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.310> was<00:00:23.490> cutting<00:00:23.760> with<00:00:24.500> it

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
here which wing I was cutting with it

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.710 
here which wing I was cutting with it
depends<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.550> what<00:00:26.789> I'm<00:00:26.970> doing<00:00:27.390> which<00:00:27.660> winging

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
depends on what I'm doing which winging

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.580 
depends on what I'm doing which winging
for<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:31.019> sheering<00:00:31.769> cut<00:00:34.130> of<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.280> flute<00:00:35.579> wrapped

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
for a sheering cut of the flute wrapped

for a sheering cut of the flute wrapped
actually<00:00:37.590> rolled<00:00:38.450> slightly

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
actually rolled slightly

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.110 
actually rolled slightly
counterclockwise<00:00:40.760> so<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.120> wing<00:00:44.120> has

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
counterclockwise so that this wing has

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.310 
counterclockwise so that this wing has
given<00:00:45.570> me<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> shearing<00:00:46.170> pet<00:00:49.129> for<00:00:50.539> bulk<00:00:51.539> removal

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
given me a shearing pet for bulk removal

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.420 
given me a shearing pet for bulk removal
I<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.980> flute<00:00:53.460> rolled<00:00:54.649> clockwise<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
I have the flute rolled clockwise and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.209 
I have the flute rolled clockwise and
it's<00:00:57.420> actually<00:00:58.340> the<00:00:59.340> nose<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:02.010> right

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
it's actually the nose and the right

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.600 
it's actually the nose and the right
hand<00:01:02.489> wing<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.989> orientation<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:05.430> would

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
hand wing in this orientation that would

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.440 
hand wing in this orientation that would
be<00:01:05.760> doing<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.240> cutting

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450

I'll<00:01:09.450> try<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.869> show<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:16.880> that<00:01:17.880> even

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
I'll try and show you that even

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.660 
I'll try and show you that even
basically

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.289 

with<00:01:23.439> the<00:01:24.439> section<00:01:24.890> just<00:01:25.100> here<00:01:25.430> below<00:01:26.119> the

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
with the section just here below the

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.779 
with the section just here below the
nose<00:01:26.570> of<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.409> couch

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
nose of the couch

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:34.840 
nose of the couch
and<00:01:29.689> this<00:01:29.990> wing<00:01:30.939> is<00:01:33.039> basically<00:01:34.039> peeling<00:01:34.700> out

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
and this wing is basically peeling out

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:54.510 
and this wing is basically peeling out
the<00:01:35.060> waste

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.270 

that's<00:01:55.090> pretty<00:01:55.750> much<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.380> cut<00:01:56.619> you<00:01:56.830> get<00:01:57.040> my

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
that's pretty much the cut you get my

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.260 
that's pretty much the cut you get my
psyche<00:01:58.210> on<00:01:58.479> couch<00:02:01.110> with<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.610> regular<00:02:03.610> grind<00:02:03.820> or

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
psyche on couch with a regular grind or

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.520 
psyche on couch with a regular grind or
traditional<00:02:04.930> drag<00:02:06.690> where<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.810> wings<00:02:08.050> are

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
traditional drag where the wings are

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.040 
traditional drag where the wings are
much<00:02:09.280> more<00:02:10.030> vertical<00:02:12.270> if<00:02:13.270> I<00:02:13.450> have<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.780> flute

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
much more vertical if I have the flute

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.030 
much more vertical if I have the flute
rolled<00:02:14.319> over

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
rolled over

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:30.120 
rolled over
I<00:02:15.069> get<00:02:15.489> basically<00:02:24.209> where<00:02:25.209> I'm<00:02:26.940> cutting<00:02:29.130> but

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
I get basically where I'm cutting but

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.979 
I get basically where I'm cutting but
just<00:02:30.940> below<00:02:31.360> Center<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:34.000> wing<00:02:34.570> is

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
just below Center and the wing is

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:43.380 
just below Center and the wing is
peeling<00:02:35.380> out<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.860> waist<00:02:42.030> depending<00:02:43.030> on<00:02:43.180> how

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
peeling out the waist depending on how

00:02:43.390 --> 00:03:09.620 
peeling out the waist depending on how
heavy<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.810> cut<00:02:44.140> I'm<00:02:44.380> making

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:23.110 

for<00:03:09.990> a<00:03:10.020> little<00:03:10.350> more<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:11.280> finesse<00:03:19.460> to<00:03:20.460> handle

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.390 

and<00:03:24.120> make<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.390> shearing<00:03:24.840> set<00:03:25.290> with<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:25.710> wing<00:03:26.040> a

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
and make a shearing set with this wing a

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:56.640 
and make a shearing set with this wing a
bevel<00:03:27.180> supportive<00:03:27.720> Jerry

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:07.020 

which<00:03:57.650> leaves<00:03:57.950> a<00:03:58.220> pretty<00:03:58.460> good<00:03:58.700> surface

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.980 

that's<00:04:08.030> a<00:04:08.150> cut<00:04:08.360> that<00:04:08.570> I<00:04:08.720> like<00:04:08.990> quite<00:04:09.680> a<00:04:09.710> bit

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
that's a cut that I like quite a bit

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.930 
that's a cut that I like quite a bit
which<00:04:11.990> is<00:04:12.110> why<00:04:12.320> I<00:04:12.350> still<00:04:12.830> have<00:04:13.040> four<00:04:13.370> gouges

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
which is why I still have four gouges

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.760 
which is why I still have four gouges
