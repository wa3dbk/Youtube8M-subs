00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.770

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.310
 Hello 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.150
 of course I do not mind 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.040
 so it all started from the moment I 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.900
 found that in some sort of gloomy premises with 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.639
 total memory loss 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.869
 I could not remember who and where I am and what 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:19.359
 i need here 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.859
 but it did not last long in one of 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.119
 rooms of this scary place i 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:26.049
 found a note in which he wrote 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.149
 to myself 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:29.269
 after before you 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.749
 rather, I learned my name 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:33.939
 and what and why did you drink alexis 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.259
 oblivion 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:36.960
 further it was said 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.730
 that i need to kill some 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.739
 Alexandra 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.650
 I am a flowering siregar 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.449
 explore on my heels 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:46.000
 as it turned out 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.360
 I was in the castle of Barentsburg 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.189
 whose owner 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.579
 and was the very Alexander 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.579
 but now let's move on to ap photo 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.449
 there was just unbearable 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:01.519
 as you already know i'm scared of the dark 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.669
 a couple of minutes without light and I feel sick 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.799
 there is no headache 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.700
 in that damn castle 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.509
 there were a lot of such places 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:14.589
 so I constantly had to look 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:16.199
 everywhere work Nietzsche 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:18.259
 for lighting candles torches 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:20.599
 as well as oils for smoked lamps 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.680
 yes lamp faithful assistant illuminating 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.150
 way 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.299
 but only while they are mass 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.809
 when the voltage associated with must 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:30.639
 look for a candle or a torch nearby 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.319
 not to be in this joke of the dark and 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.029
 light at least a small area 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:37.139
 ways dark 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.319
 it was far from the worst thing 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.149
 seen in this castle 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:43.060
 scary sounds 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.890
 very often some steps were heard 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.139
 pieces 100 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.149
 all this very strong acted on me 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:51.869
 nerves 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:54.619
 I understood that these sounds 

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:56.029
 I was not alone 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:58.029
 wandering around the castle 

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.319
 zombie mutants 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.300
 once 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.870
 being in one of the rooms 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.979
 I heard roaring and approaching footsteps 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:06.849
 there was nowhere to go this creature 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.429
 stones were going straight 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:10.339
 I already started to think about how this thing 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:12.929
 will now call me apart while my 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:14.080
 the glance didn't fall 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.129
 on the closet 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.940
 the same second I jumped him off 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.410
 slam the very childhood but the most 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.759
 terrible did not expect 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.629
 when i went down to the lower levels 

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.229
 target skolkovo 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.490
 there deep underground 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.999
 in the marital dungeons 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.669
 I ran into this creepy creature and 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.809
 it is so gala to the minister that i 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:35.520
 almost crazy 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.259
 beside myself from what I saw, I rushed 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.819
 run didn't swing side to side in 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:41.309
 all eyes were 

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:43.339
 seeing the camera in front of me I burst 

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:45.469
 there and hid in a corner 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:47.639
 ok enough about that 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.219
 I also had to decide for myself 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:51.249
 tasks 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:52.979
 They mainly concerned the repair 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:53.969
 equipment 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.119
 it has become Italy set on 

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:58.229
 place the next day 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:59.319
 And so on 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.849
 this job just a little bit of me 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:02.509
 reassured after suffering 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:03.529
 stress 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:05.459
 I have never even had any 

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:07.009
 difficulties in these matters 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:08.599
 everything was easy enough 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.939
 wandering around the castle I was everywhere 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:13.900
 page of his diary 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.879
 where did you gradually learn your past 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:19.069
 about how I got to this place 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.550
 and what I had to do 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.650
 I understood why I needed livesey 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.759
 oblivion 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.629
 I did such terrible things the course was victory 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:29.029
 monstrously 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.969

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.129
 everything will be fine 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:39.840
 if that's the case then nobody tells it 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.969
 Forget about it 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:43.930
 bring him a sedative 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.460

 I'm sorry but we have to close 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:52.800
 the door to the castle are the rules of the hospital 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.270
 as you can see we are well shone his camera 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.539
 then was spent on payment remains 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:05:59.930
 several candles 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.009
 so you can not be afraid of the dark 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.009
 for courage and cameras will follow the feed and 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:08.499
 if something happens he will come 

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:09.610
 for help 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.610
 good night 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.669
 someone walked just 15 minutes 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.469
 and when he returned 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:22.849
 found that the outcome of the game hand measures not 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.639
 you can see fire 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.169
 i opened the door 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.389
 and saw that contrary to the industry 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.619
 that's 

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:32.789
 lying motionless on the floor 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:34.550
 for 15 minutes 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.680
 drink he 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.550
 after five minutes can not be in 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.279
 the darkness i told you x 

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:45.499
 not at all
