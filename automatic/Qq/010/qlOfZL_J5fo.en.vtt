00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.259
 That Phil is the educational system yes so very wonderful about three decades 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.060
 Before filling in the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.390
 Ah ... have an educational system to do terribly 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.750
 And eight domestic respectively Well what we are doing about directly we are renovating 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.519
 The whole thing 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.230
 They decided for some reason you know ... that the Republicans are here 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.830
 He will call them you do not know the good social Sousse 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.310
 But there was a focus on equality what kind of this is that crazy about 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.880
 And it's not the qualitative results that they were not so uh ... do 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.160
 Test on doing a test until the age of sixty 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.929
 So do not test Sidi uniform 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:34.710
 Equality of residence opportunity does not matter if you are poor 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.490
 Or milk or Richard 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.080
 Are objective 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.600
 Is to achieve equality of opportunity and by the way in this amazing I would make 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.260
 My republic has exploded in u_s_ uh ... we are not uh ... 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.170
 Go to due to you but we will not try to cut 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.290
 Already want America to like 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.940
 We do not just want everyone to be the right sponsor for a fair chance of 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.970
 Competitiveness in their schools Yes I thought about missing a lot of pressure 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:01.550
 With them 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.030
 You'll be the best you can have a stick for that reason and I was not like that and 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.180
 I sat down until I could tell 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.750
 When this setback let you know well 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.790
 Discover what you are passionate about 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.530
 He continued your dreams 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.270
 Now everything is fine 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.460
 Born crazy but waiting to see there 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.950
 They said you know what we pre-school kindergarten canceled 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.250
 You are not allowed to go to school for yourself 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.300
 Do you know why his children should be tight 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.920
 The head is exploding from America No one is a nice kiss to her We ordered it 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.140
 Different things 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.060
 Nor private schools alone 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.500
 Everyone has to go to public school 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.530
 But what accommodation will not be no matter how it happens 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.329
 Get this 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.740
 We teacher husband will work on a decent 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.030
 We gonna gonna require them now that I think they are ready to start 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.070
 Sydney dentist subtract 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.770
 Ah ... but you know it's uh ... if the movie was even getting health care et al 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.479
 Gra and also keep in mind changed with the role of teachers are 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.370
 It has become much more prestigious 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.050
 Like it was and did not like how your teacher no matter how big your making and false 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.420
 I was like all my biggest professors this large in our minds explode 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.489
 Teachers or it was not difficult to get to school 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.029
 To be a teacher than it is 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:15.180
 To get to school to be a lawyer or document 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.980
 No opinion of the series 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.699
 And then you can become a teacher and in reverence in this fine aspect 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:23.019
 Say no sterilization until you're sixty 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.529
 Uh ... The list goes on and so they do not even participate in the 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:29.750
 International work as they wish to test the ground is silly 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.880
 I know what these children want to do 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.819
 And give them a chance to do the right as well 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.339
 Uh ... At the beginning of two thousand A 2002 news 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:39.060
 One 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.709
 It is not as if you know what you are saying that it is in hand condition here 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.209
 The explanation was a piece of study pieces that she had 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.559
 Well so let's let Andrew have them there and see what happens if we do not expect 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.319
 Number one in the world 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.939
 She was the one in the world 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.680
 It was much less than the foot unit that this thought 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.740
 You must have experienced an accident we are not even trying pastries that try to get to 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.289
 People if TIX air right 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:09.870
 They tested it several times not that you are suing in years 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.359
 Consistently top three in the world 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.699
 Others say of course South Korea where we gonna kiss death 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:19.969
 For Riyadh daily and success, this is a different way to 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:20.849
 did that 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.569
 A search that certainly does not want to argue about what a great way to go 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.490
 Endemic to that man who accepted the education 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.840
 In a section in their base the issue of education comes along in this vein 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.749
 United State_ 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:34.729
 Every physical shop in Atlanta 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:38.789
 He explained Americans did not do the Americans a fair competition so you can 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:40.249
 I had to compete 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:42.769
 Noble Tweet do not do cooperation 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.859
 Like paying so I would have to have private schools even though we do not have to 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.139
 Private schools is so good anyway what private schools 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.879
 Central critic but we do not have your own schools like 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.749
 He's exploiting the system 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:55.639
 And it's not getting into their heads 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.309
 The areas are lit like this 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:59.349
 So anyway the conclusion is 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.899
 What uh ... more competition right 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:07.769
 It's like going there is not a lot of mine is quite the opposite of the bottom line 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.539
 And then 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:11.629
 And he wrote a book about her entry 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.659
 They say in America try to find out 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.299
 From finishing one of course facing the wind in the New York Times coverage 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.439
 From that story a different article so they can quote some friends from 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:22.919
 Preservation of think tanks 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.949
 All you can not do you can do if the model here is selling it perfectly 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.059
 The situation is different 

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:31.389
 Uh ... you have to know all that one there is a much smaller mobile 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.889
 We do that for you justifying countries allow compared to one of our states about 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.139
 Behavior of the same size 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.840
 Disaster 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.949
 Multiply the world right oh ... Well that's it now, I love this password 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.430
 They have a more homogeneous set 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.339
 You know that her master password is good about what they all are 

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:49.990
 Cable that forcier 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.289
 They are in fact so you do not know what a neighbor is 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.069
 Exactly the same 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:56.330
 Achievement and creativity savings 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.069
 A harmonious society 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:03.300
 They use the American model disaster this core near the bomb 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.239
 So now 

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:05.419
 What is now 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.309
 We will never gonna check any behind you and our America is a story you know what 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.000
 They say 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.120
 As well as the right to education system 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.279
 Rivals pasand but ship in the world here 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:19.969
 But we made last year as the number fifty remember your nineteen disasters 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:21.780
 to 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.880
 All the worst you've been assigned
