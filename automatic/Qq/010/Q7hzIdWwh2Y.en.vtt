 work on the modern architecture of the 900 and on contemporary architecture for 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.789
 these two 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.650
 great themes of 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.310
 interest is determining museum and different choices 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.369
 it is the most traditional 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.190
 the essence of conservation documentation enhancement 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.210
 the choice on the closure of the 900 most innovative experimental one alone 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.770
 on contemporary architecture that will be realized by calling architects such 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.769
 demonstration of their ideas on contemporary space 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.370
 the architecture collections collect drawings models dressed documents of the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.570
 twentieth century architects of contemporary architects

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.970
 archives through which it will be possible to directly access everyone 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.680
 the material 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.270
 presented in digital format photo mina 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.350
 original 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.230
 and this innovative way of understanding a museum of architecture that is known 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.150
 work on an object that is absent from renting the museum the flying architecture 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.150
 capitalized architecture built outside of the museum spaces 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.100
 Specks is presented inside the museum through 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.780
 a story and through its representations precisely model drawings

 photographs and videos 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.090
 for the inauguration of the maxi artemax museum ironing have chosen to 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.929
 present the respective collections with a single large exhibition entitled Spazio 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.509
 space to the unifying theme of the research of artists and architects 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.309
 contemporary serit artists who showcase works already completed 

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:09.590
 for architecture we have called 10 international groups to you to develop one 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.739
 specific installation for this new to compare on the topic of space 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:22.379
 even with the space of the Caribbean death for me 10 films turned out to be films 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.370
 interesting because they demonstrate the different research trends 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.489
 contemporary architecture 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.440

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.409
 the Italian culture of the 20th century with the original and eclectic uprising 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.050
 architecture and also the arts we're all publishing 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:56.400

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.270
 it was this opportunity 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.299
 to document also the theme of the conservation of these testimonies 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.629
