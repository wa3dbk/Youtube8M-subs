00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
things from rushing too much so I think

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.520 
things from rushing too much so I think
that<00:02:38.330> that's<00:02:38.420> something<00:02:38.630> that<00:02:38.840> I've<00:02:39.140> tried<00:02:39.410> to

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
that that's something that I've tried to

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.280 
that that's something that I've tried to
be<00:02:39.620> more<00:02:39.770> cause<00:02:40.250> than<00:02:40.460> of<00:02:40.610> is<00:02:40.790> just<00:02:41.690> relaxing

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
be more cause than of is just relaxing

be more cause than of is just relaxing
and<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:43.270> not<00:02:44.270> pushing<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:44.810> too<00:02:44.930> too<00:02:45.290> hard

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
and and not pushing it too too hard

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.170 
and and not pushing it too too hard
because<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.770> lot<00:02:46.070> of<00:02:46.100> times<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:46.580> get<00:02:46.940> up<00:02:47.060> on

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
because a lot of times you get up on

stage<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.780> get<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.230> little<00:02:48.470> excited<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.070> you

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
stage and get a little excited and you

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.340 
stage and get a little excited and you
tend<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.060> want<00:02:50.240> to<00:02:50.300> just<00:02:50.390> rush<00:02:50.630> through<00:02:50.660> it<00:02:51.050> and
