Stimpy<00:04:17.049> would<00:04:17.169> say<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:18.010> also<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.400> toy

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
Stimpy would say and also the the toy

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.920 
Stimpy would say and also the the toy
the<00:04:19.510> figure<00:04:19.750> is<00:04:19.840> actually<00:04:20.169> very<00:04:20.349> very<00:04:20.500> frail

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
the figure is actually very very frail

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.830 
the figure is actually very very frail
very<00:04:22.049> very<00:04:22.410> like<00:04:22.740> you<00:04:23.160> can<00:04:23.280> see<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.610> arms<00:04:24.180> the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
very very like you can see the arms the

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.170 
very very like you can see the arms the
legs<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.410> neck<00:04:25.650> these<00:04:26.340> are<00:04:26.490> actually<00:04:26.880> really

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
legs the neck these are actually really

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.360 
legs the neck these are actually really
thin<00:04:27.600> and<00:04:27.840> you<00:04:28.380> know<00:04:28.470> just<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.770> little<00:04:29.039> bit<00:04:29.190> of

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
thin and you know just a little bit of

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.100 
thin and you know just a little bit of
pressure<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:30.270> I<00:04:30.330> feel<00:04:30.479> like<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.750> would<00:04:30.870> break

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
pressure and I feel like it would break

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.930 
pressure and I feel like it would break
so<00:04:31.410> it's<00:04:31.530> a<00:04:31.620> very<00:04:31.889> very<00:04:32.130> delicate<00:04:32.340> figure

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
so it's a very very delicate figure

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.180 
so it's a very very delicate figure
which<00:04:33.810> is<00:04:33.840> why<00:04:34.080> I'm<00:04:34.199> really<00:04:34.380> glad<00:04:34.590> it<00:04:34.800> comes

what<00:05:54.030> I<00:05:54.060> don't<00:05:54.360> like<00:05:54.539> about<00:05:54.690> these<00:05:54.870> figures

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
what I don't like about these figures

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.830 
what I don't like about these figures
though<00:05:55.440> is<00:05:55.590> that<00:05:55.639> it<00:05:56.639> sort<00:05:57.210> of<00:05:57.300> messes<00:05:57.690> with

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
though is that it sort of messes with

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.360 
though is that it sort of messes with
the<00:05:57.960> scale<00:05:58.259> a<00:05:58.289> little<00:05:58.590> bit<00:05:58.860> you<00:05:59.039> know<00:05:59.159> here

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
the scale a little bit you know here

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.570 
the scale a little bit you know here
like<00:05:59.610> here's<00:06:00.180> mr.<00:06:00.539> horse<00:06:00.750> next<00:06:01.050> to<00:06:01.169> Stimpy<00:06:01.680> and

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
like here's mr. horse next to Stimpy and

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.730 
like here's mr. horse next to Stimpy and
actually<00:06:03.120> in<00:06:03.240> the<00:06:03.389> cartoon<00:06:03.780> if<00:06:03.990> they<00:06:04.080> were<00:06:04.139> if

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
actually in the cartoon if they were if

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.830 
actually in the cartoon if they were if
this<00:06:04.919> were<00:06:05.099> according<00:06:05.639> to<00:06:05.669> scale<00:06:06.060> it<00:06:06.720> would

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
this were according to scale it would

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.260 
this were according to scale it would
probably<00:06:07.229> be<00:06:07.500> something<00:06:07.770> more<00:06:08.099> like<00:06:08.270> like

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
probably be something more like like

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.089 
probably be something more like like
this<00:06:09.539> I<00:06:09.840> think<00:06:10.380> they<00:06:10.650> could<00:06:10.830> have<00:06:10.919> actually

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099 
this I think they could have actually

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:13.670 
this I think they could have actually
easily<00:06:12.060> actually<00:06:12.810> found<00:06:13.320> two<00:06:13.530> other

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
easily actually found two other

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.379 
easily actually found two other
characters<00:06:14.250> from<00:06:14.280> the<00:06:14.729> series<00:06:14.940> that<00:06:15.270> would

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
characters from the series that would

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:18.379 
characters from the series that would
have<00:06:15.479> been<00:06:15.630> more<00:06:15.979> more<00:06:16.979> in<00:06:17.580> line<00:06:18.030> with<00:06:18.060> the

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
have been more more in line with the

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:19.969 
have been more more in line with the
scale<00:06:18.720> that<00:06:18.930> they<00:06:19.050> did<00:06:19.289> here<00:06:19.500> at<00:06:19.590> like<00:06:19.740> muddy

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
scale that they did here at like muddy

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.620 
scale that they did here at like muddy
mudskipper<00:06:20.220> I<00:06:20.580> think<00:06:20.880> would<00:06:21.000> worked<00:06:21.270> great

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
mudskipper I think would worked great

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.469 
mudskipper I think would worked great
you<00:06:22.620> know<00:06:22.710> I<00:06:22.740> think<00:06:23.070> I<00:06:23.490> think<00:06:23.909> you<00:06:24.210> could<00:06:24.389> have

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
you know I think I think you could have

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:26.810 
you know I think I think you could have
done<00:06:24.720> other<00:06:25.050> characters<00:06:25.770> other<00:06:25.979> than<00:06:26.099> these

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
done other characters other than these

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.790 
done other characters other than these
two<00:06:26.880> who<00:06:27.330> again<00:06:28.020> two<00:06:28.320> of<00:06:28.409> my<00:06:28.470> favorite

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
two who again two of my favorite

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.379 
two who again two of my favorite
characters<00:06:29.009> in<00:06:29.280> the<00:06:29.370> series<00:06:29.699> but<00:06:29.880> they<00:06:30.240> don't

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:30.389 
characters in the series but they don't

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:31.600 
characters in the series but they don't
really<00:06:30.479> work<00:06:30.750> with

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
really work with

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.340 
really work with
in<00:06:31.880> terms<00:06:32.210> of<00:06:32.360> a<00:06:32.420> line<00:06:32.840> of<00:06:32.990> minifigures

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.020 
in terms of a line of minifigures

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
because it does throw off the scale a

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.510 
because it does throw off the scale a
little<00:06:35.180> bit<00:06:35.570> but<00:06:36.140> anyway<00:06:36.440> there's<00:06:37.100> the<00:06:37.280> set
