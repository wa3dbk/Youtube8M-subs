00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
this is actually still one of the best

this is actually still one of the best
guns<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.560> entire<00:00:28.830> game

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
guns in the entire game

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.310 
guns in the entire game
why<00:00:29.640> because<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> recoil<00:00:30.570> pattern<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.109> very

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
why because the recoil pattern is very

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.410 
why because the recoil pattern is very
easy<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.890> control<00:00:32.160> very<00:00:32.640> predictable<00:00:33.149> all<00:00:33.329> it

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
easy to control very predictable all it

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.020 
easy to control very predictable all it
does<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.230> goes<00:00:34.380> up<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.800> little<00:00:34.920> bit<00:00:35.219> vertical

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
does is it goes up a little bit vertical

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.360 
does is it goes up a little bit vertical
or<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.510> sometimes<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.170> top<00:00:37.710> right<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.280> all

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
or and sometimes to the top right so all

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
or and sometimes to the top right so all
you<00:00:38.430> have<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.820> pull<00:00:39.030> down<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
you have to do is pull down to the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.940 
you have to do is pull down to the
bottom<00:00:39.750> left<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.200> little<00:00:40.440> bit<00:00:40.680> when<00:00:40.860> you're

with it for a while if you're a newbie
so<00:00:51.469> remember<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.680> damage<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.460> an

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
so remember the damage on it is an

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.360 
so remember the damage on it is an
average<00:00:54.300> 50<00:00:54.870> which<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.289> pretty<00:00:55.710> good<00:00:55.920> already

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
average 50 which is pretty good already

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.939 
average 50 which is pretty good already
the<00:00:56.789> aim<00:00:56.969> spread<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.449> 0.8<00:00:58.410> which<00:00:58.680> means<00:00:58.859> you're

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
the aim spread is 0.8 which means you're

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.290 
the aim spread is 0.8 which means you're
going<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.190> pretty<00:00:59.370> accurate<00:00:59.550> with<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.059> up

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
going to be pretty accurate with this up

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.270 
going to be pretty accurate with this up
to<00:01:00.510> around<00:01:00.719> mid<00:01:00.960> range<00:01:01.199> hip<00:01:01.620> spread<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:01.980> also

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
to around mid range hip spread is also

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.299 
to around mid range hip spread is also
pretty<00:01:02.760> decent<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> starting<00:01:04.140> weapon<00:01:04.309> 2.29

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
pretty decent for a starting weapon 2.29

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.510 
pretty decent for a starting weapon 2.29
and<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.840> move<00:01:06.990> spread<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.159> good<00:01:08.340> as<00:01:08.460> it

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
and the move spread is not as good as it

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.539 
and the move spread is not as good as it
could<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:09.030> 4.15<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.530> when<00:01:11.250> further

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
could be it's 4.15 but when further

this<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.020> actually<00:01:37.500> really<00:01:37.770> good<00:01:38.280> at<00:01:38.750> medium

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
this is actually really good at medium

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.569 
this is actually really good at medium
range<00:01:39.960> close<00:01:40.229> range<00:01:40.590> whatever<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:41.400> long

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
range close range whatever and as long

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.010 
range close range whatever and as long
as<00:01:41.610> you're<00:01:41.909> aiming<00:01:42.180> for<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> head<00:01:42.450> even<00:01:42.840> at

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
as you're aiming for the head even at

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.600 
as you're aiming for the head even at
medium<00:01:43.320> ranges<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:43.860> still<00:01:44.189> headshot

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
medium ranges you can still headshot

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.789 
medium ranges you can still headshot
because<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.540> hip<00:01:45.689> spread<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.290> good<00:01:46.590> I

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
because the hip spread is so good I

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.380

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.990 
don't even have to aim down my site half
the<00:01:48.509> time<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.320> point<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.770> click

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
the time I just have to point and click

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.999 
the time I just have to point and click
like<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.210> ok<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:51.960> here<00:01:52.200> I'm<00:01:52.290> playing<00:01:52.409> CTF<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
shredder for some reason the spawns are

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.940 
shredder for some reason the spawns are
retarded<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:54.960> everyone's<00:01:55.380> spawning<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.829> that

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
retarded so everyone's spawning in that

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
and I do a full reload just in time to

any warning so I have to be on my guard

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.460 
any warning so I have to be on my guard
at<00:03:02.299> all<00:03:02.840> times

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
at all times

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.840 
at all times
look<00:03:03.680> at<00:03:03.769> this<00:03:03.860> I'm<00:03:03.980> using<00:03:04.069> the<00:03:04.250> depot<00:03:04.670> as

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
look at this I'm using the depot as

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.910 
look at this I'm using the depot as
cover<00:03:05.390> from<00:03:05.780> this<00:03:05.959> guy's<00:03:06.140> bullets<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.739> then

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
cover from this guy's bullets and then

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.920 
cover from this guy's bullets and then
even<00:03:07.489> though<00:03:07.579> there's<00:03:07.760> a<00:03:07.820> hand<00:03:08.060> icon<00:03:08.239> blocking

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
even though there's a hand icon blocking

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.599 
even though there's a hand icon blocking
my<00:03:09.049> crosshair<00:03:09.470> I'm<00:03:09.590> still<00:03:09.829> using<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.250> as<00:03:10.370> kind

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
my crosshair I'm still using it as kind

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.280 
my crosshair I'm still using it as kind
of<00:03:10.640> a<00:03:10.730> temporary<00:03:11.060> crosshair<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.750> shoot<00:03:11.959> at<00:03:12.109> him

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
of a temporary crosshair to shoot at him

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.800 
of a temporary crosshair to shoot at him
and<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:12.590> does<00:03:12.769> work<00:03:13.070> and<00:03:13.280> then<00:03:14.209> I<00:03:14.390> noticed

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
and it does work and then I noticed

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.080 
and it does work and then I noticed
there's<00:03:14.959> a<00:03:15.019> guy<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.829> my<00:03:16.010> left<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:16.370> also<00:03:16.700> one<00:03:16.910> to

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
there's a guy to my left and also one to

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.420 
there's a guy to my left and also one to
my<00:03:17.180> right<00:03:17.209> so<00:03:17.859> unfortunately<00:03:18.859> my<00:03:18.950> luck<00:03:19.250> runs

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
my right so unfortunately my luck runs

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.009 
my right so unfortunately my luck runs
out<00:03:19.609> here<00:03:19.940> because<00:03:20.299> my<00:03:20.450> aim<00:03:20.630> wasn't<00:03:20.810> good

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
out here because my aim wasn't good

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.170 
out here because my aim wasn't good
enough<00:03:21.049> but<00:03:21.530> I<00:03:21.709> did<00:03:22.070> stand<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.700> pretty<00:03:22.940> big

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
enough but I did stand a pretty big

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.210 
enough but I did stand a pretty big
chance<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.600> their<00:03:23.780> finally<00:03:24.560> in<00:03:24.709> this<00:03:24.799> vertigo

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
chance of their finally in this vertigo

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.250 
chance of their finally in this vertigo
def<00:03:25.430> match<00:03:25.670> I<00:03:25.880> make<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:26.299> play<00:03:26.600> that<00:03:26.840> gets<00:03:27.079> me<00:03:27.230> a

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
def match I make a play that gets me a

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.780 
def match I make a play that gets me a
whole<00:03:27.440> bunch<00:03:27.470> of<00:03:27.709> kills<00:03:27.920> in<00:03:28.130> a<00:03:28.190> very<00:03:28.400> short

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
whole bunch of kills in a very short

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.849 
whole bunch of kills in a very short
amount<00:03:29.060> of<00:03:29.150> time<00:03:29.209> and<00:03:29.600> as<00:03:30.049> you<00:03:30.140> can<00:03:30.230> see<00:03:30.440> my<00:03:30.590> aim

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
amount of time and as you can see my aim

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.490 
amount of time and as you can see my aim
is<00:03:31.070> not<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.519> greatest<00:03:32.030> but<00:03:32.120> aiming<00:03:33.109> is<00:03:33.260> only

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
is not the greatest but aiming is only

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.500 
is not the greatest but aiming is only
just<00:03:33.890> one<00:03:33.920> part<00:03:34.430> of<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:34.609> equation<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:35.269> other

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
just one part of the equation the other

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.990 
just one part of the equation the other
part<00:03:35.930> is<00:03:36.190> tactics<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.459> if<00:03:37.670> you<00:03:37.730> don't<00:03:37.880> have

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
part is tactics and if you don't have

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.400 
part is tactics and if you don't have
both<00:03:38.239> then<00:03:38.480> you're<00:03:38.570> not<00:03:38.660> going<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:38.870> do<00:03:38.989> well<00:03:39.230> no

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
both then you're not going to do well no

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.630 
both then you're not going to do well no
matter<00:03:39.560> what<00:03:39.650> kind<00:03:39.950> of<00:03:40.040> play<00:03:40.220> style<00:03:40.489> you<00:03:40.579> use

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
matter what kind of play style you use

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.819 
matter what kind of play style you use
see<00:03:41.329> I'm<00:03:41.480> using<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.780> default<00:03:42.109> AR<00:03:42.440> here<00:03:42.680> I'm

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
see I'm using the default AR here I'm

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.069 
see I'm using the default AR here I'm
making<00:03:43.010> sure<00:03:43.340> that<00:03:43.370> I'm<00:03:43.579> not<00:03:43.840> moving<00:03:44.840> too<00:03:45.049> much

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
making sure that I'm not moving too much

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.229 
making sure that I'm not moving too much
because<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.739> moving<00:03:45.980> spread<00:03:46.280> is<00:03:46.459> not<00:03:46.819> as<00:03:47.000> good

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
because the moving spread is not as good

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.240 
because the moving spread is not as good
as<00:03:47.329> it<00:03:47.450> could<00:03:47.690> be<00:03:47.870> it's<00:03:48.140> a<00:03:48.260> little<00:03:48.560> above<00:03:48.829> four

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
as it could be it's a little above four

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.190 
as it could be it's a little above four
so<00:03:49.549> you<00:03:49.609> want<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:49.880> keep<00:03:50.120> in<00:03:50.359> mind<00:03:50.900> the

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
so you want to keep in mind the

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.870 
so you want to keep in mind the
effective<00:03:51.680> distance<00:03:51.829> that<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.340> can<00:03:52.370> use<00:03:52.700> it

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
effective distance that you can use it

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.150 
effective distance that you can use it
at<00:03:53.030> that's<00:03:53.720> why<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:53.959> decide<00:03:54.319> to<00:03:54.350> move<00:03:54.560> directly

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
at that's why I decide to move directly

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.099 
at that's why I decide to move directly
up<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.459> this<00:03:55.609> corner<00:03:55.970> here<00:03:56.389> and<00:03:56.569> then<00:03:56.840> keep

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
up to this corner here and then keep

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.930 
up to this corner here and then keep
firing<00:03:57.620> so<00:03:58.040> if<00:03:58.190> you<00:03:58.280> plan<00:03:58.459> to<00:03:58.519> play<00:03:58.790> in

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
firing so if you plan to play in

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.250 
firing so if you plan to play in
competitive<00:03:59.420> black<00:03:59.600> light<00:03:59.840> in<00:04:00.019> the<00:04:00.109> near

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
competitive black light in the near

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.020 
competitive black light in the near
future<00:04:00.440> you're<00:04:01.100> gonna<00:04:01.220> have<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:01.519> get<00:04:01.730> used<00:04:01.880> to

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
future you're gonna have to get used to

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.640 
future you're gonna have to get used to
these<00:04:02.150> spread<00:04:02.420> conditions<00:04:02.870> because<00:04:03.049> everyone

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
these spread conditions because everyone

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.620 
these spread conditions because everyone
is<00:04:03.829> going<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:04.310> be<00:04:04.430> using<00:04:04.609> a<00:04:04.850> default<00:04:05.030> AR

used<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.560> default<00:04:25.710> AR<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.610> got<00:04:26.910> all<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.210> way

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
used the default AR and got all the way

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.150 
used the default AR and got all the way
up<00:04:27.390> to<00:04:27.510> level<00:04:27.630> 40<00:04:28.140> that<00:04:28.350> was<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.650> maximum

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
up to level 40 that was the maximum

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.500 
up to level 40 that was the maximum
level<00:04:29.340> back<00:04:29.640> then<00:04:29.880> and<00:04:30.090> he<00:04:30.210> never<00:04:30.420> used

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
level back then and he never used

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.600 
level back then and he never used
anything<00:04:31.200> else<00:04:31.410> and<00:04:31.950> he<00:04:32.010> said<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.250> don't<00:04:32.400> even

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
anything else and he said I don't even

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.160 
anything else and he said I don't even
need<00:04:32.850> to<00:04:32.910> use<00:04:33.120> anything<00:04:33.420> else<00:04:33.660> this<00:04:33.870> thing<00:04:34.050> is
