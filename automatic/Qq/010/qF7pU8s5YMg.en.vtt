00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
things of psychic abilities as a lot the

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.540 
things of psychic abilities as a lot the
good<00:03:10.080> bits<00:03:10.319> late<00:03:10.530> all<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.769> bad<00:03:10.920> bits<00:03:11.100> about<00:03:11.310> it

so<00:03:12.239> i<00:03:12.269> tend<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.569> listen<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.870> more<00:03:12.959> rockabilly

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
so i tend to listen to more rockabilly

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.330 
so i tend to listen to more rockabilly
because<00:03:13.680> that's<00:03:13.830> better<00:03:14.010> than<00:03:14.130> psychic

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
because that's better than psychic

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.390 
because that's better than psychic
ability<00:03:14.580> in<00:03:14.819> my<00:03:14.880> opinion<00:03:16.400> psychobilly

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
ability in my opinion psychobilly

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.490 
ability in my opinion psychobilly
evolved<00:03:17.910> out<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.090> rockabilly<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:19.019> it's<00:03:19.200> just<00:03:19.410> a

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
evolved out of rockabilly so it's just a
