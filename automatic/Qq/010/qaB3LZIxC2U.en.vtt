miked<00:01:22.860> they<00:01:23.460> stay<00:01:24.119> miked<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.780> believe<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
miked they stay miked I believe the

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.279 
miked they stay miked I believe the
whole<00:01:26.399> time<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.939> whole<00:01:26.969> game<00:01:27.619> until<00:01:28.619> they

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
whole time the whole game until they

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.240 
whole time the whole game until they
they<00:01:31.289> explode<00:01:31.710> or<00:01:31.890> something<00:01:32.280> or<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:33.299> even<00:01:34.250> saw

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
they explode or something or I even saw

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.139 
they explode or something or I even saw
I<00:01:36.289> made<00:01:37.289> it<00:01:37.409> believe<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.340> possible<00:01:38.880> if

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
I made it believe that it's possible if

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.810 
I made it believe that it's possible if
you<00:01:39.450> fly<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> helicopter<00:01:40.680> or<00:01:41.159> jet<00:01:41.369> out<00:01:41.609> of

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
you fly with a helicopter or jet out of

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.490 
you fly with a helicopter or jet out of
the<00:01:42.060> mat<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.630> short<00:01:42.840> amount<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.140> time<00:01:43.200> that

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
the mat for short amount of time that

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.679 
the mat for short amount of time that
the<00:01:44.100> mic<00:01:44.310> will<00:01:44.579> disappear<00:01:45.000> but<00:01:45.149> I'm<00:01:45.299> not

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
you can see the trying orifice there

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.560 
you can see the trying orifice there
nice<00:02:13.320> i<00:02:13.440> should<00:02:13.620> there<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.790> with<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> infantry

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
nice i should there so with the infantry

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.190 
nice i should there so with the infantry
it's<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.900> bit<00:02:16.050> more<00:02:16.260> complicated<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.660> if<00:02:18.660> the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
it's a bit more complicated and if the

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.680 
it's a bit more complicated and if the
if<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:19.530> spot<00:02:19.800> them<00:02:20.010> but<00:02:20.460> they<00:02:20.700> go<00:02:21.510> behind

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
if you spot them but they go behind

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.490 
if you spot them but they go behind
cover<00:02:22.080> their<00:02:22.920> denmark<00:02:23.910> will<00:02:24.510> disappear<00:02:25.140> after

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
cover their denmark will disappear after

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.970 
cover their denmark will disappear after
a<00:02:26.190> few<00:02:26.580> seconds<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.030> believe<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.960> you<00:02:28.050> have<00:02:28.500> to

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
a few seconds I believe so you have to

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.740 
a few seconds I believe so you have to
they<00:02:29.280> have<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.760> remain<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.360> your<00:02:30.480> line<00:02:30.630> of

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
they have to remain in your line of

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.130 
they have to remain in your line of
sight<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.260> stay<00:02:31.950> miked<00:02:32.450> otherwise<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.930> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
sight to stay miked otherwise and the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.050 
sight to stay miked otherwise and the
mic<00:02:34.320> will<00:02:34.890> disappear<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.520> they<00:02:35.760> are<00:02:35.820> not

spotted<00:02:36.510> anymore<00:02:37.430> also<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.490> get<00:02:38.930> credit<00:02:39.930> for

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
spotted anymore also you get credit for

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.030 
spotted anymore also you get credit for
spotting<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.860> believe<00:02:41.700> ten<00:02:41.970> points<00:02:42.360> if<00:02:43.040> someone

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
spotting I believe ten points if someone

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.199 
spotting I believe ten points if someone
kills<00:02:44.310> an<00:02:45.120> enemy<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.660> spot<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.970> might<00:02:47.970> be<00:02:48.180> a

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
kills an enemy you spot it might be a

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.949 
kills an enemy you spot it might be a
bit<00:02:48.510> more<00:02:48.810> with<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.800> with<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.489> helicopter<00:02:51.209> and
