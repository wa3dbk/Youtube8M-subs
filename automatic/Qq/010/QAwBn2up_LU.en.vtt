we<00:01:54.600> try<00:01:54.930> these<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.260> once<00:01:55.590> already<00:01:55.800> to<00:01:56.250> see

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790

we try these on once already to see
other<00:01:56.940> hood<00:01:57.330> there<00:01:57.660> get<00:01:58.380> order<00:01:59.010> size<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.610> I

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
other hood there get order size and I

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.880 
other hood there get order size and I
like<00:02:00.150> a<00:02:00.180> half<00:02:00.540> size<00:02:00.810> up<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.409> what<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.740> actually

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
like a half size up of what you actually

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.760 
like a half size up of what you actually
would<00:02:02.220> it<00:02:02.780> because<00:02:03.780> they<00:02:03.960> run<00:02:04.170> pretty<00:02:04.410> narrow

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
would it because they run pretty narrow

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.310 
would it because they run pretty narrow
but<00:02:05.300> other<00:02:06.300> than<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.600> he<00:02:06.900> seemed<00:02:07.140> like<00:02:07.290> a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
but other than that he seemed like a

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.430 
but other than that he seemed like a
pretty<00:02:07.710> big<00:02:08.009> tweaked<00:02:09.080> haven't<00:02:10.080> learned<00:02:10.289> I'm

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
pretty big tweaked haven't learned I'm

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.340 
pretty big tweaked haven't learned I'm
on<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.679> field<00:02:10.890> yet<00:02:11.130> i<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.459> got<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> mystery

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
but it seems they're pretty good i think

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.940 
but it seems they're pretty good i think
these<00:02:18.239> are<00:02:18.420> gonna<00:02:18.510> last<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.470> whole<00:02:19.650> season

that<00:02:23.070> they<00:02:23.130> also<00:02:23.670> look<00:02:24.360> at<00:02:24.570> when<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.840> get<00:02:25.020> the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
that they also look at when you get the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.300 
that they also look at when you get the
pizzas<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:26.459> part<00:02:26.910> right<00:02:27.180> here<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:29.040> seems
