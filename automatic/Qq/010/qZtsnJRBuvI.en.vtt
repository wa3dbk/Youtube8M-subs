I<00:00:06.230> decided<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.350> do<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.470> quick<00:00:07.859> test<00:00:08.250> tonight

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
I decided to do a quick test tonight

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.919 
I decided to do a quick test tonight
between<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.800> the<00:00:10.800> CCD<00:00:11.429> sensor<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.210> my<00:00:12.630> little

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
between the the CCD sensor in my little

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.500 
between the the CCD sensor in my little
Canon<00:00:13.349> 780<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.570> CMOS<00:00:16.139> sensor<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:17.330> in<00:00:18.330> my

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
Canon 780 is and the CMOS sensor I in my

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.210 
Canon 780 is and the CMOS sensor I in my
Canon<00:00:19.020> t1<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:20.449> very<00:00:21.449> very<00:00:22.230> very<00:00:22.650> low<00:00:22.980> light

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
Canon t1 I in very very very low light

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.599 
Canon t1 I in very very very low light
conditions<00:00:23.820> low<00:00:24.359> light<00:00:24.900> conditions<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:26.070> just

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
conditions low light conditions I just

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.300 
conditions low light conditions I just
did<00:00:26.820> two<00:00:27.060> quick<00:00:27.420> scenes<00:00:27.779> there<00:00:28.650> really<00:00:28.980> quick

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
did two quick scenes there really quick

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.250 
did two quick scenes there really quick
but<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.150> think<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.539> illustrates<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
but I think it illustrates the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.060 
but I think it illustrates the
difference<00:00:31.920> between<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.520> two<00:00:32.669> sensors<00:00:33.210> now

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
difference between the two sensors now

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.940 
difference between the two sensors now
admittedly<00:00:35.070> with<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.059> t1<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
admittedly with the t1 I I have the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.150 
admittedly with the t1 I I have the
ability<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.430> change<00:00:38.910> lenses<00:00:39.239> right<00:00:39.750> now<00:00:40.350> with

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
ability to change lenses right now with

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.970 
ability to change lenses right now with
these<00:00:41.309> videos<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:42.149> am<00:00:42.809> recording<00:00:43.469> them<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:43.829> my

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
these videos I am recording them with my

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.690 
these videos I am recording them with my
50<00:00:44.550> millimeter<00:00:47.180> Canon<00:00:48.180> F<00:00:48.450> 1.8<00:00:49.289> lens<00:00:49.590> I'm<00:00:50.430> not

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
50 millimeter Canon F 1.8 lens I'm not

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.619 
50 millimeter Canon F 1.8 lens I'm not
sure<00:00:50.940> if<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.149> has<00:00:51.629> more<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.260> do<00:00:52.500> with<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
sure if that has more to do with the the

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.889 
sure if that has more to do with the the
vast<00:00:54.629> reduction<00:00:55.500> or<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.550> vast<00:00:56.910> improvement

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
vast reduction or the vast improvement

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.560 
vast reduction or the vast improvement
in<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.320> low-light<00:00:58.710> conditions<00:00:59.340> or<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:00.420> it's

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
in the low-light conditions or if it's

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.950 
in the low-light conditions or if it's
the<00:01:00.719> sensor<00:01:01.079> itself<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.800> think<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:03.270> has<00:01:03.539> more<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the sensor itself I think it has more to

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.450 
the sensor itself I think it has more to
do<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> sensor<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.010> could<00:01:05.250> have

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
do with the sensor but it could have

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.460 
do with the sensor but it could have
something<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.119> with<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> lens<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.840> well<00:01:06.869> so

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
something to do with the lens as well so

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.740 
something to do with the lens as well so
let's<00:01:08.159> take<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> look<00:01:08.700> real<00:01:08.909> quick<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.540> see

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
let's take a look real quick and see

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.530 
let's take a look real quick and see
what<00:01:09.960> happens<00:01:10.530> all<00:01:10.619> right<00:01:10.799> guys<00:01:11.070> look<00:01:11.790> closely

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
what happens all right guys look closely

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.179 
what happens all right guys look closely
at<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.890> extreme<00:01:15.320> quality<00:01:16.320> difference

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
at the extreme quality difference

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.880 
at the extreme quality difference
between<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.909> 780<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:20.840> t1<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.530> Canon

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
between the 780 and the t1 I the Canon

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.539 
between the 780 and the t1 I the Canon
t1<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.390> in<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.689> image<00:01:25.110> quality<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> noise

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
t1 I in the image quality and the noise

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.410 
t1 I in the image quality and the noise
in<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.119> background<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> wall<00:01:28.909> amazing<00:01:29.909> ok

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
in the background on the wall amazing ok

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.880 
in the background on the wall amazing ok
here's<00:01:30.750> one<00:01:31.020> more<00:01:31.259> test<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> 780<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:33.890> see

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
here's one more test of the 780 is see

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.620 
here's one more test of the 780 is see
the<00:01:35.009> noise<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> background<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.329> just

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the noise in the background this is just

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.319 
the noise in the background this is just
my<00:01:36.780> main<00:01:37.079> computer<00:01:37.710> system<00:01:37.740> my<00:01:38.340> core<00:01:38.610> i7<00:01:39.180> 860

system so you can kind of see the image
quality<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:44.340> only<00:01:44.790> light<00:01:45.030> source<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:46.490> small

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
quality the only light source is a small

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.749 
quality the only light source is a small
desk<00:01:48.060> lamp<00:01:48.420> over<00:01:48.810> here<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> corner<00:01:49.759> the

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
rest of the room is completely dark so

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.170 
rest of the room is completely dark so
there's<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.000> image<00:01:55.159> pay<00:01:56.159> close<00:01:56.430> attention<00:01:56.640> to

there's the image pay close attention to

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.109 
there's the image pay close attention to
the<00:01:57.420> noise<00:01:58.189> because<00:01:59.189> that's<00:01:59.399> where<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> lot<00:02:00.090> of

the noise because that's where a lot of

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.380 
the noise because that's where a lot of
the<00:02:00.299> difference<00:02:00.689> lives<00:02:01.430> ok<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.700> here<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the difference lives ok and here is the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.609 
the difference lives ok and here is the
t1<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:05.420> under<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.570> exact<00:02:07.020> same<00:02:07.290> lighting

t1 I under the exact same lighting

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.210 
t1 I under the exact same lighting
conditions<00:02:08.780> quite<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.929> bit<00:02:10.259> better<00:02:10.530> image

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
conditions quite a bit better image

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.399 
conditions quite a bit better image

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
quality

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:20.229 
quality
not<00:02:14.010> nearly<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.790> noise<00:02:15.260> as<00:02:16.400> on<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.579> 780<00:02:18.090> and

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
not nearly the noise as on the 780 and

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.110 
not nearly the noise as on the 780 and
again<00:02:21.560> my<00:02:22.560> monitors<00:02:23.129> are<00:02:23.280> not<00:02:23.430> on<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.939> only

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
again my monitors are not on the only

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.850 
again my monitors are not on the only
light<00:02:24.450> source<00:02:24.950> is<00:02:26.180> this<00:02:27.180> small<00:02:27.750> desk<00:02:28.500> lamp

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
light source is this small desk lamp

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.530 
light source is this small desk lamp
here<00:02:30.379> so<00:02:32.420> there's<00:02:33.420> an<00:02:33.659> example<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:35.209> pay<00:02:36.209> close

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
here so there's an example and pay close

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.589 
here so there's an example and pay close
attention<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.379> noise<00:02:37.680> levels<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:38.640> it's

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
attention to the noise levels it's it's

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.500 
attention to the noise levels it's it's
a<00:02:39.750> striking<00:02:40.290> difference<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.209> don't<00:02:42.359> know<00:02:42.420> if

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
a striking difference so I don't know if

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.539 
a striking difference so I don't know if
this<00:02:42.629> has<00:02:42.840> more<00:02:43.079> to<00:02:43.140> do<00:02:43.379> with<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.709> lens<00:02:44.040> or<00:02:44.519> the

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
this has more to do with the lens or the

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.099 
this has more to do with the lens or the
actual<00:02:46.190> CMOS<00:02:47.190> sensor<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:48.599> that's<00:02:48.780> quite<00:02:48.989> a

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
actual CMOS sensor but that's quite a

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:55.240 
actual CMOS sensor but that's quite a
difference<00:02:51.500> okay<00:02:52.500> now<00:02:52.769> first<00:02:53.250> here<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.389> a

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
difference okay now first here is a

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.809 
difference okay now first here is a
wooden<00:02:56.250> carved<00:02:57.000> Mallard<00:02:57.569> in<00:02:58.519> very<00:02:59.519> low<00:02:59.790> light

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
wooden carved Mallard in very low light

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.819 
wooden carved Mallard in very low light
conditions<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.019> can<00:03:01.170> see<00:03:01.379> some<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.650> the

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
conditions and you can see some of the

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.300 
conditions and you can see some of the
noise<00:03:02.099> there<00:03:02.639> on<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.150> wall<00:03:03.389> and<00:03:03.959> it's<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.069> very

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
noise there on the wall and it's a very

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.170 
noise there on the wall and it's a very
noisy<00:03:05.639> image<00:03:06.329> trying<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:07.909> trying<00:03:08.909> to<00:03:09.000> gather

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
noisy image trying to trying to gather

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.710 
noisy image trying to trying to gather
this<00:03:09.480> light<00:03:09.750> there's<00:03:10.530> also<00:03:10.769> a<00:03:11.720> bronze

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
this light there's also a bronze

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.309 
this light there's also a bronze
pheasant<00:03:13.680> over<00:03:14.040> here<00:03:14.480> kind<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:15.540> see<00:03:15.750> how<00:03:16.079> well

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
pheasant over here kind of see how well

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.000 
pheasant over here kind of see how well
you<00:03:16.470> can<00:03:16.590> see<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:17.449> but<00:03:18.449> let's<00:03:18.870> take<00:03:19.109> a<00:03:19.139> look

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
you can see that but let's take a look

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.939 
you can see that but let's take a look
at<00:03:20.129> the<00:03:20.280> image<00:03:20.549> quality<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:21.389> t1i<00:03:22.290> real<00:03:22.590> quick

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
at the image quality of t1i real quick

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.159 
at the image quality of t1i real quick
under<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.519> same<00:03:23.790> conditions<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.720> see<00:03:24.900> if<00:03:24.989> we

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
under the same conditions and see if we

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:28.039 
under the same conditions and see if we
see<00:03:25.349> much<00:03:25.590> difference<00:03:26.150> all<00:03:27.150> right<00:03:27.389> here<00:03:27.870> is

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
see much difference all right here is

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.659 
see much difference all right here is
the<00:03:28.079> cannon<00:03:28.829> t1i

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:35.059 

as<00:03:32.669> you<00:03:32.970> can<00:03:33.150> see<00:03:33.389> that's<00:03:33.599> quite<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.709> big

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
as you can see that's quite a big

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.949 
as you can see that's quite a big
difference

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
difference

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.689 
difference
not<00:03:37.069> hardly<00:03:38.190> not<00:03:38.909> as<00:03:39.060> much<00:03:39.299> noise<00:03:39.949> in<00:03:40.949> the

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
not hardly not as much noise in the

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:46.449 
not hardly not as much noise in the
image<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:43.639> there's<00:03:44.639> an<00:03:44.879> example<00:03:45.540> of<00:03:45.780> the

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
image and there's an example of the

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.110 
image and there's an example of the
little<00:03:47.459> bronze<00:03:47.819> pheasant<00:03:49.549> see<00:03:50.549> that<00:03:50.760> quite<00:03:51.060> a

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
little bronze pheasant see that quite a

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.619 
little bronze pheasant see that quite a
bit<00:03:51.239> better<00:03:51.569> so<00:03:52.310> it<00:03:53.310> looks<00:03:53.519> to<00:03:53.669> be<00:03:53.699> like<00:03:54.000> quiet

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
bit better so it looks to be like quiet

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.580 
bit better so it looks to be like quiet
a<00:03:54.989> great<00:03:55.440> amount<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.459> difference<00:03:57.199> between<00:03:58.199> the

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
a great amount of difference between the

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.280 
a great amount of difference between the
quality<00:03:59.220> of<00:03:59.310> these<00:03:59.489> images<00:04:02.540> so<00:04:03.540> let's<00:04:03.930> take<00:04:04.260> a

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
quality of these images so let's take a

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.849 
quality of these images so let's take a
look<00:04:04.650> at<00:04:04.949> the<00:04:05.099> next<00:04:05.459> one<00:04:05.609> here<00:04:06.620> alright<00:04:07.620> guys

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
look at the next one here alright guys

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.879 
look at the next one here alright guys
so<00:04:08.129> that's<00:04:08.280> actually<00:04:08.549> it<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.510> just<00:04:10.440> wanted<00:04:10.739> to

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
so that's actually it I just wanted to

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:17.120 
so that's actually it I just wanted to
show<00:04:11.099> those<00:04:11.430> two<00:04:13.280> low-light<00:04:15.560> condition<00:04:16.560> shots

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
show those two low-light condition shots

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.870 
show those two low-light condition shots
at<00:04:18.030> one<00:04:18.449> subject<00:04:19.310> from<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.519> exact

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
at one subject from the exact

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.209 
at one subject from the exact
perspective<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:21.989> exact<00:04:22.409> lighting<00:04:23.010> and

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:23.219 
perspective and the exact lighting and

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:24.060 
perspective and the exact lighting and
as<00:04:23.849> you

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
as you

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.680 
as you
can<00:04:24.190> see<00:04:24.430> the<00:04:25.680> CMOS<00:04:26.680> sensor<00:04:27.280> in<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.810> DSLR

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
can see the CMOS sensor in the DSLR

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.010 
can see the CMOS sensor in the DSLR
kicks<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.410> living<00:04:32.770> crap<00:04:33.280> out<00:04:33.940> of<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.450> CCD

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
kicks to the living crap out of the CCD

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.480 
kicks to the living crap out of the CCD
sensor<00:04:35.440> now<00:04:36.220> given<00:04:36.850> it<00:04:37.240> you<00:04:37.570> know<00:04:38.280> that<00:04:39.280> there

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
sensor now given it you know that there

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.420 
sensor now given it you know that there
are<00:04:39.640> some<00:04:39.880> caveats<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.570> this<00:04:40.660> number<00:04:41.350> one<00:04:41.710> the

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
are some caveats to this number one the

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.250 
are some caveats to this number one the
lens<00:04:42.730> that<00:04:43.300> I<00:04:43.360> have<00:04:43.690> on<00:04:43.960> on<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.580> t1<00:04:45.580> I<00:04:46.140> you<00:04:47.140> know

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
lens that I have on on the t1 I you know

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.560 
lens that I have on on the t1 I you know
I<00:04:47.560> don't<00:04:48.280> know<00:04:48.340> it's<00:04:48.520> just<00:04:48.700> a<00:04:48.820> standard<00:04:49.180> 50

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
I don't know it's just a standard 50

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.970 
I don't know it's just a standard 50
millimeter<00:04:50.560> $90<00:04:51.250> lens<00:04:52.320> so<00:04:53.320> I<00:04:53.350> think<00:04:53.500> this<00:04:53.740> has

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
millimeter $90 lens so I think this has

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.060 
millimeter $90 lens so I think this has
more<00:04:54.010> to<00:04:54.280> do<00:04:54.520> with<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.790> sensor<00:04:55.330> so<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.410> CCD

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
more to do with the sensor so the CCD

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.980 
more to do with the sensor so the CCD
cameras<00:04:57.900> definitely<00:04:58.900> have<00:05:00.150> big<00:05:01.150> advantages

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
cameras definitely have big advantages

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.130 
cameras definitely have big advantages
in<00:05:02.260> video<00:05:02.680> right<00:05:03.010> now<00:05:03.120> over<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:04.150> CMOS<00:05:04.690> sensor

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
in video right now over the CMOS sensor

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:12.360 
in video right now over the CMOS sensor
but<00:05:05.890> low<00:05:06.340> light<00:05:06.730> indoor<00:05:08.910> movie<00:05:10.320> recording<00:05:11.320> I<00:05:11.950> I

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
but low light indoor movie recording I I

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.060 
but low light indoor movie recording I I
don't<00:05:12.730> believe<00:05:13.150> is<00:05:13.330> gonna<00:05:13.450> be<00:05:13.690> one<00:05:13.900> of<00:05:13.930> them<00:05:14.170> so

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
don't believe is gonna be one of them so

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.610 
don't believe is gonna be one of them so
that's<00:05:15.400> been<00:05:15.700> my<00:05:15.730> little<00:05:16.120> test<00:05:17.050> for<00:05:17.350> the<00:05:17.440> night

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
that's been my little test for the night

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.350 
that's been my little test for the night
and<00:05:18.480> I<00:05:19.480> hope<00:05:20.470> my<00:05:20.620> interested<00:05:21.070> some<00:05:21.310> of<00:05:21.520> you<00:05:21.700> is
