 Well, it did not mean that much 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.519
 project was born as we are 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.050
 come to want to create a ball 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.670
 philanthropic just do not leave these 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.610
 periods a little over a year ago 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.200
 happened is that there is a name to 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.720
 our colleagues someone who works 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.820
 with us in the ball committee that a 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.320
 crazy idea of a concept leader 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.149
 existed elsewhere in the country 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.380
 in toronto which is a market he 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.020
 knew very well because there is 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.970
 worked and bring his quÃ©bec and by 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.280
 after that there was some talk about me and also 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.319
 to other people and thread in 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.750
 the organizing committee was 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.460
 formed and then by dint of meetings as soon 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.440
 Sunday night and two meetings at 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.789
 other moms also we ended up 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.729
 realize all this since it's 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.020
 beautiful we have a little more than 320 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.780
 people who made their belongings this 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.880
 evening at 150 dollars a piece that's really 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.409
 all a success to erase surrender is 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.569
 just a first edition that goes 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.190
 support the cause of school crooners 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.790
 tell me proof had chosen this 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.920
 cause it was a process 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.000
 relatively complex because the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.440
 majority of the group 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.180
 we are where we are 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.510
 professionally because we 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.550
 had access to an education 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.710
 but the entourage who gives football that 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.550
 supported us teachers who 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.590
 encouraged us 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.630
 so we really soon by 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.840
 take off encourage youth and 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.840
 the school so we need 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.580
 decided to 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.500
 support the big schools because 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.690
 it's really a parent who is going 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.840
 can go to help in paying either 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.459
 linear standing brushes tutoring them 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.930
 rare studies also for children who 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.560
 have the talent to do so but not the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.379
 resources 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.450
 so it's really better to store it then 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.129
 I think people here tonight 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.140
 also felt concerned by the 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.700
 cause so we had the support the share of 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.349
 requests and the balloon a little bit of 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.150
 silk tonight a sharp decline to 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.590
 the hyperrion space an accomplice in time and 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.470
 always have the cocktail that were in 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.849
 course right now we have the casino of 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.440
 wind and so gaming tables that 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.810
 allows you to discover the wine while 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.239
 having fun a pretty interesting concept 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.630
 which is quite new in the market of 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.670
 quebec 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.500
 so we conducted his and for the rest the 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.599
 evening we have some surprises we have 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.209
 circus artists of the sun who are going 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.120
 short-term benefits and we have 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.940
 also one of the inventors of the ipod who 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.860
 will be our dj a very close collaborator 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.019
