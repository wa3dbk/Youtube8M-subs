all right so I'm gonna clear up some
points<00:00:07.649> that<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:07.830> made<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.340> couple<00:00:08.670> other

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
points that I made in a couple other

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.530 
points that I made in a couple other
videos<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:10.710> may<00:00:11.250> not<00:00:11.460> have<00:00:11.639> been<00:00:11.670> completely

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
videos that may not have been completely

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.980 
videos that may not have been completely
true<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:13.980> about<00:00:14.219> rendering<00:00:14.990> blender

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
true and this is about rendering blender

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.370 
true and this is about rendering blender
curves<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.529> yeah<00:00:16.740> free<00:00:17.359> well<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.750> first<00:00:19.020> part

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
curves in yeah free well the first part

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.460 
curves in yeah free well the first part
is<00:00:19.650> yes<00:00:20.279> blender<00:00:20.880> curves<00:00:21.150> do<00:00:21.689> render<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.289> yeah

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
is yes blender curves do render in yeah

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.550 
is yes blender curves do render in yeah
free<00:00:23.359> and<00:00:24.359> I'll<00:00:24.539> show<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.350> right<00:00:25.380> now

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
free and I'll show that to you right now

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.919 
free and I'll show that to you right now
so<00:00:26.070> i'll<00:00:26.430> create<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.330> circle<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:29.330> then<00:00:30.330> i'll

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
so i'll create a circle and then i'll

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.910 
so i'll create a circle and then i'll
create<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:32.239> bezier<00:00:33.239> curve<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.489> this<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:36.920> just

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
create a bezier curve and this is just

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.080 
create a bezier curve and this is just
going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.250> be<00:00:38.899> a<00:00:43.190> bevel<00:00:44.190> or<00:00:44.399> what<00:00:44.820> other

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
going to be a bevel or what other

00:00:45.090 --> 00:01:53.710 
going to be a bevel or what other
programs<00:00:45.690> might<00:00:45.960> call<00:00:46.230> aloft<00:00:47.329> so

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.880 

okay<00:01:54.500> so<00:01:54.560> I<00:01:54.710> have<00:01:54.920> my<00:01:55.190> curve<00:01:55.790> set<00:01:56.090> up<00:01:56.210> here<00:01:56.450> and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
okay so I have my curve set up here and

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.100 
okay so I have my curve set up here and
now<00:01:57.890> if<00:01:58.040> I<00:01:58.160> render<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:58.610> you<00:01:59.210> will<00:01:59.360> see<00:01:59.390> that<00:01:59.840> it

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
now if I render it you will see that it

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.520 
now if I render it you will see that it
actually<00:02:00.140> does<00:02:00.710> render<00:02:01.930> before<00:02:02.930> in<00:02:03.230> previous

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
actually does render before in previous

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.910 
actually does render before in previous
videos<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:04.340> had<00:02:04.520> said<00:02:04.760> that<00:02:04.790> it<00:02:05.090> doesn't<00:02:05.450> and

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
videos I had said that it doesn't and

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.400 
videos I had said that it doesn't and
that's<00:02:06.920> because<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:08.000> had<00:02:08.300> tried<00:02:08.899> rendering<00:02:09.320> a

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
that's because I had tried rendering a

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.650 
that's because I had tried rendering a
different<00:02:09.770> type<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:09.920> curve<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:11.330> didn't

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
different type of curve and it didn't

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.660 
different type of curve and it didn't
work<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.200> thought<00:02:12.440> that<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:13.190> was<00:02:13.400> true

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
work and I thought that that was true

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.630 
work and I thought that that was true
for<00:02:14.000> all<00:02:14.120> curves<00:02:14.450> however<00:02:15.020> i<00:02:15.320> will<00:02:16.100> now

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
for all curves however i will now

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.750 
for all curves however i will now
clarify<00:02:17.630> what<00:02:18.620> will<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.130> what<00:02:19.310> won't<00:02:19.430> render

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
clarify what will and what won't render

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.180 
clarify what will and what won't render
in<00:02:20.120> yo<00:02:20.390> free<00:02:20.630> as<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:21.590> can<00:02:21.740> see<00:02:21.950> um<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:24.190> beveled

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
in yo free as you can see um a beveled

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.560 
in yo free as you can see um a beveled
or<00:02:25.460> lofted<00:02:26.270> object<00:02:27.340> will<00:02:28.340> render<00:02:28.730> in<00:02:28.970> Khafre

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
or lofted object will render in Khafre

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:36.250 
or lofted object will render in Khafre
just<00:02:30.410> fine<00:02:33.100> however<00:02:34.100> if<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:34.459> was<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.910> not<00:02:35.810> loft

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
just fine however if I was to not loft

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.400 
just fine however if I was to not loft
this<00:02:36.620> pretend<00:02:37.520> I<00:02:37.640> want<00:02:37.910> myself<00:02:38.600> a<00:02:38.900> nice<00:02:39.850> column

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
this pretend I want myself a nice column

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.530 
this pretend I want myself a nice column
or<00:02:42.410> something

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.470 

if<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:49.030> do<00:02:50.030> this<00:02:50.299> and<00:02:50.599> then<00:02:51.110> try<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.530> render

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
if I do this and then try to render

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.160 
if I do this and then try to render
you'll<00:02:53.480> notice<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:54.109> don't<00:02:55.040> get<00:02:55.310> anything

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
you'll notice I don't get anything

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.940 
you'll notice I don't get anything
absolutely<00:02:57.170> nothing<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:59.319> don't<00:03:00.319> know<00:03:00.469> why<00:03:00.890> this

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
absolutely nothing I don't know why this

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.069 
absolutely nothing I don't know why this
is<00:03:01.250> but<00:03:01.730> it's<00:03:01.879> some<00:03:02.060> blender<00:03:02.540> II<00:03:02.569> offer<00:03:02.870> a

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
is but it's some blender II offer a

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.649 
is but it's some blender II offer a
communication<00:03:03.890> that's<00:03:04.519> not<00:03:04.819> working<00:03:05.090> because

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
communication that's not working because

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.300 
communication that's not working because
if<00:03:05.870> i<00:03:05.959> render<00:03:06.290> this<00:03:06.409> in<00:03:06.590> blender<00:03:06.950> you'll<00:03:07.129> see

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
if i render this in blender you'll see

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.339 
if i render this in blender you'll see
that<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:07.579> will<00:03:07.670> render<00:03:07.849> just<00:03:08.239> fine<00:03:08.480> and

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
that it will render just fine and

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.530 
that it will render just fine and
besides<00:03:10.099> the<00:03:10.220> fact<00:03:10.370> that<00:03:10.549> it's<00:03:10.670> black<00:03:11.269> and<00:03:11.450> you

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
besides the fact that it's black and you

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.849 
besides the fact that it's black and you
can't<00:03:11.750> see<00:03:11.900> anything<00:03:12.579> so<00:03:14.260> what<00:03:15.260> we<00:03:15.379> have<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.680> do

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
can't see anything so what we have to do

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.009 
can't see anything so what we have to do
is<00:03:15.889> we<00:03:16.310> have<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.579> figure<00:03:16.760> out<00:03:16.879> some<00:03:17.569> way<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.780> get

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
is we have to figure out some way to get

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.990 
is we have to figure out some way to get
this<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.409> render<00:03:18.769> well<00:03:19.189> if<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:19.549> play<00:03:19.760> around

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
this to render well if you play around

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.940 
this to render well if you play around
with<00:03:20.239> something<00:03:20.599> if<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:21.290> put<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:21.650> same

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
with something if you put that same

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:30.759 
with something if you put that same
curve<00:03:22.430> in<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:23.780> taper<00:03:24.400> place<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:30.470> know<00:03:30.560> you're

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
curve in the taper place you know you're

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.409 
curve in the taper place you know you're
wondering<00:03:30.950> is<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:31.549> is<00:03:31.700> it<00:03:32.000> going<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.239> work

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
wondering is it is it going to work

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:36.190 
wondering is it is it going to work
because<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:33.139> know<00:03:34.359> bevel<00:03:35.359> object<00:03:35.720> work<00:03:35.870> but

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
because you know bevel object work but

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.789 
because you know bevel object work but
just<00:03:36.409> having<00:03:36.769> a<00:03:36.799> thing<00:03:38.409> just<00:03:39.409> a<00:03:39.590> normal<00:03:40.569> cube

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
just having a thing just a normal cube

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.909 
just having a thing just a normal cube
my<00:03:42.799> cube<00:03:43.129> a<00:03:43.370> normal<00:03:44.239> extrude<00:03:44.720> didn't<00:03:45.049> work<00:03:45.230> so

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:45.919 
my cube a normal extrude didn't work so

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.289 
my cube a normal extrude didn't work so
you<00:03:46.010> put<00:03:46.189> in<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.430> taper<00:03:46.639> object<00:03:47.120> you'll

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
you put in the taper object you'll

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.360 
you put in the taper object you'll
notice<00:03:47.659> it<00:03:48.230> actually<00:03:49.030> works<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:50.389> it<00:03:50.780> actually

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
notice it actually works and it actually

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.589 
notice it actually works and it actually
will<00:03:52.370> render<00:03:52.760> something<00:03:53.239> that's<00:03:53.389> been

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
will render something that's been

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.439 
will render something that's been
tapered<00:03:54.019> so<00:03:54.650> now<00:03:54.829> we<00:03:54.889> know<00:03:55.159> that<00:03:55.310> a<00:03:55.790> taper<00:03:56.180> and

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
tapered so now we know that a taper and

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.949 
tapered so now we know that a taper and
a<00:03:56.510> bevel<00:03:56.840> work<00:03:57.430> so<00:03:58.430> if<00:03:58.819> we<00:03:58.879> just<00:03:59.449> want<00:03:59.659> this<00:03:59.810> to

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
a bevel work so if we just want this to

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.839 
a bevel work so if we just want this to
be<00:03:59.989> extruded<00:04:00.440> not<00:04:00.829> have<00:04:01.010> anything<00:04:01.340> done<00:04:01.639> to

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
be extruded not have anything done to

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.110 
be extruded not have anything done to
the<00:04:01.940> geometry<00:04:03.220> if<00:04:04.220> you<00:04:04.370> go<00:04:04.549> about<00:04:04.790> how<00:04:05.060> to

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
the geometry if you go about how to

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.059 
the geometry if you go about how to
think<00:04:05.419> about<00:04:05.599> that<00:04:07.209> you<00:04:08.209> might<00:04:08.389> come<00:04:08.419> up<00:04:08.840> with

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
think about that you might come up with

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.449 
think about that you might come up with
an<00:04:10.069> idea<00:04:10.280> like<00:04:10.549> I<00:04:11.030> did<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:12.620> that<00:04:12.739> is<00:04:12.919> to<00:04:13.129> simply

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
an idea like I did and that is to simply

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:22.220 
an idea like I did and that is to simply
have<00:04:13.639> an<00:04:14.000> empty<00:04:15.880> curve<00:04:17.169> limit<00:04:18.169> empty

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.750 

and<00:04:22.400> assign<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.610> either<00:04:24.000> bevel<00:04:24.660> or<00:04:24.840> extrude

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
and assign it to either bevel or extrude

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.740 
and assign it to either bevel or extrude
if<00:04:26.760> you<00:04:26.910> assign<00:04:27.150> it<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.360> bevel<00:04:29.750> you'll

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
if you assign it to bevel you'll

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.270 
if you assign it to bevel you'll
completely<00:04:31.620> ruin<00:04:32.810> your<00:04:33.810> extrude<00:04:34.560> so<00:04:34.890> just

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
completely ruin your extrude so just

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.060 
completely ruin your extrude so just
assign<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:35.730> to<00:04:35.760> taper<00:04:36.680> you'll<00:04:37.680> notice<00:04:38.040> that

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
assign it to taper you'll notice that

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.490 
assign it to taper you'll notice that
nothing<00:04:38.640> happens<00:04:39.030> because<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:39.510> is<00:04:39.870> empty<00:04:40.320> and

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
nothing happens because it is empty and

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.650 
nothing happens because it is empty and
then<00:04:41.400> render<00:04:41.880> it<00:04:42.000> and<00:04:43.250> magically<00:04:44.480> you<00:04:45.480> can

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
then render it and magically you can

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.130 
then render it and magically you can
finally<00:04:46.080> render<00:04:46.320> your<00:04:46.680> curves<00:04:47.070> in<00:04:47.900> yo<00:04:48.900> free

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
finally render your curves in yo free

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.400 
finally render your curves in yo free
without<00:04:50.060> having<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.210> convert<00:04:51.540> them<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.810> a<00:04:52.110> mesh

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
without having to convert them to a mesh

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.330 
without having to convert them to a mesh
which<00:04:52.950> is<00:04:53.330> will<00:04:54.330> save<00:04:54.600> you<00:04:54.780> time<00:04:55.170> editing<00:04:56.130> and

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
which is will save you time editing and

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:04.630 
which is will save you time editing and
it'll<00:04:57.180> also<00:04:59.630> it's<00:05:00.630> easier<00:05:01.970> and<00:05:02.970> it's<00:05:03.450> quick

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
it'll also it's easier and it's quick

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.040 
it'll also it's easier and it's quick
but<00:05:05.640> remember<00:05:06.000> you<00:05:06.270> do<00:05:06.390> have<00:05:06.420> to<00:05:06.720> sign<00:05:06.900> that

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
but remember you do have to sign that

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:14.750 
but remember you do have to sign that
empty<00:05:07.380> to<00:05:07.620> all<00:05:08.780> curves<00:05:09.780> that<00:05:10.080> are<00:05:10.320> not<00:05:13.760> lofted

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
empty to all curves that are not lofted

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.680 
empty to all curves that are not lofted
or<00:05:15.000> beveled<00:05:16.520> in<00:05:17.520> bevel<00:05:17.910> really<00:05:18.240> isn't<00:05:18.540> the

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
or beveled in bevel really isn't the

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.810 
or beveled in bevel really isn't the
right<00:05:18.840> word<00:05:19.140> but<00:05:19.530> that's<00:05:20.040> just<00:05:20.280> what<00:05:20.520> blender

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
right word but that's just what blender

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.850 
right word but that's just what blender
uses<00:05:21.470> anyway<00:05:22.470> that's<00:05:23.130> been<00:05:23.550> another<00:05:24.860> tutorial

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
uses anyway that's been another tutorial

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.250 
uses anyway that's been another tutorial
