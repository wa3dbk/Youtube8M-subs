00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:07.680
 [Music] 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.120
 hi hello cause so much to you but that 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.799
 they are very good, they are 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.200
 seeing with bare skin means that 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.969
 we will talk about a facial 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.830
 this time I want to share something 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.689
 that many of you may 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.029
 help because it has helped me you think 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.980
 ways and ways to dry those damn 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.810
 grains that do not taste right at the moment 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.320
 that we least want them to come out 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.060
 [Music] 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.760
 then stay there now 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.940
 we started and let's see what those are 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.220
 five ways to dry the beans well of 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.560
 Quick 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.590
 let's start it's very important to go in 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.480
 the main point of why not to use 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.490
 the grains good for countless things 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.340
 but let's go into one thing that is 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.010
 kill the bacteria that produces those 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.200
 granites so the number one is about 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.480
 about apple cider vinegar so the 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.340
 apple cider vinegar the nasty 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.080
 this is simply that the vinegar of 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.820
 apple for many of you may that 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.980
 come back very unpleasant but calm 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.930
 that that's only a little while then it 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.820
 it happens to you before telling you how 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.880
 apply apple cider vinegar 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.440
 tell them two little things the first one 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.600
 treatment is not suitable for people 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.760
 that are allergic to apple cider vinegar 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.420
 so if you're allergic to vinegar 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.950
 Apple 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.960
 this option number 1 I'm really sorry not 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.910
 It will serve you but if you are not allergic 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.259
 to apple cider vinegar , you're sure 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.840
 serve good what we are going to need 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.080
 for this treatment is a component 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.420
 of these or a cotton ball there is no 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.850
 problem let's introduce the vinegar 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.520
 in a plastic boat or what 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.080
 have if we are going to wet the cotton quoted 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.840
 the cotonete and we will apply it on 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.730
 the great very important this only what 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.560
 let's do at night we can not 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.150
 apply it day because the vinegar 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.520
 massage has an acid and can not 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.800
 produce spots so let's do 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.570
 that we are going to apply in the zone to lose 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.350
 a little bit is going to sting a bit is normal 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.940
 because the vinegar has an acid but it's 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.010
 tolerable or that is not torture 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.440
 and neither the good thing is that a day 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.480
 next you will have that dry grain 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.130
 number 2 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.500
 good the second way to dry it grain 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.240
 very easy and this we have already been leaving 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.430
 I think many of us but for 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.740
 who do not know is the toothpaste 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.230
 ok the toothpaste has a component 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.440
 it is very important that you disinfect and that 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.760
 it will also reduce the grain ok 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.430
 let's apply small amounts 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.410
 about the affected grain we leave it 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.290
 throughout the night and the next day 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.720
 we have that grain has dried well 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.600
 that this is option number 2 also 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.640
 a night treatment 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.370
 13 good production number 3 them 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.900
 I recommend tea tree oil is 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.489
 very important that it be tea tree 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.319
 the tea tree oil has 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.409
 a lot of components and it's going to help you 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.349
 very much believe me so soon 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.879
 also videos with tree oil 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.959
 tea everything we can do with it in 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.939
 this occasion will help us to bring 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.189
 the big ones in the same way 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:04.280
 let's grab a cotton ball a 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:06.799
 We are going to wet cork ok to apply 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.900
 about grain tea tree oil 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.970
 we're going to take half the time it's going to reduce inflammation and 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.620
 will help us to dry the grain 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.200
 ok you can get this in drugstore 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.500
 pharmacies and supermarkets where they sell 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.810
 jon natural products number 4 is the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.810
 lemon if it is or not quoted we will not apply 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.760
 the lemon droplet in the affected area 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.980
 it is very important that before all the 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.590
 treatments that I have recommended 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.139
 the skin cleans completely ok and by 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.519
 last we apply these treatments well 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.109
 that the lemon will be applied in the 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.639
 affected area we let it dry 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.560
 always remembering that we want to apply 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.939
 those at night and the next day also 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.150
 we will have the great display dry grain 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:45.319
 and finally option number five is the 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.530
 lavender oil 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.060
 the oil or even the tonic 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.680
 lavender or you can also get the 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.650
 flower 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.349
 Roger you see and you apply it in the area 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.969
 affected and this is going to help us that the 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.329
 grain is disinfected and deflated and 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:02.409
 also dry well said 5 o'clock 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.060
 not to dry the grains that you 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.469
 also recommended that all these 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.870
 treatments we can only do 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:10.030
 at night and not during the day or very 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.620
 important that when the sun goes away 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.000
 it's good we can do these 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.829
 treatments all these ingredients 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.930
 you can get them in supermarkets 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.120
 pharmacies drugstores places where 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.739
 sell natural things in those places 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.139
