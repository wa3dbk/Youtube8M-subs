all<00:00:51.000> throughout<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.719> whole<00:00:51.930> gun<00:00:52.140> as<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.469> a

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
all throughout the whole gun as like a

all throughout the whole gun as like a
camo<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.460> think<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.820> looks<00:00:53.850> absolutely

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180

camo and I think it looks absolutely
incredible<00:00:54.600> now<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.590> setup<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.160> guys<00:00:56.309> can

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
incredible now the setup is you guys can

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.920 
incredible now the setup is you guys can
see<00:00:56.550> since<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> beginning<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.539> video<00:00:57.629> on

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
see since the beginning of the video on

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.779 
see since the beginning of the video on
my<00:00:57.960> screen<00:00:58.469> I'm<00:00:58.649> using<00:00:58.859> lightweight<00:00:59.190> low

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
my screen I'm using lightweight low

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.790 
my screen I'm using lightweight low
profile<00:01:00.329> peripherals<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.620> kind<00:01:01.770> of

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
profile peripherals that you can kind of

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.619 
profile peripherals that you can kind of
switch<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.250> whatever<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.609> want<00:01:02.820> blast

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
switch up for whatever you want blast

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.539 
switch up for whatever you want blast
suppressor<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.199> toughness<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.799> then<00:01:05.250> as<00:01:05.369> my

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
suppressor and toughness and then as my

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.280 
suppressor and toughness and then as my
attachments<00:01:06.150> which<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.720> kind<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.990> think<00:01:07.110> are

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
attachments which I kind of think are

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.600 
attachments which I kind of think are
the<00:01:07.350> most<00:01:07.380> important<00:01:07.920> sometimes<00:01:08.130> maybe<00:01:08.520> if

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
the most important sometimes maybe if

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.859 
the most important sometimes maybe if
you<00:01:08.670> want<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> switch<00:01:09.030> out<00:01:09.150> low<00:01:09.299> profile<00:01:09.750> and

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
you want to switch out low profile and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.810 
you want to switch out low profile and
take<00:01:10.020> off<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> perk<00:01:10.500> 1<00:01:10.680> greed<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.580> put<00:01:11.729> on

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
take off the perk 1 greed you can put on

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.670 
take off the perk 1 greed you can put on
for<00:01:12.090> grip<00:01:12.270> stock<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.869> maybe<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.110> red<00:01:13.320> dot<00:01:13.500> or

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
for grip stock and maybe a red dot or

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.710 
for grip stock and maybe a red dot or
for<00:01:13.920> grip<00:01:14.070> stock<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.520> quick<00:01:14.790> draw<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
for grip stock and quick draw the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.179 
for grip stock and quick draw the
quick-draw<00:01:16.259> grip<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.590> think<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.890> gives<00:01:17.009> it

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
quick-draw grip I think that gives it

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.859 
quick-draw grip I think that gives it
really<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> really<00:01:18.060> really<00:01:18.180> big<00:01:18.390> advantage<00:01:18.780> but

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
really a really really big advantage but

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.210 
really a really really big advantage but
you<00:01:18.990> definitely<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.409> need<00:01:19.560> at<00:01:19.710> least<00:01:19.740> four

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
you definitely do need at least four

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.770 
you definitely do need at least four
grip<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.549> stock<00:01:20.820> because<00:01:21.000> for<00:01:21.360> grip<00:01:21.509> load<00:01:21.659> is

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
grip in stock because for grip load is

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.840 
grip in stock because for grip load is
to<00:01:21.869> recall<00:01:22.170> by<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> lot<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.770> stock<00:01:23.310> makes<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:23.670> you

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
to recall by a lot in stock makes as you

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.160 
to recall by a lot in stock makes as you
can<00:01:24.000> 80s<00:01:24.299> or<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.509> corners<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.869> then<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.049> have

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
can 80s or on corners and then we have

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.649 
can 80s or on corners and then we have
UAV<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:25.979> warbird<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:26.970> my<00:01:27.090> killstreaks<00:01:27.330> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
UAV and warbird is my killstreaks and

the gun and how I think it's actually
one<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> better<00:01:56.189> guns<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.909> advanced

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
one of the better guns in advanced

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.510 
one of the better guns in advanced
warfare<00:01:57.780> now<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.649> beginning<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.189> advanced

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
warfare now in the beginning of advanced

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.550 
warfare now in the beginning of advanced
for<00:01:59.759> for<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.000> guys<00:02:00.180> saw<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.750> many<00:02:00.899> e.m<00:02:01.320> ones

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
for for you guys saw so many e.m ones

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.010 
for for you guys saw so many e.m ones
being<00:02:01.829> used<00:02:02.100> specifically<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.119> xbox<00:02:03.509> 360

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
being used specifically on the xbox 360

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.840 
being used specifically on the xbox 360
advanced<00:02:04.439> warfare<00:02:04.770> version<00:02:05.159> because<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.759> was

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
advanced warfare version because it was

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.880 
advanced warfare version because it was
so<00:02:06.180> overpowered<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.990> 360<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.530> think<00:02:07.799> they

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
so overpowered on the 360 I think they

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.529 
so overpowered on the 360 I think they
actually<00:02:07.920> nerfed<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.819> 360<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.450> they

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
actually nerfed is on the 360 and they

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.300 
actually nerfed is on the 360 and they
buffed<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.929> on<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.140> Xbox<00:02:10.530> one<00:02:10.739> I'm<00:02:10.860> not<00:02:11.009> really

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
buffed it on the Xbox one I'm not really

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.880 
buffed it on the Xbox one I'm not really
quite<00:02:11.640> sure<00:02:11.940> why<00:02:12.569> it's<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:12.900> different<00:02:13.170> across

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
quite sure why it's so different across

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.110 
quite sure why it's so different across
alsons<00:02:14.190> i<00:02:14.250> don't<00:02:14.430> i<00:02:14.490> don't<00:02:14.700> think<00:02:15.000> it's

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
alsons i don't i don't think it's

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.850 
alsons i don't i don't think it's
actually<00:02:15.240> very<00:02:15.420> different<00:02:15.870> now<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.680> i<00:02:16.710> do

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
actually very different now so i do

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.830 
actually very different now so i do
think<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.850> guys<00:02:18.030> have<00:02:18.209> probably<00:02:18.390> seen<00:02:18.780> a

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
think that you guys have probably seen a

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.480 
think that you guys have probably seen a
lot<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.319> m1<00:02:19.560> but<00:02:19.920> haven't<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.430> past

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
think actually looks pretty cool you

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.970 
think actually looks pretty cool you
know<00:02:33.450> instead<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.260> typical<00:02:34.590> green<00:02:34.800> laser

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
know instead and the typical green laser

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.860 
know instead and the typical green laser
you<00:02:35.160> do<00:02:35.280> have<00:02:35.400> on<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.580> em1<00:02:35.820> on<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.090> poner<00:02:36.420> elite

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
you do have on the em1 on a poner elite

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.240 
you do have on the em1 on a poner elite
you<00:02:37.230> actually<00:02:37.530> do<00:02:37.620> get<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.860> purple<00:02:38.130> or<00:02:38.220> pink

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
you actually do get the purple or pink

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.920 
you actually do get the purple or pink
blazer<00:02:38.550> would<00:02:38.790> freely<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.390> looks<00:02:39.600> pretty<00:02:39.810> cool

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
blazer would freely it looks pretty cool

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.110 
blazer would freely it looks pretty cool
I<00:02:40.020> could<00:02:40.470> definitely<00:02:40.709> dig<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.100> so<00:02:41.310> i<00:02:41.520> think<00:02:41.790> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
I could definitely dig it so i think the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.180 
I could definitely dig it so i think the
stats<00:02:42.390> on<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.690> gun<00:02:42.870> are<00:02:43.040> extremely<00:02:44.040> powerful

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.650 
stats on this gun are extremely powerful
i<00:02:44.489> don't<00:02:44.670> think<00:02:44.819> we've<00:02:44.910> ever<00:02:45.030> actually<00:02:45.270> seen

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
i don't think we've ever actually seen

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.960 
i don't think we've ever actually seen
like<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> laser<00:02:46.800> type<00:02:47.070> gun<00:02:47.340> with<00:02:47.459> such<00:02:47.670> powerful

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
like a laser type gun with such powerful

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.550 
like a laser type gun with such powerful
stats<00:02:48.330> especially<00:02:48.810> an<00:02:48.870> assault<00:02:49.170> rifle<00:02:49.200> like

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
stats especially an assault rifle like

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
plus 2 damage on that is very very

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.720 
plus 2 damage on that is very very

dominating and having plus 1 mobility is

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.699 
dominating and having plus 1 mobility is
another<00:03:09.300> very<00:03:09.570> very<00:03:09.840> dominant<00:03:10.260> attribute

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
another very very dominant attribute

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:11.750 
another very very dominant attribute
towards<00:03:11.070> it<00:03:11.160> because<00:03:11.250> you're<00:03:11.459> going<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.670> be

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
towards it because you're going to be

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.710

able to bring up your sights a little
bit<00:03:13.019> faster<00:03:13.170> than<00:03:13.530> usual<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:14.430> when<00:03:14.610> having<00:03:14.850> all

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
bit faster than usual so when having all

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.430 
bit faster than usual so when having all
these<00:03:15.060> attributes<00:03:15.300> while<00:03:15.840> having<00:03:16.080> plus<00:03:16.290> 2

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
these attributes while having plus 2

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.840 
these attributes while having plus 2
damage<00:03:16.620> whenever<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.130> know<00:03:17.220> attachments<00:03:17.820> you

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
damage whenever you know attachments you

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.460 
damage whenever you know attachments you
want<00:03:18.090> like<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.450> foregrip<00:03:18.840> in<00:03:18.989> stock<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.440> i

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
want like the foregrip in stock that i

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.199 
want like the foregrip in stock that i
recommend<00:03:19.769> maybe<00:03:20.130> even<00:03:20.340> quick-draw<00:03:20.790> grip<00:03:21.000> if

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
recommend maybe even quick-draw grip if

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.520 
recommend maybe even quick-draw grip if
you<00:03:21.510> guys<00:03:21.630> really<00:03:21.840> want<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.140> try<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.500> out

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
you guys really want to try that out

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.170 
you guys really want to try that out
which<00:03:22.829> i<00:03:22.950> do<00:03:23.160> suggest<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.700> does<00:03:23.820> make<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:23.970> big

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
which i do suggest it does make a big

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.130 
which i do suggest it does make a big
difference<00:03:24.209> i'm<00:03:24.600> not<00:03:24.720> using<00:03:24.900> in<00:03:25.079> this

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
difference i'm not using in this

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.810 
difference i'm not using in this
gameplay<00:03:25.380> but<00:03:25.620> i<00:03:25.950> would<00:03:26.340> definitely<00:03:26.610> suggest

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
gameplay but i would definitely suggest

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.030 
gameplay but i would definitely suggest
it<00:03:27.209> so<00:03:27.390> i<00:03:27.600> do<00:03:28.049> think<00:03:28.410> that<00:03:28.470> having<00:03:28.709> all<00:03:28.920> these

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
it so i do think that having all these

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.710 
it so i do think that having all these
attributes<00:03:29.250> when<00:03:29.730> update<00:03:30.150> updating<00:03:30.630> the

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
attributes when update updating the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.780 
attributes when update updating the
stats<00:03:30.989> with<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.290> new<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.829> em1<00:03:32.070> poner<00:03:32.430> on<00:03:32.670> the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
stats with the new the em1 poner on the

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.400 
stats with the new the em1 poner on the
version<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.239> em1<00:03:33.450> makes<00:03:34.079> it<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.290> very

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
version of the em1 makes it a very

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.319 
version of the em1 makes it a very
dominant<00:03:34.799> gun<00:03:35.130> if<00:03:35.310> not<00:03:35.549> one<00:03:35.730> of<00:03:35.760> my<00:03:35.880> top<00:03:36.090> like

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
dominant gun if not one of my top like

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.350 
dominant gun if not one of my top like
78<00:03:37.110> maybe<00:03:37.470> maybe<00:03:37.860> six<00:03:38.160> or<00:03:38.250> seven<00:03:38.610> top<00:03:39.060> favorite

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
78 maybe maybe six or seven top favorite

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.000 
78 maybe maybe six or seven top favorite
assault<00:03:39.600> rifles<00:03:39.900> in<00:03:39.989> advanced<00:03:40.350> warfare<00:03:40.709> so

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.640 
loves a someone ever be hates the em1
poner<00:03:51.180> it's<00:03:51.480> actually<00:03:51.810> really<00:03:52.200> good<00:03:52.320> in<00:03:52.560> my

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
poner it's actually really good in my

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.199 
poner it's actually really good in my
opinion<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:53.040> like<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.549> lot<00:03:53.579> because<00:03:53.910> you<00:03:54.120> know

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
opinion I like it a lot because you know

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.370 
opinion I like it a lot because you know
the<00:03:54.329> ammo<00:03:54.600> is<00:03:54.660> another<00:03:54.900> big<00:03:55.079> thing<00:03:55.110> because

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
the ammo is another big thing because

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.140 
the ammo is another big thing because
you<00:03:55.560> don't<00:03:55.739> have<00:03:55.829> to<00:03:55.920> use<00:03:56.040> scavenger<00:03:56.549> on<00:03:56.670> it<00:03:56.790> so

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
you don't have to use scavenger on it so

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.490 
you don't have to use scavenger on it so
you<00:03:57.239> can<00:03:57.360> actually<00:03:57.480> get<00:03:57.720> an<00:03:57.840> extra<00:03:58.140> perk<00:03:58.320> like

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
you can actually get an extra perk like

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.289 
you can actually get an extra perk like
i<00:03:58.590> did<00:03:58.769> in<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:58.890> on<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.519> set<00:03:59.700> up<00:03:59.820> a<00:03:59.940> little<00:04:00.180> bit

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
i did in the on the set up a little bit

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.640 
i did in the on the set up a little bit
ago<00:04:00.510> I<00:04:00.540> put<00:04:00.840> toughness<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:01.320> blast<00:04:01.530> suppressor

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
ago I put toughness and blast suppressor

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.199 
ago I put toughness and blast suppressor
which<00:04:02.040> normally<00:04:02.370> just<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.670> toughest<00:04:03.030> and

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
which normally just the toughest and

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.330 
which normally just the toughest and
toughness<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:03.750> scavenger<00:04:04.290> so<00:04:04.769> I<00:04:04.799> think<00:04:05.220> this

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
toughness and scavenger so I think this

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.100 
toughness and scavenger so I think this
does<00:04:05.579> add<00:04:05.820> another<00:04:06.090> advantage<00:04:06.570> just<00:04:06.840> by<00:04:06.959> using

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
does add another advantage just by using
