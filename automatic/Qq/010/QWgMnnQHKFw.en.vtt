00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:09.907
 - How was it supposed to end - 

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:22.032
 -How Spider-Man 3 was supposed to end- 

00:00:50.332 --> 00:00:52.878
 Hello, this is me, Peter Parker. 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:55.271
 My favorite neighborhood ... you know. 

00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:57.639
 I've come a long way since I was stung by a spider. 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.934
 Before that, nothing went well for me. 

00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:02.276
 Now, people really love me. 

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:05.013
 I keep the city, I'm the best in class, 

00:01:05.235 --> 00:01:07.075
 I'm even in love with my dream girl. 

00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:10.089
 Spider-Man, please stop telling it. 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:14.371
 what? - You're a number, it's not so necessary. 

00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:18.585
 Not needed? But how would people know who I was all this time? 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.342
 Spider-Man, we're not idiots. 

00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:23.758
 Just do your job. 

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:27.599
 Or ... so fine ... 

00:01:30.453 --> 00:01:33.727
 But what if I tell the audience ...? - Do not tell anything! 

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:38.124
 I'll offer Mother Jay a marriage. 

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:42.156
 It reminds me of a long boring story about your uncle 

00:01:42.157 --> 00:01:46.443
 That will only make you feel guilty and make the wrong decision in life. 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.246
 There is a change in the mass of the silicon 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.565
 Yeah, it must be just a bird ... 

00:01:57.374 --> 00:02:01.328
 Here's a good idea, maybe make sure it's a bird before you do something mutation, 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.744
 Just because you're too lazy to safely carry out this nightly experiment of the sand mutation. 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.363
 OK... 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.323
 There's a big bird here. 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.706
 It pretty much looks like a guy. 

00:02:12.782 --> 00:02:14.270
 It's a guy down there. 

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:17.970
 You do not understand, I have a child ... 

00:02:18.198 --> 00:02:19.302
 She's sick. 

00:02:19.904 --> 00:02:23.020
 It would make it all right to break the law. 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:25.458
 I'm not a bad man. 

00:02:29.094 --> 00:02:30.698
 Oh no ... it's Gwen. 

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:32.712
 what? What is she doing up there? 

00:02:33.056 --> 00:02:36.426
 She tries not to fall to her death, idiots. 

00:02:36.526 --> 00:02:38.087
 Why do not you see some worry ?! 

00:02:38.954 --> 00:02:42.358
 Why are fathers so irrational in this film? 

00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:47.535
 What is Um ... but I love or ... 

00:02:47.536 --> 00:02:49.778
 You and me ... and the ring ... 

00:02:50.715 --> 00:02:52.479
 I'm Spider-Man! 

00:02:53.096 --> 00:02:54.952
 Because you cry too much, okay? 

00:02:56.964 --> 00:02:58.400
 I did not even want you. 

00:02:59.943 --> 00:03:01.271
 You can not do ... 

00:03:08.523 --> 00:03:09.571
 Because I'm Batman! 

00:03:09.901 --> 00:03:11.340
 Dude, that 's cool. 

00:03:17.052 --> 00:03:18.806
 What the hell was that? 

00:03:19.462 --> 00:03:23.417
 Peter Parker was just making an extravagant walk of the music craze outside the window. 

00:03:23.574 --> 00:03:25.942
 I know, but ... why? 

00:03:26.255 --> 00:03:27.383
 I'm not sure. 

00:03:27.703 --> 00:03:29.511
 But I was afraid something like that would happen. 

00:03:30.054 --> 00:03:30.910
 What do you mean? 

00:03:32.118 --> 00:03:33.101
 did you see it? 

00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:43.271
 The night your father died, 

00:03:43.624 --> 00:03:45.814
 I cleaned his wound. 

00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:51.039
 The blade that pierced his body came from his surfboard. 

00:03:51.506 --> 00:03:55.875
 But there's no doubt, your father killed himself. 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:57.243
 You're so fired. 

00:03:58.244 --> 00:03:59.032
 what? 

00:03:59.143 --> 00:04:03.263
 Did you know that all the time and now you tell me? 

00:04:03.448 --> 00:04:06.396
 I thought it was the perfect time to tell you the truth. 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.472
 I got a grenade in my face, man! 

00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:14.627
 Hey Parker. 

00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:20.915
 Eddie, wait, why do you have Venom's scary face? You'll just get the mask back when you fight. 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.270
 Because that's how I get more screen time. 

00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:24.974
 It's shabby ... 

00:04:25.087 --> 00:04:27.895
 You miserable! And I'll kill your girlfriend. 

00:04:28.098 --> 00:04:29.705
 Here's a big surprise. 

00:04:30.251 --> 00:04:33.636
 Of all the things you can choose you want to threaten my company. 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:36.337
 Just like any other villain I've dealt with. 

00:04:36.438 --> 00:04:37.860
 Hey, if it's not broken, do not fix. 

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:41.187
 seriously? Do you think you can beat me? 

00:04:41.518 --> 00:04:44.804
 This is my third film. Spider - Man 3, Friend. 

00:04:45.102 --> 00:04:46.495
 Do you think you'll just kill me ?! 

00:04:46.823 --> 00:04:47.567
 No. 

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:51.496
 Look, do you know any movie that kills the main character at the end? 

00:04:52.124 --> 00:04:53.387
 Donny Drago. 

00:04:57.097 --> 00:04:58.052
 Romeo and Juliet. 

00:04:58.127 --> 00:04:59.765
 Yes, I do not think so. 

00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:03.876
 Hang on to Pete, I'm coming to an old friend and fond of an old friend. 

00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:07.387
 I'm just saying, there's only one way it will end. 

00:05:07.827 --> 00:05:09.051
 It always happens. 

00:05:09.632 --> 00:05:15.544
 Fight a little, tear my mask, but in the end I'll do something that will make you kill yourself. 

00:05:15.886 --> 00:05:18.965
 Or maybe I'll kill you and your girlfriend because I'm cool and you're not. 

00:05:19.472 --> 00:05:22.991
 Fly a beautiful bird, no mutant sandcasts for you tonight. 

00:05:23.202 --> 00:05:26.313
 I can not wait to help my best friend in the world. 

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:29.758
 I assure you, these things have already happened! 

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:31.752
 You still have a chance to escape. 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.288
 Here I come Pete, I'll help you save the day. 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:38.034
 No matter what, I'll help you ... 

00:05:39.926 --> 00:05:41.743
 We talk like you're in control, Parker. 

00:05:42.192 --> 00:05:42.999
 You're just an insect, trapped on my network. 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.359
 Okay, he told the truth. 

00:05:51.742 --> 00:05:54.270
 Yes, it always happens. 

00:05:55.284 --> 00:05:57.079
 You punched me in the face first! 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.614
 -The end- 

00:06:31.381 --> 00:06:34.502
 Remove your eye from the ball. 

00:06:38.496 --> 00:06:39.895
 Get me up! 

00:06:40.954 --> 00:06:42.168
 .
