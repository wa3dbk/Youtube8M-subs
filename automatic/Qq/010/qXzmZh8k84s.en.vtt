platform has got more in common with the

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:49.290 
platform has got more in common with the
Aria<00:04:47.800> than<00:04:48.099> the<00:04:48.249> old<00:04:48.400> Safari<00:04:48.580> so<00:04:48.969> there's<00:04:49.150> an

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
Aria than the old Safari so there's an

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.909 
Aria than the old Safari so there's an
improvement<00:04:49.629> on<00:04:49.840> that<00:04:50.020> it<00:04:50.229> will<00:04:50.259> write<00:04:50.650> and

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
improvement on that it will write and

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.499 
improvement on that it will write and
handle<00:04:51.279> better<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.999> engine<00:04:52.360> has<00:04:52.479> been

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
handle better the engine has been

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:53.790 
handle better the engine has been
tweaked<00:04:52.930> to<00:04:53.020> offer<00:04:53.229> slightly<00:04:53.680> better

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
tweaked to offer slightly better

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.309 
tweaked to offer slightly better
performance<00:04:54.400> but<00:04:54.909> this<00:04:55.479> is<00:04:55.840> a<00:04:55.870> bit

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319 
performance but this is a bit
