00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.799
 so hi everybody is he 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.450
 that none so today I'm going to you 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.799
 show 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.240
 we can find the glyph ponies on 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:15.630
 each island of one piece unlimited allred 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.279
 so this is this video is for 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.890
 especially to playstation players so 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.609
 three avoided because there is a trophy 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.960
 that can be obtained by deciphering 30 x 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.740
 filed glee knowing that we can read 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.300
 than one by one a day so normally 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.160
 between three and four days it's over 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.610
 it depends if you start barely 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.960
 you had to start over that normally 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.730
 this four day taste that it's over 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.920
 before maybe a little less it depends 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.980
 so here I'm going to barely show you 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.450
 casar so the 1st of april 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.149
 hoping not to make me a poison born 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.170
 to the clock 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.699
 this is good we know where he is so 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.920
 subject what is practical is that it 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.570
 is next to the plant one you can 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.309
 see it here 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.739
 then you can see the theme me 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.070
 so in Paris it's more like land side of 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.460
 ice cream month you can it's more 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.909
 quick 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.140
 you are already the place to go 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.970
 going there taken with robin you to encrypt 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.850
 its end just pressed on when that you 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.590
 will propose good so that's where they get 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.979
 find at the low table koned glyphs 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.229
 So the second city of the game we are going there it 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.790
 is a month so it takes rather 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.090
 appear here and there in puddles of blood 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.610
 doha to go through there after you 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.110
 head to the plant here and before 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.020
 you will see there you can turn right there 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.299
 there is the head of the ofii and you will see 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.299
 the church tale that is right there 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.000
 so that's where the third is 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.630
 glyph bridge on so on the deadlines 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.579
 this lobby you can see here 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.049
 so here it is here so I'm going to you 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.869
 show now on the small map where 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.310
 so it's wrong to show up on the end 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.220
 yes on the main door you 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.979
 appear and after you continue 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.570
 always straight up wait for the 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.220
 step by step 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.110
 finally the small rectangular territory 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:17.110
 watch the cabba here for the third 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.220
 degree so then for the 4th bridge of 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.920
 glyphs that is on the Isle of Men 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.870
 fish that's where he is 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.040
 so I'm going to show you his little map 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.349
 so here except that of course fake one can 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.989
 not cut directly by the misstep 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:36.220
 it's not going around that way like that 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.739
 get here and then be there 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.099
 so it's very long 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.840
 they cut the fast lane so for 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.049
 the 5th kone glyphs who and oriane of 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.269
 drum here it is so that I lie in his 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.040
 little map so that once where 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.609
 appeared rather clever 0 size you 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.459
 until then, the costs incurred by 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:02.140
 mr to continue until then and here I am 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:04.060
 and not very hard to see so here's where 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.040
 find the sixth policy at once 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.650
 that I take the controller so I 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.810
 shows you here on the small mark 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.459
 so he is there at the end so appeared 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.859
 rather the upper court which here we go 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.709
 you just will not have it all just his 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:21.400
 crossing to reach the here for 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.430
 to have the sixth kone slips so here 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.420
 where is the seventh pony glyphs 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.310
 so at mont corvo so watch the 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.880
 static mac so appeared rather 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:38.859
 by where could go go up 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.750
 here it's for the 7th for the glyphs or 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:45.130
 seventh and before the last point 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.440
 glyphs so that's where is the 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.850
 last glyph hat from marineford good 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.230
 you can see it here so it's a 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.530
 very small place quite complicated 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.990
 wait you can see the ice map 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.850
 right here 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.890
 trouble girl so in Paris it's rather 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.740
 instead maurice so it's below 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.620
 couty tysiak by that you take this 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:08.120
 way there and you go up and here is a 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.560
 little corner of there you can see him again 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.970
 here and I ask myself because she is 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.310
 pacifist otherwise I'd broken me
