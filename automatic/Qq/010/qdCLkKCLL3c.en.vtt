doctors in for this one and then a third

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.030 
doctors in for this one and then a third
noob<00:06:19.300> thrown<00:06:19.780> in<00:06:19.960> I<00:06:20.170> think<00:06:20.500> this<00:06:20.590> story<00:06:20.860> will

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
noob thrown in I think this story will

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.560 
noob thrown in I think this story will
be<00:06:21.070> a<00:06:21.160> lot<00:06:21.370> closer<00:06:21.550> to<00:06:21.790> the<00:06:21.910> three<00:06:22.150> doctors

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
be a lot closer to the three doctors

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.120 
be a lot closer to the three doctors
than<00:06:22.690> anything<00:06:23.050> else<00:06:23.230> I<00:06:23.470> think<00:06:23.650> the<00:06:23.740> cast<00:06:23.950> is

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
than anything else I think the cast is

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.620 
than anything else I think the cast is
minimal<00:06:24.490> enough<00:06:24.730> that<00:06:24.880> we<00:06:24.970> can<00:06:25.060> still<00:06:25.240> get<00:06:25.450> a

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
minimal enough that we can still get a

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.690 
minimal enough that we can still get a
really<00:06:26.140> good<00:06:26.170> story<00:06:26.620> in<00:06:26.950> there<00:06:27.190> while<00:06:27.430> still

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
really good story in there while still

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.760 
really good story in there while still
having<00:06:27.820> the<00:06:28.060> lanky<00:06:28.390> moments<00:06:28.810> of<00:06:28.930> the<00:06:29.380> doctor

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
having the lanky moments of the doctor

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.860 
having the lanky moments of the doctor
talking<00:06:30.160> about<00:06:30.430> the<00:06:30.580> TARDIS<00:06:31.120> vesicle<00:06:31.600> theme

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.320 
awesome thing to happen I think keeping

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.629 
awesome thing to happen I think keeping
the<00:07:05.500> number<00:07:05.680> of<00:07:05.770> doctors<00:07:05.919> minimal<00:07:06.400> is<00:07:06.520> the

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 
the number of doctors minimal is the

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.940 
the number of doctors minimal is the
best<00:07:06.850> way<00:07:07.090> to<00:07:07.150> pay<00:07:07.810> a<00:07:07.840> proper<00:07:08.260> homage<00:07:08.470> to<00:07:08.620> the

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:08.950 
best way to pay a proper homage to the

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.830 
best way to pay a proper homage to the
original<00:07:09.040> series<00:07:09.790> and<00:07:10.030> the<00:07:10.360> wonder<00:07:10.630> of<00:07:10.660> the
