pretty weird the units and buildings are

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:13.999 
pretty weird the units and buildings are
actually<00:05:12.570> highly<00:05:12.960> detailed<00:05:13.320> but<00:05:13.740> it<00:05:13.830> looks

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
actually highly detailed but it looks

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:15.350 
actually highly detailed but it looks
like<00:05:14.130> they're<00:05:14.280> filled<00:05:14.580> in<00:05:14.729> with<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:15.000> bucket

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360

the<00:05:29.580> environments<00:05:30.030> were<00:05:30.090> designed<00:05:30.419> like<00:05:30.570> this

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
the environments were designed like this

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.150 
the environments were designed like this
to<00:05:30.870> support<00:05:31.020> high<00:05:31.380> frame<00:05:31.650> rates<00:05:31.919> when<00:05:32.070> you're

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
to support high frame rates when you're

controlling a hundred units but it

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.779 
controlling a hundred units but it
certainly<00:05:34.289> did<00:05:34.560> not<00:05:34.590> bedazzle<00:05:35.220> me<00:05:35.340> in

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
certainly did not bedazzle me in

addition<00:05:36.360> I<00:05:36.600> thought<00:05:36.840> that<00:05:36.960> everything

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
addition I thought that everything

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.110 
addition I thought that everything
looked<00:05:37.500> too<00:05:37.650> bright<00:05:38.009> there<00:05:38.550> isn't<00:05:38.729> a<00:05:38.940> good

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
looked too bright there isn't a good

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
usage of shadows in the game to really

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.860 
usage of shadows in the game to really
add<00:05:41.130> depth<00:05:41.430> to<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.639> picture<00:05:41.669> so<00:05:42.389> I<00:05:42.419> don't<00:05:42.780> know

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
add depth to the picture so I don't know

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.659

what<00:05:43.320> to<00:05:43.470> say<00:05:43.500> about<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:43.979> graphics<00:05:44.340> besides

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
what to say about the graphics besides
