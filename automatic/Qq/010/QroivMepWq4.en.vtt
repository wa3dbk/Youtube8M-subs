I<00:03:07.190> think<00:03:07.760> Anthony's<00:03:08.209> strength<00:03:08.540> he<00:03:08.690> has<00:03:08.870> he<00:03:09.320> has

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
I think Anthony's strength he has he has

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.580 
I think Anthony's strength he has he has
rapid<00:03:10.160> acceleration<00:03:11.030> great<00:03:11.420> feet<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:11.930> huge

rapid acceleration great feet and huge

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.500 
rapid acceleration great feet and huge
physicality<00:03:13.220> now<00:03:13.370> he's<00:03:13.970> obviously<00:03:14.150> much

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
physicality now he's obviously much

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.000 
physicality now he's obviously much
bigger<00:03:14.750> than<00:03:14.900> his<00:03:15.049> brother<00:03:15.260> which<00:03:15.830> i<00:03:15.950> think

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
bigger than his brother which i think

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.979 
bigger than his brother which i think
suits<00:03:16.340> him<00:03:16.519> better<00:03:16.549> for<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:16.940> 15s<00:03:17.420> games<00:03:17.630> great

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.840 
are massively good but being said you
know<00:05:44.650> I'm<00:05:44.710> not<00:05:44.800> trying<00:05:44.980> to<00:05:45.100> trying<00:05:45.550> to<00:05:45.610> think

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
know I'm not trying to trying to think

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.010 
know I'm not trying to trying to think
too<00:05:46.000> much<00:05:46.030> about<00:05:46.210> that<00:05:46.450> I'm<00:05:46.630> trying<00:05:46.840> to<00:05:46.870> get

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
too much about that I'm trying to get

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.750 
too much about that I'm trying to get
better<00:05:47.140> each<00:05:47.410> training<00:05:47.650> session<00:05:47.740> and<00:05:48.550> try<00:05:48.669> and

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
better each training session and try and

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.210 
better each training session and try and
develop<00:05:48.910> from<00:05:49.120> there<00:05:49.680> and<00:05:50.680> so<00:05:50.830> what<00:05:51.010> are<00:05:51.130> the

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
develop from there and so what are the

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.070 
develop from there and so what are the
chances<00:05:51.729> of<00:05:51.760> the<00:05:51.970> Watson<00:05:52.360> brothers<00:05:52.720> playing

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
chances of the Watson brothers playing

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.260 
chances of the Watson brothers playing
for<00:05:53.350> the<00:05:53.470> same<00:05:53.770> team

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
for the same team

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.870 
for the same team
one<00:05:54.450> day<00:05:54.950> something<00:05:55.950> that<00:05:56.040> we've<00:05:56.250> spoke<00:05:56.640> about

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
one day something that we've spoke about

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.050 
one day something that we've spoke about
and<00:05:57.120> so<00:05:57.300> does<00:05:57.480> my<00:05:57.660> dad<00:05:58.190> and<00:05:59.190> I<00:05:59.430> can<00:05:59.730> see<00:05:59.910> that

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
and so does my dad and I can see that

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.760 
and so does my dad and I can see that
only<00:06:00.360> really<00:06:00.600> being<00:06:00.810> in<00:06:00.900> a<00:06:00.960> 15<00:06:01.260> s<00:06:01.380> environment

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
only really being in a 15 s environment

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:02.840 
only really being in a 15 s environment
to<00:06:01.830> be<00:06:01.920> honest<00:06:02.100> with<00:06:02.220> the<00:06:02.280> way<00:06:02.340> and<00:06:02.580> he's<00:06:02.670> going

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
to be honest with the way and he's going

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.210 
to be honest with the way and he's going
at<00:06:03.030> the<00:06:03.090> moment<00:06:03.120> I<00:06:03.480> can't<00:06:03.720> see<00:06:03.960> him<00:06:04.220> coming

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
at the moment I can't see him coming

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.740 
at the moment I can't see him coming
about<00:06:05.430> sevens<00:06:05.850> but<00:06:06.090> he<00:06:06.240> talks<00:06:06.450> to<00:06:06.600> me<00:06:06.660> about

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
about sevens but he talks to me about

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.630 
about sevens but he talks to me about
how<00:06:07.650> you<00:06:07.710> wouldn't<00:06:08.070> really<00:06:08.190> want<00:06:08.280> to<00:06:08.430> do<00:06:08.550> the

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
how you wouldn't really want to do the

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.130 
how you wouldn't really want to do the
fitness<00:06:09.000> and<00:06:09.150> all<00:06:09.240> that<00:06:09.390> kind<00:06:09.630> of<00:06:09.750> thing<00:06:09.900> at

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
fitness and all that kind of thing at

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.840 
fitness and all that kind of thing at
the<00:06:10.230> moment<00:06:10.560> I<00:06:10.620> think<00:06:10.680> both<00:06:10.980> boys<00:06:11.220> are<00:06:11.460> where

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
the moment I think both boys are where

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.530 
the moment I think both boys are where
they<00:06:11.970> should<00:06:12.150> be<00:06:12.320> I<00:06:13.320> think<00:06:14.060> Marcus<00:06:15.060> knob<00:06:15.240> spots

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
they should be I think Marcus knob spots

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.360 
they should be I think Marcus knob spots
off<00:06:15.720> Anthony<00:06:16.110> and<00:06:16.230> sevens<00:06:16.560> and<00:06:16.740> Anthony's

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
off Anthony and sevens and Anthony's

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.730 
off Anthony and sevens and Anthony's
mopping<00:06:17.670> spots<00:06:17.910> on<00:06:18.090> Marcus<00:06:18.480> in<00:06:18.630> 15s

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
mopping spots on Marcus in 15s

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.010 
mopping spots on Marcus in 15s
but<00:06:20.130> I<00:06:20.160> think<00:06:20.310> both<00:06:20.640> are<00:06:20.880> equally<00:06:21.390> able<00:06:21.660> to

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
but I think both are equally able to

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.870 
but I think both are equally able to
transfer<00:06:22.470> code<00:06:22.800> and<00:06:23.070> with<00:06:23.490> a<00:06:23.520> little<00:06:23.760> bit<00:06:23.850> of

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
transfer code and with a little bit of

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.700 
transfer code and with a little bit of
work<00:06:24.120> on<00:06:24.330> the<00:06:24.450> areas<00:06:24.720> they<00:06:24.870> need<00:06:24.900> to<00:06:25.290> they

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
work on the areas they need to they

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.950 
work on the areas they need to they
could<00:06:25.890> both<00:06:26.040> be<00:06:26.100> be<00:06:27.090> playing<00:06:27.360> alongside<00:06:27.600> one

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
could both be be playing alongside one

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.200 
could both be be playing alongside one
