00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.410
 either cups or cake 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:21.090
 Microwave cake where he already notices you 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.580
 I need a microwave too 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.369
 I do it mostly in the evening 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.050
 before with a dry ingredient and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.140
 In the morning I'll finish it off 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.600
 but everything takes less together 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:39.390
 ten minutes as he also a length of 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.960
 but you can watch videos better 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.510
 need a little less time in the morning 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.570
 than ten minutes 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.100
 what do you need so for now 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.739
 needs your mail 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.920
 I always take wholemeal flour but could 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.859
 also quite normal white take more 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:03.409
 cacau not as important cocoa 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.840
 some cover or something sweetened 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:11.130
 then sugar or 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.830
 sweetener I use both baking powder 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.080
 and chocolate 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.930
 there you can just take what is there 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.720
 I still have so minis of 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.439
 intersport cocos and queen da heard and 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.750
 I have shimmered 1 small 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:33.890
 So you'll dive tomorrow, then 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:37.619
 early still milk oil and jam 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.710
 as well as either a tool 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.799
 big cup or a small bowl 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.060
 and a tablespoon of a teaspoon and 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.060
 as I said a microwave 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:02:19.230
 so we wait 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:22.140
 3 s so now the question is what you are 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.980
 you could use either four 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.080
 tablespoon of sweetener or just that 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.390
 Respect on my is just on it 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.420
 one tablespoon of sweetener equals 1 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.810
 tablespoon sugar or four tablespoons 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.000
 sugar 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.500
 I do so I always take two 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.920
 tablespoon sugar and two tablespoons 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:45.200
 fabric therefore my sweetener that is one 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.200
 stevia as a sweetener from qantas 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:56.650
 there is always maltodextrin in there 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.060
 steviol glycosides and of course around 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.430
 Unfortunately I also have to buy hot running 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.769
 found that it is because I have 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.200
 Strong me what to in sugar or 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:10.400
 or sugar substitute around it 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.709
 you need now I believe in yet 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.060
 and then it's good 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:18.310
 So as I said I always take two 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.310
 tablespoon of sweetener 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.450
 and a little less 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.599
 and 2 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.800
 2 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:57.230
 then active little less than 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:04.599
 phone forgive so 2 v.li maybe 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:04.599
 it was like that 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.190
 a tablespoon of butter 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.320
 Well , yes, but there could be so much 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.790
 take whatever you want, whatever I want 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.640
 just noticed in combination 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:30.540
 with strawberry jam comes naturally 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:34.290
 about people too so now I miss 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:37.530
 All of this contributed to bottles until tomorrow 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:41.000
 are coming and tomorrow morning 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.000
 remaining ingredients 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.510
 Good morning together it is close 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.240

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.860

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.520

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.670
 yesterday 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.250
 and now we still need milk and 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.670
 jam 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.100
 So we need two and a half to three 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.600
 tablespoon of oil 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.860
 I always take rapeseed oil easily fixed 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.810
 should be healthy as its customer 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.990
 should keep taste match everything 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.990

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.370
 then we need about 30 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:32.439
 I also have the milk 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:38.069
 Apple juice in replaced then stop it 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:38.069

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:46.719
 so my battery went limp made something 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.699
 There is no indication as well 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:50.710
 I got the jam jar on 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.819
 I wanted to say something like that here in you 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.830
 always take the homemade 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:55.780
 I was strawberry jam from my mum 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:06.250
 that's just the best jam 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:08.639
 Anyway , you can be sure of that 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.639
 spoon 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:22.530
 then the whole thing will be good luck and good luck 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:24.389
 then comes in nico raecke microwave 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:28.620
 at 180 percent 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:31.790
 I do not know how much pathos the whole 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.790
 then two minutes 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:46.850
 Now after home, be careful caution it 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:50.090
 is really hot so before it's time 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:55.419
 Allow to cool for about two minutes 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:55.419
 and done
