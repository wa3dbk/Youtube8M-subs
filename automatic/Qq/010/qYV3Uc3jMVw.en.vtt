00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.300
 Basic aerial maneuvers 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.530
 Welcome to the World of Warplanes Training Video! 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.610
 In this video we will show the following simple acrobatic maneuvers: 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.750
 swoop, 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.550
 controlled roll, 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.050
 Immelmann's twist, 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.450
 S-figure a 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.050
 rising bends (chandelle). 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:35.700
 Under normal circumstances, these maneuvers are not used individually in aerial combat, but form the basis for more complex maneuvers. 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.350
 Swoop. 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.400
 The dive is essentially a steep steep descent. 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.650
 To perform a dive, the pilot must simply tilt the bow of the aircraft down. 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.250
 Before executing a maneuver, experienced pilots make sure they are at a sufficient height to handle it safely. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.950
 Dive flights are used to attack ground targets and minimize enemy fire exposure to dive. 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:08.400
 The dive flight can also serve as an emergency maneuver, for example to extinguish the engine fire or to shake the pursuing enemy. 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.240
 Controlled roll. 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:23.000
 In the case of a controlled roll, the aircraft rotates 360 ° around the fuselage to maintain its original height and direction. 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:32.230
 When properly executed, there is no visible change in height and the aircraft leaves the maneuver in the same direction as it entered. 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.670
 To perform a controlled roll, the pilot must deflect the wings fully in one direction. 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:48.850
 In the case of some biplanes, the pilot must start a dive before the aileron is deflected in order to obtain the appropriate flight speed. 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.200
 It achieves the flight speed necessary to complete the roll without losing control of the aircraft. 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.380
 Although controlled roll-up is not very practical in combat, it is closely related to many common maneuvers. 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.250
 Normally, this maneuver is also referred to as the winning roll as it is done in victory or celebration. 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.500
 Immelmann's twist. 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.000
 Immelmann's twist, which is also known as half loop or simply Immelmann, 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.850
 is an acrobatic maneuver with minimal practical use in aerial combat 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.880
 however, it has nevertheless become a popular acrobatic maneuver that is commonly seen on air shows around the world. 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.450
 It is named after Max Immelmann, the German Air Ace of the First World War. 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.650
 The maneuver begins with an ascending half loop followed by a half roll 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.000
 with a horizontal flight in the opposite direction and higher altitude. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.350
 Note: Make sure you have enough speed to complete this maneuver. 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.000
 S-figure. 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.350
 The S-figure maneuver is also called "inverted" or "turned" Immelmann. 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.800
 To perform an S-figure, the pilot must start with a half-roll with an inverted plane and then perform a downward half-loop. 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.650
 The aircraft returns to horizontal flight in the opposite direction at a lower altitude. 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:28.050
 This maneuver is mostly used to withdraw from combat or to move behind an enemy that moves at a lower altitude in the opposite direction. 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.000
 Note: Make sure you have enough height to complete this maneuver. 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.150
 Rising Curves (chandelle). 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.850
 The chandelle is a combination of 180 ° rotation and climb. 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.000
 The pilot will start a rising turn from a level flight. 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.800
 The maneuver is divided into two parts. 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:56.800
 In the first half of the maneuver, through a 90 ° change of direction, the tilt angle is constant and the height increases slowly. 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.300
 During the second half of the turn, the height is constant and the heeling angle slowly aligns. 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.950
 A rising turn is a very useful maneuver for pilots of low-level aircraft. 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.550
 It can be used to quickly rotate on a chasing attacker 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.300
 or to move to a position from which you can attack an enemy that rotates or flies in a different direction. 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.550
 When attacked, it can be used to prepare the aircraft for an offensive position, and in defense to escape from the enemy. 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.650
 Congratulations! Now you know the basic acrobatic maneuvers! 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.250
 We look forward again next time and now up into the cloud!
