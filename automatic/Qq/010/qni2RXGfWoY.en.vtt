00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:22.960
 and how they are speaking friends youtube 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:25.419
 of the foral territories in this new 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.230
 material we will learn how to record a 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:31.630
 sample in virtual dj let's start what 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.030
 first thing we're going to do is have a 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.969
 music loaded on one of the decks 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.920
 after we have spending we will go to 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.649
 this tab where you are here that is 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.309
 flame light and here we are going to select 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.410
 one of these groups for more 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.710
 or less into account what we want 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.649
 that is repeated because if we have yes 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.300
 we know the samples are small 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.559
 Music arguments that repeat 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.660
 well we choose any if it's one is 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.489
 very small 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.489
 without these is a little longer 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.650
 but I say it more or less 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.650
 like this 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.790
 finish 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.760
 and how they are repeated well I do not put it 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.370
 this the beginning 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.370
 and I give him to record the sampler 7 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.840
 or to any of these 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.359
 and it is already 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.240
 let's cut it 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.299
 counting more 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.980
 and well that was all for today with this 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.960
 we can make various combinations 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.220
 subscribe I know this video here and 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.220
 we have many more
