You know, sometimes when you have a specific
location with specific needs you can't find

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.190
the right piece of furniture, and you just
have to make it.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.270
You watched us design and build this house
in 150 days, but the work is far from over.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.890
We're about to jump into my favorite part
of the process of bringing all this together.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.080
Join me for an exclusive look right here on
eHow Home.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.140
Sometimes in rooms with limited space, finding
that exact, perfect piece of furniture is

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.600
always a dilemma.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.660
For instance, in the entry hall here, well,
we already have a nice, beautiful chest that's

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.620
gonna go on the west wall.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.460
I needed something on the east wall to put
some things on, maybe even store some things

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.520
under, and I just couldn't find it.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.390
I really only had about 56 inches to deal
with along the wall.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.310
And so what I did is I came up with this table.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.010
I sketched it out on a piece of paper, first
sort of laying out the form and the dimensions

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.200
of the table for Tony to build.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.430
And then I came up with a design for the profile
of the side or this supporter leg.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.920
You see, we just used some really ordinary
materials -- these are pine boards.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.010
And, basically, you have a top, two sides,
and a rail that gives it support down the

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.010
center.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.549
So, what could be simpler?

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.080
I wanted a sort of a classic balustrade design
on the end.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.110
I haven't decided exactly how I'm gonna finish
it now, but the size works perfectly.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.890
It fits just below the chair rail in the entry
hall.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.369
The great thing about this custom piece is
that it wasn't that expensive to make and

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.360
the width of it or how much it will stick
out into the hall is really narrow.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.159
It's only 13 inches, which is exactly what
I needed.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.110
This won't crowd the space but will allow
me to have a console or a piece of furniture

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.340
to place things on.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.900
And one other design detail I wanna point
out is that I wanted some depth here, so he

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.920
expanded this board just a little bit by adding
a 3/4 board -- we have just a little bit of

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.320
an apron here, which gave the top some weight.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.759
That's better than just having one single
flat board across the top.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.709
Hey, isn't it nice having a Tony around?

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.750
If you're enjoying these segments and wanna
see how we finish out this table and place

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.150
it in the entry hall, check in with us regularly.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:36.910

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.700
