00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
cooking them then we'll heat up the

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.960 
cooking them then we'll heat up the
apples<00:02:19.570> on<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.780> stove<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.650> try<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.460> mix<00:02:21.760> them

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
apples on a stove and try to mix them

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.090 
apples on a stove and try to mix them
again<00:02:22.090> what<00:02:22.930> happens<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.500> apples<00:02:23.860> when<00:02:24.010> we

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
again what happens to the apples when we

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.300 
again what happens to the apples when we
heat<00:02:24.280> them<00:02:24.400> off<00:02:24.610> great<00:02:25.480> question<00:02:26.020> Gabriela

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
heat them off great question Gabriela

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.449 
heat them off great question Gabriela
it's<00:02:27.310> your<00:02:28.000> job<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.750> observe<00:02:29.410> how<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:29.980> heat

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
it's your job to observe how the heat

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.890 
it's your job to observe how the heat
changes<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.300> apples

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
changes the apples

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.020 
changes the apples
I<00:02:32.050> think<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.590> apples<00:02:33.010> will<00:02:33.220> get<00:02:33.370> softer<00:02:33.850> when

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
I think the apples will get softer when

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.940 
I think the apples will get softer when
we<00:02:34.180> heat<00:02:34.390> them<00:02:34.570> up<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:34.959> don't<00:02:35.110> think<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.650> apples

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
we heat them up I don't think the apples

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.710 
we heat them up I don't think the apples
will<00:02:36.040> change<00:02:36.280> at<00:02:36.459> all<00:02:36.670> well<00:02:37.239> there's<00:02:37.450> only<00:02:37.570> one

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
will change at all well there's only one

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.080 
will change at all well there's only one
