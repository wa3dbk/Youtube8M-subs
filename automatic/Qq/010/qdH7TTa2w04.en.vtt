00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
same watercolor pencils as me however

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.460 
same watercolor pencils as me however
that<00:00:59.670> they<00:01:00.000> do<00:01:00.059> not<00:01:00.330> show<00:01:00.540> up<00:01:00.720> nearly<00:01:01.019> as<00:01:01.259> well

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
that they do not show up nearly as well

that they do not show up nearly as well
as<00:01:01.619> on<00:01:01.769> my<00:01:01.890> videos<00:01:02.400> in<00:01:03.299> 90%<00:01:03.720> of<00:01:04.199> cases<00:01:04.259> it<00:01:04.949> means

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
as on my videos in 90% of cases it means

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.859 
as on my videos in 90% of cases it means
something<00:01:05.579> went<00:01:05.759> wrong<00:01:05.970> during<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.420> sealing

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
something went wrong during the sealing

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.859 
something went wrong during the sealing
process<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.790> good<00:01:08.790> way<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.030> test<00:01:09.329> if<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.689> is

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
process a good way to test if this is

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.870 
process a good way to test if this is
true<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.619> use<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.890> same<00:01:11.100> pencils<00:01:11.640> on

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
true is to use the same pencils on

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.749 
true is to use the same pencils on
regular<00:01:12.390> copy<00:01:12.659> paper<00:01:12.920> if<00:01:13.920> they<00:01:14.130> work<00:01:14.310> well<00:01:14.579> on

doll<00:01:25.740> properly<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.430> extremely<00:01:27.030> important<00:01:27.630> but

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
doll properly is extremely important but

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.990 
doll properly is extremely important but
it<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.260> take<00:01:28.560> quite<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.860> while<00:01:29.010> to<00:01:29.370> get<00:01:29.520> used<00:01:29.790> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
it can take quite a while to get used to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.870 
it can take quite a while to get used to
it<00:01:30.150> since<00:01:31.050> Selene<00:01:31.560> has<00:01:31.770> tan<00:01:32.040> skin<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.670> means

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
it since Selene has tan skin it means

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.360 
it since Selene has tan skin it means
that<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.330> use<00:01:33.479> pink<00:01:33.780> pastels<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.500> her<00:01:34.740> they

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
that if I use pink pastels on her they

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.120 
that if I use pink pastels on her they
will<00:01:35.549> turn<00:01:35.790> red<00:01:36.030> when<00:01:36.240> sealed<00:01:36.860> think<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.010> it

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
will turn red when sealed think of it

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.980 
will turn red when sealed think of it
like<00:01:38.310> using<00:01:38.580> a<00:01:38.790> multiply<00:01:39.299> layer<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.780> Photoshop

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
like using a multiply layer in Photoshop

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.890 
like using a multiply layer in Photoshop
it<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.130> basically<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.729> same<00:01:41.909> principle<00:01:42.150> where

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
it is basically the same principle where

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.260 
it is basically the same principle where
the<00:01:42.930> background<00:01:43.290> color<00:01:43.799> affects<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.909> colors

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the background color affects the colors

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.660 
the background color affects the colors
applied<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.810> top<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.460> why<00:01:47.640> I

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
applied on top of it this is why I

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.460 
applied on top of it this is why I
airbrushed<00:01:48.000> her<00:01:48.479> lips<00:01:48.690> white<00:01:48.960> before

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
airbrushed her lips white before

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.160 
airbrushed her lips white before
painting<00:01:49.740> them<00:01:50.100> pink<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:51.540> darker<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.140> skin

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
painting them pink the darker the skin

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.200 
painting them pink the darker the skin
tone<00:01:52.650> is<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.220> more<00:01:53.400> difficult<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.180> to

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
tone is the more difficult it is to

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.120 
tone is the more difficult it is to
achieve<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.840> exact<00:01:55.200> shade<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.860> want

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
achieve the exact shade that you want

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.490 
achieve the exact shade that you want
and<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.940> more<00:01:57.150> reliant<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.780> will<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.320> use

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
and the more reliant you will be to use

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.200 
and the more reliant you will be to use
an<00:01:58.680> airbrush<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.310> achieve<00:01:59.610> lighter<00:01:59.880> and

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
an airbrush to achieve lighter and

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.140 
an airbrush to achieve lighter and
brighter<00:02:00.360> colors

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.510 

when<00:02:03.720> I'm<00:02:03.840> happy<00:02:04.050> with<00:02:04.200> how<00:02:04.530> she<00:02:04.590> looks<00:02:04.980> I<00:02:05.250> add

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
when I'm happy with how she looks I add

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.130 
when I'm happy with how she looks I add
some<00:02:05.760> glitter<00:02:05.940> gloss<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.780> apply<00:02:07.080> the
