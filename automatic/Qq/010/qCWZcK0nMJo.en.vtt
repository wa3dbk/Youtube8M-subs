00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.089
 for this pirate is removed 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.750
 psychological barrier to a piece of man 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.290
 There is a certain zone of implementation which 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.360
 he does not tolerate 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.340
 that is, he is already beginning to strain 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.300
 feel it may even run away 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.289
 sleeves nerves there therefore we are first 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.840
 remove the psychological barrier 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.260
 get used to each other get used to everyone 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.090
 movements and gaining movement yourself 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.080
 what will be convenient for us 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.809
 do but for now does not mean we 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.140
 one body will now be in another laugh 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.149
 yet without arms hands for balancing like u 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.230
 squirrels tail key work all the time 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.230
 one passive any 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.600
 I say in the spirit of mind 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.690
 as much as possible contact than I would lie 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.550
 he came here so I later easier 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:05.920
 will work by itself that is to try 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.540
 fill it up as much as possible 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.960
 or is there a bulge of their area fill 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.950
 by myself 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.500
 decomposed and try all the time it 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.310
 shift 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.310
 much further next element 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.700
 Well, gradually we work as a hull then 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.140
 include shoulders and forearms and hands and 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.060
 move already 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.070
 Well, how would I tell you to add more 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.880
 hitting and will be already completely fight 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.159
 gradually we move sportop plane 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.580
 Here we are in this position 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.110
 Now 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.440
 also from this position tries and on 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.800
 somehow block me here I am from here 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.800
 also go out 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:57.210
 blocked it now it is very and here 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.210
 Sold accumulating looking I came up with 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.020
 below 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.189
 and so since 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.189
 medic 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:36.670
 surah pack 3 itself we continue 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.670
 deducing something else off balance 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.200
 pushing also apart 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.470
 rotate 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.400
 that no competitive effect 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.940
 no fight each other one lead and 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.849
 another slave I really run in this 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.239
 situations are all possible which only 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.690
 there are combat elements from to the end they are not 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.410
 I bring 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.660
 that is, it turned out to be such a situation for yourself 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.989
 I note that I can from this position 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.370
 make overturn it work on. 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:17.690
 hit another like it just as well do 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:21.690
 pushed we kick the portrait 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.160
 for starters in the training version a friend through 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.500
 friend through a friend just throws 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:31.190

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.150
 I throw my leg over it and I 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.489
 simultaneously touched the ground I immediately 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.590
 I put it on my head yes that is, he 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.470

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.730
 name is 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.730
 managing very much 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.220
 he comes at me 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.880
 down the water and trickles that is to fail 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:20.000
 him get on him and so again like 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:26.580
 my guardian I am I 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.020
 further running hands of some martial 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.170
 arts this technique is called 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.340
 sticky hands here it is more 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.500
 [music] 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:39.080
 multifunctional ie at the initial 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:42.419
 stage we just put arm overlap 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.710
 hand of the enemy here if it will be so he does not 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:49.729
 will strike so I im that is here we are not 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:53.479
 tearing contact must prevent 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:57.720
 penetration is never carried out 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:05:00.060
 The first this pad will be further 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:04.070
 while we just denote passes 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.070
 frontal point further this will be here
