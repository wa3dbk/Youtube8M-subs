gardeners in order to use one of these

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.219 
gardeners in order to use one of these
you<00:01:14.159> just<00:01:14.340> turn<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.549> all<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.790> way<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:16.140> you

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
you just turn it all the way on and you

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.550 
you just turn it all the way on and you
go<00:01:16.320> ahead<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.470> rotate<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.040> all<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.460> way<00:01:17.640> and

go ahead and rotate it all the way and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.880 
go ahead and rotate it all the way and
then<00:01:19.560> hit<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.860> igniter<00:01:21.080> this<00:01:22.080> flame<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.650> so

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
then hit the igniter this flame is so

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.780 
then hit the igniter this flame is so
efficient<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:23.820> all<00:01:24.060> blue<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.390> clear<00:01:25.610> if<00:01:26.610> you

to<00:03:04.400> freeze<00:03:04.700> up<00:03:04.940> that's<00:03:05.330> not<00:03:05.600> good

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.740 

well<00:03:32.310> I've<00:03:32.490> tried<00:03:32.730> this<00:03:32.910> in<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.150> couple<00:03:33.360> of<00:03:33.540> beds

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
well I've tried this in a couple of beds

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.500 
well I've tried this in a couple of beds
now<00:03:33.990> let<00:03:34.290> me<00:03:34.380> give<00:03:34.530> you<00:03:34.650> my<00:03:34.890> verdict<00:03:35.510> something

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
now let me give you my verdict something

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.920 
now let me give you my verdict something
like<00:03:36.660> this<00:03:37.010> it<00:03:38.010> kind<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.400> works<00:03:38.750> but<00:03:39.750> it's

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
like this it kind of works but it's

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.330 
like this it kind of works but it's
nothing<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.260> write<00:03:40.500> home<00:03:40.530> about<00:03:40.710> really<00:03:41.250> it

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
nothing to write home about really it

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.520 
nothing to write home about really it
takes<00:03:41.550> a<00:03:41.730> while<00:03:41.910> if<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.660> have<00:03:42.870> mulch<00:03:43.200> in<00:03:43.410> your

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
takes a while if you have mulch in your

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.190 
takes a while if you have mulch in your
bed<00:03:43.740> it's<00:03:44.310> likely<00:03:44.700> going<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.910> catch<00:03:45.090> fire<00:03:45.200> the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
bed it's likely going to catch fire the

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.900 
bed it's likely going to catch fire the
best<00:03:46.440> time<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.860> do<00:03:47.040> something<00:03:47.490> like<00:03:47.640> this

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
best time to do something like this

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.120 
best time to do something like this
would<00:03:48.150> be<00:03:48.480> early<00:03:49.350> spring<00:03:49.680> before<00:03:49.860> you

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
would be early spring before you

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.710 
would be early spring before you
actually<00:03:50.550> plant<00:03:50.850> your<00:03:51.030> plants<00:03:51.450> because<00:03:51.600> if

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
actually plant your plants because if

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.360 
actually plant your plants because if
your<00:03:51.870> mulch<00:03:52.080> catches<00:03:52.560> on<00:03:52.710> fire<00:03:52.950> you're<00:03:53.280> gonna

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
your mulch catches on fire you're gonna

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.820 
your mulch catches on fire you're gonna
get<00:03:53.580> a<00:03:53.640> lot<00:03:53.970> of<00:03:54.270> problems<00:03:54.780> with<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.470> plants

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
get a lot of problems with the plants

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.950 
get a lot of problems with the plants
already<00:03:56.010> in<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.310> ground<00:03:56.520> the<00:03:57.510> other<00:03:57.690> thing

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
upside down you never want to turn a

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.570 
upside down you never want to turn a
propane<00:04:01.260> tank<00:04:01.500> upside<00:04:01.770> down<00:04:02.160> because<00:04:02.370> it'll

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
propane tank upside down because it'll

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.880 
propane tank upside down because it'll
start<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:02.820> freeze<00:04:03.210> up<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.720> first<00:04:04.650> place

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
start to freeze up and the first place

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.440 
start to freeze up and the first place
it<00:04:05.070> will<00:04:05.160> freeze<00:04:05.400> up<00:04:05.430> is<00:04:05.790> around<00:04:06.030> this<00:04:06.180> neck

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
it will freeze up is around this neck

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.450 
it will freeze up is around this neck
blocks<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.140> flow<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:07.680> then<00:04:08.190> you've<00:04:08.340> got

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
blocks the flow and then you've got

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.120 
blocks the flow and then you've got
problems<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.810> kind<00:04:10.110> that<00:04:10.260> farmers<00:04:10.830> use

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
problems the kind that farmers use

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.370 
problems the kind that farmers use
typically<00:04:11.850> are<00:04:12.120> going<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.330> be<00:04:12.510> they're<00:04:13.290> gonna

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
typically are going to be they're gonna

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.530 
typically are going to be they're gonna
have<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.680> hose<00:04:13.950> attached<00:04:14.460> to<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:14.880> to<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:15.030> propane

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.870 
have a hose attached to it to a propane
bottle<00:04:16.020> that'll<00:04:16.650> stay<00:04:16.890> upright<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:17.580> you<00:04:17.640> don't

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
bottle that'll stay upright so you don't

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.310 
bottle that'll stay upright so you don't
have<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.239> problem<00:04:18.450> then<00:04:18.780> it'll<00:04:18.989> have<00:04:19.080> a<00:04:19.110> nice

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
have that problem then it'll have a nice

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.940 
have that problem then it'll have a nice
long<00:04:20.060> wand<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.360> it<00:04:21.510> with<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.440> flame

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
long wand to it with the flame

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.010 
long wand to it with the flame
attachment<00:04:23.580> on<00:04:23.670> the<00:04:23.700> end<00:04:23.820> so<00:04:24.540> you<00:04:24.570> can<00:04:24.780> just

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
attachment on the end so you can just

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.650 
attachment on the end so you can just
walk<00:04:25.230> around<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.890> do<00:04:26.520> big<00:04:26.760> areas<00:04:27.120> like<00:04:27.390> that

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
walk around and do big areas like that

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.930 
walk around and do big areas like that
you<00:04:28.230> can<00:04:28.380> pick<00:04:28.650> those<00:04:28.860> up<00:04:28.920> I<00:04:29.280> believe<00:04:29.490> in<00:04:29.880> a

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
you can pick those up I believe in a

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.120 
you can pick those up I believe in a
farm<00:04:30.330> and<00:04:30.480> rent<00:04:30.690> stores<00:04:31.050> for<00:04:31.380> around<00:04:31.620> between

twenty-five<00:04:32.790> and<00:04:32.820> fifty<00:04:33.090> dollars<00:04:33.600> and<00:04:33.870> then

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
twenty-five and fifty dollars and then

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.780 
twenty-five and fifty dollars and then
you<00:04:34.680> just<00:04:34.830> hook<00:04:34.980> it<00:04:35.070> up<00:04:35.190> to<00:04:35.280> your<00:04:35.310> propane

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.460 
you just hook it up to your propane
bottle<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.330> could<00:04:36.630> do<00:04:36.810> it<00:04:36.840> like<00:04:37.080> that<00:04:37.290> if

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
bottle and you could do it like that if
