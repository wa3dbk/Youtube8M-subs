my quarter I didn't use points plummeted

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.910 
my quarter I didn't use points plummeted
because<00:02:26.600> he<00:02:26.780> didn't<00:02:26.990> have<00:02:27.080> his<00:02:27.140> name<00:02:27.440> card<00:02:27.710> yes

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
think it's kind of fun is you get like

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.770 
think it's kind of fun is you get like
the<00:02:43.610> double<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.030> points<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:44.570> get<00:02:44.660> to

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
the double the points and you get to

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.420 
the double the points and you get to
watch<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.140> game<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.560> some<00:02:45.740> say<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.220> highs<00:02:46.400> are

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
watch the game to some say the highs are

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.250 
watch the game to some say the highs are
high<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:47.090> then<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.390> lows<00:02:47.570> are<00:02:47.600> it's<00:02:47.959> true

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
high and then the lows are it's true

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.410 
high and then the lows are it's true
that's<00:02:48.590> true<00:02:48.740> so<00:02:49.610> if<00:02:49.880> you<00:02:50.000> have<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.180> great

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
that's true so if you have a great

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.400 
that's true so if you have a great
backup<00:02:50.690> quarterback

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
backup quarterback

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.890 
backup quarterback
maybe<00:02:51.740> it's<00:02:51.920> minute<00:02:52.250> yeah<00:02:52.490> I<00:02:52.790> mean<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.360> think

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
maybe it's minute yeah I mean I think

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.070 
maybe it's minute yeah I mean I think
that<00:02:54.170> it's<00:02:54.920> it's<00:02:55.220> smart<00:02:55.580> sometimes<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:56.510> to

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
that it's it's smart sometimes to to

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.430 
that it's it's smart sometimes to to
pick<00:02:57.320> like<00:02:57.650> Peyton<00:02:58.490> Manning<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.230> you<00:03:00.230> know<00:03:00.380> to
