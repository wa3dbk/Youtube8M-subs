00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.080
 look at the wants 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.770
 finish 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.279
 hello friends of youtube friends today 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.680
 I bring some data related to the 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.779
 last chapter of the end of season 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.020
 of gravity files that turned out to be very 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.460
 shocking especially in its good ending 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.860
 I'll just talk about the things that I've 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.170
 analyzed and seen in other videos about 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.070
 this final episode and about the secret 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.440
 it's good to start this episode 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.019
 Gideon is today called risk rises 11 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.030
 translated into Spanish tells about how 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.100
 at last and lion manages to seize the 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.140
 mystery cottage leaving its 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.199
 residents living with their grandmother's 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.239
 in your house as we all know and of a 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.430
 tried to seize numerous times of 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.100
 the cabin but it's always frustrated by 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.199
 dipper who considers his enemy but 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.170
 does not consider it a threat when believing 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.479
 superior for having the book number 2 in 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.790
 this episode are video delivery 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.820
 the papers of the cabin giving him the 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.979
 property so nobody knows their plans 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.020
 and deon says he will convert the cabin into 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.750
 an amusement park that measures 5 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.789
 miles around but what in 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.690
 reality wants is to seize the book 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.550
 number 1 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.290
 is the secret that speaks so much every time 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.450
 that his father asks him why 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.270
 he wants the cabin as we saw it in 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.550
 the small chapter dipper the why and 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.290
 where is that book is because it is said 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.900
 that by putting together the two parts of 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.640
 newspapers will open a portal to a world 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.390
 extraordinary that will allow you to govern 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.130
 all good when you can not take care of your 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.320
 Nephews are sending them to the city 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.900
 where they will be in the care of their parents 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.640
 but meanwhile and deon put together the 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.770
 dipper's book and his but he 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.530
 Surprising to know that they are not two parts 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.480
 but they are three so go into a 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.670
 robot that the crazy old man built the 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.160
 people that as we know is an expert in 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.260
 put together giant robots for purposes of 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.990
 destruction as in the lake episode 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.090
 sinks back and one manages to catch the 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.400
 bus where piper and mabel traveled 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.530
 but in the end he only manages to catch mabel 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.600
 bieber is free but wounded on 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.610
 everything in the nose where you can see that 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.520
 the magnitude of the stroke has left him 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.410
 blood now I make a parenthesis for 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.650
 show them that this is the only episode 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.780
 where blood appears so far at 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.110
 try to rescue his sister viper 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.440
 fight 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.940
 and it ends with the robot explosion and 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.550
 that was controlled by the movements 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.520
 of video and because of the beating he finished 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.600
 exploding at the end of the explosion in 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.610
 the rubble 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.890
 piper finds her book and then they're 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.930
 reveals that and gift is a farce since it does not 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.360
 it was evident and that the emblems that 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.700
 daban were actually spy cameras that 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.880
 they captured his movements and allowed him 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.040
 know everything in the end the police arrest 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.230
 of guideÃ³n and when picking it loose the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.110
 scriptures and his book that are caught in 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.670
 secret together with the scriptures 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.890
 once in the room of dipper and mabel 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.290
 he decides to show him he is in the secret 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.020
 of the newspaper number three since they trusted 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.209
 in him after what happened they are at 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.340
 catch it pretends disinterest and believes that 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.650
 Bieber invented everything and borrows it 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.630
 to swindle more people as it 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.820
 they exhausted their ideas 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.980
 piper tries to stop him but his comes out 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.200
 a box with water guns and 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.090
 entertains the country nephews so 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.390
 they leave the book aside and play with 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.400
 its now the shocking thing comes 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.350
 below the dipper room and 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.150
 mabel are entering the secret part 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.790
 hidden behind the vending machine 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.100
 as we saw it in episode number 1 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.459
 but this time you will all the hiding place 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.140
 good almost everything now in see why 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.060
 well it's so low down some stairs and 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.310
 take an elevator to a basement level 3 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.470
 which is a machine room and where 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.720
 he has his desk inside him 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.060
 find book number 1 which is the 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.120
 Treasure of the cottage plus that room 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.950
 having the three books in their possession 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.560
 aligns in a formation where the 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.360
 result is a map are copied 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.519
 codes of that map on a machine 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.650
 strange that makes another one work even more 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.480
 strange where the portal opens towards 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.120
 the extraordinary world that and where 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.400
 writes 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.630
 good what did you think until now 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.639
 shocking not now well in my theories 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.470
 good but also this image will be given 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.419
 account that in this pipeline is 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.330
 written the word thousand is me 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.160
 observing what my theory would imply 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.290
 that bill is aware of everything at 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.510
 possess the eye that sees everything so 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.760
 look at everyone who has a relationship 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.830
 with these books and since they are managed 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.830
 gather all three is the center of attention 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.020
 of good bill now look at these objects 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.419
 As you can see they have recorded the eye that everything 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.400
 he sees that according to me they have a relationship with 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.380
 bill so that would imply that he is 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.360
 carrying this search for several 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.479
 years as mentioned in the episode 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.430
 now they remember when I said that the 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.650
 hideaway is not shown at all is 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.389
 because only two plants show us the 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.550
 first that's where you take it and the 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.680
 third that is the engine room and 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.350
 where is the number one book 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.510
 but it does not show on the second floor like this 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.310
 that we do not know what hidden mysteries we 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.380
 they hope inside her maybe the 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.780
 show in another episode 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.480
 Now look at this as you can see 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.580
 appreciate a telescope a radar where you 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.650
 shows the forest maybe it's so wise 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.390
 who would find the book and what 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.940
 I wanted to watch so it would not happen 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.740
 nothing or maybe to monitor some event 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.570
 strange that I gave him information about the 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.580
 location of the books or so that 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.990
 people like video will not come close and 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.200
 you take in the two remaining books 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:46.140
 first that now let's turn to the subject of 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.360
 portal this portal could be found 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.760
 for are they trying to make a scam 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.130
 for tourists suddenly ran into this 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.560
 hiding place that could possibly be the 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.780
 refuge of the writer of these books and 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.550
 they are too stingy to spend 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.380
 the money in this material and its 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.650
 intellectual abilities are not 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.050
 bright we may say when entering 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.180
 to hide and seek , book number one was 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.220
 already put on the desk giving him the 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.260
 knowledge of the mysteries of gravity 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.150
 files like the power of books and 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.850
 the portal to the wonderful world that video 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.610
 describes good finally let's move on 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.650
 script topic as we know and deon already 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.240
 I knew about the existence of books 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.660
 but only two volumes 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.669
 this episode discovers that there are three 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.319
 now suppose that and deon gets the 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:34.930
 three books but you can not do it 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:36.699
 operate without the machine as they are is 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.740
 the only one who knows the password of the 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:40.930
 vending machine that is the entrance to 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.030
 hideaway and the elevator to get to 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.039
 she and I do not think that guideÃ³n was going to dig 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.199
 to get to the portal because suddenly 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:49.260
 it would damage the facilities and the machine 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:52.110
 it would spoil 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:55.140
 good friends that was all I hope you 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.420
 I liked it and you know if I had any 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.420
 mistake they tell me in the comments that 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:02.430
 that helps me improve and remember only 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.440
 this is about the end of the season where 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.960
 things are clarified from previous episodes 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.300
 so if you want more of those theories 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:13.940
 the quickest way is by giving like and 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.940
 subscribing until next time
