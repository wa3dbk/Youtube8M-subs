something which is more and more TV and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.169 
something which is more and more TV and
you<00:02:00.860> think<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:01.220> Metro<00:02:01.549> is<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.670> lot<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:02.000> live<00:02:02.119> up

you think this Metro is a lot to live up

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:03.520 
you think this Metro is a lot to live up
to<00:02:02.330> because<00:02:02.569> the<00:02:02.630> Delhi<00:02:02.869> Metro<00:02:02.959> is<00:02:03.289> said<00:02:03.500> on

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
to because the Delhi Metro is said on

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.740 
to because the Delhi Metro is said on
the<00:02:03.740> extremely<00:02:04.220> good<00:02:04.520> example<00:02:04.970> because<00:02:05.270> I

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
the extremely good example because I

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.600 
the extremely good example because I
travel<00:02:06.500> all<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.739> time<00:02:06.770> in<00:02:07.009> management<00:02:07.459> I'm

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
also just below this because this is

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.470 
also just below this because this is

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
half of the Metro I perhaps I've said it

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.580
