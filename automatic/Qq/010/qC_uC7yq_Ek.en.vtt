because<00:00:29.300> we<00:00:29.450> decided<00:00:29.630> to<00:00:29.900> mess<00:00:30.170> up<00:00:30.320> the

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
because we decided to mess up the

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.779 
because we decided to mess up the
landing<00:00:30.710> gear<00:00:30.830> a<00:00:30.860> little<00:00:30.920> bit<00:00:31.190> so<00:00:31.460> we'll<00:00:31.640> get

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
landing gear a little bit so we'll get

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.850 
landing gear a little bit so we'll get
it<00:00:31.910> going<00:00:31.940> all<00:00:32.180> right<00:00:32.210> um<00:00:32.680> we're<00:00:33.680> gonna<00:00:33.739> go

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.020 
camera in my hand as well as the
airplane<00:00:36.590> so<00:00:36.770> I'm<00:00:36.860> gonna<00:00:36.980> primarily<00:00:37.519> focus<00:00:37.909> on

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
airplane so I'm gonna primarily focus on

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.520 
airplane so I'm gonna primarily focus on
launching<00:00:38.420> it<00:00:38.570> so<00:00:39.050> what<00:00:39.140> I'm<00:00:39.199> gonna<00:00:39.289> do<00:00:39.440> is

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
launching it so what I'm gonna do is

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.079 
launching it so what I'm gonna do is
just<00:00:39.710> kind<00:00:39.829> of<00:00:39.859> angle<00:00:40.100> it<00:00:40.129> about<00:00:40.399> 45<00:00:40.760> degrees

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:41.089 
just kind of angle it about 45 degrees

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:44.950 
just kind of angle it about 45 degrees
give<00:00:41.929> it<00:00:42.050> at<00:00:42.170> least<00:00:42.469> half<00:00:43.190> throttle<00:00:43.489> and<00:00:43.960> let

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
give it at least half throttle and let

00:00:44.960 --> 00:01:57.080 
give it at least half throttle and let
me<00:00:45.079> know<00:00:45.230> when<00:00:45.379> you<00:00:45.469> are<00:00:45.499> ready<00:00:52.659> all<00:00:53.659> right

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.100 

bring<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.210> in<00:01:58.270> for<00:01:58.420> a<00:01:58.480> landing<00:01:58.630> see<00:01:58.960> if<00:01:59.020> we

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
bring it in for a landing see if we

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.990 
bring it in for a landing see if we
can't<00:01:59.320> figure<00:02:00.130> way<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.400> adjust<00:02:00.550> it<00:02:00.880> or

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
can't figure way to adjust it or

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.940 
can't figure way to adjust it or
whatever<00:02:01.210> yeah

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:21.160 

it's<00:02:07.220> just<00:02:07.460> so<00:02:07.670> much<00:02:07.880> like<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:20.510> turns<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:21.020> like

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
it's just so much like it turns in like

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.860 
it's just so much like it turns in like
spurts<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:23.680> in<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:25.280> servos<00:02:25.940> are<00:02:26.090> cheap<00:02:26.300> I've

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
spurts I in the servos are cheap I've

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.300 
spurts I in the servos are cheap I've
already<00:02:27.230> placed<00:02:27.500> one<00:02:27.830> just<00:02:28.100> because<00:02:28.190> it

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
already placed one just because it

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.979 
already placed one just because it
stripped<00:02:28.760> out<00:02:29.000> until<00:02:29.780> heart<00:02:30.110> so<00:02:30.650> I<00:02:31.870> need<00:02:32.870> to

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
stripped out until heart so I need to

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.320 
stripped out until heart so I need to
get<00:02:33.080> better
