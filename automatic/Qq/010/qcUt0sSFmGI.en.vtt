00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.199
 hello everyone also knows so 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.320
 today we find ourselves in slow motion 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:37.190
 tutorial on the cooked plugin shock that hurts 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.300
 in fact shit kg kg shock for the 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.940
 those who know a little bit so 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.329
 here is the mix is ​​still not bad 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.239
 I find the result frankly and 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:50.420
 it's impressive so it's more 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.720
 quite fast and efficient so that's it 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.370
 heard all for everything so what 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.260
 that it will be necessary so it will be already a 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.699
 level pj so it will take to the economy 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.489
 it's a question of money so 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.960
 ex officio are only volt it's also 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.119
 is necessary but I'm not sure 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.710
 than to look on loeb quit who will 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.360
 in a description by the way is 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:15.640
 then possibly also l w séoul 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.610
 quests to protect your chests 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.890
 otherwise it's all take your plugins 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.630
 it is possible to translate it as well 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.960
 so I would put you a link 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.240
 definitely who will lead you the forum 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.380
 with with translation etc 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.759
 so 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.039
 firstly, if you need it 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.780
 chests so I'm going to put some 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.899
 4 because I have four steaks will put 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.799
 sales in quotation marks so here we have 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.390
 a there then he will have to remove his 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.110
 keynote 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.110
 otherwise it will not do it 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.660
 so 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.640
 because it's still you're going to do 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.470
 a go break the cap so no 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.440
 question of facilitating it between 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.990
 quotation marks so we will take a steak 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.700
 the example of 64 here so you take the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.369
 themes in hand of course 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.490
 left click so there's France 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.200
 mom will be translated if you take my 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.390
 book translation file so there in 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.890
 does he ask the price per piece of 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.930
 the item so we'll put 5 dollars here 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.840
 up and that puts you in it 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.550
 then you right click to 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.360
 get in and you put your 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.830
 stack in I will also tell you that 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.690
 you need money because in 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.050
 done in these configurations you go 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.910
 see that with each shock created he goes 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.190
 ask you for example to put 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.810
 pay a price so for example if me 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.790
 I put two it can be $ 10 to $ 10 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.790
 by default we seem to have I put two of 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.220
 the tree you can see your money if 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.870
 you are deaf to economics by doing 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.830
 launay So there I 926 I 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.510
 will you go back for the others 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.690
 items like that you have good in my 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.890
 head so do a left click 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.250
 I want to enter the cat of you 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.110
 put the amount of which 25 dollars that 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.010
 puts you and if you fill the stock 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.110
 so here you go do not ringo paul 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.290
 remain so I take 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:19.520
 cactus a left click I lead my time 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.290
 I'm hunter here I fill the steak 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.190
 so 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.500
 here 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.150
 here like this left click we can really 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.709
 put all the minecraft items back on 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.990
 even I think swords and children 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:37.220
 teixeira am not sure what I 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:39.560
 say I told you that I think it 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.170
 is possible to do it 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.980
 so here are now even stalls 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.110
 are fulfilled and I want to buy so 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.680
 so I'm going to buy here the astien 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.690
 broken bricks 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.400
 so I left click the panel 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.560
 for even under the kop I think it 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.220
 would walk well that tells me the 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:03.230
 information so that a steak of 64 that 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.209
 it is also the name of eddie such excesses 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.019
 five of their pieces so here you have 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.250
 five dollars each 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.940
 and that if you buy milk 64.7 in 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.510
 broken bricks 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:19.160
 it's up to you to 322 art so I 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:21.799
 will buy it 5 to 5 $ it's 5 to 5 25 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.060
 and that's so it took me out and 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.070
 I have 5 4 in my inventory 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.740
 so it's the same for the rest as if 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.740
 we were very big change so 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.410
 left click on the 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.850
 we train you parts that you 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.140
 so I want to buy two since 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.170
 it's like that when from their room 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.270
 this is a way dollars so I 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.180
 think that 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.340
 it's simple for everyone so we 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.510
 is all your server on everything 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.140
 case except for languages ​​which is not this 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.090
 not and then come join us either from 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.470
 facebook and twitter there are some 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.560
 theories also they come out so 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.330
 and so I hope it is rather 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.830
 you will have more blue inches if you are 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.970
 arrived until there seems that it has you 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.970
 more and so at the next
