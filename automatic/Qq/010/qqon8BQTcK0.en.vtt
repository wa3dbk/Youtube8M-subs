how<00:02:57.320> messy<00:02:57.800> it<00:02:57.830> all<00:02:58.130> looks<00:02:58.610> because<00:02:58.850> you're

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
how messy it all looks because you're

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.480 
how messy it all looks because you're
going<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.180> be<00:02:59.330> erasing<00:02:59.870> all<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.350> extra<00:03:01.100> pencil

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
going to be erasing all the extra pencil

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:11.400 
going to be erasing all the extra pencil
lines<00:03:01.670> when<00:03:01.910> you're<00:03:02.000> done

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.710 

and<00:03:12.410> it<00:03:12.740> if<00:03:12.920> you<00:03:13.040> feel<00:03:13.580> like<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.180> want<00:03:14.390> to<00:03:14.480> draw

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
and it if you feel like you want to draw

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
the line a little bit differently than

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.460 
the line a little bit differently than
when<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:16.820> first<00:03:17.120> drew<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.840> in<00:03:17.990> with<00:03:18.140> a<00:03:18.170> pencil

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
when you first drew it in with a pencil

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.320 
when you first drew it in with a pencil
that's<00:03:18.830> okay<00:03:19.220> too<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.610> go<00:03:19.790> with<00:03:19.970> your<00:03:20.120> gut

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.560 
that's okay too you go with your gut
instincts<00:03:22.990> sometimes<00:03:23.990> the<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:26.060> just<00:03:26.210> realize

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
instincts sometimes the you just realize

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.310 
instincts sometimes the you just realize
after<00:03:26.930> looking<00:03:27.260> at<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.470> then<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:29.870> looks<00:03:30.080> better

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
after looking at it then it looks better

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.950 
after looking at it then it looks better
with<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.620> different<00:03:31.010> line<00:03:34.300> time<00:03:35.300> to<00:03:35.510> outline

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
with a different line time to outline

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.750 
with a different line time to outline
the<00:03:36.110> eyes<00:03:38.800> and<00:03:39.800> while<00:03:40.310> you're<00:03:40.490> doing<00:03:40.730> your

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
the eyes and while you're doing your

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.840

outlining keep your wrist nice and loose

00:03:45.850 --> 00:04:00.480 
outlining keep your wrist nice and loose
that'll<00:03:46.850> help<00:03:47.030> you<00:03:47.330> have<00:03:47.480> a<00:03:47.510> smoother<00:03:48.080> outline

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.370 

is<00:04:01.030> that<00:04:01.270> and<00:04:01.450> as<00:04:01.570> you<00:04:01.720> can<00:04:01.840> see<00:04:01.900> there<00:04:02.320> are

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
is that and as you can see there are

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.780 
is that and as you can see there are
plenty<00:04:02.530> of<00:04:02.740> times<00:04:03.010> where<00:04:03.250> I<00:04:03.310> make<00:04:03.520> choices

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
plenty of times where I make choices

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.580 
plenty of times where I make choices
like<00:04:04.270> here<00:04:04.480> on<00:04:04.600> the<00:04:04.690> whiskers<00:04:05.080> I<00:04:05.170> don't<00:04:05.350> follow

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
like here on the whiskers I don't follow

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.320 
like here on the whiskers I don't follow
those<00:04:05.800> pencil<00:04:06.220> lines<00:04:06.400> absolutely<00:04:06.910> perfect

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
those pencil lines absolutely perfect

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.510 
those pencil lines absolutely perfect
when<00:04:07.480> I<00:04:07.510> do<00:04:07.630> my<00:04:07.870> final<00:04:08.140> outline<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:08.920> that's

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
when I do my final outline and that's

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:19.680 
when I do my final outline and that's
perfectly<00:04:10.090> okay<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:17.760> now<00:04:18.760> that<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.330> kitty

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
perfectly okay and now that the kitty

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.690 
perfectly okay and now that the kitty
cat<00:04:19.870> has<00:04:20.080> been<00:04:20.410> outlined<00:04:20.980> it's<00:04:21.190> time<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.520> erase

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
cat has been outlined it's time to erase

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.670 
cat has been outlined it's time to erase
all<00:04:21.880> those<00:04:21.970> extra<00:04:22.330> pencil<00:04:22.720> lines<00:04:22.990> you<00:04:23.470> can<00:04:23.650> use

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
all those extra pencil lines you can use

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.880 
all those extra pencil lines you can use
a<00:04:23.830> kneaded<00:04:24.310> eraser<00:04:24.400> or<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.330> can<00:04:25.480> use<00:04:25.720> a<00:04:25.890> pink

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
a kneaded eraser or you can use a pink

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.340 
a kneaded eraser or you can use a pink
eraser<00:04:27.430> I<00:04:27.760> usually<00:04:28.510> like<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.780> kneaded<00:04:29.050> eraser

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
eraser I usually like the kneaded eraser

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.390 
eraser I usually like the kneaded eraser
because<00:04:29.410> they're<00:04:29.590> stretchy<00:04:29.920> and<00:04:30.250> they're

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
because they're stretchy and they're

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.330 
because they're stretchy and they're
very<00:04:30.520> easy<00:04:30.850> to<00:04:31.000> clean<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:31.600> they<00:04:31.660> don't<00:04:31.900> smudge

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
very easy to clean and they don't smudge

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:53.530 
very easy to clean and they don't smudge
so<00:04:33.340> time<00:04:33.760> to<00:04:33.880> erase<00:04:34.030> all<00:04:34.210> those<00:04:34.450> excess<00:04:34.960> lines

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.720 

and<00:04:54.440> as<00:04:54.530> you<00:04:54.740> can<00:04:54.890> see<00:04:55.130> it's<00:04:55.280> kind<00:04:55.490> of<00:04:55.520> like

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
and as you can see it's kind of like

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.300 
and as you can see it's kind of like
magic<00:04:56.030> when<00:04:56.540> you<00:04:56.570> get<00:04:56.810> rid<00:04:57.080> of<00:04:57.200> all<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.710> the

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
magic when you get rid of all the the

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.940 
magic when you get rid of all the the
gestural<00:04:59.410> strokes<00:05:00.610> you<00:05:01.610> can<00:05:01.640> really<00:05:02.240> see<00:05:02.950> your

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
gestural strokes you can really see your

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:15.440 
gestural strokes you can really see your
illustration<00:05:04.670> come<00:05:04.910> together

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.960 

next<00:05:16.290> it's<00:05:16.440> time<00:05:16.530> to<00:05:17.130> do<00:05:17.790> a<00:05:17.820> little

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
next it's time to do a little

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.280 
next it's time to do a little
embellishing<00:05:20.390> it's<00:05:21.390> good<00:05:21.570> to<00:05:21.750> fill<00:05:21.990> in<00:05:22.140> the

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
embellishing it's good to fill in the

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.880 
embellishing it's good to fill in the
pupils<00:05:22.860> of<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:23.280> eyes<00:05:23.460> with<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.240> solid<00:05:24.630> black

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.340 

it<00:05:28.890> will<00:05:29.550> make<00:05:29.820> your<00:05:30.150> cat<00:05:30.750> much<00:05:31.050> more

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350
