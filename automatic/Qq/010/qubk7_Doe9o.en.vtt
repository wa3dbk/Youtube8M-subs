has got some unity if the painting is to
work<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.200> painting<00:00:07.740> should<00:00:07.919> have<00:00:08.130> some<00:00:08.370> color

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
up there the flowers of where you we

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.359 
up there the flowers of where you we
were<00:00:14.040> using<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.490> reds<00:00:14.929> and<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.379> have<00:00:16.710> some<00:00:17.220> of

were using the reds and we have some of
the<00:00:17.400> same<00:00:17.550> kinds<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.539> colors<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.320> this

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
the same kinds of colors in this

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.950 
the same kinds of colors in this
foreground<00:00:22.340> piece<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.519> cloth<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.539> that

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
foreground piece of cloth that that

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.740 
foreground piece of cloth that that
forms<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:26.550> table<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.330> I'm<00:00:27.420> going<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.599> use

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
forms the the table so I'm going to use

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.720 
forms the the table so I'm going to use
the<00:00:27.960> same<00:00:28.170> read<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.650> had<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> flowers

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the same read that I had in the flowers

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.150 
the same read that I had in the flowers
and<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.119> want<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.420> start<00:00:30.689> putting<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.349> some<00:00:31.980> of

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
and I want to start putting in some of

and I want to start putting in some of
the<00:00:32.309> flower<00:00:32.579> patterns<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.960> are<00:00:34.020> down<00:00:34.350> here

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the flower patterns that are down here

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.580 
the flower patterns that are down here
and<00:00:35.160> right<00:00:35.790> up<00:00:35.969> here<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> front<00:00:36.719> right<00:00:37.410> at

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
and right up here in the front right at

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.209 
and right up here in the front right at
the<00:00:37.710> edge<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.280> where<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:39.860> where<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.070> cloth

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
the edge of where this where the cloth

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.790 
the edge of where this where the cloth
falls<00:00:44.219> there<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> large<00:00:45.809> red<00:00:46.350> rose<00:00:48.200> so<00:00:49.200> let's

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
falls there is a large red rose so let's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.439 
falls there is a large red rose so let's
go<00:00:50.039> ahead<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:51.230> use<00:00:52.230> our<00:00:52.559> red<00:00:55.910> into<00:00:56.910> our<00:00:57.090> row

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
go ahead and use our red into our row

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.959 
go ahead and use our red into our row
create<00:00:58.379> rose<00:00:59.449> shape<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:01.309> then<00:01:02.309> there's<00:01:02.640> a

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
create rose shape and then there's a

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
this one just the edge may be invisible

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.899 
this one just the edge may be invisible
and<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.439> couple<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.920> little<00:02:02.100> spots<00:02:02.460> here<00:02:02.880> and

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909

and a couple of little spots here and
there<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.570> there's<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.500> red<00:02:04.920> edge<00:02:05.310> around<00:02:05.670> that

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
there and there's a red edge around that

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.139 
there and there's a red edge around that
area<00:02:07.049> right<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.710> there<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:08.459> let's<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:08.970> go

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
area right in there so let's just go

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.809 
area right in there so let's just go
ahead<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:10.050> add<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:11.220> red<00:02:11.550> edge<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:14.190> some<00:02:14.670> of

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
ahead and add that red edge and some of

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.880 
ahead and add that red edge and some of
the<00:02:14.940> patterning<00:02:15.720> what<00:02:16.500> we're<00:02:16.739> seeing

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
the patterning what we're seeing

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.970 
the patterning what we're seeing
establish<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.459> that's<00:02:20.849> a<00:02:21.440> complex<00:02:22.440> form

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
establish that that's a complex form

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.500 
establish that that's a complex form
that's<00:02:23.970> got<00:02:24.330> some<00:02:24.720> interesting<00:02:25.530> shapes<00:02:26.510> some

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
that's got some interesting shapes some

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.690 
that's got some interesting shapes some
scrollwork<00:02:29.269> read<00:02:30.269> in<00:02:30.540> here<00:02:30.989> or<00:02:31.950> read<00:02:32.160> in<00:02:32.370> here

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
scrollwork read in here or read in here

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.520 
scrollwork read in here or read in here
there's<00:02:32.940> more<00:02:33.269> of<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.629> same<00:02:34.019> kind<00:02:34.349> of

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
there's more of that same kind of

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.220 
there's more of that same kind of
patterning<00:02:35.129> back<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.640> here<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.870> let's<00:02:37.110> just

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
patterning back in here so let's just

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.400 
patterning back in here so let's just
frame<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:38.099> up<00:02:38.129> and<00:02:39.050> we're<00:02:40.050> basically

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
frame that up and we're basically

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.790 
frame that up and we're basically
working<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:41.400> whole<00:02:41.640> painting<00:02:42.090> at<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.379> same

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
working the whole painting at the same

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.040 
working the whole painting at the same
time
