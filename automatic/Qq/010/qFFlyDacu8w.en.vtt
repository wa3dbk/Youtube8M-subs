I can start bringing in new fish into
the<00:00:24.359> display<00:00:24.720> tank<00:00:24.960> very<00:00:25.470> excited<00:00:27.140> so<00:00:28.140> what

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
the display tank very excited so what

with you guys my process for setting up

with you guys my process for setting up
a<00:00:34.350> quarantine<00:00:34.649> tank<00:00:35.329> adding<00:00:36.329> fish<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.860> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
a quarantine tank adding fish to it the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.950 
a quarantine tank adding fish to it the
process<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.579> my<00:00:38.850> quarantined<00:00:39.510> fish<00:00:39.719> go

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
process that my quarantined fish go

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.080 
process that my quarantined fish go
through<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.559> then<00:00:41.399> getting<00:00:41.640> them<00:00:41.790> into<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
through and then getting them into the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.810 
through and then getting them into the
display<00:00:42.570> tank<00:00:42.980> I'm<00:00:43.980> also<00:00:44.219> going<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.610> share

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
display tank I'm also going to share

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.569 
display tank I'm also going to share
with<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.800> my<00:00:47.030> experience<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.239> an<00:00:48.840> order

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
with you my experience with an order

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.250 
with you my experience with an order
fish<00:00:50.579> coming<00:00:51.120> from<00:00:51.239> an<00:00:51.390> online<00:00:51.539> vendor<00:00:52.079> that

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
fish coming from an online vendor that

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.779 
fish coming from an online vendor that
will<00:00:52.559> be<00:00:52.739> blue<00:00:53.039> zoo<00:00:53.190> aquatics

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
will be blue zoo aquatics

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.240 
will be blue zoo aquatics
I<00:00:53.930> know<00:00:54.930> I've<00:00:55.110> mentioned<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> past<00:00:55.980> I

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
I know I've mentioned it in the past I

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.860 
I know I've mentioned it in the past I
probably<00:00:56.520> wouldn't<00:00:57.030> order<00:00:57.300> fish<00:00:57.510> from<00:00:57.719> them

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
probably wouldn't order fish from them

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.360 
probably wouldn't order fish from them
again

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
again

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.790 
again
however<00:00:59.370> there<00:00:59.670> there<00:01:00.059> was<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.800> particularly

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
however there there was a particularly

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.450 
however there there was a particularly
excellent<00:01:02.609> deal<00:01:03.470> on<00:01:04.470> some<00:01:04.949> fish<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.189> I

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
excellent deal on some fish that I

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.840 
excellent deal on some fish that I
really<00:01:05.939> couldn't<00:01:06.240> pass<00:01:06.659> up<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:08.220> would<00:01:08.640> like

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
really couldn't pass up and I would like

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.450 
really couldn't pass up and I would like
to<00:01:09.119> put<00:01:09.479> my<00:01:09.600> new<00:01:09.900> disciplined<00:01:10.830> approach<00:01:11.010> to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
to put my new disciplined approach to

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.030 
to put my new disciplined approach to
quarantine<00:01:11.900> to<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> test<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.409> these<00:01:13.530> fish<00:01:13.830> so

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
quarantine to the test on these fish so

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.499 
quarantine to the test on these fish so
I<00:01:14.070> thought<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.430> would<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> good<00:01:15.240> chance

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
I thought that would be a good chance

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.330 
I thought that would be a good chance
for<00:01:15.659> me<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.900> do<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.439> starting<00:01:17.189> off<00:01:17.280> with

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
for me to do that so starting off with

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.660 
for me to do that so starting off with
the<00:01:17.790> components<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.450> quarantine<00:01:18.960> tank<00:01:19.670> I've

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the components of a quarantine tank I've

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.640 
the components of a quarantine tank I've
got<00:01:21.290> a<00:01:23.240> filter<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.600> very<00:01:24.960> much<00:01:25.110> overkill

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
got a filter that is very much overkill

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.390 
got a filter that is very much overkill
in<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.250> aqua<00:01:26.700> clear<00:01:26.850> 110<00:01:27.829> it's<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.950> hang<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
in the aqua clear 110 it's a hang on the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.530 
in the aqua clear 110 it's a hang on the
back<00:01:29.549> filter<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.500> chose<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.710> filter<00:01:32.540> for

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
back filter I chose this filter for

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.920 
back filter I chose this filter for
three<00:01:33.689> reasons<00:01:34.159> one<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.450> very<00:01:36.479> flexible

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
three reasons one is it is very flexible

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.870 
three reasons one is it is very flexible
so<00:01:37.380> what<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.829> mean<00:01:38.070> by<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.700> offers

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
so what I mean by that is that it offers

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.889 
so what I mean by that is that it offers
chemical<00:01:40.280> biological<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:42.030> mechanical

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
chemical biological and mechanical

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.289 
chemical biological and mechanical
filtration<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.079> very<00:01:46.079> quiet<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:47.149> it<00:01:48.149> is

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
filtration it is very quiet and it is

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.289 
filtration it is very quiet and it is
very<00:01:48.540> highly<00:01:48.869> reviewed<00:01:49.729> against<00:01:50.729> other<00:01:50.970> hang

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
very highly reviewed against other hang

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.109 
very highly reviewed against other hang
on<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> back<00:01:51.630> filters<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:53.490> those<00:01:53.880> are<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
on the back filters so those are the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.550 
on the back filters so those are the
three<00:01:54.270> things<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.570> were<00:01:54.750> pretty<00:01:55.110> important

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
three things that were pretty important

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.389 
three things that were pretty important
to<00:01:55.649> me<00:01:56.030> when<00:01:57.030> looking<00:01:57.600> around<00:01:57.719> at<00:01:58.399> filtration

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
to me when looking around at filtration

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.560 
to me when looking around at filtration
options<00:01:59.790> for<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:01.579> quarantine<00:02:02.579> tank

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
options for a quarantine tank

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.640 
options for a quarantine tank
the<00:02:04.170> tank<00:02:04.380> itself<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:05.100> 30<00:02:05.610> gallons<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:07.350> as<00:02:07.560> I

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
the tank itself is 30 gallons and as I

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.710 
the tank itself is 30 gallons and as I
said<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:08.100> filter<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.790> definitely<00:02:09.240> overkill

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
said this filter is definitely overkill

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.170

lights I really wanted the lid more than
anything<00:02:55.560> else<00:02:55.940> it's<00:02:56.940> just<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.209> nice<00:02:57.390> added

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
anything else it's just a nice added

anything else it's just a nice added
bonus<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.530> lights<00:02:58.739> come<00:02:58.980> with<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.310> I

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
bonus that the lights come with it I

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.170 
bonus that the lights come with it I
also<00:03:00.510> have<00:03:00.750> my<00:03:01.040> PVC<00:03:02.040> piping<00:03:02.400> here<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.880> a

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
also have my PVC piping here and a

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.180 
also have my PVC piping here and a
little<00:03:03.420> bit<00:03:03.540> of<00:03:03.630> dead<00:03:03.810> Rock<00:03:04.050> just<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.010> give<00:03:05.160> it

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
little bit of dead Rock just to give it

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.850 
little bit of dead Rock just to give it
a<00:03:05.340> bit<00:03:05.489> more<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.850> natural<00:03:06.270> feel<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.860> that's

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
a bit more of a natural feel and that's

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.650 
a bit more of a natural feel and that's
basically<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.519> that's<00:03:08.640> all<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.120> components

basically it that's all the components
that<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.780> have<00:03:10.110> for<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.830> quarantine<00:03:11.310> tank<00:03:11.580> so

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
that I have for the quarantine tank so

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.120 
that I have for the quarantine tank so
I'm<00:03:12.630> going<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.900> get<00:03:13.019> these<00:03:13.140> guys<00:03:13.410> set<00:03:13.739> up<00:03:13.890> and

I'm going to get these guys set up and

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.060 
I'm going to get these guys set up and
I'm<00:03:14.730> gonna<00:03:15.019> go<00:03:16.019> through<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.320> process<00:03:16.709> of<00:03:16.830> how

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
I'm gonna go through the process of how

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.680 
I'm gonna go through the process of how
I<00:03:17.100> set<00:03:17.580> up<00:03:17.610> my<00:03:17.730> quarantine<00:03:18.269> tank<00:03:18.390> with<00:03:18.600> you

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
I set up my quarantine tank with you

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.590 
I set up my quarantine tank with you
guys<00:03:18.840> in<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.140> next<00:03:19.260> video<00:03:20.000> okay<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:21.030> here<00:03:21.480> we

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
guys in the next video okay so here we

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.110 
guys in the next video okay so here we
are<00:03:21.630> at<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.200> main<00:03:22.440> display<00:03:22.860> tank<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.820> one<00:03:24.000> I'm

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
are at the main display tank the one I'm

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.440 
are at the main display tank the one I'm
doing<00:03:24.269> here<00:03:24.570> is<00:03:24.630> I'm<00:03:24.870> filling<00:03:25.709> up<00:03:25.799> buckets

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
doing here is I'm filling up buckets

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.840 
doing here is I'm filling up buckets
with<00:03:27.450> water<00:03:27.480> from<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.200> display<00:03:28.500> tank<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:29.400> put

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
with water from the display tank to put

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.020 
with water from the display tank to put
into<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.480> quarantine<00:03:30.930> tank<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:32.670> reason<00:03:32.910> why

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
into the quarantine tank the reason why

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.630 
into the quarantine tank the reason why
I'm<00:03:33.120> doing<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.840> because<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:34.769> want<00:03:35.489> the

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
I'm doing that is because I want the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.560 
I'm doing that is because I want the
fish<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:35.910> be<00:03:36.450> in<00:03:36.680> good<00:03:37.680> water<00:03:37.980> its<00:03:38.880> nutrient

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
fish to be in good water its nutrient

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.880 
fish to be in good water its nutrient
rich<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:41.480> when<00:03:42.480> I<00:03:42.510> move<00:03:42.930> them<00:03:43.110> over<00:03:43.320> into<00:03:43.680> the

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
rich and when I move them over into the

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.220 
rich and when I move them over into the
main<00:03:44.070> display<00:03:44.310> tank<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:45.480> will<00:03:45.750> make<00:03:45.959> that

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
main display tank it will make that

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.120 
main display tank it will make that
process<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:47.250> lot<00:03:47.880> less<00:03:48.090> stressful<00:03:48.450> for<00:03:48.900> them

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
process a lot less stressful for them

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.990 
process a lot less stressful for them
it's<00:03:50.130> already<00:03:50.400> going<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.610> be<00:03:50.700> stressful

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
it's already going to be stressful

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.990 
it's already going to be stressful
enough<00:03:51.390> for<00:03:51.660> them<00:03:51.840> being<00:03:52.830> taken<00:03:53.370> from<00:03:53.549> one

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
enough for them being taken from one

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.250 
enough for them being taken from one
environment<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.690> thrown<00:03:54.989> into<00:03:55.140> another

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.410

with<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:57.989> hierarchy<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.680> fish<00:03:59.120> as<00:04:00.120> well

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
with the hierarchy of the fish as well

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.390 
with the hierarchy of the fish as well
as<00:04:00.570> having<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.930> deal<00:04:01.140> with<00:04:01.170> you<00:04:01.799> know<00:04:01.950> the

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
as having to deal with you know the

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.910 
as having to deal with you know the
water<00:04:02.610> chemistry<00:04:02.880> so<00:04:03.450> this<00:04:04.080> way<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.290> take<00:04:04.709> away

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
water chemistry so this way I take away

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.310 
water chemistry so this way I take away
a<00:04:05.040> large<00:04:05.340> portion<00:04:05.850> of<00:04:05.940> that<00:04:06.000> stress<00:04:06.989> on<00:04:07.200> the

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
a large portion of that stress on the

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.410 
a large portion of that stress on the
fish<00:04:07.560> so<00:04:08.370> that<00:04:08.519> they<00:04:08.610> don't<00:04:08.820> have<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.209> deal

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
fish so that they don't have to deal

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.690 
fish so that they don't have to deal
with<00:04:09.450> that<00:04:09.810> physical<00:04:10.769> change<00:04:11.070> to<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.489> water

so<00:04:13.590> that's<00:04:13.769> what<00:04:13.920> I'll<00:04:14.040> be<00:04:14.069> doing<00:04:14.159> for<00:04:14.640> here

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
so that's what I'll be doing for here

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.939 
so that's what I'll be doing for here
let's<00:04:15.569> go<00:04:15.750> ahead<00:04:15.959> upstairs<00:04:16.229> and<00:04:16.620> we'll<00:04:16.739> go<00:04:16.889> to

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
let's go ahead upstairs and we'll go to

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.300 
let's go ahead upstairs and we'll go to
the<00:04:17.160> quarantine<00:04:17.459> time<00:04:17.760> now<00:04:18.799> all<00:04:19.799> right<00:04:20.070> so<00:04:20.130> now

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
the quarantine time now all right so now

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.770 
the quarantine time now all right so now
we're<00:04:20.549> back<00:04:20.579> at<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:20.940> quarantine<00:04:21.239> tank<00:04:21.540> as<00:04:21.720> you

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
we're back at the quarantine tank as you

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.900 
we're back at the quarantine tank as you
can<00:04:22.049> see<00:04:22.260> it's<00:04:22.380> now<00:04:22.590> completely<00:04:22.949> filled<00:04:23.610> and

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
can see it's now completely filled and

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.810 
can see it's now completely filled and
I've<00:04:24.690> also<00:04:24.900> added<00:04:25.080> an<00:04:25.590> air<00:04:25.889> stone<00:04:26.220> as<00:04:26.430> well<00:04:26.639> to

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
I've also added an air stone as well to

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.210 
I've also added an air stone as well to
the<00:04:26.910> tank<00:04:27.180> just<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.750> keep<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:28.080> water

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
the tank just to keep the water

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.879 
the tank just to keep the water
oxygenated<00:04:29.479> some<00:04:30.479> people<00:04:30.780> might<00:04:31.680> consider

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
oxygenated some people might consider

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.100 
oxygenated some people might consider
using<00:04:32.250> an<00:04:32.490> air<00:04:32.669> stone<00:04:32.880> when<00:04:33.060> they<00:04:33.210> have<00:04:33.419> maybe

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
using an air stone when they have maybe

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.290 
using an air stone when they have maybe
weak<00:04:34.530> filtration<00:04:35.280> within<00:04:35.669> their<00:04:35.820> quarantine

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
weak filtration within their quarantine

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.250 
weak filtration within their quarantine
tank<00:04:36.539> as<00:04:36.840> well<00:04:37.460> along<00:04:38.460> with<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.669> sponge<00:04:39.110> but<00:04:40.110> in

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
tank as well along with a sponge but in

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.050 
tank as well along with a sponge but in
this<00:04:40.380> case<00:04:40.620> I'm<00:04:40.860> just<00:04:41.070> using<00:04:41.280> it<00:04:41.490> purely<00:04:41.789> for

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
this case I'm just using it purely for

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.670 
this case I'm just using it purely for
oxygenation<00:04:42.720> purposes<00:04:44.300> now<00:04:45.560> everything<00:04:46.560> is

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
oxygenation purposes now everything is

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.610 
oxygenation purposes now everything is
done<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.910> only<00:04:48.060> thing<00:04:48.180> left<00:04:48.449> to<00:04:48.600> do<00:04:48.810> is<00:04:49.110> for<00:04:49.500> me

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
done the only thing left to do is for me

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.189 
done the only thing left to do is for me
to<00:04:49.800> set<00:04:50.100> up<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.460> aqua<00:04:51.300> clear<00:04:51.419> filter<00:04:51.870> and

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
to set up the aqua clear filter and

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.040 
to set up the aqua clear filter and
we're<00:04:53.039> gonna<00:04:53.130> have<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.370> look<00:04:53.550> at<00:04:53.699> it<00:04:53.820> here<00:04:54.090> as

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
we're gonna have a look at it here as

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.480 
we're gonna have a look at it here as
you<00:04:55.260> can<00:04:55.320> see<00:04:55.410> it's<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.740> pretty<00:04:55.860> good<00:04:56.190> sized

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
you can see it's a pretty good sized

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.020 
you can see it's a pretty good sized
filter<00:04:57.260> and<00:04:58.260> what<00:04:59.190> it's<00:04:59.340> going<00:04:59.520> to<00:04:59.580> contain

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
filter and what it's going to contain

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
filter and what it's going to contain
here<00:05:00.360> is<00:05:00.479> a<00:05:00.510> media<00:05:00.870> basket<00:05:01.380> and<00:05:02.539> the<00:05:03.539> media

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
have for the last two months then

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.580 
have for the last two months then
storing<00:05:21.590> two<00:05:22.340> sets<00:05:22.700> of<00:05:22.970> foam<00:05:23.480> inserts<00:05:23.960> and<00:05:24.230> two

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
storing two sets of foam inserts and two

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.170 
storing two sets of foam inserts and two
sets<00:05:24.890> of<00:05:25.040> the<00:05:25.640> bio<00:05:26.480> max<00:05:26.870> ceramic<00:05:27.650> media<00:05:28.180> this

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
sets of the bio max ceramic media this

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.760 
sets of the bio max ceramic media this
has<00:05:29.330> been<00:05:29.510> in<00:05:29.690> here<00:05:29.990> to<00:05:30.680> basically<00:05:30.890> build<00:05:31.400> up<00:05:31.730> a

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
has been in here to basically build up a

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.530 
has been in here to basically build up a
colony<00:05:33.770> of<00:05:33.800> nitrifying<00:05:34.490> bacteria<00:05:34.520> that<00:05:35.240> I<00:05:35.330> can

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
colony of nitrifying bacteria that I can

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.930 
colony of nitrifying bacteria that I can
then<00:05:35.690> take<00:05:35.930> out<00:05:36.170> of<00:05:36.230> here<00:05:36.680> and<00:05:36.890> put<00:05:37.220> directly

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
then take out of here and put directly

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.940 
then take out of here and put directly
into<00:05:38.270> the<00:05:38.540> quarantine<00:05:38.900> tank<00:05:39.200> and<00:05:39.650> that's

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
into the quarantine tank and that's

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.240 
into the quarantine tank and that's
going<00:05:40.130> to<00:05:40.250> greatly<00:05:40.640> reduce<00:05:41.390> the<00:05:42.010> cycling<00:05:43.010> time

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
going to greatly reduce the cycling time

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.570 
going to greatly reduce the cycling time
if<00:05:43.520> any<00:05:43.940> on<00:05:44.600> that<00:05:44.860> quarantine<00:05:45.860> tank<00:05:46.130> so<00:05:46.490> I'm

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
if any on that quarantine tank so I'm

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.650 
if any on that quarantine tank so I'm
going<00:05:46.760> to<00:05:46.790> pull<00:05:47.000> these<00:05:47.120> out<00:05:47.240> of<00:05:47.390> here<00:05:47.570> we're

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
going to pull these out of here we're

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.880 
going to pull these out of here we're
going<00:05:47.780> to<00:05:47.840> put<00:05:47.990> them<00:05:48.080> in<00:05:48.170> the<00:05:48.260> tank<00:05:48.440> upstairs

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
going to put them in the tank upstairs

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.650 
going to put them in the tank upstairs
and<00:05:49.220> then<00:05:49.910> we're<00:05:50.090> going<00:05:50.210> to<00:05:50.270> be<00:05:50.360> good<00:05:50.510> to<00:05:50.630> go

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
and then we're going to be good to go

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.210 
and then we're going to be good to go
okay<00:05:52.360> so<00:05:53.360> we've<00:05:53.570> got<00:05:53.600> the<00:05:54.020> sponge<00:05:54.500> and<00:05:54.770> the<00:05:54.980> bio

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
okay so we've got the sponge and the bio

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.760 
okay so we've got the sponge and the bio
max<00:05:55.490> media<00:05:55.850> up<00:05:56.000> here<00:05:56.240> the<00:05:56.930> sponge<00:05:57.230> just<00:05:57.560> sits

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
max media up here the sponge just sits

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.190 
max media up here the sponge just sits
in<00:05:57.890> this<00:05:58.070> media<00:05:58.400> basket<00:05:58.970> and<00:05:59.210> then<00:05:59.810> it<00:05:59.960> very

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
in this media basket and then it very

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.120 
in this media basket and then it very
simply<00:06:00.620> just<00:06:01.250> slots<00:06:01.610> into<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:03.110> filter<00:06:03.590> like

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
simply just slots into the filter like

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.100 
simply just slots into the filter like
so<00:06:05.320> it's<00:06:06.320> nice<00:06:06.530> and<00:06:06.560> snug<00:06:07.100> and<00:06:07.900> then<00:06:08.900> we're

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
so it's nice and snug and then we're

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
so it's nice and snug and then we're
gonna<00:06:09.200> take<00:06:09.560> the<00:06:09.910> fire<00:06:10.910> max<00:06:11.710> then<00:06:12.710> a<00:06:12.740> bit<00:06:12.980> of<00:06:13.070> a

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
gonna take the fire max then a bit of a

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.210 
gonna take the fire max then a bit of a
shake<00:06:14.110> and<00:06:15.110> just<00:06:15.290> drop<00:06:15.620> them<00:06:15.770> in<00:06:15.890> the<00:06:16.010> top

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
shake and just drop them in the top

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.190 
shake and just drop them in the top
there<00:06:17.560> and<00:06:18.560> then<00:06:18.770> last<00:06:19.100> but<00:06:19.190> not<00:06:19.400> the<00:06:19.460> least

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
there and then last but not the least

there and then last but not the least
the<00:06:21.200> lid<00:06:21.380> goes<00:06:21.590> on<00:06:22.780> there<00:06:23.780> we<00:06:23.870> go

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
the lid goes on there we go

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.950 
the lid goes on there we go
so<00:06:25.340> that<00:06:26.180> is<00:06:26.450> in<00:06:27.320> a<00:06:27.440> nutshell<00:06:27.650> the<00:06:28.340> tank<00:06:28.960> setup

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
so that is in a nutshell the tank setup

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.050 
so that is in a nutshell the tank setup
so<00:06:30.290> I'm<00:06:30.350> gonna<00:06:30.470> go<00:06:30.650> ahead<00:06:30.710> and<00:06:30.830> power<00:06:31.040> it<00:06:31.100> on

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.340 

this<00:06:35.060> is<00:06:35.120> my<00:06:35.300> first<00:06:35.630> time<00:06:35.810> turning<00:06:36.110> on<00:06:36.260> the

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
this is my first time turning on the

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.810 
this is my first time turning on the
aqua<00:06:36.620> clear<00:06:36.740> so<00:06:36.950> I'll<00:06:37.010> be<00:06:37.130> curious<00:06:37.370> to<00:06:37.490> see<00:06:37.550> how

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
aqua clear so I'll be curious to see how

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:49.960 
aqua clear so I'll be curious to see how
quiet<00:06:38.210> or<00:06:38.420> loud<00:06:38.450> it<00:06:38.810> is

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.440 

it's<00:06:50.450> actually<00:06:50.810> pretty<00:06:51.020> reasonable<00:06:52.450> all

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:53.450 
it's actually pretty reasonable all

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.030 
it's actually pretty reasonable all
right<00:06:53.600> so<00:06:55.120> I've<00:06:56.120> got<00:06:56.360> the<00:06:56.510> heaters<00:06:56.930> turned<00:06:57.860> on

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.040 
right so I've got the heaters turned on

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.510 
right so I've got the heaters turned on
that's<00:06:58.820> set<00:06:59.120> to<00:06:59.330> 79<00:06:59.900> degrees<00:07:00.200> I've<00:07:00.710> also<00:07:01.160> added

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
that's set to 79 degrees I've also added

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.640 
that's set to 79 degrees I've also added
an<00:07:01.910> airstone<00:07:02.480> as<00:07:02.690> you<00:07:02.810> can<00:07:02.990> see<00:07:03.200> here<00:07:03.470> that's

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650 
an airstone as you can see here that's

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.180 
an airstone as you can see here that's
going<00:07:03.890> to<00:07:03.980> oxygenate<00:07:04.700> the<00:07:04.760> water<00:07:06.160> we've<00:07:07.160> got

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.190 
going to oxygenate the water we've got

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.660 
going to oxygenate the water we've got
the<00:07:07.670> wave<00:07:08.240> maker<00:07:08.560> and<00:07:09.560> then<00:07:09.710> we've<00:07:09.890> got<00:07:10.100> PVC

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:10.670 
the wave maker and then we've got PVC

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.120 
the wave maker and then we've got PVC
piping<00:07:11.150> and<00:07:11.420> some<00:07:12.110> dead<00:07:12.320> Rock<00:07:12.560> not<00:07:12.800> too<00:07:12.980> much

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.130 
piping and some dead Rock not too much

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.130 
piping and some dead Rock not too much
dead<00:07:13.340> Rock<00:07:13.520> just<00:07:14.360> enough<00:07:14.600> to<00:07:14.720> make<00:07:14.870> the<00:07:14.960> fish

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.140 
dead Rock just enough to make the fish

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.950 
dead Rock just enough to make the fish

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:21.950 
I'm going to start doing some testing on

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.000 
I'm going to start doing some testing on
the<00:07:22.070> water<00:07:22.220> we're<00:07:22.520> going<00:07:22.610> to<00:07:22.730> test<00:07:22.960> the<00:07:24.010> basics

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.010 
the water we're going to test the basics

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.920 
the water we're going to test the basics
which<00:07:25.280> are<00:07:25.460> ammonia<00:07:25.940> nitrite<00:07:26.660> and<00:07:26.900> nitrate

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:26.930 
which are ammonia nitrite and nitrate

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.950 
which are ammonia nitrite and nitrate
and<00:07:27.760> then<00:07:28.760> we'll<00:07:29.000> be<00:07:29.090> back<00:07:29.120> to<00:07:29.450> add<00:07:29.570> some<00:07:29.750> fish

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 
and then we'll be back to add some fish

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.490 
and then we'll be back to add some fish
so<00:07:30.650> see<00:07:31.040> you<00:07:31.130> again<00:07:31.310> soon
