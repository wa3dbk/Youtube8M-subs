eukaryotic<00:00:03.750> cells<00:00:04.200> are<00:00:04.319> one<00:00:04.470> of<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.620> two

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
eukaryotic cells are one of the two

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.909 
eukaryotic cells are one of the two
major<00:00:05.160> kinds<00:00:05.609> of<00:00:05.850> cells<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:07.529> world<00:00:07.740> of

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
major kinds of cells in the world of

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.129 
major kinds of cells in the world of
biology<00:00:08.040> now<00:00:09.030> their<00:00:09.179> name<00:00:09.389> actually<00:00:09.660> gives

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
biology now their name actually gives

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.610 
biology now their name actually gives
you<00:00:10.290> their<00:00:10.469> key<00:00:11.690> characteristic<00:00:12.690> because<00:00:13.200> you

and<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.580> ties<00:00:17.880> into<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.510> basic

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
and that ties into the basic

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.230 
and that ties into the basic
characteristic<00:00:20.039> volume<00:00:20.490> carry<00:00:20.730> out<00:00:20.880> excels

characteristic volume carry out excels

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.929 
characteristic volume carry out excels
is<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.900> they<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.590> organelle<00:00:23.519> within

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
is that they have in organelle within

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.670 
is that they have in organelle within
the<00:00:24.119> cell<00:00:24.300> itself<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:25.170> has<00:00:25.350> its<00:00:25.529> own

to<00:00:48.809> wrap<00:00:49.110> those<00:00:49.800> DNA<00:00:50.190> molecules<00:00:50.640> around

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
to wrap those DNA molecules around

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.880 
to wrap those DNA molecules around
specialized<00:00:51.480> proteins<00:00:51.989> called<00:00:52.199> histones<00:00:52.289> and

cells and the answer would be centrioles

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.639 
cells and the answer would be centrioles
now<00:01:57.659> I'm<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.020> let<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.469> one<00:01:58.619> of

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
now I'm going to let you in on one of

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.499 
now I'm going to let you in on one of
the<00:01:58.770> trick<00:01:58.979> questions<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.939> trick<00:02:00.210> question

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
the trick questions the trick question

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.719 
the trick questions the trick question
is<00:02:00.659> they'll<00:02:01.320> also<00:02:01.710> include<00:02:02.070> an<00:02:02.219> option<00:02:02.369> where

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
is they'll also include an option where

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.240 
is they'll also include an option where
you<00:02:02.759> can<00:02:02.969> choose<00:02:03.180> centrioles<00:02:03.840> and

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
you can choose centrioles and

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.649 
you can choose centrioles and
mitochondria<00:02:05.250> because<00:02:05.759> most<00:02:06.000> kids<00:02:06.240> know<00:02:06.329> that

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
mitochondria because most kids know that

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.630 
mitochondria because most kids know that
plants<00:02:07.170> do<00:02:07.350> photosynthesis<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.489> course

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
plants do photosynthesis so of course

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.889 
plants do photosynthesis so of course
they're<00:02:08.819> going<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:08.970> be<00:02:09.030> using<00:02:09.270> chloroplasts

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
they're going to be using chloroplasts

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.990 
they're going to be using chloroplasts
imp<00:02:10.739> animal<00:02:11.310> cells<00:02:11.520> break<00:02:12.150> down

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
imp animal cells break down

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.450 
imp animal cells break down
sugar<00:02:13.690> from<00:02:14.020> photosynthesis<00:02:15.010> in<00:02:15.160> order<00:02:15.370> to

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
sugar from photosynthesis in order to

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.620 
sugar from photosynthesis in order to
get<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.670> energy<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:16.090> that's<00:02:16.240> done<00:02:16.450> by<00:02:16.480> the

true<00:02:23.200> if<00:02:23.560> we<00:02:23.650> take<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.860> look<00:02:24.070> at<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:24.340> plant

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
true if we take a look at this plant

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.090 
true if we take a look at this plant
cell<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.330> can<00:02:25.450> see<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:25.840> has<00:02:26.080> mitochondria<00:02:26.800> why

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
cell you can see it has mitochondria why

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.280 
cell you can see it has mitochondria why
because<00:02:27.730> just<00:02:28.270> like<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.570> it<00:02:28.840> wants<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.140> get

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
because just like you it wants to get

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.020 
because just like you it wants to get
the<00:02:29.440> energy<00:02:29.770> that's<00:02:29.920> in<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.100> sugar<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.640> came

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
the energy that's in the sugar that came

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.070 
the energy that's in the sugar that came
from<00:02:31.180> photosynthesis

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
from photosynthesis

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.650 
from photosynthesis
now<00:02:32.470> photosynthesis<00:02:33.310> it's<00:02:33.550> done<00:02:34.150> by<00:02:34.420> that

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
now photosynthesis it's done by that

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.390 
now photosynthesis it's done by that
cell<00:02:34.990> there<00:02:35.290> are<00:02:35.530> sorry<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:36.010> organelle

there<00:02:36.640> called<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.060> chloroplast<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:38.260> can

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
there called the chloroplast and you can

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.900 
there called the chloroplast and you can
see<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.650> has<00:02:38.860> its<00:02:38.890> own<00:02:39.250> double<00:02:39.580> membrane

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
see it has its own double membrane

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.970 
see it has its own double membrane
around<00:02:40.210> it<00:02:40.390> just<00:02:40.540> like<00:02:41.020> the<00:02:41.230> mitochondria<00:02:41.800> has

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
around it just like the mitochondria has

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.790 
around it just like the mitochondria has
two<00:02:42.580> membranes<00:02:43.150> in<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.570> out<00:02:43.660> of<00:02:43.810> it<00:02:43.930> now

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
two membranes in and out of it now

two membranes in and out of it now
something<00:02:45.340> else<00:02:45.490> that<00:02:45.670> makes<00:02:45.850> a<00:02:45.970> plant<00:02:46.240> cell

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
something else that makes a plant cell

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
different from an animal cell is that

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.699 
different from an animal cell is that
plant<00:02:48.850> cells<00:02:49.120> have<00:02:49.209> this<00:02:49.450> large<00:02:49.810> thick<00:02:50.290> cell

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
turgid and if the water in the water

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.390 
turgid and if the water in the water
vacuole<00:03:40.750> starts<00:03:41.320> to<00:03:41.440> leak<00:03:41.620> out<00:03:41.799> that's<00:03:42.130> when<00:03:42.370> a

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
vacuole starts to leak out that's when a

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.250 
vacuole starts to leak out that's when a
plant<00:03:42.670> cell<00:03:42.910> will<00:03:43.330> start<00:03:43.660> to<00:03:43.780> wilt<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:44.140> the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
plant cell will start to wilt and the

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.870 
plant cell will start to wilt and the
entire<00:03:44.500> plant<00:03:44.830> will<00:03:44.980> start<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.310> deflate<00:03:45.549> and

entire plant will start to deflate and
wilt<00:03:46.299> it<00:03:46.450> as<00:03:46.600> well<00:03:47.019> that's<00:03:47.920> eukaryotic<00:03:48.700> cells

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
wilt it as well that's eukaryotic cells

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.050 
wilt it as well that's eukaryotic cells
