00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:08.819 
today but the food heats up I mean I

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:11.570 
today but the food heats up I mean I
demonstrated<00:06:09.719> you<00:06:09.900> while<00:06:10.500> playing<00:06:11.009> it<00:06:11.189> and<00:06:11.370> I

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
demonstrated you while playing it and I

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.809 
demonstrated you while playing it and I
was<00:06:11.759> playing<00:06:12.000> it<00:06:12.180> for<00:06:12.780> around<00:06:13.229> 20<00:06:13.620> minutes<00:06:13.819> 15

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:14.819 
was playing it for around 20 minutes 15

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:17.570 
was playing it for around 20 minutes 15
20<00:06:15.060> minutes<00:06:15.330> beforehand<00:06:16.259> also<00:06:16.889> on<00:06:17.219> the<00:06:17.400> phone

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
20 minutes beforehand also on the phone

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.390 
20 minutes beforehand also on the phone
and<00:06:17.969> start<00:06:18.270> stealing<00:06:18.569> up<00:06:18.900> from<00:06:19.530> this<00:06:19.740> area<00:06:20.190> now

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
and start stealing up from this area now

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.059 
and start stealing up from this area now
the<00:06:21.090> back<00:06:21.300> plate<00:06:21.629> is<00:06:21.659> sealed<00:06:22.409> so<00:06:22.560> you<00:06:22.710> can't

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:23.069 
the back plate is sealed so you can't

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:28.399 
the back plate is sealed so you can't
also<00:06:23.849> remove<00:06:24.180> the<00:06:24.419> battery<00:06:26.900> the<00:06:27.900> heating<00:06:28.229> up

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
also remove the battery the heating up

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:31.760 
also remove the battery the heating up
causes<00:06:28.889> the<00:06:29.069> battery<00:06:29.520> drain<00:06:29.789> and<00:06:30.479> heavy<00:06:31.440> games

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
causes the battery drain and heavy games

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.029 
causes the battery drain and heavy games
are<00:06:32.250> not<00:06:33.090> so<00:06:33.449> good<00:06:33.690> for<00:06:34.050> the<00:06:34.199> battery<00:06:34.620> it's<00:06:34.740> got

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 
are not so good for the battery it's got

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:37.430 
are not so good for the battery it's got
a<00:06:35.069> 2600<00:06:35.969> mAh<00:06:36.210> battery<00:06:36.659> so<00:06:36.780> if<00:06:36.930> we<00:06:37.139> see<00:06:37.289> the

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
a 2600 mAh battery so if we see the

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.469 
a 2600 mAh battery so if we see the
performance<00:06:37.949> wise<00:06:38.219> it<00:06:38.819> will<00:06:39.000> run<00:06:39.150> any<00:06:39.389> game

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
performance wise it will run any game

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:42.019 
performance wise it will run any game
but<00:06:40.259> the<00:06:40.590> battery<00:06:40.979> will<00:06:41.159> get<00:06:41.370> drained<00:06:41.580> faster

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:42.029 
but the battery will get drained faster

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:46.670 
but the battery will get drained faster
and<00:06:42.210> heating<00:06:42.779> occurs<00:06:44.029> so<00:06:45.029> you<00:06:45.870> know<00:06:45.990> it's<00:06:46.409> like

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
and heating occurs so you know it's like

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.360 
and heating occurs so you know it's like
one<00:06:46.919> plus<00:06:47.189> and<00:06:47.400> one<00:06:47.580> minus<00:06:48.050> overall<00:06:49.370> average

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
one plus and one minus overall average

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.900 
one plus and one minus overall average
gaming<00:06:50.789> device<00:06:51.090> I<00:06:51.419> would<00:06:51.629> say
