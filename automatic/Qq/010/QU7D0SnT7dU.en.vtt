up protection and they're going to go

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.039 
up protection and they're going to go
one<00:01:55.979> step<00:01:56.189> further<00:01:56.490> for<00:01:57.119> those<00:01:57.240> street<00:01:57.659> riders

dual sport riding where you might be

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:19.830 
dual sport riding where you might be
taking<00:02:18.939> this<00:02:18.999> off-road<00:02:19.299> and<00:02:19.540> you're<00:02:19.629> probably

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
taking this off-road and you're probably

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.569 
taking this off-road and you're probably
going<00:02:20.079> to<00:02:20.139> be<00:02:20.200> crashing<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.769> you<00:02:21.159> might<00:02:21.400> want

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
going to be crashing it you might want

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.250 
going to be crashing it you might want
to<00:02:21.609> stay<00:02:21.849> away<00:02:22.120> from<00:02:22.180> those<00:02:22.450> because<00:02:22.689> they<00:02:23.019> can

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
to stay away from those because they can

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.569 
to stay away from those because they can
get<00:02:23.409> damaged<00:02:23.799> in<00:02:23.889> the<00:02:24.040> event<00:02:24.219> of<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.340> crash

and we're going to start at the right
we're<00:02:37.420> going<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.599> work<00:02:37.810> our<00:02:37.959> way<00:02:37.989> through<00:02:38.109> this

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
we're going to work our way through this

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.440 
we're going to work our way through this
so<00:02:39.069> first<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:39.730> foremost<00:02:40.180> we're<00:02:40.269> going<00:02:40.389> to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
so first and foremost we're going to

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.899 
so first and foremost we're going to
have<00:02:40.719> the<00:02:40.959> full<00:02:41.319> aluminum<00:02:41.859> backbone<00:02:42.430> version

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
have the full aluminum backbone version

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.729 
have the full aluminum backbone version
for<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.150> mounting<00:02:43.629> kit<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.079> this<00:02:44.439> is<00:02:44.590> going

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
for the mounting kit and this is going

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.559 
for the mounting kit and this is going
to<00:02:44.799> be<00:02:44.950> probably<00:02:45.249> my<00:02:45.489> personal<00:02:46.030> favorite<00:02:46.419> for

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
to be probably my personal favorite for

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.360 
to be probably my personal favorite for
dual-sport<00:02:47.230> use<00:02:47.500> because<00:02:48.099> it's<00:02:48.189> going<00:02:48.310> to

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
dual-sport use because it's going to

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.009 
dual-sport use because it's going to
have<00:02:48.489> a<00:02:48.519> mount<00:02:48.849> on<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.150> bar<00:02:49.389> end<00:02:49.569> and<00:02:49.780> it's

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
piece now one of the things that sets us

piece now one of the things that sets us
wmo<00:03:05.560> take<00:03:05.739> apart<00:03:06.040> is<00:03:06.189> if<00:03:06.310> i<00:03:06.370> powder-coated<00:03:07.359> the

wmo take apart is if i powder-coated the

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:09.119 
wmo take apart is if i powder-coated the
aluminum<00:03:07.810> on<00:03:07.900> this<00:03:08.109> so<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.560> had<00:03:08.739> this<00:03:08.799> really

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
aluminum on this so you had this really

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.189 
aluminum on this so you had this really
nice<00:03:09.250> sleek<00:03:09.669> black<00:03:10.030> look<00:03:10.329> to<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.659> now<00:03:11.019> this<00:03:11.139> is

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:11.199 
nice sleek black look to it now this is

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.449 
nice sleek black look to it now this is
going<00:03:11.379> to<00:03:11.469> tie<00:03:11.650> right<00:03:11.859> in<00:03:12.010> with<00:03:12.129> the<00:03:12.219> one

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
going to tie right in with the one

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.860 
going to tie right in with the one
nitpick<00:03:12.819> that<00:03:12.939> I<00:03:12.969> did<00:03:13.150> have<00:03:13.329> with<00:03:13.510> this<00:03:13.659> and

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
nitpick that I did have with this and

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.780 
nitpick that I did have with this and
they<00:03:14.230> didn't<00:03:14.650> powder<00:03:14.919> coat<00:03:15.219> the<00:03:15.370> mounting

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
they didn't powder coat the mounting

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.250 
they didn't powder coat the mounting
system<00:03:15.939> I<00:03:16.329> think<00:03:16.870> that<00:03:16.959> they<00:03:17.049> could<00:03:17.109> have

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
system I think that they could have

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.020 
system I think that they could have
powder<00:03:17.590> coated<00:03:17.889> this<00:03:18.069> giving<00:03:18.400> you<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.759> same

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
powder coated this giving you the same

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.909 
powder coated this giving you the same
nice<00:03:19.299> aesthetic<00:03:19.599> throughout<00:03:20.049> but<00:03:20.560> again<00:03:20.769> it's

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:20.919 
nice aesthetic throughout but again it's

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.129 
nice aesthetic throughout but again it's
a<00:03:20.979> minor<00:03:21.280> nitpick<00:03:21.549> that<00:03:22.239> just<00:03:22.569> kind<00:03:22.750> of<00:03:22.810> over

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
a minor nitpick that just kind of over

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.420 
a minor nitpick that just kind of over
sets<00:03:23.409> the<00:03:23.530> aesthetics<00:03:23.919> but<00:03:24.040> as<00:03:24.159> far<00:03:24.340> as

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
sets the aesthetics but as far as

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.439 
sets the aesthetics but as far as
functionality<00:03:24.639> concerns

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:25.449
