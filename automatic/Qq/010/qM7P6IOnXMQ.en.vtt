kind of know in the back of my mind that

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.430 
kind of know in the back of my mind that
I<00:02:22.670> could<00:02:22.790> expand<00:02:23.330> my<00:02:23.510> collection<00:02:23.930> if<00:02:24.050> I<00:02:24.170> wanted

up<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:30.380> ignore<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.450> anyway<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:32.690> thought

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.140 
up so ignore that anyway so I thought
this<00:02:33.050> is<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.230> really<00:02:33.530> fun<00:02:33.800> solution<00:02:34.400> for<00:02:34.970> how<00:02:35.090> to

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150

especially the Red Angel plates or the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.130 
especially the Red Angel plates or the
original<00:02:43.519> bundle<00:02:44.060> monster<00:02:44.150> plates<00:02:44.600> they

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
original bundle monster plates they

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.809 
original bundle monster plates they
don't<00:02:45.410> have<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.769> paper<00:02:45.950> backing<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.670> the

don't have the paper backing and the
rounded<00:02:47.810> edges<00:02:48.140> because<00:02:48.410> those<00:02:48.560> plates<00:02:48.830> are

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
rounded edges because those plates are

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.860 
rounded edges because those plates are
really<00:02:49.250> really<00:02:49.430> sharp<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.480> if<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.660> have
