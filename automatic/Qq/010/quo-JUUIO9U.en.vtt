whatever but I thought I wanted to give
you<00:00:24.359> an<00:00:24.480> idea<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.900> what<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.109> camera<00:00:25.430> looked

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
you an idea of what the camera looked

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.700 
you an idea of what the camera looked
like<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.480> outdoors<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.349> I'm<00:00:28.590> actually

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
like in the outdoors so I'm actually

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.440 
like in the outdoors so I'm actually
just<00:00:28.920> filming<00:00:29.550> with<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.150> kind<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.960> awkwardly

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
just filming with this kind of awkwardly

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.970 
just filming with this kind of awkwardly
just<00:00:33.450> like<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.719> would<00:00:33.870> with<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.050> regular<00:00:34.739> video

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
just like I would with a regular video

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.319 
just like I would with a regular video
camera<00:00:35.160> but<00:00:35.489> I'm<00:00:35.640> walking<00:00:35.790> around<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.210> a

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
camera but I'm walking around with a

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.380 
camera but I'm walking around with a
laptop<00:00:37.430> so<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.489> wouldn't<00:00:38.760> find<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.239> you'd

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
laptop so you wouldn't find that you'd

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.670 
laptop so you wouldn't find that you'd
be<00:00:39.540> doing<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.170> your<00:00:40.290> regular<00:00:40.620> everyday

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
be doing this in your regular everyday

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.830 
be doing this in your regular everyday
life<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:41.700> again<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.239> wanted<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.660> give<00:00:42.750> you

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
life but again I just wanted to give you

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.139 
life but again I just wanted to give you
an<00:00:42.960> idea<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.440> what<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> quality<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:44.879> this

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
an idea of what the quality on this

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.299 
an idea of what the quality on this
camera<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.660> outside<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.530> let<00:00:46.800> me<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.070> pan

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
camera is outside and let me just pan

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.209 
camera is outside and let me just pan
around<00:00:47.340> here<00:00:47.840> I'm<00:00:48.840> at<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> local<00:00:49.530> reservoir

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
around here I'm at a local reservoir

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.729 
around here I'm at a local reservoir
that<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.149> do<00:00:51.300> video<00:00:52.020> camera<00:00:52.320> tests<00:00:52.620> at

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
that I like to do video camera tests at

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.090 
that I like to do video camera tests at
because<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.190> kind<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.460> pretty<00:00:53.670> down<00:00:53.850> here

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
because it's kind of pretty down here

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.200 
because it's kind of pretty down here
but<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.520> an<00:00:56.670> HP<00:00:57.300> truvizion<00:00:58.399> HD<00:00:59.399> webcam

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
but this is an HP truvizion HD webcam

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.720 
but this is an HP truvizion HD webcam
and<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:01.050> means<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:01.710> about<00:01:02.039> one

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
and that means that it's about one

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.509 
and that means that it's about one
megapixel<00:01:03.359> for<00:01:04.049> video<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.619> think<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.309> shoots

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
megapixel for video I think it shoots

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:14.810 
megapixel for video I think it shoots
720p<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.890> I'm<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.549> walking<00:01:08.790> here<00:01:11.150> and<00:01:13.820> let's

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
720p and I'm just walking here and let's

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.370 
720p and I'm just walking here and let's
see<00:01:14.909> what<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> audio<00:01:15.420> quality<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
see what the audio quality is like and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.399
