00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
gameplays as you guys see took two three

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.960 
gameplays as you guys see took two three
shots<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.560> kill<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.890> guy<00:01:50.070> but<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.430> managed<00:01:50.759> to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
shots to kill that guy but I managed to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.109 
shots to kill that guy but I managed to
kill<00:01:51.240> them<00:01:51.360> anyway<00:01:51.860> boom<00:01:52.860> close<00:01:53.579> range<00:01:53.850> that

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
kill them anyway boom close range that

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.580 
kill them anyway boom close range that
there's<00:01:54.420> no<00:01:54.540> problem<00:01:54.810> but<00:01:54.930> sometimes<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.409> put

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
there's no problem but sometimes I put

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.530 
there's no problem but sometimes I put
this<00:01:55.680> clip<00:01:55.920> into<00:01:56.100> sometimes<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.119> animation

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
this clip into sometimes the animation

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.999 
this clip into sometimes the animation
is<00:01:57.659> missing<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.469> guess<00:01:58.740> that's<00:01:58.770> only

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
is missing but I guess that's only

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.219 
is missing but I guess that's only
because<00:01:59.219> it's<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.549> beta<00:02:00.140> sometimes<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
because it's a beta sometimes the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.080 
because it's a beta sometimes the
animation<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.710> missing<00:02:02.009> when<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.310> do<00:02:02.939> that

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
animation is missing when you do that

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.160 
animation is missing when you do that
pump<00:02:03.329> action<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:05.070> ah<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.810> seems<00:02:07.049> like

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
pump action so ah so it seems like

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.960 
pump action so ah so it seems like
you're<00:02:07.290> not<00:02:07.320> shooting<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.580> get<00:02:08.700> kind<00:02:08.910> of

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
you're not shooting it can get kind of

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.550 
you're not shooting it can get kind of
confusing<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.599> think<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.020> gonna<00:02:10.140> get<00:02:10.500> a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
confusing I think it's gonna get a

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.440 
confusing I think it's gonna get a
better<00:02:10.709> look<00:02:10.800> right<00:02:11.129> here<00:02:11.180> yeah<00:02:12.180> there<00:02:12.360> was

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.860 
when i first got the beta but i do have
to<00:03:24.690> say<00:03:24.810> also<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:26.160> beta<00:03:26.340> on<00:03:26.490> pc<00:03:26.910> ran<00:03:27.300> a<00:03:27.570> little

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
to say also the beta on pc ran a little

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.720 
to say also the beta on pc ran a little
bit<00:03:28.080> smoother<00:03:28.560> than<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.830> one<00:03:28.950> on<00:03:28.980> ps3<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.700> I

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
bit smoother than the one on ps3 that I

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.940 
bit smoother than the one on ps3 that I
have<00:03:30.030> right<00:03:30.209> now<00:03:30.270> I<00:03:30.630> did<00:03:31.050> not<00:03:31.140> preorder<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.650> on

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
have right now I did not preorder it on

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.000 
have right now I did not preorder it on
origin<00:03:32.459> so<00:03:32.730> I'm<00:03:33.000> only<00:03:33.390> having<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:34.170> ps3

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
origin so I'm only having the ps3

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.520 
origin so I'm only having the ps3
version<00:03:35.040> available<00:03:35.400> but<00:03:36.270> you<00:03:36.660> know<00:03:36.810> soon<00:03:37.020> well

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
version available but you know soon well

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.290 
version available but you know soon well
I<00:03:37.560> guess<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:37.980> 60<00:03:38.459> frames<00:03:38.670> per<00:03:38.760> second

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
I guess it is 60 frames per second

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.090 
I guess it is 60 frames per second
versus<00:03:39.720> 30<00:03:39.930> frames<00:03:40.200> per<00:03:40.320> second<00:03:40.740> it<00:03:40.830> kind<00:03:40.950> of

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
versus 30 frames per second it kind of

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.360 
versus 30 frames per second it kind of
shows<00:03:41.310> but<00:03:42.270> and<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:43.770> lighting<00:03:43.950> is<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.190> bit

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
shows but and the lighting is a bit

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.280 
shows but and the lighting is a bit
different<00:03:44.550> and<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:45.300> liked<00:03:45.690> this<00:03:45.840> clip<00:03:46.020> because

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
different and I liked this clip because

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.500 
different and I liked this clip because
I<00:03:46.530> cleared<00:03:46.830> out<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:46.980> room<00:03:47.130> for<00:03:47.970> my<00:03:48.090> teammates

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
I cleared out the room for my teammates

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.640 
I cleared out the room for my teammates

and just let them just continue on

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.830 
and just let them just continue on
