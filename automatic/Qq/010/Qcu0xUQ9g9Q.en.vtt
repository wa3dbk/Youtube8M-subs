going up on my desktop so there are

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.450 
going up on my desktop so there are
64-bit<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.750> 32-bit<00:01:24.930> build<00:01:25.680> since<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.340> am

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
64-bit and 32-bit build since I am

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.210 
64-bit and 32-bit build since I am
running<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.820> 64-bit<00:01:26.970> version<00:01:27.479> I'm<00:01:27.960> I'll<00:01:28.920> run

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
running the 64-bit version I'm I'll run

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.850 
running the 64-bit version I'm I'll run
the<00:01:29.460> start<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.060> corner<00:01:30.509> 64-bit<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.740> a
