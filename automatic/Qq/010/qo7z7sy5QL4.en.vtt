00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
other side the minecart will be there

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.370 
other side the minecart will be there
with<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.270> diamond<00:01:41.599> stealing<00:01:42.080> but<00:01:42.229> you'll

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
with the diamond stealing but you'll

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.570 
with the diamond stealing but you'll
have<00:01:42.590> them<00:01:42.679> in<00:01:42.770> your<00:01:42.860> inventory<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:43.489> you

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
have them in your inventory so you

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.790 
have them in your inventory so you
duplicated<00:01:44.239> them<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:44.599> that's<00:01:45.500> pretty<00:01:45.679> much

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
duplicated them and that's pretty much

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.020 
duplicated them and that's pretty much
how<00:01:45.979> it<00:01:46.009> goes<00:01:46.190> something<00:01:46.429> to<00:01:46.550> show<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.789> clip

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
how it goes something to show you a clip

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.270 
how it goes something to show you a clip
now<00:01:47.239> of<00:01:47.479> me<00:01:47.959> actually<00:01:48.259> managing<00:01:49.099> to

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
now of me actually managing to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.469 
now of me actually managing to

clicks<00:01:59.929> and<00:02:00.110> I've<00:02:00.170> got<00:02:00.319> my<00:02:00.410> diamonds<00:02:00.709> back<00:02:00.830> now

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
clicks and I've got my diamonds back now

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.540 
clicks and I've got my diamonds back now
you<00:02:01.729> need<00:02:01.970> to<00:02:02.000> go<00:02:02.239> through<00:02:02.629> the<00:02:02.869> pole<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.550> let

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
you need to go through the pole and let

you need to go through the pole and let
me<00:02:04.700> just<00:02:04.940> get<00:02:05.060> rid<00:02:05.270> of<00:02:05.300> this<00:02:05.479> chest<00:02:05.810> in<00:02:05.929> mind

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
me just get rid of this chest in mind

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.779 
me just get rid of this chest in mind
car<00:02:06.259> here's<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.649> can<00:02:06.800> see<00:02:06.979> there's<00:02:07.190> no<00:02:07.310> 64

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
car here's you can see there's no 64

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.790 
car here's you can see there's no 64
diamonds<00:02:08.239> and<00:02:08.390> they<00:02:08.989> are<00:02:09.140> in<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.379> chest<00:02:09.649> as

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
diamonds and they are in the chest as

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.339 
diamonds and they are in the chest as
well<00:02:09.920> so<00:02:10.700> there<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:11.239> go<00:02:11.360> I've<00:02:11.569> got<00:02:11.599> two<00:02:11.959> stacks

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
well so there you go I've got two stacks

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.260 
well so there you go I've got two stacks
which<00:02:12.620> is<00:02:12.890> pretty<00:02:13.489> cool<00:02:13.730> as<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.120> can<00:02:14.209> tell

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
which is pretty cool as you can tell

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.630 
which is pretty cool as you can tell
these<00:02:14.720> well<00:02:14.930> it's<00:02:15.140> very<00:02:15.440> very<00:02:15.800> very<00:02:16.069> simple<00:02:16.370> to

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
these well it's very very very simple to

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.479 
these well it's very very very simple to
actually<00:02:16.940> do<00:02:17.209> like<00:02:18.110> unbelievably<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.920> 1.5

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
actually do like unbelievably the 1.5

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.559 
actually do like unbelievably the 1.5
that<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:19.819> did<00:02:20.150> was<00:02:20.510> actually<00:02:21.080> quite<00:02:21.290> hard<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.890> do

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
that I did was actually quite hard to do

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.630 
that I did was actually quite hard to do
so<00:02:23.569> yeah<00:02:24.170> this<00:02:24.800> scale<00:02:25.099> it<00:02:25.220> can<00:02:25.400> be<00:02:25.489> done<00:02:25.580> a

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
so yeah this scale it can be done a

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.550 
so yeah this scale it can be done a
single<00:02:25.849> player<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.300> multiplayer<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:27.380> just

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
single player and multiplayer I just

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
single player and multiplayer I just
want<00:02:27.710> to<00:02:27.770> point<00:02:27.890> now

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
want to point now

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.090 
want to point now
it<00:02:29.150> really<00:02:29.540> can<00:02:29.840> it's<00:02:30.020> pretty<00:02:30.470> simple<00:02:30.740> as<00:02:30.950> well

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
it really can it's pretty simple as well

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.620 
it really can it's pretty simple as well
the<00:02:31.280> multiply<00:02:31.700> might<00:02:31.880> be<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.030> little<00:02:32.360> bit

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
the multiply might be a little bit

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.780 
the multiply might be a little bit
harder<00:02:32.930> because<00:02:33.050> of<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:33.500> delay<00:02:33.980> as<00:02:34.370> the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
harder because of the delay as the

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.610 
harder because of the delay as the
minecarts<00:02:35.390> moving<00:02:35.780> but<00:02:35.990> you<00:02:36.320> know<00:02:36.380> if<00:02:36.500> you're

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
minecarts moving but you know if you're

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.440 
minecarts moving but you know if you're
on<00:02:36.710> a<00:02:36.740> server<00:02:37.040> with<00:02:37.160> quite<00:02:37.490> loping<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.180> should

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
on a server with quite loping it should

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.620 
on a server with quite loping it should
be<00:02:38.630> fairly<00:02:38.870> easy<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.530> do<00:02:39.680> so<00:02:40.460> yeah<00:02:40.940> thumbs<00:02:41.510> up

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
be fairly easy to do so yeah thumbs up

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.930 
be fairly easy to do so yeah thumbs up
