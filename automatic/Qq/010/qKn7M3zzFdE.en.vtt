hey guys I inherited another lock from

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.910 
hey guys I inherited another lock from

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
dice man on YouTube and this is an Avis

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.160 
dice man on YouTube and this is an Avis
and<00:00:17.550> he<00:00:18.000> he<00:00:18.359> gave<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.690> me<00:00:18.840> because<00:00:19.080> he

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
and he he gave it to me because he

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.390 
and he he gave it to me because he
didn't<00:00:19.320> have<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.529> combination<00:00:20.130> he's<00:00:20.250> got<00:00:20.369> a

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
didn't have the combination he's got a

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.460 
didn't have the combination he's got a
change<00:00:20.730> key<00:00:21.060> but<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.840> course<00:00:22.080> without<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
change key but of course without the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.380 
change key but of course without the
combination<00:00:22.680> there's<00:00:23.220> no<00:00:23.430> way<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.640> change<00:00:24.150> it

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
combination there's no way to change it

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.650 
combination there's no way to change it
it<00:00:25.320> appears<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.369> include<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.760> change<00:00:27.060> key<00:00:27.390> to

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
it appears to include the change key to

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.189 
it appears to include the change key to
look<00:00:27.980> almost<00:00:28.980> exactly<00:00:29.849> like<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.300> master<00:00:31.019> lock

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
look almost exactly like the master lock

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.459 
look almost exactly like the master lock
in<00:00:31.590> almost<00:00:31.949> every<00:00:32.460> dimension<00:00:33.260> even<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
in almost every dimension even on the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.080 
in almost every dimension even on the
bottom<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.950> looks<00:00:35.040> like<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.520> if<00:00:35.820> I'm<00:00:35.969> not

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
bottom it looks like it and if I'm not

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.500 
bottom it looks like it and if I'm not
mistaken<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.079> model<00:00:37.410> Z<00:00:37.739> be<00:00:38.510> engraved

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
mistaken this is the model Z be engraved

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.440 
mistaken this is the model Z be engraved
right<00:00:39.690> there<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.890> has<00:00:41.370> four<00:00:41.640> tumblers<00:00:42.149> just

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
right there it has four tumblers just

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.790 
right there it has four tumblers just
like<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> master<00:00:44.040> lock<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.670> I

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
like just like the master lock and so I

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.170 
like just like the master lock and so I
before<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> disposed<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> lock<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.000> thought

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
before I disposed of the lock I thought

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.310 
before I disposed of the lock I thought
well<00:00:48.360> why<00:00:48.450> not<00:00:48.480> go<00:00:48.780> ahead<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:48.930> try<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.200> at

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
well why not go ahead and try to at

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.660 
well why not go ahead and try to at
least<00:00:49.350> figure<00:00:49.739> out<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.950> combination<00:00:50.129> or<00:00:50.610> at

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
least figure out the combination or at

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.250 
least figure out the combination or at
least<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:51.000> if<00:00:51.090> it's<00:00:51.239> vulnerable<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.960> any<00:00:52.079> way

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
least see if it's vulnerable in any way

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.310 
least see if it's vulnerable in any way
and<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:53.280> was<00:00:53.430> curious<00:00:53.730> if<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.360> mean<00:00:54.809> abus<00:00:55.110> has<00:00:55.289> a

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
and I was curious if I mean abus has a

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.619 
and I was curious if I mean abus has a
reputation<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.579> very<00:00:56.910> month<00:00:57.180> lying<00:00:57.420> machine

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
reputation for very month lying machine

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.900 
reputation for very month lying machine
work<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.770> was<00:00:58.920> curious<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.520> could<00:00:59.730> use

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
work and I was curious if I could use

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.610 
work and I was curious if I could use
the<00:01:00.120> old<00:01:00.210> shim<00:01:00.510> technique<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.320> use<00:01:01.469> on

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the old shim technique that we use on

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.349 
the old shim technique that we use on
these<00:01:01.770> type<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.010> locks<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> states<00:01:03.210> on

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
these type of locks in the states on

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.550 
these type of locks in the states on
master<00:01:03.719> locks<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:05.070> answer<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.460> almost

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
master locks and the answer is almost

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.260 
master locks and the answer is almost
you<00:01:07.560> can't<00:01:07.920> quite<00:01:08.310> because<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> fine

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
you can't quite because of the fine

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.820 
you can't quite because of the fine
machine<00:01:09.630> work<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.229> one<00:01:10.409> there's<00:01:10.590> you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
machine work on this one there's you

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.210 
machine work on this one there's you
can't<00:01:11.130> quite<00:01:11.460> get<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.270> most<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.220> gaps

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
can't quite get it in most of the gaps

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.070 
can't quite get it in most of the gaps
there's<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:14.760> not<00:01:14.909> enough<00:01:14.970> room<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> fit<00:01:15.930> our

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
there's just not enough room to fit our

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.320 
there's just not enough room to fit our
shim<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.530> believe<00:01:17.130> me<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> very<00:01:18.090> very

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
shim and believe me this is a very very

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.719 
shim and believe me this is a very very
thin<00:01:18.780> piece<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.259> metal<00:01:19.530> as<00:01:19.830> I'm<00:01:20.220> sure<00:01:20.400> most<00:01:20.549> of

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
thin piece of metal as I'm sure most of

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.719 
thin piece of metal as I'm sure most of
you<00:01:20.880> know<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:22.530> only<00:01:22.680> place<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.100> could<00:01:23.159> fit<00:01:23.580> it

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you know the only place I could fit it

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.880 
you know the only place I could fit it
in<00:01:23.970> was<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.900> third<00:01:25.110> one<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.619> very

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
in was on the third one and it's a very

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.319 
in was on the third one and it's a very
tight<00:01:26.220> fit<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.360> doesn't<00:01:27.780> bypass<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.040> lock

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
tight fit but it doesn't bypass the lock

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.810 
tight fit but it doesn't bypass the lock
exactly<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> way<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.810> master<00:01:31.020> lock<00:01:31.320> does<00:01:31.820> I'm

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
exactly the way the master lock does I'm

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.910 
exactly the way the master lock does I'm
gonna<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.210> turn<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.630> sideways<00:01:34.049> you

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
gonna have to turn this sideways you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.170 
gonna have to turn this sideways you
still<00:01:35.280> go<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.610> at<00:01:35.700> an<00:01:35.790> angle

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
still go in at an angle

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.080 
still go in at an angle
you<00:01:36.390> still<00:01:36.750> jiggle<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.229> but<00:01:38.159> apparently<00:01:38.640> I

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
you still jiggle it but apparently I

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.210 
you still jiggle it but apparently I
haven't<00:01:39.420> machined<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.110> apart<00:01:40.500> yet<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.130> think

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
haven't machined this apart yet I think

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.210 
haven't machined this apart yet I think
I<00:01:41.490> will<00:01:41.670> you're<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.780> don't<00:01:43.049> lever<00:01:43.680> up<00:01:43.979> to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
I will you're you don't lever up to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.609 
I will you're you don't lever up to
remove<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.820> release<00:01:45.390> mechanism<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.229> appears

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
remove the release mechanism it appears

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.679 
remove the release mechanism it appears
that<00:01:46.680> there's<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.189> slot<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.180> has<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.509> fit

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
that there's a slot that it has to fit

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.889 
that there's a slot that it has to fit
into<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:49.950> depress<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.060> shackle<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:51.780> as

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
into so you depress the shackle just as

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.990 
into so you depress the shackle just as
we<00:01:52.020> do<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> master<00:01:52.649> lock<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.700> kind<00:01:53.939> of

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
we do on the master lock and you kind of

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.600 
we do on the master lock and you kind of
work<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.420> into<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.079> slot<00:01:55.530> at<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> same<00:01:56.310> time

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
work it into that slot at the same time

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.510 
work it into that slot at the same time
jiggling<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:58.049> shackle<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.430> you

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
jiggling on the shackle and if you

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.789 
jiggling on the shackle and if you
jiggle<00:01:59.880> it<00:01:59.969> just<00:02:00.299> right<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.500> hope<00:02:01.649> this

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
jiggle it just right and I hope this

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.700 
jiggle it just right and I hope this
works<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.520> kind<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.390> work<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.869> there<00:02:04.079> it'll

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
works and kind of work it in there it'll

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.510 
works and kind of work it in there it'll
fit<00:02:04.950> into<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.250> slot<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.950> hopefully<00:02:07.950> get<00:02:08.399> in

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
fit into the slot and hopefully get in

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.550 
fit into the slot and hopefully get in
any<00:02:08.700> devil

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
any devil

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.020 
any devil
we<00:02:11.560> can<00:02:11.770> fit<00:02:12.070> it<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.310> there<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.640> we'll<00:02:12.730> open<00:02:12.820> it

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
we can fit it in there and we'll open it

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.300 
we can fit it in there and we'll open it
right<00:02:13.240> up<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:14.020> there<00:02:14.170> must<00:02:14.320> be<00:02:14.620> some<00:02:14.890> kind<00:02:15.100> of

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
right up so there must be some kind of

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.020 
right up so there must be some kind of
lever<00:02:15.720> release<00:02:16.720> mechanism<00:02:17.380> but<00:02:17.920> let's<00:02:18.880> try

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
lever release mechanism but let's try

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.700 
lever release mechanism but let's try
that<00:02:19.180> again<00:02:19.240> I<00:02:19.480> must<00:02:19.750> have<00:02:19.930> missed<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.380> just

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
that again I must have missed it just

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.760 
that again I must have missed it just
slightly<00:02:23.010> okay<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:26.200> course<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.560> works

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
slightly okay of course it works

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.440 
slightly okay of course it works
perfectly<00:02:27.220> when<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.520> camera's<00:02:27.940> not<00:02:27.970> on<00:02:28.150> we

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
perfectly when the camera's not on we

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:36.030 
perfectly when the camera's not on we
all<00:02:28.570> know<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:34.080> hope<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.230> had<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.650> pushed<00:02:35.890> it

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
all know that hope I had it I pushed it

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.870 
all know that hope I had it I pushed it
back<00:02:36.990> there<00:02:37.990> it<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:39.490> see<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.820> is

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
back there it is so you see it is

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.810 
back there it is so you see it is
vulnerable<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.510> this<00:02:40.630> shim<00:02:40.990> bypass<00:02:41.530> but<00:02:42.520> not

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
vulnerable to this shim bypass but not

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.430 
vulnerable to this shim bypass but not
in<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.090> way<00:02:43.209> that<00:02:43.240> we're<00:02:43.570> used<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:43.959> you<00:02:44.320> have

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
in the way that we're used to you have

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.530 
in the way that we're used to you have
to<00:02:44.560> just<00:02:44.740> and<00:02:45.490> I<00:02:45.730> don't<00:02:45.790> know<00:02:46.030> if<00:02:46.120> all<00:02:46.240> of<00:02:46.390> them

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
to just and I don't know if all of them

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.940 
to just and I don't know if all of them
are<00:02:46.600> going<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.810> be<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.020> same<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.290> have<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.560> sample

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
are going to be the same I have a sample

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.360 
are going to be the same I have a sample
size<00:02:47.980> of<00:02:48.340> one<00:02:48.640> but<00:02:49.570> on<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:50.110> right<00:02:50.470> side<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:51.220> the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
size of one but on the right side of the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.110 
size of one but on the right side of the
third<00:02:51.580> wheel

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
third wheel

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.210 
third wheel
with<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.660> numbers<00:02:53.020> facing<00:02:53.440> up<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.800> can<00:02:54.040> fit

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
with the numbers facing up you can fit

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.250 
with the numbers facing up you can fit
it<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.489> there<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:54.880> if<00:02:55.300> you<00:02:55.420> just<00:02:55.690> work<00:02:55.989> it<00:02:56.140> in

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
it in there and if you just work it in

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.020 
it in there and if you just work it in
and<00:02:56.350> shove<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.680> into<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:57.040> slot<00:02:57.400> apparently

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
and shove it into a slot apparently

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.210 
and shove it into a slot apparently
that's<00:02:58.180> enough<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:59.410> wedge<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.860> locking

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
that's enough to wedge the locking

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.190 
that's enough to wedge the locking
mechanism<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:00.940> can<00:03:01.060> get<00:03:01.330> an<00:03:01.450> unlock<00:03:01.900> on

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
mechanism so you can get an unlock on

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.070 
mechanism so you can get an unlock on
the<00:03:02.260> abus<00:03:03.070> zeebee<00:03:03.850> anyway<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:04.810> thought<00:03:04.959> that

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
the abus zeebee anyway I thought that

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.140 
the abus zeebee anyway I thought that
was<00:03:05.170> interesting<00:03:05.290> hope<00:03:05.770> you<00:03:06.150> enjoyed

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
was interesting hope you enjoyed

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.520 
was interesting hope you enjoyed

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
just stepped outside of the back of my

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.650 
just stepped outside of the back of my
hotel<00:03:20.769> room<00:03:20.950> notice<00:03:21.850> there's<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.120> giraffe<00:03:22.299> out

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
hotel room notice there's a giraffe out

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.820 
hotel room notice there's a giraffe out
there<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:23.019> looks<00:03:23.049> like<00:03:23.230> he<00:03:23.410> was<00:03:23.530> getting<00:03:23.680> a

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
there it looks like he was getting a

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.670 
there it looks like he was getting a
drink<00:03:24.010> of<00:03:24.190> water<00:03:24.310> or<00:03:24.489> something<00:03:25.500> he's<00:03:26.500> getting

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.870 
drink of water or something he's getting
ready<00:03:26.739> to<00:03:26.890> pick<00:03:27.070> a<00:03:27.100> lock<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.519> I<00:03:27.580> thought<00:03:27.730> I'd

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
ready to pick a lock and I thought I'd

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.360 
ready to pick a lock and I thought I'd
take<00:03:28.000> a<00:03:28.060> brief<00:03:28.720> break<00:03:29.320> just<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.680> catch<00:03:30.010> this<00:03:30.220> on

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
take a brief break just to catch this on

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.600 
take a brief break just to catch this on
video<00:03:30.700> quick<00:03:31.299> so<00:03:31.570> how<00:03:32.470> about<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.680> just<00:03:33.340> a<00:03:33.459> quick

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
video quick so how about a just a quick

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.800 
video quick so how about a just a quick
view<00:03:33.940> of<00:03:33.970> what<00:03:34.060> we're<00:03:34.239> looking<00:03:34.480> at<00:03:34.570> here<00:03:34.690> we

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
view of what we're looking at here we

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.300 
view of what we're looking at here we
back<00:03:35.019> up<00:03:35.230> he's<00:03:35.530> only<00:03:35.680> about<00:03:35.830> a<00:03:35.920> hundred<00:03:36.220> meters

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
back up he's only about a hundred meters

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.449 
back up he's only about a hundred meters
away<00:03:36.610> from<00:03:36.730> me<00:03:37.030> very<00:03:37.390> very<00:03:37.690> close<00:03:41.130> anyway<00:03:42.130> this

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
away from me very very close anyway this

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:49.000 
away from me very very close anyway this
is<00:03:42.670> what<00:03:42.880> Namibia<00:03:43.810> looks<00:03:44.500> like

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.789

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
so enough of this let's quit screwing

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.580 
so enough of this let's quit screwing
around<00:03:52.920> with<00:03:53.099> his<00:03:53.250> nature<00:03:53.459> stuff<00:03:53.849> and<00:03:54.590> why

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
around with his nature stuff and why
