00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.070
 hello autumn is a perfect time to 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.080
 prepare our plants for the 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.120
 winter that many of them are 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.730
 beginning a process that is known as 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.740
 vegetative recess in which little 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.080
 energy that they get from the sun what 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.510
 used to store nutrients this 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.140
 period will last all winter until 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.480
 the sunlight becomes more intense 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.460
 summer growth generated that the 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.260
 plants were absorbing a lot of the 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.000
 nutrients that are in the soil the 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.160
 which are also being lost through 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.960
 of water from irrigation and rain is 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.579
 what to ensure good development 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.680
 in our plants it is fundamental 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.920
 return these nutrients through the 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.920
 fertilization 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.120
 in addition to its organic animal content and 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.550
 vegetable in a medium degree of decomposition 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.440
 the compos improves the structure of the soil 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.899
 Increase your ability to store 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.670
 waters that wet times and reduce 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.670
 the losses in the dry seasons 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.380
 another organic fertilizer is guano 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.440
 which is basically animal excrement 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.240
 of its high content of organic matter 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.250
 guano favors the development of 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.900
 roots in addition to improving the quality 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.900
 both flowers and fruits 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.130
 reviewing the questions that have arrived 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.200
 to our site is Javier's 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.210
 sugar yourself who tells us that here is 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.980
 plant grass and need advice 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.720
 to prevent birds from eating their 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.880
 seeds 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.010
 javier there are several possibilities one 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.080
 consists of putting branches of hawthorn that 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.060
 they will block the passage of birds and 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.610
 another is to surround the areas with ribbons 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.170
 plastic the brightness that these generate 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.170
 move scare the birds 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.259
 and remember that if you have a plant with 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.450
 problems in the roots should not fertilize 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.280
 until it recovers if it was left 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.980
 Any doubt you can see this again 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.480
 program in nothing the same point cl where 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.290
 You can also share it on the networks 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.100
 social 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.100
 ok, they're fine
