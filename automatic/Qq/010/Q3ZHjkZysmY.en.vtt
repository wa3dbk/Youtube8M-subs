what<00:02:13.530> happens<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:14.010> like<00:02:14.160> war<00:02:14.430> when<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.910> grenade

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
what happens in like war when a grenade

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.600 
what happens in like war when a grenade
goes<00:02:15.450> off<00:02:15.480> near<00:02:15.930> like<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.170> person<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.830> think<00:02:17.489> it's

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
goes off near like a person I think it's

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.550 
goes off near like a person I think it's
even<00:02:17.819> in<00:02:17.940> some<00:02:18.150> call<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.510> duty<00:02:18.780> games<00:02:19.230> maybe

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
even in some call of duty games maybe

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.130 
even in some call of duty games maybe
not<00:02:19.860> black<00:02:20.700> ops<00:02:20.910> 2<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.360> don't<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.629> don't<00:02:21.660> think<00:02:21.989> so

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
not black ops 2 I don't I don't think so

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.229 
not black ops 2 I don't I don't think so
but<00:02:22.319> I<00:02:22.410> think<00:02:22.650> call<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:22.890> duty<00:02:23.069> 4<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.910> call<00:02:24.090> duty

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
but I think call of duty 4 and call duty

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.910 
but I think call of duty 4 and call duty
for<00:02:24.510> when<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.690> grenade<00:02:24.840> goes<00:02:25.170> off<00:02:25.379> around<00:02:25.680> you
