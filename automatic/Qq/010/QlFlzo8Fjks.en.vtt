00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:19.070
 There is no doubt that the speed increases and the movement is better, so the efficiency is very good. 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:24.050
 Mid-that it can move Tteyuu Ikeru to increase the speed without consuming energy 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.360
 Enter through I think you sleep well ultra-cool a country cut to be a run of the forefoot from the foot 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.550
 Say 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.980
 I talk to you, but if you want to run fast you will set it up in front of you to the harbor 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.460
 Because it is so important to buy out this way 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:40.050
 In that sense, I think that rooting is set in the meaning 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:44.520
 It important Kana I think I already life is also interview I had with our picture 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:49.610
 There is no tool player who also uses it today 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:53.780
 Rc 1300 designed for speeding 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:57.920
 rc 1300 only loft landing design fifa 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:03.140
 The resulting sensation, such as installing I guess I'm good I earlier from the middle of that nature and this foot 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.270
 Because it is possible, if you usually do not notice the overruns, you can not easily hit the parts 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.500
 Let's take nature by wearing shoes 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:14.510
 The part that can be installed is very good, isn't it? 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.010
 As it is shoes which help from the moment we put on marmit route 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.729
 Efficient 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:24.760
 As it is run that gives that speed , it is quite 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:29.490
 I think that you can experience it if you wear this 1300 and run 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:34.580
 Not just as a tool but as part of the body 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.920
 I like the shoes I think I want to train in this dictionary and leave the result 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:44.710
 I kana to say not it the highest of shoes 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:49.750
 If it is a part of the top part, it is a part that can be attacked in reverse 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:54.200
 I think it is important to have the ability to run 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:02:02.150
 Racing shoes for efficient midfoot landing 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:04.870
 The minimum required to support a series of flows from rc 1300 installation to kicking out 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.870
 Equipped with features 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.050
 First of all Guess Drop Last The last is well, but if it was always a little hot 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.349
 I cut it 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.920
 I firmly install the minutes so that it is easy to run smoothly on the midfoot 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.610
 It can be so 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.010
 Now that you installed the child Dynalight of the grip 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:29.360
 Socorro of the firm and its installation in the grip force 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:35.360
 Nde this Reburaito in de rider sees is us to properly firm rebound 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:40.220
 It is a shoe that runs smoothly to the next action without missing the resurgence from Hosono 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:44.209
 So these three functions are well balanced well because this 1300 is a shoe 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.030
 I wonder if it's a shoe that brings it closer to the ideal form 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.090
 I think 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.090
 Ray 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.060
 Bes Drop Last Shoe Design- Less Drop Assisting Efficient Speeding 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:01.660
 last 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:07.220
 Smooth weight transfer is promoted by setting the difference in height between the asthmatic part and the high-speed part to 4 mm 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:12.410
 As it assists midfoot running almost flat because it is almost same 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:17.300
 That's why I can shift my weight very smoothly, but rather from the midfoot 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:22.040
 Because it is weight shift after all that it is easy to do forefoot 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:25.030
 Can be migrated from the midfoot to the forefoot by weight transfer goes smoothly 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.990
 I think it is sake brewer with a similar feeling 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:33.640
 So If you really wanted to Susumo early I guess I say switch time is really short 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:37.290
 If the groove contact time is long , it will be the movement of the open road today, so if it's a small installation it will drop that much 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.760
 Time runs short, so I can say I can run smoothly 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:47.069
 2 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:51.989
 Dyna Ride Dyna Ride to keep the grip in any road conditions 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:55.980
 Firmly grasp the road surface in a special i5 rubber studs and the polyamide resin 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:58.750
 Support the kicking repulsion support no slip 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:04.210
 You can feel especially if you run on a rainy day 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.900
 Sense of when firmly established does not slip even run in Toka when good weather anymore usually 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:10.180
 But 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:12.270
 As we understand things right away, this Dynalight also goes to a very high level 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:19.160
 I feel like I am 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:19.160
 As expected rebound is by Nemu at the time of this installation is also I think to be further improved 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:29.479
 32% of conventional products due to the repulsive force and lightness sought by the Rebright rc elite runner 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.770
 Lightweight and advanced 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:39.390
 Cushioning material for racing shoes 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:46.440
 After all it's because it's long for a while, but it's too wide to listen to it 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:50.940
 It can be used to build strength, with a certain degree of hardness, neither soft nor stern 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:54.510
 Such shoes are already a mystery for us, isn't it a very mysterious place? 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.540
 In Buber I Yara Kai's is the nuance collection until now a rather 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.380
 Now processing firm school that there was a image that sinks 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:04.150
 Repulsion Tsu out before you die 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:07.860
 It has become a role to reduce the contact time really 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.860
 I think I'm doing a lot 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:17.580
 Really because I think is still Hey shoes that it is the middle of evolution 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.180
 Just the part we really need 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.630
 I really have shoes that can really fight 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:29.340
 I do n't think I should have done it 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:31.009
 In that really the moment you enter honestly for the first time beginning I 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:36.919
 First of all there is no failure 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:42.600
 There's no problem with that, and at the moment there are almost no first-class items in any shoes 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:47.030
 Than just I, et al. Have come to level out there is looking more ahead without 's goal 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.030
 I think there is a place where I want to evolve further 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:52.560
 Hey do not you shoes that make me a satisfactory run
