00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.719
 Come on, folks, I want to do it now. 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.780
 Central repair prf 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.090
 here in the case the fiat bravo amar is all 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.640
 use this type of head 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.130
 it has a very common defect that is 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.449
 light up the hand brake light and 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.160
 central df 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.710
 marking on the panel that this has to 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.240
 make this lid here just to cut it 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.369
 this cover is a bum because any 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.670
 you are the electronic component 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:41.219
 here we are going to use this kind of 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:43.440
 The saw that cuts through vibration is not 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.989
 swirling chatter is not that 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.170
 she is not a saw for 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.820
 vibration that will allow the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.239
 of this full cap and then we go 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:00.149
 perform the sun procedure 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:03.180
 here the detail of the cover removed 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.790
 detail that using this tool 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.330
 nor is it necessary for me to remove all 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.939
 cap I know where the defect 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.210
 It happens that these four pins 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:20.390
 in these four neighboring terminals here 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:25.200
 these legs here than the central relay 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:29.850
 So I can not see you there. 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:33.420
 video but gives a little crack here in the 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.110
 soldering necessary to re-weld 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.770
 cold and now our 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:45.420
 knife tool in skull 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:51.020
 which is the soldering iron gas that's it 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.130
 guys now end already with the solder redone 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.670
 original screenplay right 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.709
 Look, it does not even look like iron was stirred. 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:06.569
 soldering gas the spot that was welded 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:09.629
 is that you and make four 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:13.560
 Drop of solder for anyone who wants to 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:15.900
 venture and the tip is in hand 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.840
 but you can run the risk of sending 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.010
 central part of the space is why 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.549
 is expensive 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.420
 the execution of this type of central service 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.790
 ready 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.090
 close and isolate baby with 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.239
 silicone glue all standard sent to 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.239
