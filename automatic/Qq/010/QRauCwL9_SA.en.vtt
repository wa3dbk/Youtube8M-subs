00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
sort of it's not as strong I think the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.460 
sort of it's not as strong I think the
field<00:00:50.540> like<00:00:50.780> we've<00:00:50.900> never<00:00:50.989> played<00:00:51.200> on<00:00:51.379> a<00:00:51.440> field

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
field like we've never played on a field

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.470 
field like we've never played on a field
like<00:00:51.680> this<00:00:51.860> before<00:00:52.220> so<00:00:52.489> it's<00:00:53.210> going<00:00:53.360> to<00:00:53.420> be

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
like this before so it's going to be

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.150 
like this before so it's going to be
interesting<00:00:53.690> being<00:00:54.410> here<00:00:54.680> as<00:00:54.890> part<00:00:55.100> of

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
interesting being here as part of

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.340 
interesting being here as part of
history<00:00:55.309> it's<00:00:55.640> a<00:00:56.420> great<00:00:56.780> experience<00:00:57.170> for<00:00:57.199> us

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
history it's a great experience for us

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.650 
history it's a great experience for us
cause<00:00:57.530> it<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:57.920> come<00:00:58.130> to<00:00:58.220> America<00:00:58.640> and<00:00:58.670> play

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
around the world at the moment it's

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.880 
around the world at the moment it's
mainly<00:01:04.820> concentrated<00:01:05.479> in<00:01:05.570> three<00:01:06.560> parts<00:01:06.680> of

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
mainly concentrated in three parts of

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:54.810 
mainly concentrated in three parts of
world

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:18.610 

Oh

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.839 

it's<00:02:19.620> only<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:19.859> second<00:02:20.189> time<00:02:20.280> any<00:02:20.459> Australian

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
it's only the second time any Australian

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.789 
it's only the second time any Australian
teams<00:02:21.060> played<00:02:21.329> out<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.569> here<00:02:21.719> so<00:02:21.989> we're

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
teams played out of here so we're

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:23.929 
teams played out of here so we're
looking<00:02:22.920> forward<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.489> hopefully<00:02:23.730> will

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
looking forward to it hopefully will

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.699 
looking forward to it hopefully will
generate<00:02:24.689> enough<00:02:24.959> interest<00:02:25.139> to<00:02:25.319> get<00:02:25.439> the<00:02:25.560> game

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
generate enough interest to get the game

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.440 
generate enough interest to get the game
kicked<00:02:26.159> off<00:02:26.249> your<00:02:26.430> bit<00:02:26.579> me<00:02:26.700> it's<00:02:27.120> gonna<00:02:27.299> be

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
kicked off your bit me it's gonna be

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.539 
kicked off your bit me it's gonna be
good<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:28.109> see<00:02:28.260> Leah<00:02:28.409> game<00:02:28.950> get<00:02:29.099> replayed<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.489> few

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
good to see Leah game get replayed a few

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.819 
good to see Leah game get replayed a few
more<00:02:29.790> times<00:02:30.030> over<00:02:30.299> here<00:02:30.739> apparently<00:02:31.739> it's

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
more times over here apparently it's

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.140 
more times over here apparently it's
only<00:02:32.010> one<00:02:32.159> game<00:02:32.189> a<00:02:32.430> week<00:02:32.549> that<00:02:32.819> gets<00:02:32.969> shown

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
only one game a week that gets shown

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.240 
only one game a week that gets shown
over<00:02:33.299> here<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:33.750> hopefully<00:02:34.409> two<00:02:34.769> or<00:02:34.859> three<00:02:35.069> be

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
over here so hopefully two or three be

over here so hopefully two or three be
good<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.579> so<00:02:36.420> before<00:02:36.569> generate<00:02:37.109> a<00:02:37.139> bit<00:02:37.260> more

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
good and so before generate a bit more

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.319 
good and so before generate a bit more
interest<00:02:37.680> it's<00:02:38.489> a<00:02:38.609> lot<00:02:38.730> narrower<00:02:38.939> than<00:02:39.060> our

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
interest it's a lot narrower than our

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.110 
interest it's a lot narrower than our
field<00:02:39.599> it's<00:02:40.530> not<00:02:40.680> real<00:02:40.829> grass<00:02:41.099> because<00:02:41.939> we're

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
field it's not real grass because we're

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.369 
field it's not real grass because we're
not<00:02:42.150> used<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.599> plan<00:02:42.810> on<00:02:42.930> this<00:02:43.019> type<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.230> stuff

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
not used to a plan on this type of stuff

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.039 
not used to a plan on this type of stuff
and<00:02:44.329> there's<00:02:45.329> a<00:02:45.359> lot<00:02:45.480> more<00:02:45.510> lines<00:02:45.840> on<00:02:45.959> this

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049
