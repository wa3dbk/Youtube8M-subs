road<00:00:07.230> bike<00:00:07.259> component<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.250> was<00:00:08.400> wondering

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
road bike component and I was wondering

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.610 
road bike component and I was wondering
if<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.059> can<00:00:09.269> combine<00:00:09.510> components<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.440> different

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
if I can combine components of different

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.160 
if I can combine components of different
group<00:00:11.040> sets<00:00:11.340> like<00:00:11.639> Allegro<00:00:12.240> with<00:00:12.420> duress<00:00:12.809> or

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170

group sets like Allegro with duress or
105<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.980> if<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:14.670> what's<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.179> best<00:00:15.269> way<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.690> do

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929

order<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> shifters<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.600> say<00:01:09.930> go<00:01:10.080> with<00:01:10.229> 105<00:01:10.830> they

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.320 
are great and the functional difference

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
price difference is also very small so I

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.990 
price difference is also very small so I
feel<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.320> worth<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.829> go<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.250> uLTA<00:01:29.549> here

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
durable finish than 105 that keeps it

durable finish than 105 that keeps it
shifting<00:01:55.560> nicer<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.250> longer<00:01:56.640> when<00:01:57.270> you

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
shifting nicer for longer when you

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.510 
shifting nicer for longer when you
consider<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.170> 105<00:01:58.740> chain<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.219> only<00:01:59.399> a

few bucks cheaper than the Altera the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.920 
few bucks cheaper than the Altera the
choice<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.189> obvious<00:02:02.340> go<00:02:03.090> at<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.390> old<00:02:03.479> tetra

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
choice is obvious go at the old tetra

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.069 
choice is obvious go at the old tetra

for the crankset old tiger 6800 is about

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.669 
for the crankset old tiger 6800 is about
65<00:02:07.740> grams<00:02:08.009> lighter<00:02:08.369> than<00:02:08.729> 105<00:02:09.289> 5800<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.530> has

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
more advanced chain rings that shift a

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.550 
more advanced chain rings that shift a
little<00:02:12.720> nicer

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
little nicer

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.320

this<00:02:13.860> makes<00:02:14.160> all<00:02:14.340> tegra<00:02:14.700> worth<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.209> extra

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
this makes all tegra worth the extra

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.530 
this makes all tegra worth the extra
money<00:02:15.600> in<00:02:15.959> my<00:02:16.140> opinion<00:02:16.650> Duras<00:02:17.490> 9000<00:02:18.360> is

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
money in my opinion Duras 9000 is

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.630 
money in my opinion Duras 9000 is
another<00:02:18.870> 70<00:02:19.350> grams<00:02:19.590> lighter<00:02:19.860> than<00:02:20.160> all<00:02:20.280> tiger

another 70 grams lighter than all tiger
6800<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.810> arms<00:02:22.140> are<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.319> little<00:02:22.500> stiffer

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
6800 and the arms are a little stiffer

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.190 
6800 and the arms are a little stiffer
but<00:02:23.310> shifting<00:02:23.730> performance<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.540> essentially

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
but shifting performance is essentially

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.590 
but shifting performance is essentially
the<00:02:25.319> same<00:02:25.500> at<00:02:26.220> more<00:02:26.490> than<00:02:26.640> double<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.150> cost<00:02:27.390> of

Alegre<00:02:28.110> it's<00:02:28.350> hard<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.709> make<00:02:28.890> an<00:02:29.010> argument

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
Alegre it's hard to make an argument

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.710 
Alegre it's hard to make an argument
that<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.850> small<00:02:30.150> bump<00:02:30.390> in<00:02:30.540> performance

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
that the small bump in performance

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.080 
that the small bump in performance
offered<00:02:31.620> by<00:02:31.770> duress<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.520> worth<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.940> extra
