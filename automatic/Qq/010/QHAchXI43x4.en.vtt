00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.010 
is an extremely cool feature any work
way<00:01:58.280> better<00:01:58.310> than<00:01:58.789> I<00:01:58.909> thought<00:01:58.969> it<00:01:59.179> would<00:01:59.270> the

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
way better than I thought it would the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.749 
way better than I thought it would the
other<00:02:00.139> force<00:02:00.439> power<00:02:00.649> we<00:02:00.799> have<00:02:00.829> is<00:02:01.279> the<00:02:01.459> force

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
other force power we have is the force

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.699 
other force power we have is the force
push<00:02:02.090> where<00:02:02.509> you<00:02:02.600> pull<00:02:02.630> your<00:02:02.990> hand<00:02:03.259> back<00:02:03.350> to

push where you pull your hand back to
charge<00:02:03.979> up<00:02:04.219> and<00:02:04.369> then<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:04.729> frost<00:02:05.119> your<00:02:05.270> hand

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
charge up and then you frost your hand

forward to tear down everything in front

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.210 
forward to tear down everything in front
of<00:02:07.520> you<00:02:07.639> using<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.420> force<00:02:08.690> is<00:02:08.899> awesome<00:02:09.740> but<00:02:10.190> I

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
of you using the force is awesome but I

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.520 
of you using the force is awesome but I
would<00:02:10.550> still<00:02:10.819> like<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.090> few<00:02:11.630> more<00:02:11.840> force<00:02:12.140> powers

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
would still like a few more force powers

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.320 
would still like a few more force powers
like<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.069> ability<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.489> throw<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.700> lightsaber

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
like the ability to throw a lightsaber

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.110 
like the ability to throw a lightsaber
use<00:02:14.810> for<00:02:15.170> sliding<00:02:15.680> as<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:15.950> sip<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.370> course<00:02:16.640> or

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
use for sliding as a sip of course or

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.160 
use for sliding as a sip of course or
what<00:02:17.299> about<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.659> ability

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
what about the ability

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.870 
what about the ability
is<00:02:18.230> force<00:02:18.530> impulse<00:02:19.040> like<00:02:19.400> in<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.670> first

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
is force impulse like in the first

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.600 
is force impulse like in the first
trailer<00:02:20.180> in<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:21.440> campaign<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:22.280> also<00:02:22.400> get

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
trailer in the campaign you also get

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.640 
trailer in the campaign you also get
these<00:02:22.819> stages<00:02:23.180> where<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.750> ride<00:02:23.989> on<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.230> speed

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
these stages where you ride on a speed

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.979 
these stages where you ride on a speed
bike<00:02:24.890> through<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.250> forest<00:02:25.760> which<00:02:26.300> is<00:02:26.510> kind<00:02:26.900> of

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
bike through a forest which is kind of

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.140 
bike through a forest which is kind of
cool<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.950> get<00:02:28.099> space<00:02:28.370> combat<00:02:28.700> which<00:02:29.030> is

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
cool and you get space combat which is

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.210 
cool and you get space combat which is
very<00:02:29.420> simplicity<00:02:29.930> because<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.709> just<00:02:30.890> should

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
very simplicity because you just should

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.949 
very simplicity because you just should
automatically<00:02:31.849> one<00:02:32.120> aiming<00:02:32.480> at<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.569> enemies

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
automatically one aiming at the enemies

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.559 
automatically one aiming at the enemies
but<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.620> works<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:34.819> can<00:02:34.970> also<00:02:35.090> play<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.450> game

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
but it works you can also play the game

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.570 
but it works you can also play the game
in<00:02:35.690> co-op<00:02:36.020> but<00:02:36.440> at<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.709> time<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:36.980> record<00:02:37.430> this

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580
