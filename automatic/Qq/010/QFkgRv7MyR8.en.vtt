00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 Welcome to the fourth episode 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.200
 of the baw shipyards today we show you 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.849
 an American aircraft carrier 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.809
 48 and the leg sink 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.820
 originally this ship was called 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.460
 battle cruiser planned and built and 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.320
 had his stacking run in 1921 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.029
 but already in the following year 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.250
 began the long conversion to 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.980
 Aircraft carrier became after five years 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.660
 the lexington finally in 1927 as 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.369
 aircraft carrier put into service and 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.320
 part of the american Pacific fleet 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.100
 In 1930 she was in the meantime 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.140
 assigned and with their huge 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.910
 generators the power supply of 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.899
 American coastal town Takoma 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.670
 ensure 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.809
 because this one suffered after the hard winter 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.399
 under large-scale power failure after 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.980
 some missions in the second world war 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.899
 the leak was behind on 8 may 1942 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.000
 settled by japanese bomber and 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.250
 torpedo bomber so badly damaged that 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.079
 they are abandoned during the day 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.250
 had to and from the american destroyer 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.250
 Phelps was sunk 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.020
 next to the four plane squadrons the 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.090
 has can command themselves their 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.770
 the lexington is a serviceable secondary 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.450
 artillery and a really good one 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.520
 air defense over 60 guns from 20 and 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.600
 40 millimeters cannon get the planes 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.450
 in the melee of the sky 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.280
 in addition there are 1200 27 millimeters 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.190
 Protected the already from 5 kilometers 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.570
 the airmen put under pressure but 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.660
 enough naked facts we look at the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.130
 lexington in motion at acceleration 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.930
 and turning radius are themselves for one 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.790
 Aircraft carriers rather weak though 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.190
 allows you the high final speed 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.869
 of 35 knots if you drive once 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.720
 have come every point the map 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.399
 to reach quickly most of the time 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.170
 however, you are only indirectly taking care of yourself 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.780
 but your aircraft carrier is located 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.460
 on the tactical map for here 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.759
 commented her your hunting aircraft 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.410
 torpedo bomber and bomber with the files 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.910
 you can show very good opponents 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.259
 uncover ships around your own 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.610
 battleships offer good 10 to 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.710
 Of course, they are suitable for others 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.540
 Also great for opposing suitcases 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.069
 or enemy torpedo bomber from 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.569
 to get heaven before your own 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.569
 ships can be dangerous 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.150
 with your own torpedo bombers 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.500
 should you as such 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.540
 but combed completely 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.190
 stay out 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.170
 with her torpedo armament it is her 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.670
 Primary target enemy battleships 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.670
 and aircraft carrier sink 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.090
 That's sinking with the top man of leg 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.860
 Although not always easy there 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.600
 torpedoes relatively little harm 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.739
 cause by their quite high 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.030
 they are speed, though 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.480
 quickly back on your own 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.010
 Aircraft carrier to load new torpedoes 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.540
 with a few extra modules you can 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.430
 the damage to the torpedoes by the way 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.640
 then raise the burden, however 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.440
 the plane speed on eur 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.540
 bomber witch on the opposing ships 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.519
 since the fight that can not escape 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:58.280
 However, they are just as good against 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:03:00.019
 smaller and more agile ships should 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.450
 you your lexican with two squadrons 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.310
 torpedo bomb so equipped 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.170
 It always tries to attack 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.819
 to lead from two different sides 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.670
 thus complicates with the enemy 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.260
 Ships torpedoes dodge torpedo 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.540
 attacks from the front as seen here 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.459
 are significantly more effective in that 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.040
 enemy ship from a maximum 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.570
 two topteams will hit well 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.310
 placed attacks from the side 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.780
 on the other hand means for almost everyone 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.780
 enemy ships mother needs 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:37.190
 and when I'm at the first election 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:38.780
 then at the latest at the second has the 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.520
 enemy aircraft carrier once 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.220
 uncovered so you are usually fast 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.830
 center points campfire thanks to your high 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.690
 Structure scores are armor 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.850
 normal attacks but not much 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.470
 dangerous for you too the secondary 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.300
 lexington artillery is good enough 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.560
 to attack one or the other 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.690
 to sink destroyers 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.310
 but at the latest when the enemy with you 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.290
 one or merck and should be like torpedoes 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:06.050
 caught the lexington place 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.930
 faster we touch the whole thing 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.250
 again briefly together 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.770
 wilex inc owns as aircraft carrier 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.120
 a very good air defense as well as eight 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.230
 Aircraft that hurt a lot 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.489
 can cause 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.320
 In addition, the high helps you 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.010
 Final speed most smaller 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.330
 skirmish out of the way 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.980
 Negative weight falls next to the 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.690
 low agility and the weak 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.970
 Alpha damage the torpedo bomb 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.510
 especially the bad values 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.520
 fall 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.800
 so can you enemy ships 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.900
 already recognize over 17 kilometers 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.520
 and take under fire 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.480
 the operational areas of lexington are 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.790
 clear like any other 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.470
 Aircraft carriers also while themselves 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.270
 rather you on the edge of the battlefield on 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.770
 Keep sending your torpedo bomber 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.600
 to enemy battleships or 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.970
 to pressurize the aircraft carrier 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.950
 You prefer to send euro bomber 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.960
 opposing herbs or destroy and 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.580
 with your own hunting planes 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.560
 you try to keep the sky clear 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.360
 and your own ships 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.830
 enemy torpedo bommern and bomb 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.419
 to protect what I last fall 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.130
 hope you had fun watching and 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.320
 listen to see you in the next 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.560
 Followed by the buffed shipyard then with the 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:16.120
 Japanese destroyer of kg red in 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.120
 this sense until next time
