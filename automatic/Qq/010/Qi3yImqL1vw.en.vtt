00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello everyone already knows so we 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.009
 is found for a new tutorial 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.810
 ironing beads and it will be you 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.670
 will learn to read a moron rabbit 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.380
 so it will be small enough so could 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.059
 either the iron keychain or the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.670
 suspend or put it a little bit 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.049
 then want there are several models that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.699
 we can do so we can change the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.350
 eyes offered a different mouth me 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.930
 I'm going to mouth or veiled 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.260
 so you will need the blow at the level 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.890
 pearls of 73 white pearls of 14 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.800
 light pink pearl 2.8 brown or 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.980
 black for the mouth and two pearls 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.210
 red or blue for them and that's it 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.100
 let's start right away so you 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.829
 take a pair leblanc game place you 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.600
 is pretty much to the right of your support 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.540
 is at the edge 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.320
 I like to be placed pretty much here and I 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:56.140
 so go place 5 white pearls in 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:02.440
 the same row verdict non horizontal 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.970
 excuse me up then 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.520
 so if I have a little trouble it's because 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.930
 that the pearls they are a can not 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.160
 to hold in the support is a little 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.520
 complicated because it's not the real ones 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.350
 beads 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.690
 but hey I 'll do with then you 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.550
 then put a pearl on top 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.050
 right all right you go back to 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.580
 right and you place and so a pearl 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.860
 white that will place you three pearls 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:26.530
 light roses to make belly then 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.509
 you replace a white pearl or not 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.800
 this arranged it next and you place a 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.930
 white pearl above the pearl 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.570
 white from the previous row 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.990
 blah her two white pearls to the right of 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:43.530
 this one but loses we do not take 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.530
 of course but it is not serious 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.210
 then I place three pink pearls 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.920
 clear new ones that will be placed at 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.400
 above the previous three pearls that 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.400
 you had placed 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.690
 then you place three pearls 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.270
 white 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:07.030
 on the other side to actually make them 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:09.040
 bunny rabbit's arm not it arranged it 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.020
 next and you start straight 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.510
 everything to the right of the white pearls of the 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.070
 previous horizontal row and there you 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.720
 have placed four white pearls for 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.280
 create a small shift at the level of 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.960
 belly 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.690
 four white pearls and pearls 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:28.680
 roses then again three pairs 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.680
 white 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.730
 I pass then we know at the row 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.879
 next and I create an offset 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:51.680
 vertical to the left 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:51.680
 then I place no I line stupidity 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.680
 no it's good of no nonsense I'm 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.109
 lose all alone then after so I 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.379
 place so I create a shift towards the 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.170
 left 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.250
 after I place only white pearls 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.049
 it's good I hear you check if 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.879
 I had finished to stop them finally yes 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.530
 stomach 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:12.840
 the little belly with roses is actually 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.359
 I finished then after I key creates 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.709
 also a shift to the left so I 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.389
 stop at the penultimate pearl 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.560
 white of the previous gnawing 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:24.450
 you have to get that after I sit down 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.849
 above I create an offset again 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:32.609
 to the left from right in 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:36.239
 of course and I also create a lag at 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:39.900
 left to bring me closer to the 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:43.909
 shot and then I put a pearl 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.799
 white again a shift to the right 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:50.699
 merici then I place that pearls 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.319
 black or brown to make the mouth and 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:55.400
 I stop at the last white pearl 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.400
 from the previous row 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.260
 I go to the next gnawing I replace 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:01.799
 a pearl white must the pearl 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.579
 white 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.719
 I place a black pearl and there I do 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.829
 I alternate so I put a black pearl 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:10.379
 a white pearl 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.459
 a black pearl a white pearl for 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:17.250
 to be able to make the teeth of the moron rabbit 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:21.090
 and I stop of course at the last 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.680
 previous pearl which was black next 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.229
 I go to the next orange and I'm going 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.389
 place that white so I'm leaving to 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.919
 right where I had already placed white 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:33.210
 to lengthen previous ones and I 'm going in 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:35.720
 square and up to the black pearl 2 angers 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.720
 former 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.550
 then I go to the orange pressed 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.340
 next excuse me and I place pearl 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.630
 white so I start again at 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.699
 same level of the white pearl 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.740
 previous right 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.229
 then I put a red pearl for 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.099
 to make a small eye and then I place 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.680
 White pearl 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:03.449
 and finally to finish the row I 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.740
 place a red bead to do the 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.050
 second is there so you can also 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.490
 put blue if you want it next 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.500
 there's not that arranged next and I'll 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.880
 place white on the entire row 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.060
 wearing red by going up to 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.060
 White 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.199
 we got a little hard because my pairs 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.350
 months do not hold since they are 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:32.960
 super badly trained but hey I try to 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:35.240
 to show you anyway after I 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.539
 replace right above the beads 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.130
 white and then I'm going to create a 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.599
 shift to the left so I stop at 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.319
 the penultimate pearl white 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:48.440
 Previous of the previous lengthen 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:51.169
 so at that level then to create 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.880
 I'll have to go right and I'm screaming 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.430
 a shift to the right I place a pearl 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.000
 white pearl pink pearl then a pearl 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.240

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.970
 uh no no yes if if you 're not 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.840

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.190
 books and games place 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.919
 I go on the other side I put a 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.199
 white pearl is still a pearl 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:13.789
 white 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:15.710
 oulala escapes I go to the orange 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:17.659
 next I'm still shouting a shift towards 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.199
 the right and I'm talking about two pearls place 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:23.300
 white then a pink pearl and it will be 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:25.880
 all on this side I move to the next side 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.849
 I spend a white pearl on top of 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.190
 my previous white pearl 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:32.440
 then a pink pearl then a pearl 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.090
 white 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.440
 I come back on the other side there I place 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.940
 this time a white pearl at 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.080
 Above the white pearl and then 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.490
 pink pearls to the left of this one of 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.020
 the other gender side is doing exactly the 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.210
 same as what I had done in 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.229
 the previous row so a white one 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:53.030
 pink and a white 

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:55.580
 I come back on the other side there I scream 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.340
 an offset have no lag I'm 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.680
 place once again above 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.509
 previous white pearls and I place 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.460
 a white pearl on the left and it will be 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:06.469
 everything and then I go back to the other 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.610
 side above the pearls I had 

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:11.440
 placed in the row 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.940
 previous I place above three 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.670
 white pearls just above the 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.370
 previous pearls 

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:20.770
 here and you get a rabbit rabbit 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.090
 cretin so that's good there it looks 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.710
 not really because it would take me 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.960
 ironing the creation so do not forget 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.300
 to put baking paper 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.860
 gently iron your creation 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.690
 and watch as and when 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.580
 it gives me I do not go back to the 

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:36.120
 creation because otherwise I could have 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.380
 father forces him to do some tutos of the coup 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.750

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.010
