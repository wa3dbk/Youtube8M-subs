for<00:02:51.680> all<00:02:51.799> we<00:02:52.010> know<00:02:52.190> it<00:02:52.430> can<00:02:52.549> be<00:02:52.579> scribed<00:02:53.060> in<00:02:53.360> the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
for all we know it can be scribed in the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:03.789 
for all we know it can be scribed in the
seat<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:58.840> those<00:02:59.840> were<00:03:00.110> um<00:03:00.579> thank<00:03:01.579> you<00:03:02.799> thank

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
seat so those were um thank you thank

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.430 
seat so those were um thank you thank
you<00:03:03.860> for<00:03:04.099> watching<00:03:04.549> it<00:03:04.940> but<00:03:05.299> um<00:03:05.510> after<00:03:06.079> you

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
you for watching it but um after you

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.869 
you for watching it but um after you
know<00:03:06.560> why<00:03:06.709> my<00:03:06.890> saying<00:03:07.129> that<00:03:07.280> that's<00:03:07.430> not<00:03:07.549> in

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
know why my saying that that's not in

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.030 
know why my saying that that's not in
the<00:03:07.940> video<00:03:08.090> yet<00:03:08.450> but<00:03:08.840> um<00:03:09.019> that's<00:03:09.799> what<00:03:09.980> I'm

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
the video yet but um that's what I'm

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.230 
the video yet but um that's what I'm
thinking<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.790> theory<00:03:11.239> is

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
thinking the theory is

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.450 
thinking the theory is
you<00:03:12.840> know<00:03:12.990> know<00:03:13.410> like<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.680> said<00:03:13.950> I'm<00:03:14.160> stuttering

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
you know know like I said I'm stuttering

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.460 
you know know like I said I'm stuttering
on<00:03:14.910> this<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.330> making<00:03:15.660> mistakes<00:03:16.050> because<00:03:16.320> I

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
on this and making mistakes because I

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.500 
on this and making mistakes because I
want<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.710> make<00:03:16.860> this<00:03:16.980> video<00:03:17.160> quick<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.850> wanted

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
want to make this video quick I wanted

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.030 
want to make this video quick I wanted
to<00:03:18.600> do<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:18.720> yesterday<00:03:18.960> but<00:03:19.350> I<00:03:19.410> had<00:03:19.440> so<00:03:19.860> many

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
to do this yesterday but I had so many

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.740 
to do this yesterday but I had so many
stuff<00:03:20.340> doing<00:03:20.880> yesterday<00:03:22.280> but<00:03:23.300> that's<00:03:24.300> just<00:03:24.540> my

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
stuff doing yesterday but that's just my

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.410 
stuff doing yesterday but that's just my
theory<00:03:25.110> of<00:03:25.230> what<00:03:25.650> of<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.490> smears<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.030> phone

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
theory of what of it smears the phone

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.200 
theory of what of it smears the phone

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
I mean maybe just his way trying to

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.490 
I mean maybe just his way trying to
communicate<00:03:55.650> with<00:03:56.520> them<00:03:56.700> now<00:03:57.540> these<00:03:58.170> are<00:03:58.350> like

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
you know like I said these are just my

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.350 
you know like I said these are just my
theories<00:04:00.390> if<00:04:01.080> you<00:04:01.560> have<00:04:01.830> anything<00:04:02.730> else<00:04:02.910> I
