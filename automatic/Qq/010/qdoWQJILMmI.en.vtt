00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.629
good friends again on youtube,
I'm back again

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.109
¡¡¡¡Noooooooooooooo!!!!

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.060
today I come he make a new unboxing

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.399
a new product that I bought

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:31.039
they are high-end sneakers

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:38.039
because these are the slippers

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.420
I see that does not

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.089
It has been a good presentation

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:49.089
I'll put the best

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.300
well after this great
presentation

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.880
I want to say as before, it is a
shoe, high-end

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.310
and that mean, shoes range
high

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.370
very easy

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.060
going to cost an egg

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.360
and for this reason that an egg is to me only,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.190
This shoe is more

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.160
pronation people

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.900
i.e. that goal feet as well

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.300
what differs, from neutrals, that
they put the foot as well

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.460
and because the supinadores goal in the foot well

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.230
and these shoes have, this lot of things

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.580
Ahar +, rubber injected carbon, Full guidance line, Space Trusstic,

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.040
Flex, impact guidance system, solyte grooves

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.700
gel front and rear

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.869
Dynamic duomax, ortholite, solyte sobresuela, template byomorphic

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.579
Cross released laces, personal heel fit, discrete eyelet,

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.320
Space uv,3M reflective,breathable mesh,clutch counter.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.140
In conclusion

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.720
This has more ingredients than any
product of a Chinese store

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.800
and the truth after reading
all of that is worth to slippers

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.779
and as a last, I'm going to teach how are tied

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:16.469
correctly some athletic shoes

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.749
and here's my little trick of the day
many people don't know well tie the

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:23.480
sports shoe feel that these two holes are there for decoration

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.649
and not so

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:27.449
I'll put the shoe so

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:29.149
and just so lost

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.779
So what you see

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:35.139
well these two holes are
for the following

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.759
pick up the sport shoe

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:41.679
We continue with the knot,
is this still here

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:44.949
and the other on here, as followed by

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:49.839
then spare the hole

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:52.479
so now this cord

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:56.049
or the other, I'm just, well, I'll start on the other

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.479
you're going to go through the second hole

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:04.859
but to leave a hollow

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.839
and this other thing itself, through this hole

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:12.169
and let a hollow

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:13.779
and remains so

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:15.049
Maybe now

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.259
I'm going to weave it

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:20.389
this through this hole

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.459
and through this hole

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.839
and would one thing as well

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:30.249
and this is how they are attached correctly
a sports shoe for that are

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:34.869
two holes.Nothing here was pulled today's video, I'm going to run with

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:36.729

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:40.019
already going, wait, fuck

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.739
Nothing... is that me is calling my friend Chewbacca

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.429
