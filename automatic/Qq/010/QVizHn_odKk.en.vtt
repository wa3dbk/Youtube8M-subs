00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.530
 natural but with a light touch 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.690
 sixties eyeliner a few lips rather 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.910
 claritos and especially good ones 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.860
 cheeks that represent a look look 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.739
 healthy let's start with the base of 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.449
 makeup for this and to use studio 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.800
 fix fluid which is a base slightly 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.860
 mate with this brush that is the 190 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.350
 we distribute with the corrector what we are going 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.720
 to try is to illuminate and sculpt 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.100
 certain areas of the face is worth it for that 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.650
 let's apply a little here in the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.510
 outer part of the cheekbone do you like the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.460
 initial to shine he loves me 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.280
 love everything that all those brushes 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.000
 that are soft of the tip is worth 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.330
 have this flexibility in the most 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.350
 outside help to blur and create almost 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.490
 as a trace of a sprinkling of 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.200
 good airbrush here you have a concealer 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.810
 this concealer that you see here dark is a 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.920
 black leather concealer but we're going to 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.930
 use to sculpt 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.260
 the face the only thing we have to do 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.420
 is to mark a little on the cheekbones 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:48.320
 a little bit the root of the forehead and nose 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.939
 with this we will create and it is very 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.430
 simple is a very tanned effect 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.990
 soft and sculptor and just look what 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.750
 what we have to do is spread the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.580
 product and blur it until 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.130
 disappears and creates a veil 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.649
 totally priceless 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.899
 already slightly toasting the skin but 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.590
 toast it in a very subtle way 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.489
 Now this is the cream blusher 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.349
 usually the cream blushes 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.760
 they always use a type of 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.950
 different tool me in this case I'm going 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.079
 to use a tool cuts a 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.480
 classic powder blush brush and 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.799
 we are going to do it but with the rouge in 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.810
 cream the only thing we have to do is 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.019
 try to get the blush to all 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.720
 the fibers for that you apply it or in 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:37.109
 the hand or on a piece of paper and you pass 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.040
 slightly in the center of the cheekbone here 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:42.629
 this black trap is a gel eyeliner 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.659
 that helps us perfectly to perform 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.639
 from the inaccurate smoked eyeliner to 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:51.420
 the most absolutely executions 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:55.409
 precise and perfect we are going to make a 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.510
 small a little wink making him a 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.750
 little bit of corner and we 're going to 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.750
 prolong 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.380
 trying to fit us the most perfect 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.330
 possible look here you have a palette with 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.010
 several colors usually true here 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.190
 There is doubt and that is what we do with so much 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.810
 colour 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.880
 The essential thing is that you have 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.590
 notice that dark colors in looks 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.840
 well traditional where you do not want 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.000
 make large smoked but a note 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.620
 minimum color is that these two colors 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.140
 which are more intense darker 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.940
 fall in the outer area of ​​the 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.370
 eyeliner let's start with the blue 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.280
 Marine 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:36.500
 and the only thing we have to do is with 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:41.230
 the brush 219 let's give it 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.810
 a touch on the root of the eyeliner 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.920
 and let's go lightly little by little 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.930
 blurring the color 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:54.270
 to create a minimum smoky effect 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.010
 to the outside of this palette and everything 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.040
 the content that we are going to use is from the 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.950
 shop collection with shampoo that is a 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.280
 a collection 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.739
 of deep color of inspiration 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.060
 sixties we go to the second color the 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.010
 second color that I'm going to use is this 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.620
 color wine this color wine is going to 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.440
 serve to introduce a second color 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.070
 in a very delicate way we just go 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.620
 to take a little bit of the product and 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:26.630
 apply it 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:30.689
 following the dark blue 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.150
 minimum there is and another little 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:34.610
 Oh 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.980
 and to finish with a little touch of 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.820
 Silver color is a mink silver color 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:44.300
 let's give a little touch 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.070
 in the bottom very little but what 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.770
 enough to tell us something 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.510
 special I think that if we had 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.270
 reduce eye makeup to a 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.980
 element the mascara would be the 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.530
 element truth you do not understand then 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.910
 totally in such a way that the 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.920
 Eyelash masks are capable of 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.310
 frame to illuminate the eyes especially 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.230
 to redraw what and in many cases 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.770
 make a younger appearance more 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:13.670
 childish and why not sexier we go 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:16.420
 there we are going to make up the root well and 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.330
 distribute the product towards the tip 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.000
 also of the collection was obtained 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:25.510
 we have the new ones maybe bold color and 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.520
 flavor is a very appetizing texture nothing 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.000
 annoying is not a the s would be like a 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.790
 whipped lipstick 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.470
 and it's just delicious the touch that 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.110
 leave velvety and you'll see that the 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:40.090
 color in the case of this color that 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:44.000
 flame show game 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:46.550
 it's just beautiful 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.830
 It is very light but what I like the most 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.230
 of the product is that the color is 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.900
 incredibly pretty is very very sexy is 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.460
 as a peach color but also 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.150
 remember the color of the mucosa 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.400
 of the lip is simply precious yes and 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.400
 here you have the look a look I think 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.190
 is 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.380
 to modernize it what so 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.910
 traditional we consider it is whole that 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.970
 is basically focused on an eyeliner 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:14.940
 and the makeup is continuously 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:18.630
 reverberate about the history of 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.880
 black eyeliner eyes a feline effect 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.690
 but also quiet and modern 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.690
 synthetic
