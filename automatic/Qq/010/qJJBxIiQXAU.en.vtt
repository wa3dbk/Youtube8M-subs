and said would you took a point and I
had<00:00:09.940> a<00:00:09.969> reasonably<00:00:10.509> good<00:00:10.570> performance

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:11.169 
had a reasonably good performance

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:12.449 
had a reasonably good performance
against<00:00:11.379> the<00:00:11.469> middle<00:00:11.650> of<00:00:11.709> a<00:00:11.860> side<00:00:12.099> top<00:00:12.339> of<00:00:12.400> the

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:12.459 
against the middle of a side top of the

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.029 
against the middle of a side top of the
league<00:00:12.639> I<00:00:12.849> would<00:00:13.749> have<00:00:13.809> said<00:00:13.959> of<00:00:14.079> course<00:00:14.289> you

league I would have said of course you

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:16.680 
league I would have said of course you
know<00:00:15.129> we're<00:00:15.249> not<00:00:15.339> so<00:00:15.519> greedy<00:00:15.849> but<00:00:16.390> I<00:00:16.480> think

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690 
know we're not so greedy but I think

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.220 
know we're not so greedy but I think
after<00:00:17.130> playing<00:00:18.240> better<00:00:19.240> as<00:00:19.450> a<00:00:19.480> half<00:00:19.750> went<00:00:20.050> on

Lee but we started with a little bit
lower<00:00:24.250> temper<00:00:24.640> than<00:00:24.760> I'd<00:00:24.910> like<00:00:24.940> but<00:00:25.510> we<00:00:25.750> had<00:00:25.840> a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
the look we've got to move the ball

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.540 
the look we've got to move the ball
better<00:00:44.290> second<00:00:44.800> half<00:00:44.829> and<00:00:45.160> we<00:00:45.220> got<00:00:45.340> to<00:00:45.430> move

the ball with a little bit more pace and
a<00:00:47.980> little<00:00:48.160> bit<00:00:48.250> more<00:00:48.399> tempo<00:00:48.880> and<00:00:49.060> certainly

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
a little bit more tempo and certainly

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.660 
a little bit more tempo and certainly
more<00:00:49.570> quality<00:00:50.079> and<00:00:50.410> we<00:00:50.980> didn't<00:00:51.190> manage<00:00:51.280> to<00:00:51.430> do

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
more quality and we didn't manage to do

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.799 
more quality and we didn't manage to do
that<00:00:51.700> you<00:00:52.030> know<00:00:52.120> we<00:00:52.210> looked<00:00:52.360> a<00:00:52.450> little<00:00:52.600> bit

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
that you know we looked a little bit

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.229 
that you know we looked a little bit
edgy<00:00:52.899> on<00:00:53.110> the<00:00:53.230> ball<00:00:53.410> at<00:00:53.559> times<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.910> give<00:00:55.090> them

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
edgy on the ball at times we give them

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.450 
edgy on the ball at times we give them
the<00:00:55.360> one<00:00:55.570> chance<00:00:55.930> from<00:00:56.410> a<00:00:56.440> poor<00:00:56.739> clearance<00:00:56.950> and

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
the one chance from a poor clearance and

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.880 
the one chance from a poor clearance and
poor<00:00:57.670> decisions<00:00:58.180> at<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:58.300> back<00:00:58.570> and<00:00:59.500> Bamford

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
poor decisions at the back and Bamford

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.170 
poor decisions at the back and Bamford
only<00:01:00.100> needs<00:01:00.309> one<00:01:00.430> chance<00:01:00.820> that's<00:01:01.059> what

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
only needs one chance that's what

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.120 
only needs one chance that's what
quality<00:01:01.600> players<00:01:01.840> can<00:01:02.050> do<00:01:02.230> to<00:01:02.380> you<00:01:02.500> and<00:01:02.680> that

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
quality players can do to you and that

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.490 
quality players can do to you and that
was<00:01:03.250> a<00:01:03.280> disappointment<00:01:03.940> then<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:05.199> then<00:01:05.470> we

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
was a disappointment then and then we

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.000 
was a disappointment then and then we
responded<00:01:06.220> okay<00:01:06.900> should<00:01:07.900> have<00:01:08.049> really<00:01:08.530> took<00:01:08.950> a

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
responded okay should have really took a

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.070 
responded okay should have really took a
chance<00:01:09.400> to<00:01:09.909> win<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.090> game<00:01:10.240> couldn't<00:01:10.900> manage

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
chance to win the game couldn't manage

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.200 
chance to win the game couldn't manage
to<00:01:11.320> do<00:01:11.440> so<00:01:11.470> and<00:01:12.340> that<00:01:12.490> was<00:01:12.610> a<00:01:12.640> disappointment

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
to do so and that was a disappointment

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.090 
to do so and that was a disappointment
really<00:01:13.630> not<00:01:13.780> necessarily<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.590> end<00:01:14.620> result

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
really not necessarily the end result

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.190 
really not necessarily the end result
bluffing<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.729> way<00:01:15.880> we<00:01:16.090> perhaps<00:01:16.299> should<00:01:17.110> have

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
bluffing the way we perhaps should have

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.750 
bluffing the way we perhaps should have
played<00:01:17.380> with<00:01:17.560> a<00:01:17.590> little<00:01:17.770> more<00:01:17.979> quality<00:01:18.460> second

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
played with a little more quality second

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.750 
played with a little more quality second
half<00:01:19.200> overall<00:01:20.200> this<00:01:20.380> is<00:01:21.010> against<00:01:21.460> a<00:01:21.520> team<00:01:21.729> that

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
half overall this is against a team that

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.580 
half overall this is against a team that
went<00:01:22.240> top<00:01:22.479> of<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.720> championship<00:01:22.900> and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
went top of the championship and

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.070 
went top of the championship and
obviously<00:01:24.159> you<00:01:24.430> know<00:01:24.640> it<00:01:24.909> ultimately<00:01:25.690> a<00:01:25.780> draw

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
obviously you know it ultimately a draw

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.770 
obviously you know it ultimately a draw
maybe<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:26.920> good<00:01:27.159> result<00:01:27.430> well<00:01:28.299> it<00:01:28.420> isn't<00:01:28.630> a

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
maybe is a good result well it isn't a

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.690 
maybe is a good result well it isn't a
minute<00:01:29.110> you<00:01:29.260> know<00:01:29.530> it<00:01:29.710> carries<00:01:30.010> on<00:01:30.189> the<00:01:30.490> runner

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
minute you know it carries on the runner

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.280 
minute you know it carries on the runner
games<00:01:31.000> where<00:01:31.270> we're<00:01:31.420> picking<00:01:31.540> points<00:01:32.049> up<00:01:32.170> but

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
games where we're picking points up but

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
move you around the picture make you

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.370 
move you around the picture make you
work<00:01:50.830> really<00:01:51.070> hard<00:01:51.780> some<00:01:52.780> place<00:01:52.990> with<00:01:53.110> lots<00:01:53.259> of

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
work really hard some place with lots of

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.429 
work really hard some place with lots of
aspects<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:54.130> I'm<00:01:54.250> pleased<00:01:54.820> with<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:56.200> point

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
aspects and I'm pleased with the point

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:57.899 
aspects and I'm pleased with the point
but<00:01:56.680> I'm<00:01:56.770> just<00:01:56.979> disappointed<00:01:57.220> we<00:01:57.880> couldn't

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
but I'm just disappointed we couldn't

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.090 
but I'm just disappointed we couldn't
take<00:01:58.420> advantage<00:01:58.600> of<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.140> great<00:01:59.350> position<00:01:59.650> that

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
take advantage of a great position that

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.429 
take advantage of a great position that
we've<00:02:00.250> worked<00:02:00.280> hard<00:02:00.610> to<00:02:00.939> get<00:02:01.060> in<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:02.350> I<00:02:02.409> think

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
we've worked hard to get in and I think

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.319 
we've worked hard to get in and I think
that<00:02:02.740> just<00:02:02.920> comes<00:02:03.130> down<00:02:03.250> really<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:04.030> being<00:02:04.270> a

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
that just comes down really to being a

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.030 
that just comes down really to being a
little<00:02:04.509> bit<00:02:04.689> braver<00:02:04.960> on<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.290> ball<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:05.710> moving

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
little bit braver on the ball and moving

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.100 
little bit braver on the ball and moving
the<00:02:06.130> ball<00:02:06.159> with<00:02:07.000> a<00:02:07.030> lot<00:02:07.240> more<00:02:07.420> quality<00:02:07.930> than

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
the ball with a lot more quality than

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.050 
the ball with a lot more quality than
we'd<00:02:08.259> hoped<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.590> do<00:02:08.709> there's<00:02:09.640> obviously<00:02:09.759> a

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
we'd hoped to do there's obviously a

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.300 
we'd hoped to do there's obviously a
great<00:02:10.420> chance<00:02:10.810> in<00:02:10.989> stoppage<00:02:11.349> time<00:02:11.380> which<00:02:11.800> you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
great chance in stoppage time which you

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.559 
great chance in stoppage time which you
could<00:02:12.489> have<00:02:12.580> taken<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.940> game<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.270> when<00:02:13.390> it

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
could have taken the game and when it

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.720 
could have taken the game and when it
yes<00:02:14.260> yeah<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.739> moment<00:02:14.890> those<00:02:15.219> chances<00:02:15.670> just

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
yes yeah the moment those chances just

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.069 
yes yeah the moment those chances just
don't<00:02:16.060> seem<00:02:16.299> to<00:02:16.329> be<00:02:16.480> going<00:02:16.569> in<00:02:16.749> the<00:02:16.810> back<00:02:16.959> of

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
don't seem to be going in the back of

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.780 
don't seem to be going in the back of
the<00:02:17.140> net<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.439> and<00:02:17.709> I<00:02:17.920> thought<00:02:18.310> Clayton<00:02:18.639> was

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
the net and and I thought Clayton was

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.039 
the net and and I thought Clayton was
excellent<00:02:19.180> tonight<00:02:19.420> for<00:02:19.629> he's<00:02:19.749> one<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:19.930> our

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
excellent tonight for he's one of our

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.050 
excellent tonight for he's one of our
best<00:02:20.079> players<00:02:20.409> for<00:02:20.859> physically<00:02:21.489> imposed

best players for physically imposed

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.660 
best players for physically imposed
himself<00:02:22.269> on<00:02:22.629> the<00:02:22.749> game<00:02:23.280> just<00:02:24.280> not<00:02:24.459> quite

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
himself on the game just not quite

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.860 
himself on the game just not quite
getting<00:02:24.909> a<00:02:25.090> robot<00:02:25.329> agreeing<00:02:25.629> with<00:02:25.719> those

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
getting a robot agreeing with those

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.839 
getting a robot agreeing with those
chances<00:02:26.349> but<00:02:26.530> we're<00:02:26.680> creating<00:02:27.159> them<00:02:27.340> and

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
chances but we're creating them and

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.280 
chances but we're creating them and
that's<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.209> biggest<00:02:28.420> thing<00:02:28.629> you<00:02:28.989> know<00:02:29.109> those

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
that's the biggest thing you know those

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.530 
that's the biggest thing you know those
chances<00:02:29.680> will<00:02:29.829> come<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.790> at<00:02:30.909> the<00:02:31.030> moment<00:02:31.060> if

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
chances will come and at the moment if

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.449 
chances will come and at the moment if
you<00:02:31.629> look<00:02:31.840> at<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:31.989> games<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.680> know<00:02:33.310> we

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
you look at the games you know we

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.160 
you look at the games you know we
certainly<00:02:33.849> could<00:02:34.060> have<00:02:34.180> another<00:02:34.450> four<00:02:34.780> points

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
certainly could have another four points

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.349 
certainly could have another four points
easily<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:36.250> know<00:02:36.370> turn<00:02:36.609> two<00:02:36.879> of<00:02:37.000> those<00:02:37.090> wins

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
easily you know turn two of those wins

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.629 
easily you know turn two of those wins
into<00:02:37.719> drawers<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:38.319> we'd<00:02:38.889> be<00:02:39.040> looking<00:02:39.189> even

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:39.639 
into drawers and we'd be looking even

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.429 
into drawers and we'd be looking even
better<00:02:39.669> in<00:02:39.969> a<00:02:40.030> table<00:02:40.450> so<00:02:40.629> I<00:02:40.840> think<00:02:41.049> it's<00:02:41.319> a

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
better in a table so I think it's a

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.289 
better in a table so I think it's a
testament<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.950> how<00:02:42.010> far<00:02:42.310> we've<00:02:42.340> come<00:02:42.519> but<00:02:43.090> we

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
testament of how far we've come but we

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.670 
testament of how far we've come but we
want<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.510> go<00:02:43.629> further<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:44.230> know<00:02:44.319> we<00:02:44.439> want<00:02:44.590> to

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
want to go further you know we want to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.959 
want to go further you know we want to
get<00:02:44.769> better<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.249> want<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.400> keep<00:02:45.549> improving

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:45.969 
get better and want to keep improving

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:49.229 
get better and want to keep improving
and<00:02:46.439> at<00:02:47.439> the<00:02:47.530> moment<00:02:47.680> working<00:02:48.280> very<00:02:48.430> hard<00:02:48.549> but

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
and at the moment working very hard but

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.759 
and at the moment working very hard but
not<00:02:49.389> quite<00:02:49.629> managing<00:02:50.049> to<00:02:50.169> kill<00:02:50.319> games<00:02:50.560> off

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
not quite managing to kill games off

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.500 
not quite managing to kill games off
which<00:02:50.950> is<00:02:51.069> a<00:02:51.099> disappointment<00:02:51.849> but<00:02:51.879> it's<00:02:52.480> a

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
off what was the situation there I think

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.330 
off what was the situation there I think
he's<00:02:58.750> made<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.930> side<00:02:59.260> foot<00:02:59.530> block<00:02:59.859> and<00:03:00.129> he's

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
he's made a side foot block and he's

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.189 
he's made a side foot block and he's
opened<00:03:00.790> his<00:03:00.879> knee<00:03:01.060> up<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.329> little<00:03:01.569> bit<00:03:01.719> and

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:02.199 
opened his knee up a little bit and

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.659 
opened his knee up a little bit and
sometimes<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:02.709> just<00:03:02.829> stretch<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.219> ligaments

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:03.669 
sometimes you just stretch the ligaments

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:04.500 
sometimes you just stretch the ligaments
and<00:03:03.730> he<00:03:03.849> looked<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.120> little<00:03:04.269> bit<00:03:04.449> uncomfortable
