really<00:01:54.630> what<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.840> want<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.050> look<00:01:55.140> out<00:01:55.289> for<00:01:55.350> is

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
really what you want to look out for is

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.960 
really what you want to look out for is
that<00:01:55.800> move<00:01:56.070> right<00:01:56.250> there<00:01:56.310> where<00:01:56.610> he<00:01:56.640> throws

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
that move right there where he throws

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.090 
that move right there where he throws
the<00:01:57.149> sword<00:01:57.360> at<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.750> that's<00:01:58.530> usually<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.920> most

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the sword at you that's usually the most

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.490 
the sword at you that's usually the most
damaging<00:01:59.670> well<00:02:00.570> actually<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:01.050> jumps<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.470> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
damaging well actually this jumps in the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.499 
damaging well actually this jumps in the
statement<00:02:01.800> during<00:02:02.039> buds<00:02:02.310> you're<00:02:03.180> more<00:02:03.300> likely

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
statement during buds you're more likely

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.350 
statement during buds you're more likely
to<00:02:03.720> be<00:02:03.810> hit<00:02:03.990> by<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.200> sword<00:02:04.610> at<00:02:05.610> least<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:06.119> my

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
to be hit by the sword at least in my

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.550 
to be hit by the sword at least in my
experience

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.890 

again<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.459> want<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.730> try<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> stay<00:02:12.390> away<00:02:12.599> from<00:02:12.630> it

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
again I want to try to stay away from it

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.540 
again I want to try to stay away from it
not<00:02:13.319> too<00:02:13.530> far<00:02:13.709> away<00:02:13.770> but<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.130> don't<00:02:14.280> want<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.459> get

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
not too far away but I don't want to get
