 but never disappoints like that is the little 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.080

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.120
 become the new south thanks to 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.010
 its different attributes large space 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.660
 low maintenance cost and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.920
 a very attractive price are the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.350
 letters of introduction from this 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.000
 subcompact that despite its few years in 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.670

 best- selling model in the country if very by 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.010
 above the south the instant this one knows very 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.170
 well what the client of this kind of 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.700
 cars search and that's functionality the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.850
 Board follows the steps of the design 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.200
 outside when employing discrete lines that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.790
 result in a cabin 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.850
 simple that puts the driver's hand 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.989
 all the necessary controls when you play 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.700
 talk about the quality of the interior 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.590
 go on meets his first 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.270
 important stumbling beyond that the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.890
 board design you like the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.100
 plastics used for its manufacture 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.199
 they are perceived cheap in general they are all 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.300
 hard and shiny but you do not either 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.000
 Alarms should not confuse quality with 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.890
 durability , the interior of the cabin 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.540
 from nissan versa it shows very well armed 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.290
 and quite resistant to the passage of 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.330
 years 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.830
 it's hard to find a car that from 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.720
 its entry version offers air 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.670
 conditioning electrical equipment equipment 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.230
 sound with auxiliary input 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.750
 four-speaker ipod compatibility 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.460
 steering wheel controls on button 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.980
 smart key travel computer 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.070
 Handsfree via bluetooth control 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.130
 cruising speed double bag alarm 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.560
 of air and reverse abs brakes and it's one 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.570
 of these cars and it obviously does so for 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.610
 compensate everything everything the quality 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.110
 of the interior left us to wish and the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.450
 new emotions that his 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.190
 Exterior design is a very simple car 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.580
 but that comes with many very 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.950
 parents the instant you are fasting under the 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.869
 chest and this is that to move it travels 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.700
 a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.640
 liters that develops 106 horses of 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.740
 force and 105 foot pounds of torque now 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.810
 this seems not much but it's more than 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.860
 enough with a car like this one this 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.940
 motor can be combined with a 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.940
 five-speed manual transmission 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.680
 or an automatic of 4 many people 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.290
 wonder if this engine is the same 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.509
 south of the stage or the trio but it's not 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.340
 none of these is an engine that 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.210
 manufactures exclusively for nissan der 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.160
 he 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.660
 the economic and very old engine of the south 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.580
 is going to go to the grave with insurance 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.190
 when that does not leave the market the engine 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.930
 1.6 to relax does not shine for its 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.180
 Accelerating response deals a little 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.310
 of fraud does not feel like a sports 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.110
 because it is not, but thanks to the bass 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.330
 car weight the engine does not need more 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.970
 what a hundred foot-pounds of torque 105 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.160
 foot pounds of torque to move with 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.750
 a certain ease for nothing 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.730
 sports sensations as we said 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.010
 before its strong point obviously are the 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.900
 fuel consumption in the city 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.880
 can reach up to 15 kilometers 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.760
 liter and on the road a lot very much 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.320
 more than that almost 20 plus the fact 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.740
 that is a nissan engine ensures 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.300
 Reliability and low repair cost 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.340
 for all these reasons the bersa is the 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.090
 third best-selling car in all of Mexico 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.090
