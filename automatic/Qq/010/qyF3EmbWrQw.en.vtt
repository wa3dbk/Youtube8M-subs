around like idiots so no matter what you
still<00:04:00.510> say<00:04:00.960> but<00:04:01.650> most<00:04:01.860> of<00:04:02.070> them<00:04:02.160> after<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:02.760> while

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
still say but most of them after a while

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.660 
still say but most of them after a while
we<00:04:03.240> start<00:04:03.540> doing<00:04:03.660> that<00:04:03.980> running<00:04:04.980> around<00:04:05.220> and

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
we start doing that running around and

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.740 
we start doing that running around and
then<00:04:05.850> if<00:04:05.940> they<00:04:06.060> don't<00:04:06.240> do<00:04:06.360> that<00:04:06.510> right<00:04:06.690> away

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
then if they don't do that right away

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.210 
then if they don't do that right away
they'll<00:04:07.140> start<00:04:07.380> your<00:04:07.560> run<00:04:07.740> around<00:04:07.950> like<00:04:08.040> it

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220

eats<00:04:08.370> for<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.640> minute<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.060> then<00:04:09.720> we'll<00:04:09.780> get<00:04:10.110> a

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
eats for a minute and then we'll get a

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.690 
eats for a minute and then we'll get a
pile<00:04:10.470> up<00:04:10.740> and<00:04:10.950> then<00:04:11.040> they'll<00:04:11.190> start<00:04:11.310> doing

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
pile up and then they'll start doing

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.420 
pile up and then they'll start doing
