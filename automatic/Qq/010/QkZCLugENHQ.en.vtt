 Hi everyone, Hum now I will show you how to do chrysanthemum flower :) 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 This is only an average level (later there are many more difficult hehe). 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.700
 The first is to outline a few basic lines, including oval lines and axes (where the flower is headed, where the axle is pointing). 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.000
 It is fine to skip, but the drawing is not used to be distorted. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Chrysanthemum, there are many layers, so it is ok to draw a 3-piece shape 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 As I said in the previous post, continue to outline the details of the flower. 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:46.000
 These are some pictures of daisies &gt;&gt; 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.479
 Depending on the angle of the wing it is different. The more the angle, the more natural and true the flower looks :) 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Out of whack. Drawing this is not difficult, but it is important to keep its "configuration" right. The weightless drawing is often caused by a lot of laziness, so I always leave out the sketchy steps. 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:31.700
 As for the axes, there is no need to draw straight lines, but to determine the right direction. The flower face is way wa on the right, don't draw it back to the left :) * say this is useless:)) * 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 Please turn :))
