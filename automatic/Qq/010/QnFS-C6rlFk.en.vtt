but<00:00:27.570> my<00:00:27.689> hair<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:27.900> short<00:00:28.380> at<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.560> top<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.130> it

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
but my hair is short at the top so it

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.400 
but my hair is short at the top so it
didn't<00:00:29.519> like<00:00:29.670> look<00:00:30.449> good<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.900> wasn't<00:00:31.230> really

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
didn't like look good it wasn't really

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.229 
didn't like look good it wasn't really
for<00:00:31.740> me<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.890> had<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.160> put<00:00:32.340> tracks<00:00:32.579> at<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> top<00:00:33.030> to

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
for me I had to put tracks at the top to

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.720 
for me I had to put tracks at the top to
cover<00:00:33.390> up<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.719> links<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.829> i<00:00:34.860> am<00:00:35.250> just<00:00:35.280> saying

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
cover up the links so i am just saying

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.819 
cover up the links so i am just saying
that<00:00:35.940> if<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.149> have<00:00:36.270> short<00:00:36.300> hair<00:00:36.600> micro<00:00:37.530> links

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
that if you have short hair micro links

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.819 
that if you have short hair micro links
is<00:00:37.980> probably<00:00:38.309> not<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.610> best<00:00:38.820> option<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.390> you

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
is probably not the best option for you

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.170 
is probably not the best option for you
and<00:00:40.829> also<00:00:41.040> i<00:00:41.219> have<00:00:41.399> short<00:00:41.640> hair<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.910> clip-ins

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
and also i have short hair so clip-ins

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.510 
and also i have short hair so clip-ins

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
out so that's a plus and the hair is

out so that's a plus and the hair is
really<00:04:28.860> soft<00:04:29.160> I'm<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:30.210> 26<00:04:30.690> inch<00:04:30.900> which<00:04:31.260> is<00:04:31.290> the

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
really soft I'm the 26 inch which is the

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.360 
really soft I'm the 26 inch which is the
top<00:04:31.830> one<00:04:33.590> it<00:04:35.030> it<00:04:36.030> came<00:04:36.450> in<00:04:36.840> like<00:04:37.770> a<00:04:37.830> wavy

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
top one it it came in like a wavy

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.370 
top one it it came in like a wavy
pattern<00:04:38.760> so<00:04:39.030> I<00:04:39.060> really<00:04:39.479> liked<00:04:39.690> that<00:04:39.840> I<00:04:40.020> thought

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
pattern so I really liked that I thought

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.719 
pattern so I really liked that I thought
that<00:04:40.530> was<00:04:40.680> nice<00:04:40.919> because<00:04:41.190> I<00:04:41.400> mean<00:04:41.640> I<00:04:41.669> guess

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
that was nice because I mean I guess

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.969 
that was nice because I mean I guess
that<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.120> person's<00:04:42.510> hair<00:04:43.110> must<00:04:43.740> have<00:04:43.860> been

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
that the person's hair must have been

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.540 
that the person's hair must have been
naturally<00:04:44.490> wavy<00:04:44.669> uh<00:04:45.080> at<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.169> con<00:04:46.560> but<00:04:47.400> it

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
naturally wavy uh at a con but it

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.070 
naturally wavy uh at a con but it
doesn't<00:04:47.790> really<00:04:47.850> count<00:04:48.000> as<00:04:48.300> a<00:04:48.360> con<00:04:48.720> because

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
doesn't really count as a con because

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.900 
doesn't really count as a con because
it's<00:04:49.229> two<00:04:49.410> different<00:04:49.590> types<00:04:49.890> of<00:04:50.040> hair<00:04:50.280> so<00:04:50.610> I

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
it's two different types of hair so I

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.550 
it's two different types of hair so I
mean<00:04:51.540> I<00:04:51.570> must<00:04:51.690> have<00:04:51.810> been<00:04:51.930> from<00:04:52.140> two<00:04:52.350> different

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
mean I must have been from two different

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.820 
mean I must have been from two different
people<00:04:52.979> but<00:04:53.190> this<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:54.090> top<00:04:54.330> 26<00:04:55.169> inch<00:04:55.590> right

do<00:07:10.250> that<00:07:10.370> they're<00:07:10.880> allowed<00:07:11.150> to<00:07:11.180> say<00:07:11.510> it's<00:07:11.630> one

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:11.780 
do that they're allowed to say it's one

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.450

hundred<00:07:11.900> percent<00:07:12.080> human<00:07:12.590> hair<00:07:12.800> and<00:07:12.980> it's<00:07:13.100> not

noticed that a lot of companies use

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.280 
noticed that a lot of companies use
filler<00:07:18.800> hairs<00:07:19.160> which<00:07:20.120> shook<00:07:20.420> on<00:07:20.630> sometimes

can<00:07:21.530> be<00:07:21.560> synthetic<00:07:21.950> hairs<00:07:22.340> or<00:07:22.580> sometimes<00:07:23.060> can

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 
can be synthetic hairs or sometimes can

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.050
