00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello how are you to see that I still do not 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.379
 you know I am valeri and I ask you 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.360
 apologies for having been absent the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.230
 previous weeks is that it has really 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.749
 really been busy and today I 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.759
 I bring a super special video something very 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.710
 personal because of weeks 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.769
 previous that I was absent came up in 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.990
 me a sudden super acne breakouts and 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.689
 super crazy to say it 's something 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.970
 normal also in me if I want to know the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.910
 reasons why they fall on the esma 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.390
 that is until the end of the video today them 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.690
 I'm going to teach tricks to get rid of 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.180
 acne apparently with makeups and 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.260
 super easy tricks to cover those 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.480
 little marquitas the nuggets 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:52.550
 temporarily I hope you like it and that 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.550
 work for them and start employment 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
 ah 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.090
 the first thing we will use is a proofreader 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.489
 we will use the orange part to correct 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.750
 the imperfections placed the concealer 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.750
 in the red part 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.890
 and then blur it 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.140
 then I will use this style base from which 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.630
 I consider it the best in the world 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.310
 because it covers up the stretch marks the bad is 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.750
 They sold me very white but 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.159
 then I will improve it with my powder 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.649
 compact 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.219
 you must apply the base on the entire face 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.219
 with a brush 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.509
 I apply a little concealer in the color 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.509
 banana to hide more dark circles 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.830
 then with my compact mac powder 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.830
 unified everything 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.540
 then some blogs and ready 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.560
 I know we are waiting for the end of the 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.460
 video to tell them the reason why 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.100
 which I relapse in this atc I do not want them 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.590
 tell my experience in acne because 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.420
 I think in the acne video is that it 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.960
 I'm going to leave you down here in case you have 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.930
 some doubt me when I was 14 years old 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.090
 I actually started with this acne me 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.040
 came out an outbreak I thought it was normal 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.410
 of normal adolescence of age 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.830
 but it turns out that it was not like that it was an acne 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.040
 genetic and hormonal had to do with the 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:41.000
 purely hormonal and genetic genetics 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.850
 I was referred to a gynecologist and the 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.620
 gynecologist prescribed me some pills with 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.990
 those pills and together with some 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.709
 pills that the dermatologist prescribed 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:54.380
 everything seemed to go super well and I healed 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.700
 then about three years later I went back to 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.090
 relapse 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.250
 with an acne similar to what I have now 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.310
 I ride again to the pills and 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.810
 well my skin got perfect so 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.420
 as you know me with my skin 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.989
 super lawful as super perfect skin me 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.390
 I did the cers took me off occasionally 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:17.060
 microdermabrasion is sorry 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.330
 all those treatments so that the face 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.090
 be super ready and super beautiful and my face 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:27.020
 it was apparently perfect but then 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.950
 a few months ago here two weeks ago 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.080
 fell madly back into acne 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.080
 call the doctor I wrote you I'm a 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.420
 drama queen I have to accept it but the 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.550
 doctor received me because she already knows how 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.290
 it's me and he said he had to have 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.810
 a lot of patience because this is something that 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.150
 is in me 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.850
 and because it is genetic and hormonal I 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.850
 they referred again to the gynecologist and 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.970
 I am again in this process that 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.250
 apparently I was not cured at all 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.440
 what I see 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.650
 they sent me to do a lot of exams 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.540
 it's very super long process and I'm 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.270
 now living with those already thanks to 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.220
 God, I'm calmer with acne 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.590
 because the outbreak is already ceasing is is 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.940
 ending because I attack it in time and 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.100
 the advice I want to give you is that if 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.620
 you have acne is for a very reason 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.480
 different from mine may be the 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.240
 food may be genetics 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.970
 it may be hormonal there are very many 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.550
 things that affect them in you because 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.919
 each person is different then I do not 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.600
 I can recommend something to you that is 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.940
 real and there are many many soaps 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.130
 creams many things that you can use but 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.380
 you have to discover the real cause of 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.510
 I went back because if not then it's not going to 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.220
 serve you anything you throw Ã¡vila 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.020
 wash your face that's what you wash your 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.520
 masks that you milk you have to 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.440
 first see where you come from where 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.050
 then this is the only recommendation 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.330
 that power and this is my my story 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.819
 briefly told 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.009
 the acne and the annoying that has been in 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:59.949
 my life but I have learned to deal with 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:02.800
 honey over time and actually 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.139
 I do not care so much and do not believe that 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.629
 not something like that on the street always 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.300
 with everything covered I do not try to use 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:12.340
 super light makeup so that I do not 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.099
 piquen do not bother me because the truth 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.050
 when when I'm super makeup I 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.240
 It bothers me a lot if I have pimples on my face 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.400
 I prefer that you see them I do not care 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.189
 really if I have devil is something super 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.500
 normal there are people who have things 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:29.409
 worse and they go down the street super happy 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.319
 and acne is something super normal so 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:34.300
 we should not be covering what this only 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:36.340
 for special cases I want to be very 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.719
 I 'm going to use it every day 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.699
 because there they are really going to get 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:41.530
 face his profile 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.680
 this was all for today's video I hope 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.169
 that the truth they liked that they have 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.360
 taken my advice my experience in 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.189
 this of acne if you want more videos 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.319
 about acne because you can write a 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:56.590
 book if you want I can make you thousands of 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:06:00.520
 documentary videos of tutorials all 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.450
 the acne we see the next video the 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.570
 I want so much 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.570
 bye
