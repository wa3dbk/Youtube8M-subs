with<00:00:37.700> the<00:00:37.820> life<00:00:37.970> of<00:00:38.090> me<00:00:38.210> what<00:00:38.360> it<00:00:38.480> was<00:00:38.630> I

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
with the life of me what it was I

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.830 
with the life of me what it was I
probably<00:00:39.290> should<00:00:39.500> have<00:00:39.530> checked<00:00:39.650> and<00:00:40.780> but<00:00:41.780> it

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
probably should have checked and but it

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.360 
probably should have checked and but it
was<00:00:41.960> it's<00:00:42.260> not<00:00:42.350> one<00:00:42.560> of<00:00:42.590> these<00:00:42.740> I've<00:00:42.920> got<00:00:42.980> now

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
was it's not one of these I've got now

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.120 
was it's not one of these I've got now
that's<00:00:44.240> a<00:00:44.510> different<00:00:45.170> one<00:00:45.260> but<00:00:45.770> yeah<00:00:45.950> it's

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
that's a different one but yeah it's

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.550 
that's a different one but yeah it's
it's<00:00:46.430> from<00:00:46.700> one<00:00:46.880> of<00:00:46.970> them<00:00:47.150> it's<00:00:48.110> really<00:00:48.230> easy

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
it's from one of them it's really easy

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.030 
it's from one of them it's really easy
to<00:00:48.680> get<00:00:49.450> but<00:00:50.450> it's<00:00:50.690> sort<00:00:51.050> of<00:00:51.110> a<00:00:51.200> powered<00:00:51.530> it's

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
to get but it's sort of a powered it's

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.800 
to get but it's sort of a powered it's

definitely gonna get nerfed at some
point<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:30.700> basically<00:01:31.700> because<00:01:32.270> not<00:01:33.229> only<00:01:33.259> can

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
point and basically because not only can

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.499 
point and basically because not only can
use<00:01:33.710> it<00:01:33.829> in<00:01:33.950> turn<00:01:34.189> dungeons<00:01:34.759> like<00:01:34.969> you<00:01:35.240> can<00:01:35.390> use

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
use it in turn dungeons like you can use

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.319 
use it in turn dungeons like you can use
it<00:01:35.630> in<00:01:35.719> ever<00:01:35.869> bloom<00:01:36.170> as<00:01:36.590> I'll<00:01:36.799> show<00:01:36.950> you<00:01:37.009> where

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
because it's all deemed as an outside

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.590 
because it's all deemed as an outside
area<00:01:39.710> you<00:01:40.520> can<00:01:40.700> use<00:01:40.880> it<00:01:41.030> in

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
area you can use it in

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.690 
area you can use it in
battlegrounds<00:01:42.350> as<00:01:42.560> you'll<00:01:43.039> once<00:01:43.219> again<00:01:43.490> see

later when I cap the flag when I take

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.999 
later when I cap the flag when I take
the<00:01:46.310> fly<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.789> Horde<00:01:46.969> flag<00:01:47.270> run<00:01:47.869> outside<00:01:48.289> use

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
it and just go to might leave us out in

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.669 
it and just go to might leave us out in
my<00:01:50.479> base<00:01:50.659> I<00:01:50.840> died<00:01:51.020> actually<00:01:51.109> copy<00:01:51.439> because

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
my base I died actually copy because

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.230 
my base I died actually copy because
they've<00:01:51.799> got<00:01:51.950> our<00:01:52.069> flag<00:01:52.310> but<00:01:52.819> it's<00:01:52.939> just<00:01:53.090> to

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
they've got our flag but it's just to

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.419 
they've got our flag but it's just to
basically<00:01:53.479> show<00:01:53.869> off<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.170> fact<00:01:54.350> that<00:01:54.429> what

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
basically show off the fact that what

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.459 
basically show off the fact that what
you<00:01:55.520> can<00:01:55.639> actually<00:01:55.729> do<00:01:55.999> with<00:01:56.030> this<00:01:56.359> like<00:01:57.020> it's

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
you can actually do with this like it's

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:58.779 
you can actually do with this like it's
gonna<00:01:57.679> be<00:01:57.859> stopped<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:58.249> you<00:01:58.340> can't<00:01:58.520> use<00:01:58.639> in

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
gonna be stopped so you can't use in

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.129 
gonna be stopped so you can't use in
battlegrounds<00:01:59.329> I<00:01:59.389> know<00:01:59.450> that<00:01:59.929> for<00:02:00.109> sure

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:00.139 
battlegrounds I know that for sure

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:01.569 
battlegrounds I know that for sure
because<00:02:00.499> at<00:02:00.709> the<00:02:00.799> moment<00:02:01.100> is<00:02:01.159> stupidly

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
because at the moment is stupidly

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.969 
because at the moment is stupidly
overpowered<00:02:01.689> there's<00:02:02.689> even<00:02:02.959> talk<00:02:03.319> of<00:02:03.380> like<00:02:03.709> I

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
overpowered there's even talk of like I

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.489 
overpowered there's even talk of like I
forget<00:02:04.850> what<00:02:04.969> the<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.389> bar<00:02:05.869> grounds<00:02:06.229> called

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:06.499 
forget what the the bar grounds called

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:07.809 
forget what the the bar grounds called
but<00:02:06.709> the<00:02:06.770> one<00:02:06.920> we<00:02:07.009> need<00:02:07.159> to<00:02:07.219> get<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.459> car<00:02:07.639> for

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
but the one we need to get the car for

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:08.919 
but the one we need to get the car for
once<00:02:07.969> entity<00:02:08.240> I<00:02:08.300> mean<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.509> slows<00:02:08.750> you<00:02:08.899> down

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
once entity I mean it slows you down

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.199 
once entity I mean it slows you down
when<00:02:09.259> you<00:02:09.350> pull<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:09.709> you<00:02:09.890> can<00:02:10.490> actually<00:02:10.640> use<00:02:11.060> it

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
when you pull it you can actually use it

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.760 
when you pull it you can actually use it
when<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:11.390> have<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.510> car<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.410> move<00:02:12.620> at

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
when you have the car and you move at

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.860 
when you have the car and you move at
the<00:02:12.920> same<00:02:13.100> speed<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.880> just<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.540> cap<00:02:14.720> it

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
the same speed and you just you cap it

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.710 
the same speed and you just you cap it
so<00:02:15.050> quickly<00:02:15.290> it's<00:02:16.030> it's<00:02:17.030> ridiculous<00:02:17.450> it

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
so quickly it's it's ridiculous it

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.300 
so quickly it's it's ridiculous it
really<00:02:18.140> does<00:02:18.319> need<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.530> nerf<00:02:18.769> so<00:02:19.069> that<00:02:19.189> I'll<00:02:19.250> be

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
really does need a nerf so that I'll be

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.369
