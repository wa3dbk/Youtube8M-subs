really<00:03:43.000> really<00:03:43.240> like<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.510> draft<00:03:43.810> I<00:03:44.110> just<00:03:44.800> said

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
really really like the draft I just said

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.440 
really really like the draft I just said
they<00:03:45.040> have<00:03:45.160> everything<00:03:45.610> going<00:03:45.640> for<00:03:45.910> them<00:03:46.090> and

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
they have everything going for them and

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.110 
they have everything going for them and
I<00:03:46.930> mean<00:03:47.740> a<00:03:47.770> lot<00:03:47.890> of<00:03:48.070> that<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.459> S<00:03:48.580> has<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.970> do

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
I mean a lot of that the S has to do

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.449 
I mean a lot of that the S has to do
with<00:03:49.360> top<00:03:50.110> lane<00:03:50.350> but<00:03:50.530> I<00:03:50.650> think<00:03:50.950> that<00:03:51.100> even<00:03:51.250> with

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
with top lane but I think that even with

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.370 
with top lane but I think that even with
a<00:03:51.490> fast<00:03:51.970> blink<00:03:52.300> on<00:03:52.420> accident<00:03:53.110> have<00:03:53.200> really

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
a fast blink on accident have really

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.780 
a fast blink on accident have really
mattered<00:03:53.709> but<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.430> thing<00:03:54.459> that<00:03:54.610> really

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
mattered but the thing that really

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.280 
mattered but the thing that really
helped<00:03:55.120> them<00:03:55.209> snowball<00:03:55.420> was<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.959> clockwork

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
helped them snowball was the clockwork

helped them snowball was the clockwork
