00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
amplifier ever board 93-94 was it

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.020 
amplifier ever board 93-94 was it
something<00:00:31.170> like<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:31.740> but<00:00:32.220> anyway<00:00:32.399> let's

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
something like that but but anyway let's

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.650 
something like that but but anyway let's
uh<00:00:33.149> let's<00:00:33.870> take<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> look<00:00:34.380> at<00:00:34.470> the<00:00:34.590> connections

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
uh let's take a look at the connections

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.990 
uh let's take a look at the connections
take<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.690> look<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> side<00:00:39.980> you<00:00:40.980> have<00:00:41.489> these

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
take a look on the side you have these

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.130 
take a look on the side you have these
two<00:00:42.360> knobs<00:00:43.350> right<00:00:43.649> here<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.579> knob<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.239> going

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
two knobs right here this knob is going

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.060 
two knobs right here this knob is going
to<00:00:46.230> be<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.500> base<00:00:47.510> how<00:00:48.510> much<00:00:48.690> base<00:00:49.050> your<00:00:49.530> son<00:00:49.770> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
to be the base how much base your son to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.110 
to be the base how much base your son to
the<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:51.120> your<00:00:51.300> subs<00:00:51.570> or<00:00:51.930> your<00:00:52.260> speakers

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
this one is this the amount of signal

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.279 
this one is this the amount of signal
that's<00:00:56.219> going<00:00:56.870> to<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:58.820> speakers

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
that's going to your speakers

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.219 
that's going to your speakers
alright<00:01:01.309> this<00:01:02.309> these<00:01:02.940> two<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.270> don't<00:01:04.019> worry

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
alright this these two you don't worry

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.899 
alright this these two you don't worry
about<00:01:04.470> until<00:01:04.739> everything's<00:01:05.220> connected<00:01:05.519> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
about until everything's connected and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.910 
about until everything's connected and
then<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.270> play<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.869> sound<00:01:07.080> those<00:01:07.619> knobs

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
then you play with the sound those knobs

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.880 
then you play with the sound those knobs
to<00:01:08.220> get<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> sound<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.450> way<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.659> want<00:01:10.020> want

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
to get the sound the way you want want

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.620 
to get the sound the way you want want
the<00:01:11.010> speakers<00:01:12.170> ok<00:01:13.369> here<00:01:14.369> take<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:15.060> look<00:01:15.299> here

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
the speakers ok here take a look here

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.160 
the speakers ok here take a look here
the<00:01:15.869> high<00:01:16.020> level<00:01:16.409> inputs<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:18.020> here<00:01:19.020> are<00:01:19.110> your

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the high level inputs and here are your

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.060 
the high level inputs and here are your
RCA<00:01:19.619> s<00:01:19.770> now<00:01:20.700> if<00:01:20.909> your<00:01:21.229> your<00:01:22.229> radio<00:01:22.560> receiver

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
RCA s now if your your radio receiver

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.240 
RCA s now if your your radio receiver
doesn't<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.549> RCA<00:01:24.000> outs<00:01:24.590> these<00:01:25.590> type<00:01:26.070> of

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
doesn't have RCA outs these type of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.429 
doesn't have RCA outs these type of
connections<00:01:26.960> then<00:01:27.960> you're<00:01:28.080> going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.229> have<00:01:28.350> to

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
connections then you're going to have to

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.590 
connections then you're going to have to
use<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.710> high<00:01:28.830> level<00:01:29.220> which<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.610> basically<00:01:30.119> um

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
use the high level which is basically um

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.280 
use the high level which is basically um
like<00:01:31.259> speaker<00:01:31.680> wire<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:33.110> you're<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
like speaker wire and you're going to

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.340 
like speaker wire and you're going to
connect<00:01:34.590> your<00:01:34.920> four<00:01:35.580> wires<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.140> two

your left and your right
into<00:02:00.689> these

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
into these

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.560 
into these
I<00:02:02.870> have<00:02:03.870> to<00:02:03.960> take<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> look<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:06.030> 24

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
I have to take a look you have the 24

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.949 
I have to take a look you have the 24
decibel<00:02:07.050> crossover<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.149> basically

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.390 

meaning<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.260> amplifier<00:02:13.770> as<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:13.980> built-in

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
meaning that the amplifier as a built-in

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.260 
meaning that the amplifier as a built-in
crossover<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:16.280> forget<00:02:17.280> what's<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:17.790> or

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
crossover so I forget what's in or

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.250 
crossover so I forget what's in or
what's<00:02:18.600> out<00:02:18.840> but<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.580> going<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:21.260> change

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
what's out but this is going to change

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.260 
what's out but this is going to change
the<00:02:22.470> amount<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.950> bass<00:02:23.940> going<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.930> speakers

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.479 

and<00:02:31.310> over<00:02:32.310> here<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.550> have<00:02:32.760> your<00:02:33.080> LPL<00:02:34.280> this<00:02:35.280> is

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
and over here you have your LPL this is

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.310 
and over here you have your LPL this is
actually<00:02:35.880> pretty<00:02:36.150> cool<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.870> can<00:02:37.050> buy<00:02:37.290> a

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
actually pretty cool you can buy a

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.840 
actually pretty cool you can buy a
phoenix<00:02:38.250> cold<00:02:39.739> plug<00:02:40.739> that<00:02:41.010> plugs<00:02:41.070> into<00:02:41.550> there

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
phoenix cold plug that plugs into there

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.320 
phoenix cold plug that plugs into there
and<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.360> remote<00:02:42.720> base<00:02:43.110> switch<00:02:44.090> it's<00:02:45.090> a

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
and it's a remote base switch it's a

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.550 
and it's a remote base switch it's a
control<00:02:46.170> knob<00:02:46.380> basically<00:02:47.310> like<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:48.230> but<00:02:49.230> you

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
control knob basically like this but you

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.410 
control knob basically like this but you
can<00:02:49.800> mount<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:52.459> where<00:02:53.459> you<00:02:53.610> can<00:02:53.790> access<00:02:53.970> it

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
can mount it to where you can access it

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.750 
can mount it to where you can access it
like<00:02:54.870> up<00:02:55.260> by<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.620> driver<00:02:55.980> seat<00:02:56.340> or<00:02:56.459> whatever

like up by the driver seat or whatever
so<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.209> have<00:02:57.420> control<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.080> bass<00:02:59.900> alright

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
so you have control of the bass alright

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.600 
so you have control of the bass alright
if<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:02.700> switch<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.060> around<00:03:03.830> here<00:03:04.830> we<00:03:05.010> are<00:03:05.040> here

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
if you switch it around here we are here

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.810

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.550 
positives to the positives and alrights
the<00:03:28.440> negatives<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.130> negatives<00:03:29.840> now<00:03:30.840> also

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
the negatives to the negatives now also

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.620 
the negatives to the negatives now also
you<00:03:31.890> could<00:03:32.100> do<00:03:32.250> with<00:03:32.430> this<00:03:32.579> if<00:03:33.209> you<00:03:33.360> don't<00:03:33.540> want

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
you could do with this if you don't want

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.229 
you could do with this if you don't want
to<00:03:33.810> use<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.079> as<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.980> channel<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:36.060> could

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
to use it as a to channel you could

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.550 
to use it as a to channel you could
bridge<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:38.610> speakers<00:03:39.140> so<00:03:40.140> in<00:03:40.200> other<00:03:40.350> words

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
bridge the speakers so in other words

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.580 
bridge the speakers so in other words
you<00:03:40.739> just<00:03:41.130> going<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.060> use<00:03:42.239> this<00:03:42.660> amplifier<00:03:43.380> to

somewhere<00:04:22.639> that<00:04:23.150> is<00:04:23.270> that<00:04:23.660> is<00:04:23.810> that<00:04:24.500> is<00:04:24.650> very

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
somewhere that is that is that is very

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.850 
somewhere that is that is that is very
necessary

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
necessary

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.670 
necessary
all<00:04:27.860> right<00:04:27.979> the<00:04:28.190> middle<00:04:28.430> one<00:04:28.630> you<00:04:29.630> have<00:04:29.930> your

directly to the negative side of the

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.330 
directly to the negative side of the
battery<00:04:43.820> but<00:04:44.800> you<00:04:45.800> know<00:04:45.889> you're<00:04:46.040> going<00:04:46.130> to<00:04:46.220> use

battery but you know you're going to use

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.279 
battery but you know you're going to use
more<00:04:46.669> wire<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.300> it's<00:04:47.560> usually<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.830> lot<00:04:49.100> harder

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
more wire and it's usually a lot harder

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.080 
more wire and it's usually a lot harder
but<00:04:51.289> in<00:04:51.830> any<00:04:51.979> case<00:04:52.100> you<00:04:52.610> want<00:04:52.850> to<00:04:52.970> make<00:04:53.060> sure

don't want to do is run this to your
battery<00:06:07.250> positive<00:06:08.590> what<00:06:09.590> that<00:06:09.830> means<00:06:10.070> is<00:06:10.400> if

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
battery positive what that means is if

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.810 
battery positive what that means is if
you<00:06:11.120> do<00:06:11.360> that<00:06:11.570> it's<00:06:12.289> going<00:06:12.530> to<00:06:12.590> keep<00:06:12.919> the

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
you do that it's going to keep the

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.659 
you do that it's going to keep the
amplifier<00:06:14.389> on<00:06:14.690> all<00:06:15.680> the<00:06:16.010> time<00:06:16.220> and<00:06:16.460> it's<00:06:16.550> going

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
amplifier on all the time and it's going

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.200 
amplifier on all the time and it's going
to<00:06:16.729> drain<00:06:16.970> your<00:06:17.120> battery<00:06:18.039> so<00:06:19.060> connect<00:06:20.060> this

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.689 

or<00:06:28.870> like<00:06:29.229> I<00:06:29.379> said<00:06:29.589> in<00:06:29.680> like<00:06:29.830> the<00:06:29.949> stereo<00:06:30.370> which

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
or like I said in like the stereo which

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:33.329 
or like I said in like the stereo which
has<00:06:31.539> to<00:06:31.719> be<00:06:31.839> manly<00:06:32.199> you<00:06:32.710> know<00:06:32.770> which<00:06:33.129> is

00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:33.339 
has to be manly you know which is

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:36.899 
has to be manly you know which is
usually<00:06:33.789> powered<00:06:34.120> by<00:06:34.300> the<00:06:35.550> ignition<00:06:36.550> so<00:06:36.789> when

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:36.909 
usually powered by the ignition so when

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:38.360 
usually powered by the ignition so when
you<00:06:36.999> turn<00:06:37.150> your<00:06:37.330> car<00:06:37.479> all<00:06:37.629> and<00:06:37.779> it<00:06:37.870> turns<00:06:38.080> on

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
you turn your car all and it turns on

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.499 
you turn your car all and it turns on
and<00:06:39.370> when<00:06:39.400> you<00:06:39.520> turn<00:06:39.729> your<00:06:39.879> car<00:06:39.999> off<00:06:40.059> it<00:06:40.389> turns

and when you turn your car off it turns

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:46.790 
and when you turn your car off it turns
off<00:06:41.039> and<00:06:42.039> that<00:06:42.699> is<00:06:43.559> basically<00:06:44.559> the

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
off and that is basically the

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.189 
off and that is basically the
connections<00:06:47.800> of<00:06:48.219> a<00:06:48.729> 2<00:06:49.419> channel<00:06:49.659> amplifier<00:06:52.199> go

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 
connections of a 2 channel amplifier go

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:56.249 
connections of a 2 channel amplifier go
over<00:06:53.499> it<00:06:53.559> real<00:06:53.710> quick<00:06:53.740> just<00:06:54.809> again<00:06:55.809> you<00:06:56.050> have

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:56.259 
over it real quick just again you have

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:00.360 
over it real quick just again you have
your<00:06:56.770> your<00:06:57.339> base<00:06:57.900> knob<00:06:58.900> you<00:06:59.620> have<00:06:59.800> your<00:06:59.949> signal
