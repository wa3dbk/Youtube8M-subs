there is no holding back between these

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.460 
there is no holding back between these
two<00:00:37.310> right<00:00:37.580> now

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:49.210 

and<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.160> rain<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.910> starting<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.960> pull

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:01:12.010 

let's<00:00:49.610> see<00:00:49.880> if<00:00:50.000> they<00:00:50.180> finish

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.279 

can<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:12.950> believe<00:01:13.130> it's<00:01:13.549> him<00:01:13.789> can<00:01:14.539> you<00:01:14.869> believe

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
can you believe it's him can you believe

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:16.980 
can you believe it's him can you believe
it

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
it

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.630 
it
we've<00:01:17.470> seen<00:01:17.740> just<00:01:18.280> about<00:01:18.369> everything<00:01:18.790> today

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
we've seen just about everything today

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.700 
we've seen just about everything today
no<00:01:21.090> snow<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.659> those<00:01:23.300> players<00:01:24.860> never<00:01:25.860> ride<00:01:26.159> at

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
no snow of those players never ride at

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.330 
no snow of those players never ride at
is<00:01:27.770> match<00:01:28.100> point

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
is match point

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:39.230 
is match point
and<00:01:30.520> have<00:01:30.909> to<00:01:31.090> stop

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.640 

it<00:01:39.720> had<00:01:40.020> been<00:01:40.200> sprinkling<00:01:40.970> for<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> while

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
it had been sprinkling for a while

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.670 
it had been sprinkling for a while
but<00:01:43.980> nothing<00:01:44.520> steady

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.560 

and<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.190> is<00:01:50.400> obviously<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:51.000> little<00:01:51.150> bit<00:01:51.390> more

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and this is obviously a little bit more

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.970 
and this is obviously a little bit more
study

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.620 

so<00:01:54.640> whenever<00:01:54.970> they<00:01:55.360> do<00:01:55.420> come<00:01:55.870> out<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:58.180> could<00:01:58.450> be

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
so whenever they do come out it could be

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.930 
so whenever they do come out it could be
over<00:01:58.660> just<00:01:59.200> as<00:01:59.590> quick<00:01:59.830> as<00:02:00.010> they<00:02:00.550> stopped

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
over just as quick as they stopped

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.460 
over just as quick as they stopped
because<00:02:01.870> it's<00:02:02.050> match<00:02:02.290> point<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:05.080> fetters

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
because it's match point the fetters

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.810 
because it's match point the fetters
going<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.650> have<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:05.890> serve<00:02:06.100> cold<00:02:06.430> unless

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
going to have to serve cold unless

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.210 
going to have to serve cold unless
they're<00:02:07.720> off<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.080> court<00:02:08.320> for<00:02:08.590> of<00:02:09.040> course

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
they're off the court for of course

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.830 
they're off the court for of course
emotions<00:02:09.700> are<00:02:09.820> running<00:02:09.910> high<00:02:10.060> off<00:02:10.570> to<00:02:10.720> that

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
emotions are running high off to that

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.470 
emotions are running high off to that
point<00:02:11.170> it's<00:02:11.770> not<00:02:11.800> open<00:02:12.190> if<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:12.460> see<00:02:12.670> Federer

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
such good Tech defense from both of them

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:45.050 
such good Tech defense from both of them

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:34.340 

because<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.730> emotion<00:03:14.240> a

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.580 

under<00:03:35.070> estimate<00:03:35.490> ports<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.570> this<00:03:36.720> point

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.850 

but<00:03:39.980> now<00:03:40.160> does<00:03:40.430> that<00:03:40.459> point<00:03:41.269> go<00:03:41.750> away<00:03:41.870> in<00:03:42.709> the

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
but now does that point go away in the

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.240 
but now does that point go away in the
players<00:03:43.129> minds

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
players minds

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.520 
players minds
it<00:03:45.730> was<00:03:45.880> about<00:03:46.180> it<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:46.510> does<00:03:46.780> dissipate<00:03:47.380> in

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
it was about it it does dissipate in

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.870 
it was about it it does dissipate in
love<00:03:47.680> it<00:03:47.770> I<00:03:47.860> definitely<00:03:48.220> think<00:03:48.490> it<00:03:48.670> does

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
love it I definitely think it does

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.510 
love it I definitely think it does
because<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:50.470> heart<00:03:50.710> rate<00:03:50.890> will<00:03:51.100> come<00:03:51.310> down

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
because the heart rate will come down

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.980 
because the heart rate will come down
now<00:03:51.760> when<00:03:51.940> he<00:03:52.000> steps<00:03:52.270> up<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.600> lines<00:03:52.810> of

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
now when he steps up to the lines of

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.890 
now when he steps up to the lines of
surf<00:03:53.260> I<00:03:53.590> mean<00:03:54.550> we'll<00:03:54.820> all<00:03:54.940> be<00:03:55.090> jacked<00:03:55.390> up<00:03:55.600> but

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
surf I mean we'll all be jacked up but

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.510 
surf I mean we'll all be jacked up but
definitely<00:03:56.080> not<00:03:56.410> as<00:03:56.470> jacked<00:03:56.800> up<00:03:56.980> as<00:03:57.160> he<00:03:57.400> would

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
definitely not as jacked up as he would

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.610 
definitely not as jacked up as he would
have<00:03:57.550> been<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:58.840> stepped<00:03:59.110> up<00:03:59.290> to<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.440> line

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
have been it stepped up to the line

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:09.080 
have been it stepped up to the line
straight<00:03:59.950> off<00:04:00.070> to<00:04:00.220> that<00:04:00.340> point

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.370 

ok

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.210 

it's<00:04:12.800> okay

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
it's okay

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.150 
it's okay
give<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.239> court<00:04:16.480> one<00:04:16.690> minute<00:04:16.989> with<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:17.950> lines

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
give the court one minute with the lines

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.220 
give the court one minute with the lines
are<00:04:18.340> fine

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.450 

so<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.530> looks<00:04:22.710> like<00:04:22.800> we're<00:04:23.130> going<00:04:23.250> to<00:04:23.340> get

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
so it looks like we're going to get

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.900 
so it looks like we're going to get
started

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.200 

stop<00:04:37.840> thinking<00:04:38.470> so<00:04:38.860> much<00:04:38.889> about<00:04:39.160> Wilson<00:04:40.060> hit
