00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
 or the grave two saludos duch sativa and 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:08.400
 this time we're going to talk about the rest 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.260
 entertaiment if you remember 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.390
 entertainment which opened a 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.460
 study and in california which are you 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.400
 two people who opened the study 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.070
 they were creators of the color and very useful 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.140
 well they have filled a document she 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.710
 put the mark that seems like maybe 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.050
 would be the name of his game called 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.680
 titan 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.050
 if it's done in English titans 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.930
 so this indicates that maybe that 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.820
 the game or it is called titan or the project 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.610
 that they will present at e3 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.710
 have the study name titan 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.510
 respond entertainment that has a partner 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.270
 boy or is he associated with electronic 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.910
 arts filled the application which 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.550
 called titan and well it was discovered 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.070
 not so let's see what goes if this goes 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.590
 to be a cool first person suddenly is 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.769
 another game but you just have to 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.259
 wait until 3 but showing 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.810
 something is going to show something who knows 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.660
 suddenly in 3 we will finally see the 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.990
 video game that will compete against colo 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.030
 beauty and battlefield 4 we are not going to see 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.680
 what's up we're going to see what went down all of a sudden 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.360
 in people you have to be realistic many 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.310
 prefer to play color and ticket for the 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.470
 film there are more people when I put 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.050
 butterfield although in bar the film is more 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.479
 exact and it's not as crazy as there are 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.270
 to be realistic but if the 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.290
 creators of color and take out a game the 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.110
 first person shooting obviously 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.600
 There's going to be a lot of competition and I'm 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.690
 sure if this game if called 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.050
 titan or something whatever be overcome color and 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.060
 I am sure that activision 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.280
 because the answer is coming game 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.440

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.900
 confirmed so I say goodbye and ducsa

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.770
