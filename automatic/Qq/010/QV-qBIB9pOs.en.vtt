00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.289
 to say eurovision it has nothing to do 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.090
 with the competitors you see 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.660
 roland garros tower because 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.219
 eurovision 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.289
 the guys who are in front of the french 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.860
 they are not doped or stuffed with 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.840
 hormones there are good good ah this coach ita to 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.170
 this is not for the hormones the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.240
 girl 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.560

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.960
 decency 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.090

 repetition of the seven names the injury no 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.160
 it's just that the guy is at his 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.019
 5th interview of nelson monfort there is 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.209
 the guy is full because this is 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.019
 that which is not talk but the soil monfort 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.639

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.329
 days with interviews with nelson 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.859
 monfort why the french before there 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.510

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.849
 us open 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.169
 why are they going to the final in melbourne 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.060
 because there are no lessons from 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.400
 montfort the host species of the guy 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.510

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.810
 match ball he has legs that 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.280

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.389
 he knows that in 2 minutes he will 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.859

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.480

 cross stitch and dirty anguish 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.700

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.500
 when the Eurovision Candidate to 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.230
