00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.759
 hello here dylan from the coach blog of 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.190
 foot.com welcome to this second 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.439
 video where we will talk about the preparation 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.750
 physical with balloon and especially with 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.609
 a case study is an example of a 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.410
 planning over four weeks but 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.810
 first let me remind you 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.670
 why it is necessary to make a 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.800
 preparation with balloon remember 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.660
 the story of the tennis player's pianist the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.700
 tennis player before starting the match 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.079
 he plays a few balls then days the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.000
 pianist does not turn around the piano 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.520
 to become a great pianist he 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.559
 trains every day at the piano on 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.210
 footballer it's the same thing for 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.100
 become a good footballer so that 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.530
 your team is good they need the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.140
 play ball that she trains with 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.640
 the balloon secondly must be put back 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.660
 players in match condition is 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.039
 the best way to prepare them 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.379
 physically you had seen in the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.149
 last video that there were four 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.989
 cycles including the first cycle where we go 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.730
 work endurance 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.170
 so we'll get the players back on the road 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.950
 the second cycle the anaerobic capacity 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.750
 the third cycle that will deal with the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.210
 and the fourth the last week of 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.070
 preparation where we will work with on 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.259
 speed exercises specific to 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.720
 football we now have a study of 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.390
 case a 4th week jump program including 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.400
 you will be able to download the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.860
 complete program ahead I apologize 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.170
 because what they actually are 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.490
 scans of his workouts that I did 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.520
 with my 15 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.759
 so know that all the exercises in 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.070
 this session will be valid for 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.530
 u13 campo of the seniors it is necessary just 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.680
 change the intensity ie the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.240
 working time the rest time more 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.520
 you have young players over the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.299
 working time is going to be reduced and the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.829
 rest time increases and the inverted if 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.869
 you have seniors for example 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.270
 okay so all these exercises can 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.979
 be very well done u13 up to 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.210
 seniors left on an example of 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.649
 two sessions a week for example 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.439
 it is the physical preparation that I have 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.750
 did last year with u15 where we 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.509
 had two sessions a week here I 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.790
 have you put 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.319
 what type to which cycle it corresponds 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.019
 okay so if that 1 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.049
 we see the sessions so you have to 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:26.409
 every time the scheme usually here 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:32.319
 the overall working time the instructions 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:33.540
 and some key points of agreement so we 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.049
 has cycle 1 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.420
 we have the cycle from here so here is not 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.310
 usually at the top right I you 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.560
 really put the time to work with 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:50.139
 rest time so here's cycle 3 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.970
 you see the cycle 3 years goes into the 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.950
 faith in the work of general force 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.409
 so we'll have more exercise 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.269
 ce2 and one against one and we come back 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.690
 finally in cycle 4 the last 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.540
 week 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.000
 so here initial of a cycle 4 because 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.340
 it's the last week of preparation 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.540
 we did a tournament on two 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.159
 days simply 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.359
 so I did not add two sessions 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.510
 additional had just seen 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.220
 now the plan over four weeks 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.099

 that's where you can print 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.049
 to watch it and that's it so I'll you 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.230

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.310

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:40.690
 how many friendlies which type 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.579
 of opponents encountered in which order 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.879
 and I will talk about three elements 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:48.030
