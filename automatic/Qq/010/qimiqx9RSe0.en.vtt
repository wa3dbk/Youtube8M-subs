job you're gonna need a couple tools

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.919 
job you're gonna need a couple tools
wire<00:00:10.710> strippers<00:00:11.599> you<00:00:12.599> want<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.809> make<00:00:12.900> sure

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
wire strippers you want to make sure

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.799 
wire strippers you want to make sure
that<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.349> have<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.559> insulated<00:00:14.130> kind<00:00:14.370> and

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
that you have the insulated kind and

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.300 
that you have the insulated kind and
different<00:00:15.809> sizes<00:00:16.289> also<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.630> voltmeter<00:00:19.310> this

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
different sizes also a voltmeter this

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.450 
different sizes also a voltmeter this
let<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.180> know<00:00:21.330> if<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.230> have<00:00:22.439> good<00:00:23.130> connection

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
let you know if you have good connection

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.120 
let you know if you have good connection
running<00:00:24.119> through<00:00:24.330> your<00:00:24.480> coil<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:25.500> next<00:00:25.890> part

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
running through your coil this next part

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.490 
running through your coil this next part
is<00:00:26.490> very<00:00:26.670> important<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:28.140> want<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.349> make<00:00:28.470> sure

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
is very important you want to make sure

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.359 
is very important you want to make sure
that<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.369> pick<00:00:29.550> up<00:00:29.900> porcelain<00:00:30.900> wire<00:00:31.859> nuts

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
that you pick up porcelain wire nuts

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.240 
that you pick up porcelain wire nuts
the<00:00:33.270> reason<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.690> use<00:00:33.719> porcelain<00:00:34.350> wire<00:00:34.920> nuts

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
the reason you use porcelain wire nuts

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.819 
the reason you use porcelain wire nuts
is<00:00:35.579> because<00:00:36.300> they<00:00:36.510> won't<00:00:36.690> melt<00:00:37.050> under<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
is because they won't melt under the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.290 
is because they won't melt under the
heat<00:00:38.070> now<00:00:39.320> say<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> stove<00:00:40.710> top<00:00:41.040> burner<00:00:41.370> this

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
heat now say the stove top burner this

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.260 
heat now say the stove top burner this
one<00:00:42.480> right<00:00:42.600> here<00:00:42.899> isn't<00:00:43.620> working<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:45.120> first

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
one right here isn't working the first

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.889 
one right here isn't working the first
thing<00:00:45.510> you're<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:46.340> is<00:00:47.340> remove<00:00:47.899> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
thing you're going to do is remove the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.700 
thing you're going to do is remove the
burner<00:00:49.140> simply<00:00:49.890> by<00:00:50.579> pulling<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.530> you<00:00:52.530> do

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
burner simply by pulling it out you do

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.279 
burner simply by pulling it out you do
this<00:00:52.920> step<00:00:53.190> make<00:00:53.969> sure<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.110> shut

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
this step make sure that you have shut

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.860 
this step make sure that you have shut
off<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> power<00:00:55.770> at<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.100> breaker<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.870> unplug

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
off the power at the breaker and unplug

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.369 
off the power at the breaker and unplug
the<00:00:57.899> stove<00:01:00.530> take<00:01:01.530> your<00:01:01.739> burner<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.870> your

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the stove take your burner and your

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.760 
the stove take your burner and your
voltmeter<00:01:05.210> turn<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.530> want<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
voltmeter turn it on and you want to

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.179 
voltmeter turn it on and you want to
find<00:01:08.040> what<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.670> called<00:01:09.140> continuity

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
find what is called continuity

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.550 
find what is called continuity
continuity<00:01:11.189> let<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.270> know<00:01:12.420> when<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.260> a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
continuity let you know when you have a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.469 
continuity let you know when you have a
good<00:01:14.159> connection<00:01:14.490> running<00:01:14.970> through<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> coil

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
good connection running through the coil

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.060 
good connection running through the coil
or<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.710> wire<00:01:17.509> you<00:01:18.509> can<00:01:18.659> test<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.259> by<00:01:19.890> taking

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
or the wire you can test this by taking

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.810 
or the wire you can test this by taking
the<00:01:20.340> two<00:01:20.520> ends<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.080> touching<00:01:22.080> them<00:01:22.170> together

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
the two ends and touching them together

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.910 
the two ends and touching them together
when<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.909> touch<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.360> two<00:01:24.509> ends<00:01:24.689> together

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
when you touch the two ends together

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.249 
when you touch the two ends together
your<00:01:25.920> voltmeter<00:01:26.840> basically<00:01:27.840> start<00:01:28.080> going

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
your voltmeter basically start going

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.800 
your voltmeter basically start going
crazy<00:01:29.180> reading<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.240> bunch<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.479> different

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
crazy reading a bunch of different

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.380 
crazy reading a bunch of different
numbers<00:01:30.950> this<00:01:31.950> means<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> good

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
numbers this means that you have a good

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.800 
numbers this means that you have a good
connection<00:01:34.369> through<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> wire<00:01:37.460> now<00:01:38.810> take

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
connection through the wire now take

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.160 
connection through the wire now take
your<00:01:39.960> two<00:01:40.140> ends<00:01:40.500> place<00:01:41.490> one<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:41.820> each<00:01:42.150> side

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.290 

now<00:01:48.510> if<00:01:49.510> you're<00:01:50.110> reading<00:01:50.380> nothing<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:52.060> means

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
now if you're reading nothing that means

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.080 
now if you're reading nothing that means
that<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.380> coil<00:01:53.620> is<00:01:53.860> bad<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.430> this<00:01:54.820> burner

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
that the coil is bad and this burner

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.520 
that the coil is bad and this burner
needs<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.570> be<00:01:55.690> replaced

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
needs to be replaced

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.500 
needs to be replaced
so<00:01:58.229> take<00:01:59.229> your<00:01:59.350> burner<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.909> a<00:02:00.940> home

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
so take your burner to a home

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.080 
so take your burner to a home
improvement<00:02:01.659> store

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
