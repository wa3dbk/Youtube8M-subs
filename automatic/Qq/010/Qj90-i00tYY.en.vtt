00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.219 
thought it was a niche too far but it
justifies<00:04:28.820> its<00:04:29.060> existence<00:04:29.180> simply<00:04:30.020> by

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
justifies its existence simply by

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.260 
justifies its existence simply by
driving<00:04:30.470> so<00:04:30.950> well<00:04:31.190> and<00:04:31.430> setting<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.120> new

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
driving so well and setting a new

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.680 
driving so well and setting a new
benchmark<00:04:33.640> so<00:04:34.640> as<00:04:34.760> it<00:04:34.940> turns<00:04:35.150> out<00:04:35.360> there

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
benchmark so as it turns out there

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.440 
benchmark so as it turns out there
actually<00:04:36.020> is<00:04:36.229> a<00:04:36.650> point<00:04:36.979> to<00:04:37.190> the<00:04:37.310> x6<00:04:37.760> you<00:04:38.240> just

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
actually is a point to the x6 you just

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.700 
actually is a point to the x6 you just
have<00:04:38.600> to<00:04:38.720> make<00:04:38.840> it<00:04:39.020> from<00:04:39.200> the<00:04:39.229> inside

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
have to make it from the inside

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.690 
have to make it from the inside
ie<00:04:40.370> so<00:04:40.760> that<00:04:40.910> you<00:04:40.970> can<00:04:41.120> drive<00:04:41.330> it<00:04:41.600> and<00:04:41.780> be<00:04:42.700> so

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
ie so that you can drive it and be so

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.540 
ie so that you can drive it and be so
you<00:04:43.729> don't<00:04:44.000> have<00:04:44.060> to<00:04:44.180> look<00:04:44.360> at<00:04:44.479> it<00:04:45.039> Tom<00:04:46.039> can<00:04:46.460> I

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
you don't have to look at it Tom can I

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
the vehicle extremely tall I'm quite a

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.469 
the vehicle extremely tall I'm quite a
tall<00:05:25.039> bloke<00:05:25.310> so<00:05:25.520> you'd<00:05:25.639> expect<00:05:25.700> me<00:05:26.000> to<00:05:26.030> fit<00:05:26.300> in
