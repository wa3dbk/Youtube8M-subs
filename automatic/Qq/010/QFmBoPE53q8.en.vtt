it's very creamy

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.359

it<00:01:11.720> can<00:01:12.080> crease<00:01:12.470> if<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:12.800> don't<00:01:12.950> put<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.160> base

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
it can crease if you don't put a base

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.520 
it can crease if you don't put a base
underneath<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:14.030> so<00:01:14.990> I'm<00:01:15.050> blending<00:01:15.259> that<00:01:15.410> out

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
underneath it so I'm blending that out

with<00:01:15.800> my<00:01:15.830> fingers<00:01:17.259> you<00:01:18.259> want<00:01:18.440> to<00:01:18.500> get<00:01:18.590> this<00:01:18.770> as

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
with my fingers you want to get this as

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.730 
with my fingers you want to get this as
smooth<00:01:19.460> as<00:01:19.670> possible<00:01:20.289> and<00:01:21.289> you<00:01:21.410> don't<00:01:21.560> want<00:01:21.679> to

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
smooth as possible and you don't want to

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.889 
smooth as possible and you don't want to
apply<00:01:21.830> this<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.160> thick<00:01:22.610> either

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.080 

then<00:01:29.899> I'm<00:01:30.020> taking<00:01:30.049> a<00:01:30.530> white<00:01:30.770> eyeshadow<00:01:31.090> and

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
then I'm taking a white eyeshadow and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.940 
then I'm taking a white eyeshadow and
applying<00:01:32.539> that<00:01:32.659> all<00:01:32.990> of<00:01:33.140> my<00:01:33.319> lids<00:01:33.590> from<00:01:33.799> the

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
applying that all of my lids from the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.440 
applying that all of my lids from the
lash<00:01:34.130> line<00:01:34.159> all<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.850> way<00:01:34.880> up<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.179> the<00:01:35.270> brow

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
lash line all the way up to the brow

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.319 
lash line all the way up to the brow
bone<00:01:35.679> this<00:01:36.679> would<00:01:36.890> probably<00:01:37.369> be<00:01:37.520> easier<00:01:37.759> if<00:01:38.179> I

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
bone this would probably be easier if I

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.660 
bone this would probably be easier if I
use<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.869> fluffier<00:01:39.289> brush<00:01:39.350> but<00:01:39.829> I<00:01:39.890> didn't<00:01:40.520> have

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
use the fluffier brush but I didn't have

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.609 
use the fluffier brush but I didn't have
one<00:01:40.880> on<00:01:41.149> hand<00:01:41.659> at<00:01:41.869> that<00:01:41.990> minute<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:42.469> that's

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
one on hand at that minute so that's

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:49.929 
one on hand at that minute so that's
what<00:01:42.770> I<00:01:42.799> used<00:01:47.920> then<00:01:48.920> I'm<00:01:49.039> taking<00:01:49.189> Illamasqua
