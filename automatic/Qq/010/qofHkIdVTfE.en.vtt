not predictable on defense the benefit

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.330 
not predictable on defense the benefit

your opponent the block is running back
or<00:00:28.170> get<00:00:28.320> sacked<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.730> we<00:00:30.000> get<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.300> decide

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
or get sacked is that we get to decide

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.840 
or get sacked is that we get to decide
on<00:00:30.660> which<00:00:30.900> side<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.260> field<00:00:31.410> he<00:00:31.590> blocked<00:00:31.859> by

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
on which side of the field he blocked by

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.459 
on which side of the field he blocked by
sending<00:00:33.270> our<00:00:33.390> heat<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.870> left<00:00:34.079> side<00:00:34.260> we

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
sending our heat on the left side we

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.049 
sending our heat on the left side we
force<00:00:34.770> our<00:00:34.950> opponent<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.370> block<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.730> running

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
force our opponent the block is running

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.450 
force our opponent the block is running
back<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> left<00:00:36.660> side<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.739> benefits<00:00:38.250> us

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
back on the left side this benefits us

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.830 
back on the left side this benefits us
because<00:00:38.940> his<00:00:39.090> running<00:00:39.360> back<00:00:39.510> becomes

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
because his running back becomes

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.260 
because his running back becomes
predictable<00:00:40.260> that's<00:00:41.250> why<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:41.640> manually<00:00:41.969> guard

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
predictable that's why we manually guard

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.910 
predictable that's why we manually guard
the<00:00:42.390> running<00:00:42.690> back<00:00:42.840> we<00:00:43.079> know<00:00:43.230> exactly<00:00:43.559> where

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the running back we know exactly where

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.729 
the running back we know exactly where
he<00:00:43.950> can<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.579> can't<00:00:45.000> go<00:00:45.559> take<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:46.710> example

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
he can and can't go take for example

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.619 
he can and can't go take for example
this<00:00:47.160> play<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.760> know<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> setup<00:00:48.270> well<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.600> I

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
this play you know the setup well so I

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.299 
this play you know the setup well so I
won't<00:00:48.840> get<00:00:48.960> into<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.230> let's<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.070> say<00:00:50.280> that

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
won't get into that let's just say that

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.770 
won't get into that let's just say that
our<00:00:50.550> opponent<00:00:50.969> decides<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.360> he<00:00:51.510> wants<00:00:51.629> to
