for backstroking workouts but either way

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:11.550 
for backstroking workouts but either way
like<00:01:10.390> just<00:01:10.570> having<00:01:10.720> your<00:01:10.899> teammates<00:01:11.350> you<00:01:11.530> know

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
like just having your teammates you know

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.080 
like just having your teammates you know
right<00:01:11.860> next<00:01:12.160> to<00:01:12.250> you<00:01:12.310> one<00:01:12.550> two<00:01:12.729> three<00:01:12.970> it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
right next to you one two three it

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.339 
right next to you one two three it
always<00:01:13.330> just<00:01:13.479> makes<00:01:13.720> it<00:01:13.869> feel<00:01:14.050> a<00:01:14.080> little<00:01:14.170> bit

00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:14.349 
always just makes it feel a little bit

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:17.470 
always just makes it feel a little bit
more<00:01:14.530> like<00:01:14.770> comforting

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.420 

I<00:01:17.570> think<00:01:18.350> it<00:01:18.440> might<00:01:18.560> be<00:01:18.590> a<00:01:18.740> little<00:01:18.980> stressful

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
I think it might be a little stressful

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.990 
I think it might be a little stressful
to<00:01:19.880> do<00:01:20.030> it<00:01:20.150> every<00:01:20.450> single<00:01:20.690> day<00:01:21.790> Terry's<00:01:22.790> great

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
to do it every single day Terry's great

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.610 
to do it every single day Terry's great
with<00:01:23.150> the<00:01:23.240> emotional<00:01:23.750> aspect<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:24.320> I<00:01:24.380> think

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
with the emotional aspect and I think

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.170 
with the emotional aspect and I think
we'd<00:01:24.740> all<00:01:24.800> get<00:01:24.980> drained<00:01:25.310> pretty<00:01:25.580> fast<00:01:25.820> if<00:01:26.090> we

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
we'd all get drained pretty fast if we

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.730 
we'd all get drained pretty fast if we
were<00:01:26.300> all<00:01:26.420> going<00:01:26.990> head-to-head<00:01:27.320> with

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
were all going head-to-head with

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.950 
were all going head-to-head with
backstroke<00:01:28.250> every<00:01:28.520> day<00:01:28.640> yeah<00:01:29.000> no<00:01:29.390> I<00:01:29.630> don't

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.210
