and you certainly did get that but were
there<00:00:27.420> any<00:00:27.539> sign<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.990> nerves<00:00:28.230> whatsoever

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
there any sign of nerves whatsoever

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.470 
there any sign of nerves whatsoever
because<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.310> certainly<00:00:29.609> didn't<00:00:30.029> seem<00:00:30.300> as

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
because it certainly didn't seem as

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.609 
because it certainly didn't seem as
though<00:00:30.570> they<00:00:30.689> were<00:00:30.720> from<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.140> way<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.320> played

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619

the<00:00:31.740> match<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.160> was<00:00:32.759> pretty<00:00:32.940> relaxed<00:00:33.510> all<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.360 
the match I was pretty relaxed all the
way<00:00:33.840> through<00:00:34.110> there<00:00:34.320> was<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.590> frame<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.010> think

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
way through there was one frame I think

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.639 
way through there was one frame I think
after<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.690> interval<00:00:37.079> elite<00:00:37.350> five

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
after the of the interval elite five

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.380 
after the of the interval elite five
where<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.129> both<00:00:38.340> followed<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:39.090> quite<00:00:39.360> a

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
where we both followed like quite a

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.319 
where we both followed like quite a
large<00:00:39.600> chances<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.320> lost<00:00:40.559> their<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.040> then<00:00:41.850> I

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
large chances and I lost their I then I

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.940 
large chances and I lost their I then I
sort<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.719> settled<00:00:43.079> back<00:00:43.200> down<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.739> took<00:00:43.800> my
