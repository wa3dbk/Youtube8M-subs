city 0 in 0 cell which is a 32 million
power<00:00:11.670> battery<00:00:12.830> and<00:00:13.969> I<00:00:15.020> have<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> lot<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.590> say

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
power battery and I have a lot to say

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.460 
power battery and I have a lot to say
about<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.910> first<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.270> all<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.750> there<00:00:19.020> 200

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
about it so first of all it is there 200

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.070 
about it so first of all it is there 200
million<00:00:19.650> powers<00:00:20.130> which<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.300> can<00:00:21.660> say<00:00:21.840> does

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
million powers which you can say does

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.200 
million powers which you can say does
add<00:00:22.260> some<00:00:22.500> bulk<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.920> really<00:00:23.160> does<00:00:23.340> but<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.180> a

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210

big<00:00:36.840> video<00:00:37.020> for<00:00:37.350> me<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.649> actually<00:00:38.250> think<00:00:38.520> it

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
big video for me I actually think it

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.970 
big video for me I actually think it
feels<00:00:38.760> better<00:00:39.030> but<00:00:39.870> some<00:00:40.350> might<00:00:40.469> not<00:00:40.649> some

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
feels better but some might not some

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.740 
feels better but some might not some
might<00:00:41.129> say<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.399> sense<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.030> thick<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.629> a

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
might say that sense is so thick it's a

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.049 
might say that sense is so thick it's a
deal<00:00:42.960> breaker<00:00:43.309> but<00:00:44.309> I'm<00:00:44.430> gonna<00:00:44.640> let<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.940> be

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
attractive that's the cover definitely

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.240 
attractive that's the cover definitely
not<00:01:27.330> as<00:01:27.420> attractive<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:27.960> an<00:01:28.140> stock<00:01:28.680> nexus<00:01:29.040> one

not as attractive as an stock nexus one
cover<00:01:29.729> but<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.240> actually<00:01:30.450> don't<00:01:30.720> mind<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.170> this

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799

cover but I actually don't mind it this
does<00:01:32.100> offer<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.640> level<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.150> protection<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:35.100> both

which<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.369> guess<00:01:38.490> would<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.880> original

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000

which I guess would be the original
battery<00:01:39.390> cover<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:40.200> also<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.280> little

completely if I get this on covers that

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.300 
completely if I get this on covers that
part<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.240> see<00:01:48.329> there<00:01:48.979> you<00:01:49.979> might<00:01:50.159> be

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
part you can see there you might be

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.149

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
worth it but let's just get on here's an

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.229 
worth it but let's just get on here's an
old<00:03:22.930> battery<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.620> i<00:03:24.040> don't<00:03:24.819> know<00:03:24.879> if<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.060> can

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
old battery the i don't know if you can

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.839 
old battery the i don't know if you can
even<00:03:25.359> see<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:26.220> it's<00:03:27.220> fourteen<00:03:27.699> hundred

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
even see that it's fourteen hundred

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:33.629 
even see that it's fourteen hundred
million<00:03:28.209> powers<00:03:28.829> and<00:03:30.180> let's<00:03:31.290> just<00:03:32.639> compare

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
million powers and let's just compare

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.569 
million powers and let's just compare
these<00:03:33.879> let's<00:03:34.090> let<00:03:34.299> focus<00:03:34.930> first<00:03:35.379> let's<00:03:36.310> just

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
these let's let focus first let's just

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.009 
these let's let focus first let's just
compare<00:03:36.879> these<00:03:37.120> there<00:03:37.329> is<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.629> difference

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
compare these there is the difference

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.720 
compare these there is the difference
maybe<00:03:38.590> i<00:03:38.650> should<00:03:38.829> prepare<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.129> sides<00:03:39.400> that

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
maybe i should prepare the sides that

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.520 
maybe i should prepare the sides that
have<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.150> thing<00:03:40.419> there's<00:03:41.019> difference<00:03:41.440> this

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
have the thing there's difference this

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.759 
have the thing there's difference this
is<00:03:41.709> about<00:03:42.329> double<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:43.510> size<00:03:45.299> so<00:03:46.299> i'm<00:03:47.199> not

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
is about double the size so i'm not

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.219 
is about double the size so i'm not
exactly<00:03:48.579> sure<00:03:48.879> and<00:03:49.599> this<00:03:49.750> is<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:49.930> little

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:50.229 
exactly sure and this is a little

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.689 
exactly sure and this is a little
nerve-racking<00:03:50.349> where<00:03:51.040> my<00:03:51.220> original<00:03:52.060> cover<00:03:52.870> is

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
nerve-racking where my original cover is

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:57.449 
nerve-racking where my original cover is
but<00:03:54.699> you<00:03:55.329> can<00:03:55.540> actually<00:03:55.720> see<00:03:56.079> how<00:03:56.799> thick<00:03:57.250> the

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
but you can actually see how thick the

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
part going all the way across that's how

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.969 
part going all the way across that's how
fat<00:04:15.909> it<00:04:16.060> would<00:04:16.180> be<00:04:16.389> with<00:04:17.229> normal<00:04:17.500> with<00:04:17.889> the

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
fat it would be with normal with the

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.390 
fat it would be with normal with the
stock<00:04:18.190> battery<00:04:18.430> on<00:04:19.199> you<00:04:20.199> can<00:04:20.349> see<00:04:20.530> so<00:04:21.070> does<00:04:21.250> a
