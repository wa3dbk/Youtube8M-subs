remember another knife I'd be perfect
for<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:24.870> because<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.950> can<00:02:26.040> get<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.220> whole

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
for this because you can get the whole

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.630 
for this because you can get the whole
thing<00:02:27.110> based<00:02:28.110> on<00:02:28.350> how<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.590> move<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.130> move<00:02:29.520> up

thing based on how you move and move up

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.370 
thing based on how you move and move up
and<00:02:29.790> down<00:02:29.940> there's<00:02:30.210> different<00:02:30.510> ways<00:02:30.600> Western

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
and down there's different ways Western

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.680 
and down there's different ways Western
I<00:02:31.500> believe<00:02:31.770> Western<00:02:32.310> ways<00:02:32.520> down<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:33.270> way

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
I believe Western ways down this way

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.080 
I believe Western ways down this way
and<00:02:34.010> Japanese<00:02:35.010> ways<00:02:35.450> this<00:02:36.590> motion<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.580> that's

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
and Japanese ways this motion so that's

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
simple the 250 is good for resurfacing

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
put some pencil marks on there to figure

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.300 
put some pencil marks on there to figure
out<00:03:25.170> where<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.440> grooves<00:03:25.650> in<00:03:25.830> Pittsford<00:03:26.160> you

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
out where the grooves in Pittsford you

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.890 
out where the grooves in Pittsford you
can<00:03:26.459> focus<00:03:26.760> on<00:03:27.000> those<00:03:27.150> areas<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.510> little<00:03:27.690> better

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
can focus on those areas a little better

can focus on those areas a little better
and<00:03:28.400> I<00:03:29.400> like<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.360> dual<00:03:30.540> purpose<00:03:30.750> cuz<00:03:31.170> come<00:03:31.440> on

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560

the<00:03:40.290> advantage<00:03:40.769> of<00:03:41.840> comparison<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.320> guys

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
the advantage of comparison and you guys

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.780 
the advantage of comparison and you guys
able<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:44.160> make<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.090> more<00:03:45.420> informed<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:46.350> useful

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790

able to make a more informed and useful
decision<00:03:48.050> based<00:03:49.050> on<00:03:49.230> that

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
decision based on that

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.789 
decision based on that
so<00:03:50.659> this<00:03:50.810> K<00:03:51.019> just<00:03:51.709> one<00:03:52.129> more<00:03:52.310> tidbit<00:03:54.280> it's<00:03:55.280> 8<00:03:56.799> by

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
so this K just one more tidbit it's 8 by

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:04.899 
so this K just one more tidbit it's 8 by
2<00:04:00.790> looks<00:04:01.790> like<00:04:02.409> someone<00:04:03.409> dropped<00:04:03.739> it<00:04:04.040> because

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
2 looks like someone dropped it because

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:09.130 
2 looks like someone dropped it because
that<00:04:05.030> doesn't<00:04:05.329> look<00:04:05.540> great<00:04:07.150> now<00:04:08.150> I<00:04:08.450> want<00:04:08.900> to

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
that doesn't look great now I want to

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.530 
that doesn't look great now I want to
point<00:04:09.530> fingers<00:04:09.739> at<00:04:10.069> it<00:04:10.189> because<00:04:10.549> it's<00:04:11.000> not<00:04:11.150> all

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540
