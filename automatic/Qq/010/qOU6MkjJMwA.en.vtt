00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.760
 i 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.379
 hello to all I am matÃ­as and if finally 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.240
 I'm back at my house after 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.150
 be a year traveling around 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.760
 Latin America I have returned to my house 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.410
 to make new and more cooking videos 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.199
 so stay tuned because there are going to be 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.689
 many but many videos but before 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.970
 start with this recipe missing here a 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.270
 very important member is how the 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.579
 fourth leg of the table that without the shoe 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.440
 the table is would fall and it would not be what 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.690
 same and if that thing that brings its 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.080
 charisma its freshness offers all its 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.550
 fun gives us all its tenderness and 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.740
 if they follow me by instagram they will have 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.440

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.750
 uploaded a couple of short videos of few 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.030
 seconds with him but able if I do not 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.250
 you follow by integral and without further ado 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.790
 and without anything else to say with you 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.680
 ladies and gentlemen is the child of the 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.320
 camera for all the people who did not see 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.900
 our reunion here I leave a link 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.330
 good as seeing the cni is not alive 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.799
 is alive and is here with us and 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.799
 good start with the recipes 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.799
 Y 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.560
 is that we are going to need are 200 grams 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.080
 of whites that would be approximately 6 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.900
 clear and 400 grams of sugar for 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.970
 start placing the egg whites in a bowl and 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.670
 the sugar mix well until 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.950
 integrate it and take it to bain-marie and 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.900
 began to stir continuously until 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.900
 that sugar has dissolved 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.479
 rub with your fingers the preparation and if 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.479
 notes that the sugar dissolved 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.280
 until the preparation cools 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.880
 to know is always ready you have to 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.209
 stay so firm that he begged 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.640
 and it is firm and to pass the test 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.830
 of fire need to make me come Swiss 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.500
 gold in the bowl where you go you say the 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.480
 merengue if you turn it around you do not have 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.080
 to fall 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.080
 tran 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.840
 do not say 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.870
 this is the test of fire to know if 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.000
 you make a good good meringue 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.819
 because if you start to lift the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.790
 bag and see that it is moving and that 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.129
 is about to fall that means 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.170
 that they lack more shake or that they do not 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:49.379
 dissolved the sugar in the bathroom 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.459
 Maria places the preparation in a sleeve 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.459
 with a smooth peak 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.470
 and on a plate with chill pack or with 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.330
 butter paper made the merits not 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.670
 make them very close to each other 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.330
 because at the time of cooking 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.330
 they enlarge a little 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.150
 of meringue 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.390
 and take it to a 100 degree oven by 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.160
 approximately 90 minutes and if your oven 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.530
 does not have to place the temperature 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.810
 it has to be at minimum fire and if it is 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.550
 necessary to leave the door ajar 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.310
 from the oven 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.440
 You can also make meringues 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.560
 colors you can use coloring in 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.720
 paste or liquid if that liquid has the 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.790
 caution not to add also to 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.590
 do not lighten the prepared appointment can you 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.590
 use a curly bill 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.460
 do not 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.350
 the merits also called sighs and 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.960
 friends of colors preceded by two 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.790
 colors because I used the same sleeve not the 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.970
 ship then the colors were mixed 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.680
 but if you throw again in a single color 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.780
 just once the sleeve and obviously 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.030
 I had to marga or use another for another 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.310
 color when I made the merits left me 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.740
 preparation and if the same thing happens to you 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.570
 Save the slope and then you can 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.360
 reuse but the problem that 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.880
 it came to me is that the merits 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.430
 they started to crack 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.900
 and as you can see but it does not matter 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.790
 because although the same for the filling of 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.290
 some cake is not going to serve you 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.700
 decorate them 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.700
 for the interior 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.270
 It is very popular 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.270
 i 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:19.240
