juggling like so many tricks is not the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.359 
juggling like so many tricks is not the
throw<00:00:30.660> itself<00:00:30.990> it's<00:00:31.650> not<00:00:31.830> even<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> catch

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
throw itself it's not even the catch

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.049 
throw itself it's not even the catch
it's<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.480> throw<00:00:33.920> before<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.370> trick<00:00:36.020> okay

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059

it's the throw before the trick okay
most<00:00:39.059> people<00:00:39.329> are<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.870> worried<00:00:40.379> about<00:00:41.090> getting

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
most people are so worried about getting

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.209 
most people are so worried about getting
their<00:00:42.329> arm<00:00:42.480> behind<00:00:42.809> them<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.260> they<00:00:43.829> neglect

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
their arm behind them that they neglect

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.860 
their arm behind them that they neglect
the<00:00:44.399> throw<00:00:44.670> beforehand<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.450> they<00:00:45.510> might<00:00:45.719> get

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the throw beforehand and they might get

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.350 
the throw beforehand and they might get
a<00:00:45.930> good<00:00:46.140> throw<00:00:46.500> from<00:00:46.739> here<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> throw

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
a good throw from here but the throw

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.819 
a good throw from here but the throw
that<00:00:48.510> they<00:00:48.629> proved<00:00:48.870> through<00:00:49.020> previous<00:00:49.410> that

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
that they proved through previous that

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.040 
that they proved through previous that
they<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.309> bring<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.760> hand<00:00:50.969> back<00:00:51.420> from

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
they have to bring this hand back from

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.319 
they have to bring this hand back from
around<00:00:52.320> their<00:00:52.469> body<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.829> catch<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.430> usually

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
around their body to catch is usually

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.600 
around their body to catch is usually
thrown<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.809> poorly<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:56.010> ruins<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> whole

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
thrown so poorly that it ruins the whole

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.299 
thrown so poorly that it ruins the whole
trick<00:00:56.940> they<00:00:57.120> end<00:00:57.239> up<00:00:57.329> reaching<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.190> so<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
trick they end up reaching for it so the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.830 
trick they end up reaching for it so the
key<00:00:59.550> is<00:01:02.329> first<00:01:03.329> let<00:01:03.629> learn<00:01:05.420> with<00:01:06.420> one<00:01:06.630> ball

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
key is first let learn with one ball

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.500 
key is first let learn with one ball
just<00:01:07.500> how<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.740> do<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.220> throw<00:01:08.549> which<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.240> quite

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
just how to do that throw which is quite

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.100 
just how to do that throw which is quite
simple<00:01:11.060> I'll<00:01:12.060> show<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.630> look<00:01:12.810> at<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.020> from

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
simple I'll show you can look at it from

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.340 
simple I'll show you can look at it from
behind

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.420 

it<00:01:16.350> doesn't<00:01:16.710> require<00:01:17.600> any<00:01:18.600> sort<00:01:18.960> of

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
it doesn't require any sort of

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.320 
it doesn't require any sort of
contortion<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:21.150> shouldn't<00:01:21.509> hurt<00:01:23.180> one<00:01:24.180> way

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
contortion it shouldn't hurt one way

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.789 
contortion it shouldn't hurt one way
that<00:01:24.540> kind<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.810> works<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.110> me<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.500> trick

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
that kind of works for me is I trick

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.160 
that kind of works for me is I trick
myself<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.729> kind<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.180> look<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.750> your

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
myself as I a kind of look in your

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.620 
myself as I a kind of look in your
periphery<00:01:28.650> for<00:01:29.430> where<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.759> want<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.360> ball

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
periphery for where you want that ball

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.109 
periphery for where you want that ball
to<00:01:30.869> be<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> air<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.619> catch<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.790> kind

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
to be in the air to catch and you kind

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.469 
to be in the air to catch and you kind
of<00:01:34.189> inevitably<00:01:35.189> throw<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.000> ball<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.360> that

of inevitably throw the ball to that

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.200 
of inevitably throw the ball to that
area<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.229> kind<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.009> reflex<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:39.000> most

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
area it's just kind of a reflex for most

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.179 
area it's just kind of a reflex for most
people<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:40.140> imagine<00:01:40.710> where<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:40.979> going<00:01:41.130> to
