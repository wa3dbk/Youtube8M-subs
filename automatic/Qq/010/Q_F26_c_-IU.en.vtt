our warlord traits oh yeah we have two

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.699 
our warlord traits oh yeah we have two
objectives<00:02:48.610> just<00:02:49.540> one<00:02:49.900> there<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.140> then<00:02:50.560> one

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
objectives just one there and then one

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.620 
objectives just one there and then one
the<00:02:50.800> force<00:02:51.040> there<00:02:51.280> it's<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.940> dark<00:02:52.240> eldar<00:02:52.420> plan

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630

the force there it's the dark eldar plan
but<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:53.020> are<00:02:53.580> traits<00:02:54.580> I<00:02:55.090> cannot<00:02:55.810> remember

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
but that are traits I cannot remember

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.390 
but that are traits I cannot remember
exactly<00:02:56.350> where<00:02:56.500> they<00:02:56.590> were<00:02:56.709> but<00:02:56.860> mine<00:02:57.040> i<00:02:57.220> think

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
exactly where they were but mine i think

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.740 
exactly where they were but mine i think
was<00:02:57.490> furious<00:02:57.760> charge<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.920> his<00:02:59.920> was<00:03:00.750> night

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
was furious charge and his was night

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.050 
was furious charge and his was night
fighting<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:03.160> then<00:03:03.280> we<00:03:03.370> rolled<00:03:03.610> in<00:03:03.790> night

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
fighting and then we rolled in night

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.199 
fighting and then we rolled in night
fighting<00:03:04.239> was<00:03:04.420> there<00:03:04.570> anyways<00:03:05.910> but<00:03:06.910> it's<00:03:07.030> good

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
fighting was there anyways but it's good

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.520 
fighting was there anyways but it's good
he<00:03:07.390> would<00:03:07.720> enjoyed<00:03:08.020> night<00:03:08.200> fighting<00:03:08.350> because

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
he would enjoyed night fighting because

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.770 
he would enjoyed night fighting because
he<00:03:08.890> ignores<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.310> he<00:03:09.459> does<00:03:10.000> steal<00:03:10.239> initiative

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
he ignores it he does steal initiative

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.050 
he ignores it he does steal initiative
and<00:03:11.050> so<00:03:11.470> here's<00:03:11.680> his<00:03:11.800> opportunity<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:12.580> take<00:03:13.030> a

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
and so here's his opportunity to take a

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.449 
and so here's his opportunity to take a
chunk<00:03:13.360> of<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.600> orc<00:03:13.750> army<00:03:14.050> he<00:03:14.290> is<00:03:14.440> way<00:03:14.980> way<00:03:15.250> back

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
chunk of the orc army he is way way back

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.170 
chunk of the orc army he is way way back
there<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:15.790> obviously<00:03:15.970> we<00:03:16.390> are<00:03:16.450> on<00:03:16.570> that

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
there and obviously we are on that

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.470 
there and obviously we are on that
a<00:03:17.299> long<00:03:17.959> table<00:03:18.739> alleged<00:03:19.159> appointment<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:19.879> so

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
a long table alleged appointment and so

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.330 
a long table alleged appointment and so
all<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.959> different<00:03:21.290> Venom's<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:22.129> the

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
all the different Venom's and the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.660 
all the different Venom's and the
Raiders<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.510> Ravagers<00:03:23.989> I'll<00:03:24.590> move<00:03:25.459> there

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
Raiders and the Ravagers I'll move there

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.250 
Raiders and the Ravagers I'll move there
six<00:03:26.000> inches<00:03:26.299> and<00:03:26.540> such<00:03:26.750> although<00:03:27.049> that<00:03:27.230> I

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
six inches and such although that I

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.750 
six inches and such although that I
guess<00:03:27.469> they<00:03:27.620> could<00:03:27.829> move<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.099> bit<00:03:28.310> further<00:03:28.549> and

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
guess they could move a bit further and

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.220 
guess they could move a bit further and
still<00:03:29.000> shoot<00:03:29.239> their<00:03:29.390> weapons<00:03:29.719> but<00:03:29.959> not<00:03:30.109> all

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
still shoot their weapons but not all

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
the troops inside so we does shoot three

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.470 
the troops inside so we does shoot three

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
saw easily what he could do output

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:49.810 
saw easily what he could do output
damage<00:04:48.560> wise<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:48.979> shots<00:04:49.190> I<00:04:49.400> need<00:04:49.550> to<00:04:49.639> close

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
damage wise and shots I need to close

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.450 
damage wise and shots I need to close
the<00:04:49.940> distance<00:04:50.090> as<00:04:50.449> far<00:04:50.630> as<00:04:50.750> fast<00:04:51.050> as<00:04:51.229> possible

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
the distance as far as fast as possible

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.529 
the distance as far as fast as possible
also<00:04:52.460> because<00:04:52.610> I've<00:04:52.820> a<00:04:52.849> lot<00:04:53.000> of<00:04:53.090> strength<00:04:53.330> five

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
also because I've a lot of strength five

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.749 
also because I've a lot of strength five
stuff<00:04:53.900> and<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.139> old<00:04:54.289> stuff<00:04:54.680> his<00:04:54.830> armor<00:04:55.130> 10<00:04:55.490> and

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
stuff and the old stuff his armor 10 and

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.360 
stuff and the old stuff his armor 10 and
so<00:04:56.090> my<00:04:56.300> bikes<00:04:56.570> can<00:04:56.750> actually<00:04:57.199> do<00:04:57.919> a<00:04:57.949> lot<00:04:58.340> of

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
so my bikes can actually do a lot of

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.469 
so my bikes can actually do a lot of
damage<00:04:59.530> so<00:05:00.530> the<00:05:00.889> battle<00:05:01.789> wagon<00:05:02.060> moving

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479
