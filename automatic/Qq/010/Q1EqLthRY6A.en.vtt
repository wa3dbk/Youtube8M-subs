00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
opening for phantom pain so far I think

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.980 
opening for phantom pain so far I think
the<00:02:47.520> script<00:02:47.820> only<00:02:48.030> comes<00:02:48.240> up<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.510> about<00:02:48.540> four

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
the script only comes up to about four

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.660 
the script only comes up to about four
minutes<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.470> that's<00:02:49.620> with<00:02:49.770> our<00:02:49.890> usual<00:02:50.280> intro

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
minutes and that's with our usual intro

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.760 
minutes and that's with our usual intro
and<00:02:50.850> outro<00:02:52.370> so<00:02:53.370> my<00:02:53.970> reaction<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.540> man<00:02:54.840> phantom

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
and outro so my reaction is man phantom

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.770 
and outro so my reaction is man phantom
pain<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.130> going<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.430> be<00:02:56.550> amazing<00:02:56.850> but<00:02:57.630> you're

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
pain is going to be amazing but you're

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.240 
pain is going to be amazing but you're
not<00:02:57.870> missing<00:02:58.290> much<00:02:58.320> from<00:02:58.650> ground<00:02:58.890> zeros

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
not missing much from ground zeros

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.550 
not missing much from ground zeros
except<00:02:59.910> for<00:03:00.090> how<00:03:00.210> amazing<00:03:00.720> phantom<00:03:01.170> pain<00:03:01.380> is

except for how amazing phantom pain is
going<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:01.950> be<00:03:02.180> maybe<00:03:03.180> we<00:03:03.360> could<00:03:03.570> have<00:03:03.660> lumped

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
going to be maybe we could have lumped

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.690 
going to be maybe we could have lumped
this<00:03:03.990> into<00:03:04.230> phantom<00:03:04.620> pain<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.040> got<00:03:05.250> phantom
