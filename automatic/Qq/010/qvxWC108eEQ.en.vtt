00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.740 

you<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.489> basically<00:00:33.000> add<00:00:33.180> up<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> kills

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
you have to basically add up the kills

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.479 
you have to basically add up the kills
from<00:00:33.930> your<00:00:34.140> units<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.649> see<00:00:34.829> how<00:00:35.070> ever<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.370> is

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
from your units and see how ever it is

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.090 
from your units and see how ever it is
that<00:00:35.550> yes<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.000> what<00:00:36.149> we're<00:00:36.329> doing<00:00:36.360> here<00:00:36.600> is

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
that yes so what we're doing here is

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.130 
that yes so what we're doing here is
we're<00:00:38.100> just<00:00:38.370> walking<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.210> running<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.780> units

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
we're just walking and running the units

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.860 
we're just walking and running the units
into<00:00:40.379> each<00:00:40.500> other<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.399> no<00:00:41.640> charge<00:00:42.030> bonus<00:00:42.629> is

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
into each other so no charge bonus is

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.639 
into each other so no charge bonus is
activated<00:00:43.910> see<00:00:44.910> no<00:00:45.090> kills<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.690> charge<00:00:46.020> no

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
activated see no kills on the charge no

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.250 
activated see no kills on the charge no
charge<00:00:46.680> bonus<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.000> these<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.750> reason<00:00:48.989> why<00:00:49.110> we

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
charge bonus so these the reason why we

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.080 
charge bonus so these the reason why we
chose<00:00:49.289> these<00:00:49.680> cutter<00:00:49.950> Factory<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.640> that

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
chose these cutter Factory is that

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.819 
chose these cutter Factory is that
they're<00:00:51.239> going<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.570> take<00:00:51.809> forever<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.469> killing

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
they're going to take forever in killing

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.340 
they're going to take forever in killing
each<00:00:52.920> other<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.940> presumably<00:00:54.629> most<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
each other so presumably most of the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.069 
each other so presumably most of the
damage<00:00:55.710> done<00:00:56.039> here<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.520> going<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.910> be<00:00:57.149> damage

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
damage done here is going to be damage

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.970 
damage done here is going to be damage
done<00:00:58.379> by<00:00:59.570> by<00:01:00.570> these<00:01:00.809> curvatures<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.620> both

done by by these curvatures so I both

how<00:02:42.110> many<00:02:42.380> kills<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.220> enemy<00:02:43.519> unit<00:02:43.820> has<00:02:44.030> gotten

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
how many kills the enemy unit has gotten

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.720 
how many kills the enemy unit has gotten
and<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.260> should<00:02:45.530> basically<00:02:45.709> tell<00:02:46.250> us<00:02:46.430> how

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
and that should basically tell us how

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.420 
and that should basically tell us how
many<00:02:46.790> friendly<00:02:47.480> fire<00:02:47.720> casualties<00:02:48.320> we<00:02:49.220> have

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
many friendly fire casualties we have

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.360 
many friendly fire casualties we have
done<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.360> let's<00:02:50.959> pause<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.440> here<00:02:51.470> at<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.130> point

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
done so let's pause it here at the point

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.590 
done so let's pause it here at the point
where<00:02:52.760> both<00:02:53.060> got<00:02:53.360> a<00:02:53.390> victory<00:02:53.750> units<00:02:54.260> break<00:02:55.600> the

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
where both got a victory units break the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.270 
where both got a victory units break the
country<00:02:57.470> Tory<00:02:57.890> here<00:02:58.220> have<00:02:58.519> 11<00:02:59.239> kills<00:03:00.250> while<00:03:01.250> I

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
country Tory here have 11 kills while I

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:09.390 
country Tory here have 11 kills while I
have<00:03:01.730> lost<00:03:02.030> let's<00:03:02.690> see<00:03:03.160> 27<00:03:04.160> plus<00:03:04.640> 11<00:03:05.060> dots<00:03:07.690> 38

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
have lost let's see 27 plus 11 dots 38

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.880 
have lost let's see 27 plus 11 dots 38
so<00:03:11.650> 22<00:03:12.760> friendly<00:03:13.760> for<00:03:13.970> casualties<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:14.930> I'm

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
so 22 friendly for casualties and I'm

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.310 
so 22 friendly for casualties and I'm
getting<00:03:16.400> 27<00:03:17.360> kills<00:03:17.630> so<00:03:18.489> it's<00:03:19.489> not<00:03:20.060> quite<00:03:20.390> 50/50

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
getting 27 kills so it's not quite 50/50

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.970 
getting 27 kills so it's not quite 50/50
in<00:03:21.410> terms<00:03:21.650> of<00:03:21.860> friendly<00:03:22.519> fire<00:03:22.670> damage<00:03:23.150> and

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
in terms of friendly fire damage and

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.020 
in terms of friendly fire damage and
another<00:03:26.140> enemy<00:03:27.140> kills<00:03:27.500> but<00:03:28.160> it's<00:03:28.310> it's

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
another enemy kills but it's it's

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.100 
another enemy kills but it's it's
getting<00:03:29.570> there<00:03:29.750> it's<00:03:29.780> getting<00:03:30.079> close<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.799> that

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
getting there it's getting close to that

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.289 
getting there it's getting close to that
so<00:03:33.110> not<00:03:33.440> secure<00:03:33.709> engagements<00:03:34.280> are<00:03:34.430> all<00:03:34.670> very

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
so not secure engagements are all very

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.780 
so not secure engagements are all very
very<00:03:36.049> ineffective

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
very ineffective

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.940 
very ineffective
so<00:03:38.569> let's<00:03:38.720> see<00:03:38.810> what<00:03:38.959> happens<00:03:39.260> over<00:03:39.439> here<00:03:39.560> when

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
so let's see what happens over here when

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.390 
so let's see what happens over here when
the<00:03:40.040> unit<00:03:40.340> starts<00:03:40.700> breaking<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.950> just<00:03:43.250> as

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
the unit starts breaking and just as

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.360 
the unit starts breaking and just as
they<00:03:43.579> break<00:03:43.790> I<00:03:44.090> will<00:03:44.150> pause<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:47.379> okay<00:03:48.409> units

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
they break I will pause it okay units

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.880 
they break I will pause it okay units
are<00:03:49.489> broken<00:03:49.849> so<00:03:50.120> again<00:03:51.110> the<00:03:51.290> conservatory

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
are broken so again the conservatory

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.539 
are broken so again the conservatory
gets<00:03:52.250> seven<00:03:52.610> kills<00:03:54.069> over<00:03:55.069> here<00:03:55.280> it's<00:03:55.430> even

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
gets seven kills over here it's even

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.199 
gets seven kills over here it's even
worse<00:03:56.950> seven<00:03:57.950> kills<00:03:58.159> on<00:03:58.370> this<00:03:58.489> cutter<00:03:58.700> Factory

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
worse seven kills on this cutter Factory

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.059 
worse seven kills on this cutter Factory
there<00:04:00.049> are<00:04:00.459> 14<00:04:02.170> remaining<00:04:03.170> here<00:04:03.349> so<00:04:03.920> that

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
there are 14 remaining here so that

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:11.369 
there are 14 remaining here so that
means<00:04:04.310> that<00:04:04.489> we<00:04:04.640> have<00:04:04.760> 21<00:04:05.890> plus<00:04:07.209> 39<00:04:08.319> we<00:04:09.319> have<00:04:09.549> 39

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
means that we have 21 plus 39 we have 39

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.360 
means that we have 21 plus 39 we have 39
friendly<00:04:12.379> fire<00:04:12.790> casualties<00:04:14.049> 39<00:04:15.049> now<00:04:16.010> I<00:04:16.039> did

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
friendly fire casualties 39 now I did

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.949 
friendly fire casualties 39 now I did
give<00:04:16.609> them<00:04:16.760> a<00:04:16.880> volley<00:04:17.060> from<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.479> angle<00:04:17.780> here

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
give them a volley from the angle here

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.099 
give them a volley from the angle here
but<00:04:18.109> they<00:04:18.229> were<00:04:18.350> this<00:04:18.650> was<00:04:18.829> just<00:04:19.070> to<00:04:19.220> simulate

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
but they were this was just to simulate

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.570 
but they were this was just to simulate
similar<00:04:21.109> firing<00:04:21.560> from<00:04:21.829> from<00:04:22.280> different

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
similar firing from from different

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.810 
similar firing from from different
angles<00:04:22.910> so<00:04:23.229> 31<00:04:24.229> friendly<00:04:24.710> fire<00:04:24.919> casualties<00:04:25.550> in

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
angles so 31 friendly fire casualties in

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:33.390 
angles so 31 friendly fire casualties in
that<00:04:26.180> engagements<00:04:27.970> 22<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.330> other<00:04:29.449> one

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.070 

and<00:04:34.400> I'll<00:04:34.699> do<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:35.000> same<00:04:35.240> thing<00:04:35.300> here<00:04:35.810> when

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
and I'll do the same thing here when

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.939 
and I'll do the same thing here when
these<00:04:36.229> units<00:04:37.070> break<00:04:37.280> so<00:04:38.289> these<00:04:39.289> units<00:04:39.560> have

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
these units break so these units have

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:44.950 
these units break so these units have
from<00:04:40.520> tourists<00:04:40.970> have<00:04:41.090> 56<00:04:41.570> kills<00:04:42.849> there<00:04:43.849> are<00:04:44.060> 59

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
from tourists have 56 kills there are 59

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.129 
from tourists have 56 kills there are 59
men<00:04:45.380> remaining<00:04:45.919> in<00:04:46.039> the<00:04:46.160> unit<00:04:47.020> so<00:04:49.960> let's<00:04:50.960> see

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
men remaining in the unit so let's see

00:04:51.139 --> 00:05:02.010 
men remaining in the unit so let's see
here<00:04:51.320> 50<00:04:53.889> 59<00:04:57.160> 56<00:04:58.479> that's<00:04:59.479> a<00:04:59.840> hundred<00:05:00.139> armed<00:05:01.099> 14

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
here 50 59 56 that's a hundred armed 14

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.540 
here 50 59 56 that's a hundred armed 14
so<00:05:03.020> it<00:05:03.650> looks<00:05:04.039> like<00:05:04.310> I<00:05:04.490> only<00:05:04.699> cost<00:05:06.220> six<00:05:07.220> for

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
so it looks like I only cost six for

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.540 
so it looks like I only cost six for
difficulties<00:05:08.449> in<00:05:08.720> this<00:05:09.050> engagements<00:05:09.590> kill

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
difficulties in this engagements kill

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.429 
difficulties in this engagements kill
that<00:05:10.760> be<00:05:10.940> right

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:13.439 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:15.799 

let's<00:05:14.279> just<00:05:14.489> let's<00:05:14.939> just<00:05:15.059> do<00:05:15.360> that<00:05:15.389> count

00:05:15.799 --> 00:05:15.809 
let's just let's just do that count

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:21.489 
let's just let's just do that count
again<00:05:16.259> so<00:05:16.709> the<00:05:16.830> Previn<00:05:17.099> tourists<00:05:17.459> killed<00:05:17.819> 56<00:05:18.449> I

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:21.499 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:25.669 

have<00:05:22.499> 59<00:05:23.159> men<00:05:23.610> remaining<00:05:24.119> in<00:05:24.209> the<00:05:24.300> unit<00:05:24.679> so

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:25.679 
have 59 men remaining in the unit so

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:34.909 
have 59 men remaining in the unit so
that's<00:05:26.539> 56<00:05:27.830> plus<00:05:29.599> 59<00:05:30.599> which<00:05:31.349> should<00:05:31.949> be<00:05:33.050> 114<00:05:34.050> so

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
that's 56 plus 59 which should be 114 so

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.790 
that's 56 plus 59 which should be 114 so
only<00:05:35.279> six<00:05:35.580> friendly<00:05:35.969> fire<00:05:36.179> casualties<00:05:36.800> very

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
only six friendly fire casualties very

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.509 
only six friendly fire casualties very
interesting<00:05:38.509> on<00:05:39.509> the<00:05:39.749> statutory<00:05:41.719> we<00:05:42.719> have

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:43.519 
interesting on the statutory we have

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:51.049 
interesting on the statutory we have
let's<00:05:44.519> see<00:05:44.759> 54<00:05:45.479> kills<00:05:47.659> 65<00:05:48.659> kills<00:05:49.219> nor<00:05:50.219> sixty<00:05:50.579> 60

00:05:51.049 --> 00:05:51.059 
let's see 54 kills 65 kills nor sixty 60

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.089 
let's see 54 kills 65 kills nor sixty 60
men<00:05:51.209> remaining<00:05:51.509> and<00:05:52.319> they're<00:05:52.559> about<00:05:52.649> to<00:05:52.800> break

00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:59.869 
so I'm going to pour some more fire into
the<00:05:55.800> blob<00:05:56.099> here<00:05:58.069> see<00:05:59.069> how<00:05:59.129> many<00:05:59.339> friendly<00:05:59.669> four

00:05:59.869 --> 00:05:59.879 
the blob here see how many friendly four

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:08.809 
the blob here see how many friendly four
casualties<00:06:02.449> so<00:06:03.709> 56<00:06:04.709> kills<00:06:06.050> 54<00:06:07.050> men<00:06:07.229> raining<00:06:07.819> it

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:08.819 
casualties so 56 kills 54 men raining it

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:13.519 
casualties so 56 kills 54 men raining it
would<00:06:09.119> seem<00:06:09.389> that<00:06:11.479> the<00:06:12.479> friendly<00:06:12.959> fire

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:13.529 
would seem that the friendly fire

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:18.350 
would seem that the friendly fire
casualties<00:06:14.309> are<00:06:14.519> much<00:06:15.300> more<00:06:15.989> severe<00:06:16.800> in<00:06:17.360> when

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
casualties are much more severe in when

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.459 
casualties are much more severe in when
firing<00:06:18.719> up<00:06:19.939> when<00:06:20.939> firing<00:06:21.209> at<00:06:21.449> engaged<00:06:21.869> cavalry

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:22.469 
firing up when firing at engaged cavalry

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:26.540 
firing up when firing at engaged cavalry
and<00:06:22.769> I<00:06:23.399> think<00:06:23.939> the<00:06:24.479> reason<00:06:24.929> for<00:06:24.959> that<00:06:25.550> they

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
and I think the reason for that they

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.970 
and I think the reason for that they
start<00:06:26.969> a<00:06:27.149> cavalry<00:06:27.629> unit

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
start a cavalry unit

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.800 
start a cavalry unit
is<00:06:30.930> let's<00:06:31.930> see<00:06:32.020> if<00:06:32.110> we<00:06:32.170> have<00:06:32.200> a<00:06:32.350> cover<00:06:32.590> it<00:06:32.860> yeah

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
is let's see if we have a cover it yeah

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.800 
is let's see if we have a cover it yeah
and<00:06:34.810> the<00:06:35.140> cavalry<00:06:35.500> is<00:06:35.830> higher<00:06:36.420> it's<00:06:37.420> taller

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
and the cavalry is higher it's taller

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.320 
and the cavalry is higher it's taller
than<00:06:38.160> an<00:06:39.160> infantry<00:06:39.910> innit

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
than an infantry innit

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.700 
than an infantry innit
so<00:06:40.960> since<00:06:41.290> unit<00:06:41.800> since<00:06:42.630> since<00:06:43.630> missiles<00:06:44.500> have

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
so since unit since since missiles have

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.310 
so since unit since since missiles have
a<00:06:44.740> tendency<00:06:45.340> to<00:06:45.580> miss<00:06:45.760> in<00:06:46.150> front<00:06:46.930> and<00:06:47.170> behind

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
a tendency to miss in front and behind

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.160 
a tendency to miss in front and behind
of<00:06:47.650> the<00:06:47.770> year<00:06:47.920> of<00:06:48.360> based<00:06:49.360> and<00:06:49.540> infantry<00:06:49.930> in<00:06:50.020> it

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.170 
of the year of based and infantry in it

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.790 
of the year of based and infantry in it
I<00:06:51.540> think<00:06:52.540> it<00:06:52.690> would<00:06:52.840> be<00:06:52.960> reasonable<00:06:53.350> to<00:06:53.530> assume

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
I think it would be reasonable to assume

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.290 
I think it would be reasonable to assume
that<00:06:54.040> in<00:06:54.850> the<00:06:55.300> cavalry<00:06:55.750> blob<00:06:57.030> let<00:06:58.030> more

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300 
that in the cavalry blob let more

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.820 
that in the cavalry blob let more
missiles<00:06:58.750> are<00:06:58.990> going<00:06:59.200> to<00:06:59.320> be<00:06:59.440> hitting<00:06:59.650> the

00:06:59.820 --> 00:06:59.830 
missiles are going to be hitting the

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.710 
missiles are going to be hitting the
cover<00:07:00.130> of<00:07:00.310> units<00:07:01.440> because<00:07:03.090> the<00:07:04.090> missiles<00:07:04.480> that

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 
cover of units because the missiles that

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.409 
cover of units because the missiles that
would<00:07:04.900> otherwise<00:07:05.320> go<00:07:06.070> travel<00:07:06.700> above<00:07:07.030> the

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:07.419 
would otherwise go travel above the

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:10.020 
would otherwise go travel above the
units<00:07:07.720> are<00:07:08.169> going<00:07:08.440> to<00:07:08.560> be<00:07:08.830> hitting<00:07:09.190> the<00:07:09.400> taller

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
units are going to be hitting the taller

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.140 
units are going to be hitting the taller
cavalry<00:07:10.810> units<00:07:11.050> so<00:07:11.890> firing<00:07:12.550> into<00:07:12.760> cavalry

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.150 
cavalry units so firing into cavalry

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.310 
cavalry units so firing into cavalry
blobs<00:07:13.360> is<00:07:14.110> a<00:07:14.169> very<00:07:14.680> very<00:07:15.040> risky<00:07:15.370> strategy<00:07:16.320> with

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:17.320 
blobs is a very very risky strategy with

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.170 
blobs is a very very risky strategy with
skirmishers<00:07:19.230> especially<00:07:20.230> if<00:07:20.440> you<00:07:21.160> would<00:07:21.940> win

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:22.180 
skirmishers especially if you would win

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.080 
skirmishers especially if you would win
that<00:07:22.480> engagement<00:07:23.460> even<00:07:24.460> if<00:07:24.580> you<00:07:24.669> don't<00:07:24.820> fire

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.090 
that engagement even if you don't fire

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.390 
that engagement even if you don't fire
into<00:07:25.390> the<00:07:25.419> blob<00:07:25.690> so<00:07:26.260> I<00:07:26.320> think<00:07:26.560> a<00:07:26.740> case<00:07:27.100> could<00:07:27.340> be

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 
into the blob so I think a case could be

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.950 
into the blob so I think a case could be
made<00:07:27.550> for<00:07:27.730> doing<00:07:28.150> as<00:07:28.300> much<00:07:28.480> damage<00:07:28.780> as

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 
made for doing as much damage as

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.680 
made for doing as much damage as
possible<00:07:29.190> before<00:07:30.210> the<00:07:31.210> cavalry<00:07:31.600> engagement

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:31.690 
possible before the cavalry engagement

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.080 
possible before the cavalry engagement
starts<00:07:32.470> happening<00:07:32.590> and<00:07:33.070> being<00:07:33.490> very<00:07:33.850> careful

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.090 
starts happening and being very careful

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.600 
starts happening and being very careful
about<00:07:34.390> pouring<00:07:34.780> fire<00:07:35.050> into<00:07:35.950> one's<00:07:36.130> own<00:07:36.310> blobs

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:36.610 
about pouring fire into one's own blobs

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.750 
about pouring fire into one's own blobs
because<00:07:36.970> I<00:07:37.090> have<00:07:37.240> seen<00:07:37.510> more<00:07:38.020> than<00:07:38.229> a<00:07:38.290> hundred

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:38.760 
because I have seen more than a hundred

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.969 
because I have seen more than a hundred
in<00:07:39.760> friendly<00:07:40.270> cavalry<00:07:40.660> units<00:07:40.990> being<00:07:41.560> killed

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:41.979 
in friendly cavalry units being killed

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:44.640 
in friendly cavalry units being killed
by<00:07:42.640> what<00:07:43.030> was<00:07:43.479> supposed<00:07:43.840> to<00:07:43.960> be<00:07:44.110> supporting

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:44.650 
by what was supposed to be supporting

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.580 
by what was supposed to be supporting
fire<00:07:44.890> but<00:07:45.669> what<00:07:45.880> ended<00:07:46.270> up<00:07:46.419> being<00:07:46.590> actually

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:47.590 
fire but what ended up being actually

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.340 
fire but what ended up being actually
helping<00:07:48.070> for<00:07:48.370> the<00:07:48.460> enemy<00:07:48.790> killing<00:07:49.300> by<00:07:50.050> killing

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:50.350 
helping for the enemy killing by killing

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:55.080 
helping for the enemy killing by killing
your<00:07:50.470> own<00:07:50.530> shoes<00:07:51.960> strengthen<00:07:52.960> over
