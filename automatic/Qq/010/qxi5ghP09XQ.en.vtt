is so incredible beyond where I ever got
into<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.090> process<00:04:45.600> you<00:04:45.870> know<00:04:45.960> there's<00:04:46.110> 200

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
into the process you know there's 200

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.520 
into the process you know there's 200
years<00:04:46.860> in<00:04:47.370> some<00:04:48.000> cases<00:04:48.030> of<00:04:48.600> history<00:04:49.169> before<00:04:49.350> I

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
years in some cases of history before I

take<00:04:53.669> that<00:04:53.880> 200<00:04:54.300> years<00:04:54.540> and<00:04:55.140> either<00:04:55.260> make<00:04:55.590> it

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
take that 200 years and either make it

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.300 
take that 200 years and either make it
live<00:04:55.890> on<00:04:56.100> or<00:04:56.490> honor<00:04:56.820> it<00:04:57.000> in<00:04:57.120> some<00:04:57.300> way<00:04:58.280> what<00:04:59.280> I

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
live on or honor it in some way what I

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.850 
live on or honor it in some way what I
find<00:04:59.640> is<00:04:59.820> the<00:04:59.850> tree<00:05:00.270> only<00:05:01.229> is<00:05:01.470> gonna<00:05:01.650> live<00:05:01.830> so

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
find is the tree only is gonna live so

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.520 
find is the tree only is gonna live so
long<00:05:02.570> but<00:05:03.570> if<00:05:03.630> you<00:05:03.690> make<00:05:03.900> a<00:05:03.930> nice<00:05:04.229> piece<00:05:04.500> of

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
long but if you make a nice piece of

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.469 
long but if you make a nice piece of
furniture<00:05:04.830> or<00:05:05.130> a<00:05:05.310> nice<00:05:05.610> wood<00:05:05.940> turning<00:05:06.330> or

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
furniture or a nice wood turning or

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.740 
furniture or a nice wood turning or
something<00:05:06.900> out<00:05:07.050> of<00:05:07.080> it<00:05:07.760> that<00:05:08.760> piece<00:05:09.240> of<00:05:09.450> piece

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
something out of it that piece of piece

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.210 
something out of it that piece of piece
that's<00:05:10.020> made<00:05:10.229> out<00:05:10.260> of<00:05:10.440> it<00:05:10.620> one<00:05:10.800> of<00:05:10.890> Martin's

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
that's made out of it one of Martin's

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.590 
that's made out of it one of Martin's
tables<00:05:11.610> maybe<00:05:11.930> around<00:05:14.120> 200<00:05:15.120> years<00:05:15.300> from<00:05:15.419> now

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
tables maybe around 200 years from now

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.820 
tables maybe around 200 years from now
so<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.620> wood<00:05:16.770> outlives<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.520> tree<00:05:17.760> by<00:05:18.000> far<00:05:18.830> the

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
so the wood outlives the tree by far the

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.560 
so the wood outlives the tree by far the
majority<00:05:19.979> of<00:05:20.310> people<00:05:20.430> buying<00:05:20.790> our<00:05:21.060> furniture

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
majority of people buying our furniture

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.690 
majority of people buying our furniture
are<00:05:21.810> buying<00:05:22.260> generational<00:05:23.190> pieces<00:05:23.580> of

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
are buying generational pieces of

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.310 
are buying generational pieces of
furniture<00:05:23.880> so<00:05:24.270> it<00:05:24.479> will<00:05:24.690> mature<00:05:24.990> with<00:05:25.169> their

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
furniture so it will mature with their

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.470 
furniture so it will mature with their
families<00:05:25.800> just<00:05:26.040> as<00:05:26.790> their<00:05:27.000> families<00:05:27.450> expand

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.360
