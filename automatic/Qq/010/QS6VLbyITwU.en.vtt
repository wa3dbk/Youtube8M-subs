00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
so here are the puzzles there's three

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.099 
so here are the puzzles there's three
puzzles<00:00:25.859> first<00:00:26.340> one's<00:00:26.580> pretty<00:00:26.849> easy<00:00:27.109> second

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
puzzles first one's pretty easy second

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.830 
puzzles first one's pretty easy second
one's<00:00:28.230> medium<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.920> recommend<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.939> do<00:00:30.420> these<00:00:30.599> as

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
one's medium I recommend you do these as

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.080 
one's medium I recommend you do these as
fast<00:00:31.080> as<00:00:31.320> possible<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.550> last<00:00:32.759> one

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
fast as possible because the last one

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.150 
fast as possible because the last one
you're<00:00:33.270> probably<00:00:33.570> gonna<00:00:33.840> need<00:00:33.950> some<00:00:34.950> time

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
you're probably gonna need some time

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.450 
you're probably gonna need some time
it's<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.520> little<00:00:35.730> difficult<00:00:40.100> you<00:00:41.100> should<00:00:41.309> be

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
it's a little difficult you should be

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.950 
it's a little difficult you should be
able<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.640> do<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.910> faster<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.510> did<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.960> oh<00:00:44.960> I

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
able to do it faster and I did this oh I

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.830 
able to do it faster and I did this oh I
had<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> difficult<00:00:46.710> time<00:00:47.129> with<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:47.840> but

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
had a difficult time with this one but

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.439 
had a difficult time with this one but
you<00:00:48.989> see<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.379> blinkin<00:00:50.370> section<00:00:50.940> with<00:00:51.090> six

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
you see the blinkin section with six

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.380 
you see the blinkin section with six
dots<00:00:51.930> that's<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.829> power<00:00:53.039> supply<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.239> what

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
dots that's the power supply so what

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.750 
dots that's the power supply so what
you're<00:00:54.539> trying<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.350> simply<00:00:56.250> get<00:00:56.489> power

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
you're trying to do is simply get power

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.420 
you're trying to do is simply get power
to<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> other<00:00:57.360> nodes<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.039> they<00:00:59.039> light<00:00:59.280> up

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
to the other nodes and they light up

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.639 
to the other nodes and they light up
green<00:00:59.460> when<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.090> get<00:01:00.239> them<00:01:00.379> get<00:01:01.379> them<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
green when you get them get them in the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.979 
green when you get them get them in the
proper<00:01:01.980> order<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.390> one<00:01:03.600> only<00:01:03.750> has<00:01:03.960> one

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
proper order so this one only has one

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.219 
proper order so this one only has one
power<00:01:04.379> supply<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.489> got<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.729> try<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
power supply so you got to try to

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.560 
power supply so you got to try to
reroute<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.820> every<00:01:08.820> bulb<00:01:11.299> so<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.360> can

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
reroute it to every bulb so you can

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.149 
reroute it to every bulb so you can
start<00:01:12.869> off<00:01:13.020> by<00:01:13.200> anything<00:01:13.619> that's<00:01:13.979> not

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
start off by anything that's not

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.320 
start off by anything that's not
connected<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.700> something

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
connected to something

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.960 
connected to something
line<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.960> up<00:01:16.250> it<00:01:17.250> seems<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.549> little<00:01:17.759> straight

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
line it up it seems a little straight

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.730 
line it up it seems a little straight
ones<00:01:18.180> they're<00:01:18.330> not<00:01:18.479> connected<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.470> go<00:01:19.619> ahead

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
ones they're not connected just go ahead

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.499 
ones they're not connected just go ahead
and<00:01:19.920> line<00:01:20.040> them<00:01:20.130> up<00:01:20.280> maybe<00:01:20.880> they'll<00:01:21.119> work<00:01:21.270> in

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
and line them up maybe they'll work in

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:31.859 
and line them up maybe they'll work in
there<00:01:21.689> later

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.560 

and<00:01:32.289> sometimes<00:01:33.189> that<00:01:33.429> the<00:01:33.789> power<00:01:34.000> has<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.390> take

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
and sometimes that the power has to take

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.480 
and sometimes that the power has to take
the<00:01:34.689> long<00:01:34.869> way<00:01:35.020> see<00:01:35.229> that<00:01:35.409> for<00:01:35.590> that<00:01:35.710> one<00:01:35.890> it

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
the long way see that for that one it

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.010 
the long way see that for that one it
actually<00:01:36.670> took<00:01:37.060> a<00:01:37.119> long<00:01:37.359> way<00:01:37.539> you<00:01:37.719> could<00:01:37.899> have

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
actually took a long way you could have

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.779 
actually took a long way you could have
easily<00:01:38.200> connected<00:01:38.799> it<00:01:38.950> right<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.490> little

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
easily connected it right to the little

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.919 
easily connected it right to the little
node<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:41.200> would<00:01:41.319> have<00:01:41.380> been<00:01:41.469> done<00:01:42.929> but

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
node and you would have been done but

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:45.300 
node and you would have been done but
then<00:01:44.079> the<00:01:44.259> other<00:01:44.380> ones<00:01:44.649> wouldn't<00:01:44.890> meddle<00:01:45.130> it

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
then the other ones wouldn't meddle it

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.850 
then the other ones wouldn't meddle it
up<00:01:45.539> all<00:01:46.539> right<00:01:46.569> here's<00:01:46.929> the<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.380> final<00:01:47.710> one<00:01:47.829> I

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
up all right here's the the final one I

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.800 
up all right here's the the final one I
got<00:01:48.159> 2<00:01:48.369> minutes<00:01:48.549> 30<00:01:48.880> seconds<00:01:49.390> hopefully<00:01:49.719> you

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
got 2 minutes 30 seconds hopefully you

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.910 
got 2 minutes 30 seconds hopefully you
get<00:01:49.929> about<00:01:50.140> three<00:01:50.319> minutes<00:01:52.500> now<00:01:53.500> this<00:01:53.709> isn't

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
get about three minutes now this isn't

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.730 
get about three minutes now this isn't
the<00:01:54.039> same<00:01:54.340> board<00:01:54.640> I<00:01:54.789> just<00:01:55.030> did<00:01:55.619> when<00:01:56.619> I<00:01:56.649> had

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
the same board I just did when I had

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.399 
the same board I just did when I had
died<00:01:57.130> so<00:01:57.640> they<00:01:57.939> do<00:01:58.000> change<00:01:58.390> this<00:01:58.719> this<00:01:59.170> third

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
died so they do change this this third

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.620 
died so they do change this this third
one<00:02:00.209> here<00:02:01.209> even<00:02:01.659> the<00:02:01.780> first<00:02:02.289> unit<00:02:03.360> but<00:02:04.360> if

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
one here even the first unit but if

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.479 
one here even the first unit but if
you're<00:02:04.810> doing<00:02:04.929> this<00:02:05.140> one<00:02:05.349> basically<00:02:06.250> the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:06.489 
you're doing this one basically the

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:08.400 
you're doing this one basically the
concept<00:02:07.000> is<00:02:07.149> you<00:02:07.179> see<00:02:07.539> there's<00:02:07.720> two<00:02:07.780> two

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
concept is you see there's two two

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.889 
concept is you see there's two two
flashing<00:02:08.979> green<00:02:09.369> ones<00:02:09.729> connect<00:02:10.599> the<00:02:10.720> power

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
flashing green ones connect the power
