00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.000
 of destiny today it's time to talk about the class 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:12.459
 of guardian that we have the titan the 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.650
 first titans built the wall and 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.200
 they gave their lives to defend it with 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.170
 high, firm and secure protection 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.430
 everyone who shelters in his shadow 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.120
 descend from a long list of heroes 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.860

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.440
 they are equipped with fists 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.990
 scintillators that will leave electrified 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.610
 the enemies also have a 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.400
 armor and shield practically 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.440
 indestructible we like to think that they are 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.880
 faceless warriors beings that we 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.910
 protect from our innumerable 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.309
 enemies their power and determination gives them 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.130
 an air of omnipotent gods 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.710
 they have 80% metal armor and a 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.920
 20% of tera and specialize in weapons 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.480
 heavy as light machine guns 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.880
 these can be distinguished by their 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.129
 heavy full body armor and 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.649
 resistant and helmets on arrow towards 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.869
 back in addition as with the others 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.920
 classes these also have a 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.900
 fifth special slot 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.240
 the titan's armor is also 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.250
 characterized by carrying a piece of cloth 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.299
 on the right hip with intention to 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.670

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.259
 titan as we have already said is a class 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.270
 that specializes in armor and 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.729
 heavy weapons are big and 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.950
 resistant but the slowest at the same 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.500
 time still so his slowness looks 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.260
 compensated firepower and 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.840
 high durability 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.780

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.640
 mansalva these do not advance quickly 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.040
 but they do not need it since they can 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.630
 get hit and barely flinch if 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.910

 we did with the other guardians you're
