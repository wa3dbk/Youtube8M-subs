00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.379
 Hello UTB crazycat today we 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.109
 we will make polka dots for peas we don’t 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.710
 simple and magical and later I will tell 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.930
 why 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.939
 for work we need polymer 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.430
 fimo clay translucent white 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.039
 green gold acrylic colors 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.170
 rolling pin or pasta machine tools frame 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.110
 fastener studs for gold and gold 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.360
 the potal roll out the black plastic and 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.730
 which we cut two blanks we ride 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.370
 balls and gradually reduces the thickness 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.070
 layers do peas of different sizes 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.140
 for the largest peas I rolled 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.230
 layer on our post do not fall by unit 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.809
 for medium under two and for small 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.809
 on the unit and divided the square in half 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.750
 Well 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.280
 Now we roll not units 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.979
 green and gold 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.860
 put on potal and carefully cut out 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.180
 contour and roll on the post machine 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.299
 along with the tint 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.530
 a couple of divisions thinner we get 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.530
 very beautiful effect 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:47.480
 and now we gently wrap our 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.760
 pea blanks for large 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.340
 peas I cut out which squares and 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.860
 two things put off a pea so 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.800
 much more convenient and no extra material 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.770
 go kata balls until 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.690
 go all the joints I did not want to do 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.790
 Standard natural and peas 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.490
 the idea of ​​such a magical line was born 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.920
 from pure translucent white 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.530
 and in him it seems to be familiar to us green 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.110
 peas they are not easy but gradually 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.840
 gold and turn into gold 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.200
 the pea won one such hid itself 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.200
 corner of 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.209
 as soon as our peas are ready 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:45.280
 we bake them now we print 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.590
 hole from earrings and cut a piece 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.760
 plastics on fimo gel we put it in 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.760
 base and bake 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:17.320
 after baking, the plastic must be removed from 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.320
 fastener and glue on super glue 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.990
 roll out a layer of translucent 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.000
 white plastic and lay out our 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.910
 peas to measure the length of the future 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.030
 pod cut the layer into 4 identical 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.030
 parts 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.720
 cut out half a pod and each edge 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.610
 as if rounding up a little 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.270
 bend so that all the edges were 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.270
 rounded 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.790
 combine both halves digging fimo-gel 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.790
 inside and lay out the peas 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.140
 but 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.290
 we press a little bit with a silicone brush 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.750
 you can outline the contours of the peas 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.820
 on the outside of the pod and awl 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.560
 left to do a hole and send 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.130
 our magic pea final 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.130
 roasting 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.200
 all left to attach earrings peas 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.040
 using the connecting ring and 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.530
 our earrings 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.020

 gilt and gracefully looking in the ears and 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.310
 only upon closer inspection can 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.970
 see that this is a simple native pea 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.590
 just by the idea of ​​the author that is me 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.610
 look non-standard and a little bit
