00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello youtube friends 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.570
 today I bring you a video of how 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.670
 be able to surround your cell phone or 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.400
 put root access to your 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.350
 cellular devices or what it is that 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.430
 is the device 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.430
 excuse the root access 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.420
 the brother who likes the world 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.330
 Android should know it is to be able to 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.430
 have the user permissions of your 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.630
 Cell Phone 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.810
 and generally what it is to 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.840
 to have 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.400
 Full access to all your phone 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.770
 here it serves, for example, to move 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.990
 applications that are not movable to the sd 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.910
 and uninstall applications that come 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.970
 by default on your phone either by the 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.700
 same company or games we see because 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.360
 some examples ok 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:59.560
 so if you like that for example 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.400
 move whatsapp be able to move it to the sd and 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.870
 a series of other things that 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.730
 they are worth doing the first thing that 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.460
 let's do it's going to be good I 'll 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.690
 show the version of my device is 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.540
 a team 500 with version 2.3.3 ok 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.750
 let's go back and let's go to 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.659
 applications here in development and let's 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.340
 to palome 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.549
 to mark this option that says 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.760
 debug usb can bring a little bit 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.700
 to the camera 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.790
 in that application you do not have to place 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.520
 then he will tell us if we 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.070
 we want that that I think so 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:47.990
 and let's go back what we're going to 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:51.710
 do now more is going to be connect the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.650
 the phone to the usb or else it's going to be 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.180
 connected 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.570
 the pc 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.640
 we want it to connect and we are going to proceed 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.409
 to open the application the application will 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.119
 calls a hot log and comes to leave the 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.519
 link in the video description for 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.030
 that can download and install it as 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.030
 any application 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.530
 like any application on your pc 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.510
 when I put you in the debugger, I do not know 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.010
 I'm going to show you look for him a little bit 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.030
 short so I can not do much but 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.280
 they will come up with two options that is 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.110
 connected by usb and the other one that says goes 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.480
 up the debugging device 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.000
 had had connected those two 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.540
 options have to leave them some 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 or another way 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.390
 then I will show you what it is like 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.310
 the application is that it is necessary that 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.469
 when it is on the internet it will come out 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.599
 that way I'll just leave the list of the 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:53.319
 description forget us so that what 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:55.810
 can open and do this that the truth 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.459
 it is very easy 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.459
 then we will proceed to open it 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.469
 and this will appear to us that is quite 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.870
 simple ok what are we going to do good 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:11.569
 all options come out ok one goes out that says 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.189
 the root access and the other that is a robot 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.319
 that is the one that from below 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.930
 it's obviously to surround your phone and 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.359
 a role is to be able to get access 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.310
 root to your phone if you no longer need it 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.549
 or that the truth is that very easy and for 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.340
 and for the two options that follows the 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:32.190
 same process then let's go now 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.140
 have your phone connected 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.760
 to the computer you do not have to do 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.120
 absolutely nothing with your phone what 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.770
 let's calm down let's press root 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.190
 here in this aquila option 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.190
 we push 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.599
 to have it pressed here on the screen 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.760
 it comes out and well in this case to me 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:56.140
 the gt500 and the android version comes out 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.950
 2.3.3 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.380
 let's hope that this program loads 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.380
 it serves for an infinity of devices 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.870
 the truth is that it is too much 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.790
 devices for which they work 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.430
 okay 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.950
 so good 15 if you want to install 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.340
 power6 see is an application me in this 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:22.000
 case I say no because I do not 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.070
 I need here says debut your formosa if 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.320
 you want your phone to restart for 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.850
 that the whole process is done you 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.830
 you say yes in this option 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.830
 obviously he has to say that if the 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.620
 phone I'm going here now show you that 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.509
 the phone is restarting because 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.509
 the phone is restarting 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.720
 I hope you try to do it to the step of 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.540
 the letters ok step by step quiet no 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.830
 despair do the process that if you 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.510
 they realize that 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.330
 he is 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.300
 our system is restarting 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.800
 our phone as it said this this 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.040
 team or excuse me in this application 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.310
 in the description of the video already having 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.310
 their 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.990
 in the description book there is a 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.110
 infinity and the positive the truth is that 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:21.590
 it is without a doubt infinite because 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.590
 then one here we are going to place good 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:30.639
 we have a 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:35.240
 I recall that our phone is charged and 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:38.990
 let's proceed to disconnect the usb from 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:42.319
 our cell phone or with any 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.270
 otherwise the rodeo is done 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:46.849
 full 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:51.280
 then let's take out the let's go out 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:53.410
 of the application well then we are going to 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.389
 if they realize it was the same as what is not 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:59.320
 simple to the naked eye you do not see any 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:00.820
 change but here in the applications you 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.090
 will come out a new application that is that 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:07.180
 because we're going to bring the phone closer and that 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:10.180
 it's called super and usher is that application 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:13.120
 from there we are going to take it here then 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:16.660
 this application you have it just 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:20.380
 do in the each step you are going to open 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:23.560
 that application ok is an application in 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.750
 which already showed what each 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.550
 an infinity of things quite very very 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.430
 good news here tell you the news 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.630
 from the version that you have until the 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.890
 moment is updated as 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:37.780
 any other application and this the 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:39.370
 ok interface is a pretty application 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.260
 well there are applications that tell you 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.880
 root access needs a number of things 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.070
 all these applications that need 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.810
 root access and with this you havana 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.290
 they can enter without any problem and 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.240
 when they install it, they will say 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:56.020
 allow access to this application 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.000

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.590
 ok for the applications that obviously 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.580
 you want to install
