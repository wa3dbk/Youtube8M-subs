so<00:01:28.650> with<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.920> other<00:01:29.040> way<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:29.759> those<00:01:29.880> who

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
so with that other way for those who

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.640 
so with that other way for those who
didn't<00:01:30.329> now<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.540> know<00:01:30.720> what<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.869> raid<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.200> so

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
didn't now you know what a raid is so

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.980 
didn't now you know what a raid is so
how<00:01:31.860> does<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.040> apply<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.460> destiny<00:01:33.030> well<00:01:33.540> rate

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
how does that apply to destiny well rate

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.450 
how does that apply to destiny well rate
in<00:01:34.229> destiny<00:01:34.650> are<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.070> co-operative
