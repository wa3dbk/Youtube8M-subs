put that onto your desktop now whenever

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.830

you<00:03:23.980> run<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.310> game<00:03:24.459> make<00:03:25.030> sure<00:03:25.329> that<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:25.660> run

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
you run the game make sure that you run

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.440 
you run the game make sure that you run
it<00:03:25.989> through<00:03:26.230> this<00:03:26.549> otherwise<00:03:30.030> it<00:03:31.030> won't<00:03:31.329> work

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
it through this otherwise it won't work

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.960 
it through this otherwise it won't work
so<00:03:32.440> again<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.130> last<00:03:33.310> thing<00:03:33.489> we<00:03:33.579> need<00:03:33.730> to<00:03:33.760> do<00:03:33.880> is

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
so again the last thing we need to do is

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.599 
so again the last thing we need to do is
click<00:03:34.150> on<00:03:34.269> configure<00:03:34.750> now<00:03:35.709> go<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.010> playback

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
click on configure now go to playback

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.400

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
options and click on mute midi on custom

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.319

play<00:03:41.560> make<00:03:41.769> sure<00:03:41.950> it's<00:03:42.130> checked<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:42.730> again

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
play make sure it's checked and again

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.020 
play make sure it's checked and again
save<00:03:43.569> and<00:03:43.720> exit<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.170> then<00:03:44.680> run<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.579> game<00:03:45.760> and

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
save and exit and then run the game and

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.729 
save and exit and then run the game and
hopefully<00:03:46.209> now<00:03:48.269> we<00:03:49.269> should<00:03:49.450> be<00:03:49.569> using<00:03:49.739> mp3

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
hopefully now we should be using mp3

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.050 
hopefully now we should be using mp3
files<00:03:50.980> instead<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.549> the<00:03:51.639> MIDI<00:03:51.819> files

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060
