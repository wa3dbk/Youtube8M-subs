lucky this year to have access to a

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.300 
lucky this year to have access to a
front-end<00:03:41.820> loader<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:42.300> made<00:03:42.900> this<00:03:43.080> so<00:03:43.890> much

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
front-end loader that made this so much

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.920 
front-end loader that made this so much
easier<00:03:44.760> we<00:03:45.060> then<00:03:45.210> use<00:03:45.450> this<00:03:45.600> homemade

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
easier we then use this homemade

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.770 
easier we then use this homemade
fertilizer<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:47.040> grow<00:03:47.070> greens<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.270> vegetables

so<00:03:49.170> we<00:03:49.260> can<00:03:49.380> feed<00:03:49.560> our<00:03:49.650> animals<00:03:49.800> fresh<00:03:50.310> clean

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700
