coming<00:01:00.359> up<00:01:00.600> she<00:01:01.140> can<00:01:01.289> now<00:01:01.440> balance<00:01:01.920> walk<00:01:02.160> on

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
coming up she can now balance walk on

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.270 
coming up she can now balance walk on
thin<00:01:03.030> beams<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:04.320> she<00:01:04.619> had<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.040> capacity

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
thin beams but if she had the capacity

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.890 
thin beams but if she had the capacity
of<00:01:05.700> doing<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.060> why<00:01:06.330> wouldn't<00:01:06.659> she<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.810> able

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
of doing that why wouldn't she be able

walk<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> bowl<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.110> she<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.439> do<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.560> too

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
walk on the bowl so she can do that too

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.240 
walk on the bowl so she can do that too
now<00:01:11.520> she<00:01:12.450> can<00:01:12.630> take<00:01:12.659> out<00:01:13.049> her<00:01:13.170> gun<00:01:13.350> switch

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
balance beam she can still do combat all

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.999 
balance beam she can still do combat all
these<00:01:23.549> create<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.200> string<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.290> animations<00:01:25.860> that

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
these create a string of animations that

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.060 
these create a string of animations that
chest<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.090> enormous<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.740> number<00:01:29.009> of

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
chest is enormous the number of

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.050 
chest is enormous the number of

animations Lara has its rumored at 1,600

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.289 
animations Lara has its rumored at 1,600
but<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:34.110> another<00:01:34.670> batch<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.970> adds

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
but we have another batch that adds

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.560 
but we have another batch that adds
another<00:01:37.200> couple<00:01:37.680> hundred<00:01:37.759> so<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:39.060> mean<00:01:39.360> I

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
another couple hundred so I mean I

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.390 
another couple hundred so I mean I
wouldn't<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.320> shy<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> say<00:01:40.860> she<00:01:41.040> has<00:01:41.130> over

with<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.490> skirt<00:01:43.729> generational<00:01:44.570> systems<00:01:45.079> they

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
with the skirt generational systems they

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.139 
with the skirt generational systems they
just<00:01:45.439> make<00:01:45.619> Lara<00:01:45.920> all<00:01:46.159> that<00:01:46.460> more<00:01:46.670> believable

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149

achieve before all this sort of makes

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.990 
achieve before all this sort of makes
her<00:02:03.619> some<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:04.009> that<00:02:04.039> you<00:02:04.250> can<00:02:04.399> actually<00:02:04.520> relate

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
her some of that you can actually relate

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
discovery that they're gonna find in

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.600 
discovery that they're gonna find in
this<00:02:14.480> game<00:02:14.720> which<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:15.019> really<00:02:15.380> exciting
