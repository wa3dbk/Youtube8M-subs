 16 years ago he left us Antonio Molina 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.060
 of the most important figures of the 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.100
 Spanish song tonight we will remember 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.040
 his best couplets with his 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:35.220
 family and friends

 [Music] 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.160
 16 years ago the world of copla 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.400
 he lost one of his most important 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.340
 figures antonio molina died in his 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.610
 casa madrileÃ±a de fuencarral at 64 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.640
 years of pulmonary fibrosis thousands of 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.340
 people showed him their love 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.220
 accompanying him in his last goodbye 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.210
 we were during all his illness that 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.589
 it lasted was a very long and very long year 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.880
 sad because it was going at a speed 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.130
 Awesome 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.030
 it did not last a year I believe when you 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.030
 declared the disease 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.550
 [Music] 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:30.310
 he was so loving he was kind he was the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:33.940
 final falsetto that the one doing 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.060
 end of the songs sent a fur coat 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:42.280
 goes and exhausted what nobody has done 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:45.870
 never singing I said that goes that's going to 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.870
 suffer suffer the lungs 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.440
 that's why they said he lacked air 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.580
 and so was his death 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.580
 and phase 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:18.309
 [Music] 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.570
 and now I hear it 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.400
 without crying every two minutes 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.830
 because there is a time that you can not not 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.860
 I could because it broke my soul but 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.670
 Now I can hear it and it's also that I 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.670
 It seems 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.790
 absolutely prodigious what he did is 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.610
 that if you listen carefully 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.050
 amazing 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.800
 is that I do not know anyone in the world 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.360
 what 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.890
 an artist in the world who makes those 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.960
 So beautiful things with the voice 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.960
 [Music] 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.360
 for antonio molina and the most important thing 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.130
 it was his family 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.670
 when 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.500
 and my brother jose alberto was little 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.460
 Well, I do not know why my father 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.740
 He got very angry with him 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.360
 something made some mischief whatever 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.900
 something I would do at home that my father did 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.349
 a good harmful 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.599
 and then immediately afterwards 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.630
 you had to go buy some things to the 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:27.890
 store below and such and you 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.910
 and my father made him the note of things 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.620
 they had to bring he said he's going to 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.480
 buy some things that you need 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.860
 mother 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.690
 after the fast that is for food 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.070
 and then when my brother arrived 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.050
 always realize that when he came to the 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.050
 store then put 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.980
 s 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.069
 what 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:03.490
 that when he read the note the note put a 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:06.850
 kilo of rice rice I love you a kilo of 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.680
 sugar I love you one thing that there was 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.680
 I had already commissioned him under that 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.620
 I felt bad because I had scolded him and 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:19.979
 when the brunette 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.979
 quickly in the sun 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:31.660
 [Music] 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.060
 I believe that he never dies 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.580
 and at some point we will meet 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:48.149
 I'm sure 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:48.149
