to build a working TARDIS doesn't
exactly<00:00:14.160> travel<00:00:14.549> through<00:00:14.849> space<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.360> time

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
exactly travel through space and time

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.540 
exactly travel through space and time
put<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.890> does<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.090> bigger<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> inside

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550

it's<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.309> bit<00:00:44.460> bit<00:00:45.300> laggy<00:00:45.570> Mouse<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> bit

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
it's a bit bit laggy Mouse is a bit

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:56.709 
it's a bit bit laggy Mouse is a bit
rubbish<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.520> I'll<00:00:48.270> try<00:00:48.480> my<00:00:48.600> best

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.180 

then<00:00:58.039> if<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.430> would<00:00:59.640> like<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.449> just

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
then if you would like you can just

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.500 
then if you would like you can just
stick<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.250> buck<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.789> top<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.120> make<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> bit

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
stick a buck on the top to make it a bit

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:12.700 
stick a buck on the top to make it a bit
more<00:01:03.539> pointy<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.439> won't<00:01:04.710> do<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:11.210> then

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
more pointy but I won't do that then

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.469 
more pointy but I won't do that then
this<00:01:13.710> will<00:01:14.010> use<00:01:14.310> command<00:01:14.670> blocks<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.299> make

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
this will use command blocks so make

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.870 
this will use command blocks so make
sure<00:01:15.509> if<00:01:16.110> you're<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.650> Serb<00:01:16.920> you've<00:01:17.159> got<00:01:17.340> command

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
sure if you're a Serb you've got command

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.749 
sure if you're a Serb you've got command
blocks<00:01:18.090> turned<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:21.650> dig<00:01:22.650> two<00:01:23.400> down<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:25.580> put<00:01:26.580> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
blocks turned on dig two down and put a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.830 
blocks turned on dig two down and put a
command<00:01:27.420> block<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.049> space<00:01:28.290> under<00:01:28.590> here

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
command block in this space under here

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.080 
command block in this space under here
I'll<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.140> get<00:01:31.290> one

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.349 

stick<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:38.929> under<00:01:39.140> there<00:01:39.320> and<00:01:40.149> now<00:01:41.149> you're

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
stick it under there and now you're

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.029 
stick it under there and now you're
gonna<00:01:41.450> have<00:01:41.659> to<00:01:41.780> find<00:01:41.960> a<00:01:42.079> suitable<00:01:42.350> place<00:01:42.590> to

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
gonna have to find a suitable place to

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.919 
gonna have to find a suitable place to
build<00:01:43.969> a<00:01:44.299> bigger<00:01:44.630> room<00:01:44.810> for<00:01:45.049> your<00:01:45.140> TARDIS<00:01:46.929> but

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
build a bigger room for your TARDIS but

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.099 
build a bigger room for your TARDIS but
to<00:01:48.140> make<00:01:48.289> this<00:01:48.500> look<00:01:49.130> authentic<00:01:49.310> like<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.929> are

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109

just walking into a giant room you get a
high-end<00:01:57.200> door<00:01:57.969> and<00:01:59.619> some<00:02:00.619> pressure<00:02:00.859> plates

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
high-end door and some pressure plates

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:08.710 
high-end door and some pressure plates
put<00:02:03.469> the<00:02:03.560> iron<00:02:03.709> door<00:02:03.920> down<00:02:07.090> there<00:02:08.090> we<00:02:08.239> go

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
put the iron door down there we go

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.199 
put the iron door down there we go
fresh<00:02:09.679> plate<00:02:09.920> there<00:02:10.160> so<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:10.789> looks<00:02:10.819> like<00:02:11.060> it

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
fresh plate there so it looks like it

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.400 
fresh plate there so it looks like it
just<00:02:11.420> opens<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.930> door

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
just opens the door

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.410 
just opens the door
I<00:02:12.549> put<00:02:13.549> the<00:02:13.670> command<00:02:13.910> block<00:02:14.090> in<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.269> wrong

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
I put the command block in the wrong

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:23.860 
I put the command block in the wrong
place<00:02:20.079> then<00:02:21.459> jump<00:02:22.459> up<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:23.120> might<00:02:23.660> want<00:02:23.840> to

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
place then jump up I might want to

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.880

change<00:02:24.019> this<00:02:24.319> as<00:02:24.560> well<00:02:27.819> then<00:02:29.560> leave<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.739> open

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
change this as well then leave that open

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.650 
change this as well then leave that open

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
out how to get off f3 so we need to go

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.159 
out how to get off f3 so we need to go
back<00:03:07.819> off<00:03:08.030> this<00:03:09.730> there<00:03:10.730> we<00:03:10.849> go<00:03:11.030> now<00:03:11.900> we<00:03:11.959> take

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:12.169 
back off this there we go now we take

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:15.220 
back off this there we go now we take
the<00:03:12.380> X<00:03:12.590> which<00:03:12.950> is<00:03:13.130> 2<00:03:13.370> 5<00:03:13.579> 2<00:03:13.819> write<00:03:14.750> that<00:03:14.930> down<00:03:15.079> if

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
the X which is 2 5 2 write that down if

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.680 
the X which is 2 5 2 write that down if
you<00:03:15.319> need<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:16.510> then<00:03:17.510> we<00:03:17.750> need<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.290> Y<00:03:18.470> of<00:03:18.739> 51<00:03:19.370> and

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
you need to then we need the Y of 51 and

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:30.879 
you need to then we need the Y of 51 and
the<00:03:20.690> Z<00:03:20.900> 2<00:03:21.410> 5<00:03:21.650> 9<00:03:24.760> okay<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:26.389> now<00:03:26.569> we<00:03:27.130> exit<00:03:28.130> f3<00:03:29.889> pop

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
the Z 2 5 9 okay so now we exit f3 pop

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:39.330 
the Z 2 5 9 okay so now we exit f3 pop
back<00:03:31.069> up<00:03:31.220> to<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.459> top<00:03:33.430> locate<00:03:34.430> our<00:03:34.639> TARDIS<00:03:36.099> and
