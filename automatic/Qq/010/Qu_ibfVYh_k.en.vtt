00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
down as you can see that the detailing

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.410 
down as you can see that the detailing
on<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.290> head<00:03:33.700> they're<00:03:34.700> basically<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.239> same

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
on the head they're basically the same

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:47.589 
on the head they're basically the same
thing<00:03:36.049> as<00:03:36.470> wass<00:03:36.859> fix<00:03:37.220> what<00:03:37.669> difficulties<00:03:46.599> got

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
thing as wass fix what difficulties got

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.770 
thing as wass fix what difficulties got
the<00:03:47.690> same<00:03:47.870> exact<00:03:48.200> um<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.680> so<00:03:48.940> I<00:03:49.940> think<00:03:50.569> is
