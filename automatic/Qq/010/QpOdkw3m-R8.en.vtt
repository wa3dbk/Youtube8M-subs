bit<00:02:18.079> of<00:02:18.170> glitter<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.709> this<00:02:18.860> so<00:02:19.220> it's<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.430> very

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
bit of glitter to this so it's a very

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.819 
bit of glitter to this so it's a very
clear<00:02:20.000> glittery<00:02:20.420> polish<00:02:20.840> but<00:02:21.049> it<00:02:21.140> just<00:02:21.290> adds

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
clear glittery polish but it just adds

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.270 
clear glittery polish but it just adds
that<00:02:22.220> very<00:02:22.519> silvery<00:02:23.079> frosty<00:02:24.079> sparkly<00:02:25.069> look

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
that very silvery frosty sparkly look

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:36.740 
that very silvery frosty sparkly look
that<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:25.489> like

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.760 

after<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:37.840> finish<00:02:37.870> adding<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.470> glittery

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
after you finish adding the glittery

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.980 
after you finish adding the glittery
coat<00:02:39.070> it<00:02:39.280> just<00:02:39.490> adds<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:40.000> really<00:02:40.240> nice<00:02:40.540> glossy

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.740 
coat it just adds a really nice glossy
shine<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:41.980> feel<00:02:42.340> really<00:02:43.060> completes<00:02:43.570> the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
shine that I feel really completes the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:51.450 
shine that I feel really completes the
nail<00:02:43.930> polish

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.890
