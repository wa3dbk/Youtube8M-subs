00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.280
 Hello and welcome to the new video 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.170
 Today I have the app Tucci Vorig 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:14.599
 and the middle class now ever the developers around for the charge 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.029
 important for the gift 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.369
 in the Valais with the Congo Code 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.189
 at the playground gave 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.369
 and now I never have him a cuche 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.939
 that 's how the minus looks like and "I'll go to the 11th in a row 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.449
 very listless you 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.449
 rer 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.060
 hl that's all there is to it 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.130
 more and more 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.100
 and I here at the site, you can look at others but that 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.540
 Bräunig why 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.960
 after all, go 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.200
 No, it had just gone too far 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.200
 I did not want to give it 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.630
 from the only number one 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.090
 and it gets mixed up a lot 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.100
 all I delete out to the moon Haas Dr 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.100
 Taffeta performance 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.780
 Red but normal so if you minis here 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.670
 I wear 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.570
 in Yemen 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.460
 Pröll you can already see that this coup Ambo restart young Uzbeks 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.980
 Melville editor 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.340
 not every year 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.340
 the next help meshes because he wants 27 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.830
 and I want to explain again briefly why she goes you have to be the little one 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.790
 green 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.730
 because naming his house we carry downstairs 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.430
 and 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.080
 Insolvency 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.990
 Once around here you have to rebuild and learn the new 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.890
 Porsche pushes 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.659
 Commander of her career 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.310
 to warm a proceeds you can then even more apprenticeships or him 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.670
 Master nervous 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.960
 already at 19 o'clock in the net 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.340
 so and here you also have to prepare one in 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.610
 you can change the name of the sound on and off the chaff ROG Amanda 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.400
 to change 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.629
 for example 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.019
 Dragon or wipe Thuringia for me now not so good if I still have 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.279
 not tried and in between is a pastor 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:16.929
 So I think 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:20.549
 I show you the last time here on the basis of Level 1 time something 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:25.139
 In the hall relatively easy there are no obstacles or anything else and I was 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.119
 also in a row 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.119
 One thing you always have to wipe here 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.159
 that makes because otherwise no sound companies point 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.569
 yes and when you're at the finish Adam Anderson is made 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.499
 now here at 0 2 they are the whole bit more difficult out there you have to 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.929
 just prescribed the box 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.199
 the know-how and the other slope 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.419
 also yesterday then down 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.419
 and there is "Super Thursday" world so Weigel is 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.079
 Here you are just a threesome 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.139
 neither 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.649
 Ezio 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.899
 Visitors heavy 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:15.839
 when you play the first time 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:17.420
 can you really build there already 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.989
 in the beginning to despair because you do not know how to do it 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.829
 Mio EUR that was not the first time everything 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.139
 here at Löw 4 everything is there you have to the Odenwald first photo 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.489
 Box and then I'm bringing home 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.099
 so i think it's possible that the sound is percent 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.429
 what good behavior 

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:43.929
 also fun because you can make your own levels Spohn 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:46.679
 I try to complain now 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:48.639
 Prof good life 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.369
 a solvable better here 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:54.099
 Marcus Prosch in Melbourne 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.059
 is allowed the free field 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:58.380
 I know how to different houses 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.219
 more what it is at the other place Vol 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:04.559
 up to now on top and how do you get the other side 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:06.489
 War I fled 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.129
 Things that are already unlocked, for example, with the animals 

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:15.009
 in Grünwald Dante she will follow behind 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:17.799
 and so far she wants to overcome green waves 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.739
 and there still there 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.539
 Groenefeld 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.449
 will be worthwhile 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:26.939
 and 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.939
 then you would have to be here now on storage media 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.460
 continue with these 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:37.069
 also play once in the commission and so on 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.669
 when he first fires 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:50.309
 now he should too 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.960
 And so it will always go on if all the bakeries are at the moment 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.779
 Income has 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:02.779
 I was on top of it 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.249
 we have that's just a barrel of gameplay that's such a little bit 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:11.479
 what to drink and 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.210
 It is getting harder and harder 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.400
 and the app costs 79 cents below five percent 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.029
 quite justified the price so 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:23.239
 So I really like it, I also bought the app for 9 70 

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:24.779
 Cents though 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:26.870
 of course, is also very good and free of charge 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.360
 yes Zoellick I can honestly say for 90 cents this is worth it 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:35.389
 I just apologize for being here with the Hells 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:36.509
 worker 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:38.620
 Percent will become the country's top 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.450
 the lamp wants to come from the top 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.659
 the sun people for individual roles and 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:45.659
 Even front not help anymore 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.729
 to the credit even the iPod to the rating and then I also remember Chur
