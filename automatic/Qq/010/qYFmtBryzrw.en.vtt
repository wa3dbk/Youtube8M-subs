to do is you're going to take three of

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.020 
to do is you're going to take three of
these<00:00:58.109> strips<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.829> you're<00:00:59.309> gonna<00:00:59.399> fold<00:00:59.730> them

these strips and you're gonna fold them
in<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.449> direction<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.920> first<00:01:02.160> one<00:01:02.430> is

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
in one direction so the first one is

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.740 
in one direction so the first one is
going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.789> go<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.359> you're<00:01:03.570> going<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
going to go like this you're going to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.830 
going to go like this you're going to
take<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.339> corner<00:01:05.339> from<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.060> top<00:01:06.270> right<00:01:06.600> and

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
take this corner from the top right and

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.770 
take this corner from the top right and
bend<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.380> down<00:01:07.729> along<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.790> edge<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.540> left

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
bend it down along the edge of the left

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.429 
bend it down along the edge of the left
side<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.500> make<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> point<00:01:12.229> then<00:01:13.229> we're

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
side so that you make a point then we're

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.660 
side so that you make a point then we're
going<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.590> do<00:01:13.710> from<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> bottom<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.520> we're

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
going to do from the bottom is we're

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.039 
going to do from the bottom is we're
going<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.850> do<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> opposite<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.780> I'm<00:01:15.869> going<00:01:15.990> to

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
going to do the opposite so I'm going to

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.630 
going to do the opposite so I'm going to
turn<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.380> horizontally<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.310> see<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.580> a

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
turn it horizontally so you can see it a

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.109 
turn it horizontally so you can see it a
little<00:01:17.790> bit<00:01:17.970> better<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:19.880> we're<00:01:20.880> going<00:01:21.030> to

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
little bit better and we're going to

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.510 
little bit better and we're going to
create<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.600> pattern<00:01:22.159> we're<00:01:23.159> going<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.369> do

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
create this pattern we're going to do

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.210 
create this pattern we're going to do
this<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.850> all<00:01:23.880> three<00:01:24.299> pieces<00:01:24.680> okay<00:01:25.680> once<00:01:25.950> those

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
this on all three pieces okay once those

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.560 
this on all three pieces okay once those
are<00:01:26.250> done<00:01:26.580> we're<00:01:26.759> gonna<00:01:26.820> bring<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> other

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
are done we're gonna bring in the other

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.240 
are done we're gonna bring in the other
two<00:01:27.900> pieces<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.470> we're<00:01:28.590> going<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.740> fold<00:01:29.040> these

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
two pieces and we're going to fold these

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.700 
two pieces and we're going to fold these
in<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.610> opposite<00:01:30.150> direction<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.500> see

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
in the opposite direction so you can see

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.800 
in the opposite direction so you can see
how<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.280> went<00:01:32.579> from<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.060> upper<00:01:33.780> right

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
how this one went from the upper right

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.020 
how this one went from the upper right
down<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> left<00:01:35.040> side<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.790> going

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
down to the left side so this is going

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.880 
down to the left side so this is going
to<00:01:36.119> go<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.509> other<00:01:36.659> way<00:01:36.810> now<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.740> going

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
to go the other way now so this is going

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.060 
to go the other way now so this is going
to<00:01:37.950> come<00:01:38.189> from<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.119> upper<00:01:39.329> left<00:01:40.140> down<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
to come from the upper left down to the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.950 
to come from the upper left down to the
right<00:01:41.280> edge<00:01:41.549> you're<00:01:42.299> going<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.509> want<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.810> make

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
right edge you're going to want to make

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.530 
right edge you're going to want to make
sure<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.130> nice<00:01:44.310> good<00:01:44.850> point<00:01:45.299> on

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
sure that you have a nice good point on

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.210 
sure that you have a nice good point on
the<00:01:45.810> end<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.229> lined<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.680> as<00:01:46.860> good<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.130> you

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the end and it's lined up as good as you

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.030 
the end and it's lined up as good as you
possibly<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.909> get<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.450> then<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.470> bottom

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
possibly can get it and then the bottom

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.440 
possibly can get it and then the bottom
edge<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.220> going<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.610> go<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> opposite

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
edge is going to go in the opposite

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.080 
edge is going to go in the opposite
direction<00:01:52.100> we're<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.310> do<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:54.030> both

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
direction we're going to do this on both

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.109 
direction we're going to do this on both
pieces<00:01:55.399> so<00:01:56.399> when<00:01:56.549> you're<00:01:56.700> finished<00:01:57.000> you're

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
pieces so when you're finished you're

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.429 
pieces so when you're finished you're
going<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.299> end<00:01:57.420> up<00:01:57.479> with<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.750> three<00:01:58.200> they<00:01:58.320> go

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
going to end up with this three they go

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.170 
going to end up with this three they go
one<00:01:58.680> way<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.159> two<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.520> go<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.820> other<00:01:59.969> now

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
one way and two that go the other now

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.330 
one way and two that go the other now
this<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.540> what's<00:02:00.719> going<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.960> fit<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.860> four

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
this is what's going to fit on this four

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.010 
this is what's going to fit on this four
by<00:02:02.610> five<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.149> quarter<00:02:03.390> well<00:02:03.869> obviously

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
by five and a quarter well obviously

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.200 
by five and a quarter well obviously
these<00:02:04.860> are<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.520> one<00:02:05.700> direction<00:02:05.729> so

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
these are going in one direction so

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.949 
these are going in one direction so
we're<00:02:06.600> going<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> place<00:02:06.960> one<00:02:07.320> here<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.959> then

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
we're going to place one here and then

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.680 
we're going to place one here and then
one<00:02:09.989> here

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
one here

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.870 
one here
and<00:02:12.350> are<00:02:12.560> going<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.740> work<00:02:12.950> in<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:13.160> chevron

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
and are going to work in that chevron

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.380 
and are going to work in that chevron
pattern<00:02:14.150> or<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.720> zig<00:02:15.110> zag<00:02:15.790> now<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:16.850> use<00:02:17.210> the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
pattern or a zig zag now I use the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.820 
pattern or a zig zag now I use the
embossing<00:02:17.930> folder<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.380> create<00:02:18.650> some

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
embossing folder to create some

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.590 
embossing folder to create some
background<00:02:19.280> just<00:02:19.490> from<00:02:19.700> additional<00:02:20.150> interest

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
background just from additional interest

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.110 
background just from additional interest
so<00:02:21.560> just<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.950> give<00:02:22.100> you<00:02:22.130> an<00:02:22.280> idea<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.670> how<00:02:22.940> this

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
so just to give you an idea of how this

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.990 
so just to give you an idea of how this
is<00:02:23.300> going<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.510> get<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:23.810> here<00:02:24.130> now<00:02:25.130> for<00:02:25.520> those<00:02:25.730> of

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
is going to get it here now for those of

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.700 
is going to get it here now for those of
you<00:02:26.240> that<00:02:27.170> are<00:02:27.380> over<00:02:27.980> picky<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:30.050> doesn't<00:02:30.500> make

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
you that are over picky it doesn't make

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.910 
you that are over picky it doesn't make
a<00:02:30.740> complete<00:02:31.370> zig<00:02:31.700> zag<00:02:31.940> all<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.420> way<00:02:32.570> across

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
a complete zig zag all the way across

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.520 
a complete zig zag all the way across
unless<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:34.130> cut<00:02:34.520> your<00:02:34.730> paper<00:02:34.910> down<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:35.600> you

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
unless you cut your paper down and you

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.770 
unless you cut your paper down and you
can<00:02:36.740> tweak<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.280> very<00:02:37.610> easily<00:02:37.880> by<00:02:38.180> taking<00:02:38.390> the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
can tweak that very easily by taking the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.240 
can tweak that very easily by taking the
two<00:02:38.960> and<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.170> half<00:02:39.350> inches<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.860> two<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.190> a

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
two and a half inches to two and a

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.950 
two and a half inches to two and a
quarter<00:02:40.460> and<00:02:40.790> then<00:02:40.880> scaling<00:02:41.300> down<00:02:41.540> your<00:02:41.750> paper

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
quarter and then scaling down your paper

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.230 
quarter and then scaling down your paper
even<00:02:42.410> more<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.770> do<00:02:42.920> duplicate<00:02:43.520> layers<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:44.120> your

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
even more to do duplicate layers of your

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.700 
even more to do duplicate layers of your
cards<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:44.870> I'll<00:02:44.960> show<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.230> that<00:02:45.380> in<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.590> minute

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
cards and I'll show you that in a minute

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.980 
cards and I'll show you that in a minute
so<00:02:46.610> then<00:02:46.790> these<00:02:47.000> are<00:02:47.060> going<00:02:47.240> to<00:02:47.390> get<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:47.660> here

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
so then these are going to get it here

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.710 
so then these are going to get it here
now<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.530> easiest<00:02:49.010> way<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.280> do<00:02:49.610> this<00:02:49.640> is<00:02:50.240> to<00:02:50.540> put

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
now the easiest way to do this is to put

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.560 
now the easiest way to do this is to put
snail<00:02:51.200> adhesive<00:02:51.700> on<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.910> angles<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:55.570> a

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
snail adhesive on the angles and a

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.670 
snail adhesive on the angles and a
little<00:02:56.840> bit<00:02:56.960> on<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.170> sides

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
little bit on the sides

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.320 
little bit on the sides
I<00:02:57.860> found<00:02:58.460> that<00:02:58.610> you're<00:02:58.760> going<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.060> want<00:02:59.270> to

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
I found that you're going to want to

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.780 
I found that you're going to want to
make<00:02:59.510> sure<00:02:59.570> that<00:03:00.110> it's<00:03:00.260> down<00:03:00.500> really<00:03:00.950> good<00:03:01.070> now

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
make sure that it's down really good now

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.790 
make sure that it's down really good now
you<00:03:01.850> can<00:03:02.150> do<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.570> chevron<00:03:02.990> pattern<00:03:03.200> down<00:03:03.590> the

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
you can do the chevron pattern down the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.340 
you can do the chevron pattern down the
center<00:03:04.220> this<00:03:05.150> one<00:03:05.480> you're<00:03:05.720> gonna<00:03:05.810> see<00:03:06.110> that<00:03:06.260> I

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
center this one you're gonna see that I

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.290 
center this one you're gonna see that I
did<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.740> little<00:03:07.160> bit<00:03:07.340> more<00:03:07.610> towards<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.270> top

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
did a little bit more towards the top

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.180 
did a little bit more towards the top
and<00:03:08.750> I<00:03:08.780> have<00:03:08.990> other<00:03:09.140> samples<00:03:09.650> for<00:03:09.830> you<00:03:10.010> that

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
and I have other samples for you that

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.430 
and I have other samples for you that
are<00:03:10.310> slightly<00:03:10.580> different<00:03:10.880> so<00:03:11.390> just<00:03:12.200> for<00:03:12.350> the

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
are slightly different so just for the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.590 
are slightly different so just for the
sake<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.830> video<00:03:12.980> I'm<00:03:13.330> going<00:03:14.330> to<00:03:14.390> start

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
sake of the video I'm going to start

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.780 
sake of the video I'm going to start
here<00:03:14.840> at<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.170> bottom<00:03:15.340> I'm<00:03:16.340> gonna<00:03:16.520> work<00:03:16.760> my

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
here at the bottom I'm gonna work my

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.240 
here at the bottom I'm gonna work my
edge<00:03:17.180> all<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.570> way<00:03:18.410> up<00:03:18.560> against<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.040> side

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
edge all the way up against the side

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.010 
edge all the way up against the side
because<00:03:19.459> you're<00:03:19.730> gonna<00:03:19.820> need<00:03:20.030> every<00:03:20.330> inch<00:03:20.660> of

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
because you're gonna need every inch of

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.380 
because you're gonna need every inch of
this<00:03:21.310> I'm<00:03:22.310> also<00:03:22.610> going<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:22.940> recommend<00:03:23.209> that

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
this I'm also going to recommend that

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.660 
this I'm also going to recommend that
you<00:03:23.480> lightly<00:03:24.110> tap<00:03:24.410> it<00:03:24.440> down<00:03:24.800> just<00:03:25.070> in<00:03:25.280> case<00:03:25.490> you

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
you lightly tap it down just in case you

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.060 
you lightly tap it down just in case you
have<00:03:25.850> to<00:03:26.000> maneuver<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.510> pieces<00:03:26.930> so<00:03:27.620> more

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
have to maneuver the pieces so more

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.150 
have to maneuver the pieces so more
snail<00:03:28.370> adhesive<00:03:28.580> here<00:03:29.209> and<00:03:29.650> this<00:03:30.650> is<00:03:30.770> going<00:03:30.980> in

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
snail adhesive here and this is going in

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.430 
snail adhesive here and this is going in
the<00:03:31.250> opposite<00:03:31.700> direction<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.510> then<00:03:33.200> this

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
the opposite direction and then this

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.710 
the opposite direction and then this
one's<00:03:33.650> going<00:03:33.770> to<00:03:33.920> go<00:03:34.040> here<00:03:34.270> now<00:03:35.270> here's<00:03:35.540> the

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
one's going to go here now here's the

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.680 
one's going to go here now here's the
last<00:03:35.930> one<00:03:36.310> unless<00:03:37.310> you<00:03:37.520> are<00:03:37.670> really<00:03:38.030> precise

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
last one unless you are really precise

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.140 
last one unless you are really precise
and<00:03:38.959> cutting<00:03:39.410> your<00:03:39.500> cardstock<00:03:39.890> it's<00:03:40.820> not

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
and cutting your cardstock it's not

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.330 
and cutting your cardstock it's not
unusual<00:03:41.450> for<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.410> have<00:03:42.590> a<00:03:42.620> small<00:03:43.130> amount

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
unusual for you to have a small amount

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.590 
unusual for you to have a small amount
that<00:03:43.850> hangs<00:03:44.120> over<00:03:44.360> and<00:03:45.260> here's<00:03:45.590> my<00:03:45.770> last<00:03:45.980> one

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
that hangs over and here's my last one

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.720 
that hangs over and here's my last one
okay<00:03:47.600> now<00:03:47.870> it's<00:03:48.320> going<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.680> work<00:03:48.920> really<00:03:49.280> close

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
okay now it's going to work really close

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.060 
okay now it's going to work really close
to<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.030> edges<00:03:50.180> so<00:03:50.780> if<00:03:51.020> you're<00:03:51.200> really<00:03:51.530> really

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
to the edges so if you're really really

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.949 
to the edges so if you're really really
particular<00:03:52.520> you<00:03:52.940> may<00:03:53.090> have<00:03:53.270> to<00:03:53.420> fold<00:03:53.660> this<00:03:53.810> one

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
particular you may have to fold this one

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.690 
particular you may have to fold this one
just<00:03:54.170> a<00:03:54.380> smidge<00:03:54.709> down<00:03:55.010> a<00:03:55.040> little<00:03:55.250> bit<00:03:55.430> further

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
just a smidge down a little bit further

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.580 
just a smidge down a little bit further
now<00:03:56.570> you're<00:03:56.690> going<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:56.900> see<00:03:57.050> that<00:03:57.200> we<00:03:57.350> have

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
now you're going to see that we have

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.830 
now you're going to see that we have
these<00:03:57.830> flaps<00:03:58.280> that<00:03:58.760> are<00:03:58.820> here<00:03:59.239> now<00:03:59.660> there's

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
these flaps that are here now there's

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.140 
these flaps that are here now there's
several<00:04:00.080> ways<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:00.470> can<00:04:00.620> do<00:04:00.920> this<00:04:01.150> you

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
several ways you can do this you

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.030 
several ways you can do this you
couldn't<00:04:02.420> put<00:04:02.600> adhesive<00:04:02.750> here<00:04:03.350> but<00:04:03.530> I<00:04:03.709> really

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
couldn't put adhesive here but I really

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.490 
couldn't put adhesive here but I really
prefer<00:04:04.070> dimensionals<00:04:05.030> so<00:04:05.780> I've<00:04:05.900> actually<00:04:06.080> cut

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
prefer dimensionals so I've actually cut

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.320 
prefer dimensionals so I've actually cut
my<00:04:06.530> dimensionals<00:04:07.250> in<00:04:07.459> half<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:08.030> I've<00:04:08.120> made

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
my dimensionals in half so I've made

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.940 
my dimensionals in half so I've made
them<00:04:08.450> a<00:04:08.510> little<00:04:08.660> bit<00:04:08.900> smaller<00:04:09.080> so<00:04:09.440> they'll<00:04:09.739> fit

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
them a little bit smaller so they'll fit

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.190 
them a little bit smaller so they'll fit
better<00:04:10.220> so<00:04:10.880> I'm<00:04:10.970> opening<00:04:11.330> up<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.480> flap<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:12.110> I

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
better so I'm opening up the flap and I

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.720 
better so I'm opening up the flap and I
found<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.560> best<00:04:12.739> spot<00:04:12.890> is<00:04:13.310> near<00:04:13.580> the<00:04:13.760> tip<00:04:14.000> and

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
found the best spot is near the tip and

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.979 
found the best spot is near the tip and
then<00:04:16.730> when<00:04:16.880> you<00:04:16.970> go<00:04:17.090> to<00:04:17.150> seal<00:04:17.480> it<00:04:17.690> you'll<00:04:17.840> have

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
then when you go to seal it you'll have

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.469 
then when you go to seal it you'll have
a<00:04:18.049> little<00:04:18.230> bit<00:04:18.320> of<00:04:18.560> a<00:04:18.650> 3d<00:04:19.100> look<00:04:19.400> which<00:04:20.120> creates

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
a little bit of a 3d look which creates

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.000 
a little bit of a 3d look which creates
a<00:04:20.539> little<00:04:20.750> dimension<00:04:21.229> to<00:04:21.380> this<00:04:21.500> card<00:04:21.830> and

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
a little dimension to this card and

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.380 
a little dimension to this card and
you're<00:04:22.100> going<00:04:22.220> to<00:04:22.280> do<00:04:22.400> this<00:04:22.580> onto<00:04:22.910> all<00:04:23.180> the

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
you're going to do this onto all the

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.390 
you're going to do this onto all the
flaps

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
flaps

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.810 
flaps
okay<00:04:24.580> here's<00:04:25.060> my<00:04:25.240> last<00:04:25.540> one<00:04:26.400> alright<00:04:27.400> so<00:04:27.669> this

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
okay here's my last one alright so this

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.939 
okay here's my last one alright so this
is<00:04:28.000> what<00:04:28.030> we've<00:04:28.300> ended<00:04:28.540> up<00:04:28.630> with<00:04:28.690> if<00:04:29.470> I<00:04:29.620> hold<00:04:29.830> it

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
is what we've ended up with if I hold it

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.409 
is what we've ended up with if I hold it
up<00:04:30.070> you<00:04:30.280> can<00:04:30.430> see<00:04:30.460> how<00:04:30.790> there's<00:04:31.000> a<00:04:31.090> little<00:04:31.180> bit

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
up you can see how there's a little bit

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.870 
up you can see how there's a little bit
of<00:04:31.509> dimension<00:04:31.630> between<00:04:32.620> those<00:04:32.979> chevron<00:04:33.430> folds

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
of dimension between those chevron folds

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.580 
of dimension between those chevron folds
which<00:04:34.030> I<00:04:34.150> think<00:04:34.360> really<00:04:34.630> makes<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.110> card<00:04:35.139> look

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
which I think really makes the card look

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.650 
which I think really makes the card look
nice<00:04:35.830> so<00:04:36.100> here's<00:04:36.789> the<00:04:37.000> one<00:04:37.210> that<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.389> originally

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
nice so here's the one that I originally

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.629 
nice so here's the one that I originally
did<00:04:38.169> and<00:04:38.970> here's<00:04:39.970> another<00:04:40.979> see<00:04:41.979> how<00:04:42.160> all<00:04:42.340> I<00:04:42.370> did

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
did and here's another see how all I did

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.090 
did and here's another see how all I did
was<00:04:42.820> turn<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.150> card<00:04:43.870> so<00:04:44.350> that<00:04:44.380> it<00:04:44.650> was<00:04:44.770> going

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
was turn the card so that it was going

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.790 
was turn the card so that it was going
the<00:04:45.250> portrait<00:04:45.729> versus<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.240> landscape<00:04:46.840> added

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
the portrait versus the landscape added

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.800 
the portrait versus the landscape added
a<00:04:47.830> really<00:04:48.250> pretty<00:04:48.490> antique<00:04:48.910> Brad<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.449> this<00:04:49.570> one

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
emboss all the backgrounds I found that

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.140 
emboss all the backgrounds I found that
that<00:04:53.919> just<00:04:54.100> really<00:04:54.370> played<00:04:54.610> this<00:04:54.789> up<00:04:55.000> and

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
here's that black and white modern

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.010 
here's that black and white modern
medley<00:04:56.970> designer<00:04:57.970> series<00:04:58.300> paper<00:04:58.690> and<00:04:58.780> I<00:04:58.870> added

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
medley designer series paper and I added

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.060
