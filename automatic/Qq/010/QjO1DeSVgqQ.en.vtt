00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.470
 Yes this time 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.670
 First issue 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.730
 The first youtube videos of enduring 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.950
 I would like to introduce Pioneer's shogi 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:23.600
 Here it is yeah 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:25.170
 Among the controllers of pcdj came out, but among them 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.100
 Almighty 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.760
 Moreover 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:34.270
 Quite to the beginner even simple products 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:39.020
 I want to introduce the product that dj can enjoy 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.840
 Please move to here Jack 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.650
 Bip 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.780
 Then 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.309
 Yes 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:53.270
 Here it is from Pioneer 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:56.590
 becomes a commodity called pcdj controller dj you get child 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.590
 I understand when you get a look 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.270
 White 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:12.450
 Black but man-in not give me the 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:17.729
 It looks so thin but the button is very simple and that 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:21.509
 But I think that can be seen If you could If you are using the cdj Toka of pies and pioneer 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.870
 Also true that the third of this job is you said that 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.770
 It remains as close as possible to cdj 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.570
 Yes 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.010
 This controller is characteristic 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.320
 And Well Okiku' 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.440
 There you two 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.000
 First one eye 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.610
 This software comes with is the usual model 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.690
 virtual dj l 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.300
 Although it made to those 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.290
 We are using here and Oo 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.360
 this 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:59.310
 Situations and buttons will light up according to the mix effect of that aj 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.720
 So that 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:10.690
 Screen or waveform 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:12.040
 If you look only at the controller without seeing them together, you can see the screen 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.790
 There is no need to look 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.400
 Although it is dj mix is groundbreaking products 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.069
 Yes 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.140
 Another deals already this 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.690
 English features 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.950
 There is 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.129
 Most of pcdj's software is compatible 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.230
 Of course attached virtual dj le 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:36.090
 intro with serato 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.840
 And the tractor 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.230
 Here yeah 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.870
 Three pcdj software on three 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.400
 To all that 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:52.630
 It means that Joe supports 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.830
 Over or was that easy to control replacement 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.850
 really 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:01.030
 Even the high controller has decided the software 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.990
 In that case, it is often done even with a dedicated control 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:10.540
 It is that this ergo can use that almighty 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:12.610
 Yes, a little mainland When did the person who worries in pcdj software 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.190
 If you buy one here 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:21.250
 As we almost correspond 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.850
 I wonder if you can use your favorite pcd software without getting lost 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.099
 I will 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.799
 Yes 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:31.010
 In Well I would like as usual the annual face-to-face first show 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:35.840
 Yes 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.959
 It's so simple, yes yes the name is like this 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.959
 eh 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.140
 I explained that briefly 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.970
 In short the sound coming out of the speaker 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:51.130
 There are two of these outputs 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.930
 The larger one is connected to the guitar 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.270
 Yes it is what is referred to this as 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:04.090
 You can use it there 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:08.379
 I see here one more Akashi's Well I witness that the TV is often attached 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.360
 It is said that table rc, but you can use this 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.819
 Yes 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.270
 In the next 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:17.470
 Mike yes 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:21.400
 The volume of the microphone is attached to the side here with the microphone 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:27.380
 So it's that live performance 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:31.010
 If you need a person who is going to marry you, please let us know 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.129
 It will be referred to as the sound of eyebrows comes to speaker 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.630
 Yes 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:41.880
 It is this, but input select 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:44.790
 It 's absurd with Mike, but it's something that is commonly said to be external input 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.430
 Because there is a terminal here 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.510
 If you can choose this 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.510
 External input or 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.550
 Microphone 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:01.670
 You will be able to choose one or the other 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:06.050
 So, for example, during the break of dj or with iphone 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:10.770
 Someone who wants to play the included song is a request 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:14.960
 If there is a time when you want me to play the songs of my own iphone 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.169
 iphone cable with iphone 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.600
 this 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.840
 controller 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.810
 Please connect with a cable at 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.030
 this 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.870
 If it is possible to put in the person of Ogjusu external input 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:34.120
 also from the iphone 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:37.110
 It is a mechanism that flows to the speaker through this control 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:42.230
 This moat mountain is on heavy that the external input 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.129
 So it is almost the same as a bike 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.360
 Ne 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:46.940
 Another one 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.240
 Here on 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.409
 This is a gradual decrease in the controller 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.289
 On and off 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:57.969
 You can enter 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:06:00.550
 It was always on it is when you dj because it is 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:03.600
 Don't move unless you get it 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.840
 Please be careful of that 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:11.900
 The last one is usb 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:13.180
 really is important tea in the is usb teacher when outside start of pcdj 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.710
 Yes 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.630
 I will go before 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.920
 Before 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.400
 This is headphones 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.500
 It comes with the terminal of the headphone 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.200
 a this 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:32.610
 Kota E- That is a royal road 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.569
 It is this because it is up to now 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:38.590
 Put this on 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:40.040
 It will be inserted form 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.230
 It's sashimi 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.490
 Maa like this 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:51.230
 I'll let you, next to what is stereo mini 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:53.670
 It is a terminal that say you Deko connected to the Toka degree goods and books at Toka well iphone 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.230
 I use that 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:58.650
 It does a such a feeling 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.650
 I am 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:05.789
 By the way, the headphones I just used are 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.789
 I did
