00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
the way I'm putting it together could be

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.240 
the way I'm putting it together could be
viewed<00:01:18.840> as<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> main<00:01:19.470> dish<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.980> this<00:01:20.070> number

viewed as a main dish in this number

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.540 
viewed as a main dish in this number
time<00:01:21.229> or<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.500> make<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> smaller<00:01:23.070> version

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
time or you can make a smaller version

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.160 
time or you can make a smaller version
of<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.000> can<00:01:24.150> use<00:01:24.300> one<00:01:24.540> slice<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.080> tomato

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170

smaller plate okay

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.440 
smaller plate okay
so<00:01:30.000> now<00:01:30.180> we're<00:01:30.600> gonna<00:01:30.690> cut<00:01:30.960> some<00:01:30.990> mozzarella

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.670 
buffalo it's it's good Buffalo they say
and<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.119> would<00:01:39.330> probably<00:01:39.660> greaves<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.440> best

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
and I would probably greaves the best

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.710 
and I would probably greaves the best
but<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.700> good<00:01:41.910> and<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.450> more

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
but this is good and this is more

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.020 
but this is good and this is more
readily<00:01:43.050> available<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.979> less<00:01:44.130> expensive<00:01:44.820> for

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
readily available and less expensive for

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.910 
readily available and less expensive for
you<00:01:45.660> and<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.930> can<00:01:46.080> probably<00:01:46.259> buy<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.830> your

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
