you<00:03:22.310> guys<00:03:22.459> could<00:03:22.639> probably<00:03:22.939> figure<00:03:23.239> out<00:03:23.510> it's

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
you guys could probably figure out it's

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.509

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
has a little bit of a texture to it so

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.509
