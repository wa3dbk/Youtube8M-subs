00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.120
 hello everyone welcome to retro trainer 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.350
 good good 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.940
 finally after a long time 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.490
 receiving demands on our part 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.990
 returns the little honor of wic to the channel and 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.700
 I told you that I would recover it again 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.860
 Once the bases were well laid 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.360
 of the sixth generation competitive already 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.340
 that I did not want strategies that were 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.290
 to be too much about you are so 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.930
 starting today, the official 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.700
 section for this generation did not have 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.260
 very clear with what pokemon start the 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.300
 little eleven week so I've decided 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.610
 do it with one of which I have not read 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.859
 no strategy nor have I seen anything in 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.050
 specialized websites since I wanted the 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.179
 first at least out of 100% creation 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.429
 own and well then we started the section 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:51.679
 and we premiered with wu of the time 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:52.940
 mondragón that occupies number 706 of the 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.530
 international era 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.420
 this pokemon caught my attention from 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.339
 I saw within the generation since I saw that 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.280
 he was a very defensive dragon and right away 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.629
 I got to thinking it's necessary to run 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.550
 let's start telling us skills 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.620
 of voodoo since the first of them all 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.420
 Viper is one of the effects of 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.400
 plant type movements and not only that 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.530
 but also increase our attack 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.450
 if they hit us with movements of said 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.710
 kind this can go great always 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.390
 we say that the rival 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.610
 will use movement of this type and 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.409
 we change sharp or even in doubles to 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.970
 hitting us with our partner is a 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.250
 very good skill that we already knew from 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.690
 Pokemon as zoom arrangements explains but 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.850
 anyway we will not focus on 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.830
 this is your second skill is hydration 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.500
 which cure all our strokes 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.790
 altered while the weather is rainy 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.280
 this skill also known as 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.720
 little mountain was born yukon and although in this 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.399
 generation the drizzle skill has 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.560
 past of cream nivea tehran to 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.360
 only five shifts hydration 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.009
 is still very good so let's go the 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.899
 pokemon just from the drizzle a rock 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.539
 rain to achieve that five place 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.160
 The rain lasts eight shifts per 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.320
 last and as an idea of hiding some 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.539
 has exclusive baba only 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.250
 for him and that is to come down in a 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.570
 level the speed of the pot amounts a 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.490
 contact movement against whom 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.310
 owns the google skill is not a little 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.280
 exaggeratedly fast maximum sex is 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.220
 at 284 speed points so it's 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.869
 an ability to keep in mind 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.370
 The truth is that with any of these 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.110
 skills you can do things very 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.000
 creative with google but to be 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.130
 that I thought for this week I 'm going to 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.660
 focus on the second hydration though 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.550
 It can also be effective with herbivore 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.560
 since we totally discard for this 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.660
 week is baba so once you're the 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.760
 stability let's continue 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.380
 the next thing we need to think about is 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.030
 nature and to make this 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.980
 week that I will not have them clearer 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.570
 cautious is the best choice we can 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.580
 make a nature that increases the 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.680
 Special decency against reducing 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.650
 his special attack if he does not move has 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.540
 350 special points and you sit 28 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.490
 physical attacks but even if it is not so 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.310
 good as a physical attacker you will see what 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.420
 nature is more successful we are going to 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.870
 speak with distribution of points of 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.000
 effort 250 and 23 health points 252 in 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.250
 the special scene and finally 4 in the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.990
 defense with these points of effort to the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.720
 level 7 we will have a Buddha with the 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:07.360
 following statistics 384 points of 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.550
 230 attack 236 defense 230 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.210
 of special that we will not use a whopping 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:16.120
 of 438 special defense points and by 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.580
 last a moderate 196 points in the 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.410
 speed well once we've seen 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.570
 buddha statistics we realize 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.310
 that the only thing that stands out is the point 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.230
 health and defense so special 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.610
 so much we must necessarily look 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.080
 some movement that serves to 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.940
 increase some features 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.510
 at this point we find the first 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.489
 set movement that is 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.349
 curse is a movement that has the 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.329
 effect that when the user is not 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.069
 of the phantom type increases at a level of 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.019
 attack and the user's defense in 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.040
 against losing speed that's why at 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.810
 I told you what was the beginning 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.640
 necessary to give it speed of having 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.470
 low skill since every time the 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.150
 we see we will be slower but also 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.069
 It can be said that if we use only one 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.180
 we'll have the curses 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.709
 Teachers 354 attack points and 265 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.989
 defense points that will come 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.030
 acute generals and that without saying that what 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.950
 we use more times and we create a monster 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.129
 with defenses a bestial attack on 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.659
 a few shifts well as we see the use 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.129
 of curse comes great to put 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.569
 point to our doubt but we 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.220
 we found a problem and that is that during 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.170
 the time that is a curse 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.940
 the rival will weaken us little by little 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.130
 and this is where the second one comes in 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.900
 movement of set rest a movement 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.699
 more than known that makes us recover 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.530
 all health points at risk of 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:25.970
 you are asleep during two towns for 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.039
 avoid this we go back to comment the 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.750
 vedra's ability that is hydration and 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.610
 is that it is necessary that the equipment 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.410
 buddha there is some consolidated politician 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.249
 hide and the little rain that you have 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.289
 come earlier to put the weather 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.839
 once done this every time you cover 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.459
 rest and while it's still raining 

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:42.779
 will wake up automatically what you 

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:44.609
 will allow us to continue with our increases 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:46.439
 of features or throw us to the 

00:04:44.609 --> 00:04:47.939
 attack anyway the object that 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:50.549
 I recommend it is a berry tania or 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:52.499
 plum the first fence tania cure 

00:04:50.549 --> 00:04:54.719
 only the dream while the 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:56.549
 second city heals all the tests of 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:58.319
 been but I sincerely prefer to 

00:04:56.549 --> 00:05:00.389
 the first since in the case that we 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:01.949
 burn first in the paralyze we do 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.689
 rest and the fence will cure us is the 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.519
 perfect problem 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:07.439
 we have already increased the characteristics and 

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:08.699
 also in hand sorry health comes the 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:10.019
 moment to destroy all 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.399
 opponents that cross us in front 

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:13.409
 remember that after performing 

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:15.509
 curse our speed will turn out 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.219
 really bad so we go with the 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.299
 attack that partly benefits from this 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:20.039
 with the dragon 

00:05:18.299 --> 00:05:21.719
 this dragon type movement of 60 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.189
 power and without television has the 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:25.049
 particularity that always goes last 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:27.179
 but force the change every time 

00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:28.349
 we use therefore if the opponent has 

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:30.569
 started also increase the 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.399
 features will lose these benefits 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:33.629
 since being with the dragon you will have to 

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:35.609
 change breaking completely and 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:37.799
 strategy in addition as this kind of 

00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:39.989
 hits for being and therefore its power 

00:05:37.799 --> 00:05:41.889
 it is increased all pokemon can be 

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:44.139
 resist the power of a dragon 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.699
 after the increases with curse and 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.650
 more if we have the field full of spines or 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.780
 trap clothes few pokemons of all 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.219
 type the types and is that the type fairy 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.990
 simulates the type of aragon and therefore 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:54.669
 we need some movement that can 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.800
 stop her pokemon like silvia take her 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.599
 nuances and this is where the room comes in 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.949
 movement of set with the iron one 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:02.349
 movement of equipment to zero of 100 of 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.909
 power and 35 precision that in addition to 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:05.379
 cause harm has a 10% of 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:07.599
 possibilities to reduce the defense of 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:09.430
 rival also type 0 is very effective 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:11.169
 against the rock the ice and also the 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.029
 fairies therefore be our best 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.750
 trick to pay for these pokemon that can 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:16.850
 to be lost alavedra 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.530
 finally for people who ask 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.510
 how to make a curse pledge and 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.800
 with the jargon this is obtained through 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.990
 a few parenting chains is a bit 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.910
 long for curse we need a 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.890
 slow pop wanted with a pull to 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.540
 pass the movement to this and then the 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.340
 type should create with the abortive armh of 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.770
 udra so that a single curse is born 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.750
 for which cling we need to gather 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.490
 a cron with a hand soros so that this one 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.230
 let him move and then put the 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.240
 absurdities with the last weapon of buddha 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.590
 finally we put together the 2 gomis and 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.030
 they started doing wu ming with the two 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.950
 movements since in this generation 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.590
 the egg movements are passed by both the 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.540
 father as the mother and well until I 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.010
 I put news this generation I hope
