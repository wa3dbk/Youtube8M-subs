00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.350 
it looks like after never used it I
would<00:00:46.090> do<00:00:46.239> a<00:00:46.270> how-to<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.700> like<00:00:48.940> I<00:00:49.060> said<00:00:49.270> I've

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
would do a how-to but like I said I've

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.820 
would do a how-to but like I said I've
never<00:00:49.390> used<00:00:49.780> it<00:00:49.960> before<00:00:50.020> and<00:00:50.380> I<00:00:50.440> don't<00:00:50.500> want<00:00:50.740> to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
never used it before and I don't want to

never used it before and I don't want to
 you<00:00:51.910> and<00:00:52.090> pretend<00:00:52.570> like<00:00:52.630> I<00:00:52.780> know

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
what I'm doing when I don't so I figured

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.220 
what I'm doing when I don't so I figured
I'd<00:00:54.910> just<00:00:55.060> go<00:00:55.210> ahead<00:00:55.420> and<00:00:55.540> post<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.870> before

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
I'd just go ahead and post the before

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.650 
I'd just go ahead and post the before
and<00:00:56.380> after<00:00:56.740> of<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.250> product<00:00:57.670> and<00:00:57.910> let<00:00:58.570> you

that<00:02:13.689> I<00:02:13.720> needed<00:02:13.989> I<00:02:14.230> didn't<00:02:15.099> need<00:02:15.189> any<00:02:15.400> other

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
that I needed I didn't need any other

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
kit so I took it back to autozone course

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.020 
kit so I took it back to autozone course
they<00:02:23.560> just<00:02:23.590> swapped<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.490> right<00:02:24.640> out<00:02:24.819> no

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030

here's the final result didn't turn out
beautiful<00:02:44.239> but<00:02:44.890> hopefully<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.040> will<00:02:46.069> be

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
beautiful but hopefully it will be

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.470 
beautiful but hopefully it will be
enough<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:47.590> keep<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.769> water<00:02:48.980> out<00:02:49.099> so<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:50.299> can

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
enough to keep the water out so you can

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.630 
enough to keep the water out so you can
see<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:51.080> didn't<00:02:51.379> turn<00:02:51.440> out<00:02:51.500> beautiful<00:02:52.040> because

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
see it didn't turn out beautiful because

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.000 
see it didn't turn out beautiful because
of<00:02:53.230> kind<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.319> because<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.590> me

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
of kind of because of me

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.130 
of kind of because of me
right<00:02:55.790> here<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.209> can<00:02:56.390> tell<00:02:56.629> where<00:02:56.959> there's

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
right here you can tell where there's

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.460 
right here you can tell where there's
quartz<00:02:58.010> textured<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:59.180> blends<00:02:59.900> in<00:03:00.080> real<00:03:00.290> good

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
quartz textured it blends in real good

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.280 
quartz textured it blends in real good
with<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:01.299> with<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.420> roof<00:03:02.599> right<00:03:02.900> around<00:03:03.140> the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
with the with the roof right around the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.009 
with the with the roof right around the
edges<00:03:03.489> put<00:03:04.489> that<00:03:04.640> in<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.849> middle<00:03:05.120> I<00:03:05.269> put<00:03:05.630> too

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
edges put that in the middle I put too

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.890 
edges put that in the middle I put too
much<00:03:06.049> of<00:03:06.349> that<00:03:06.410> gunk<00:03:06.799> on<00:03:07.010> there<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.720> just<00:03:08.720> kind

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
much of that gunk on there and just kind

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.240 
much of that gunk on there and just kind
of<00:03:08.989> flattened<00:03:09.380> out<00:03:09.440> didn't<00:03:09.769> really<00:03:09.980> give<00:03:10.130> it

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
of flattened out didn't really give it

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.479 
of flattened out didn't really give it
the<00:03:10.340> texture<00:03:10.720> that<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:12.560> has<00:03:12.709> where<00:03:12.980> it's<00:03:13.129> works

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
the texture that it has where it's works

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.710 
the texture that it has where it's works
lighter<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:14.060> if<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.239> do<00:03:14.420> it

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
lighter so if you do it

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.900 
lighter so if you do it
don't<00:03:15.410> cake<00:03:15.680> this<00:03:15.860> stuff<00:03:16.099> on<00:03:16.280> just<00:03:16.549> put<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.819> on

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
don't cake this stuff on just put it on

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.729 
don't cake this stuff on just put it on
real<00:03:17.239> real<00:03:17.840> light<00:03:18.079> and<00:03:18.110> you'll<00:03:18.470> get<00:03:18.590> your

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
real real light and you'll get your

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.830 
real real light and you'll get your
texture<00:03:19.129> that<00:03:19.250> you're<00:03:19.340> looking<00:03:19.640> for<00:03:19.840> I'll

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
texture that you're looking for I'll

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.240 
texture that you're looking for I'll
probably<00:03:21.110> go<00:03:21.349> ahead<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.680> scrape<00:03:21.950> some<00:03:22.220> of

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
probably go ahead and scrape some of

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.369 
probably go ahead and scrape some of
this<00:03:22.400> stuff<00:03:22.670> off<00:03:22.879> and<00:03:23.150> kind<00:03:23.870> of<00:03:23.959> melt<00:03:24.140> it<00:03:24.260> off

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
this stuff off and kind of melt it off

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.130 
this stuff off and kind of melt it off
and<00:03:24.560> do<00:03:24.650> it<00:03:24.739> again<00:03:24.950> but<00:03:25.250> for<00:03:26.120> right<00:03:26.180> now<00:03:26.269> it<00:03:26.629> you

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
and do it again but for right now it you

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.750 
and do it again but for right now it you
know<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.530> is<00:03:27.709> what<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.099> it's<00:03:28.340> better<00:03:28.519> than

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
know it is what it is it's better than

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.729 
know it is what it is it's better than
having<00:03:29.599> it<00:03:29.660> open<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.049> leaking<00:03:30.319> on<00:03:30.440> me<00:03:30.590> so

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
having it open and leaking on me so

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.470 
having it open and leaking on me so
there<00:03:31.370> is<00:03:31.579> overall<00:03:31.849> I<00:03:31.940> think<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.269> product

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
there is overall I think the product

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.240 
there is overall I think the product
worked<00:03:32.810> pretty<00:03:33.079> good<00:03:33.319> if<00:03:33.680> I<00:03:33.859> would<00:03:34.040> have<00:03:34.130> just

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
worked pretty good if I would have just

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.389 
worked pretty good if I would have just
done<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.430> better<00:03:34.579> job<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:34.910> client
