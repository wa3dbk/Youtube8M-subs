projects so give me the quick rundown
well<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.530> suspension<00:00:41.219> was<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.920> combination<00:00:43.920> of

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
well the suspension was a combination of

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.260 
well the suspension was a combination of
easy<00:00:45.180> ride<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:46.410> newer<00:00:47.219> suspensions<00:00:48.030> one

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
easy ride it's newer suspensions one

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.910 
easy ride it's newer suspensions one

all the way to the rear uh-huh and then
Scorpion<00:00:53.250> para<00:00:53.550> rail<00:00:53.789> they<00:00:54.059> use<00:00:54.210> all<00:00:54.390> bow<00:00:54.570> you

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
Scorpion para rail they use all bow you

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.110 
Scorpion para rail they use all bow you
wheels<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> rail<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.760> run<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
wheels on a rail so I can run in the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.580 
wheels on a rail so I can run in the
summer<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.570> Don<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> lubrication

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
and then the tensioning system and the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.410 
and then the tensioning system and the
rear<00:01:01.980> axle<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> same<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:03.030> John<00:01:03.270> Deere

covers will come right off that's easy
to<00:02:29.960> work<00:02:30.080> on

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
to work on

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.270 
to work on
well<00:02:33.050> I<00:02:33.080> think<00:02:33.260> this<00:02:33.560> thing<00:02:33.830> should<00:02:34.040> be<00:02:34.160> on<00:02:34.250> a

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
well I think this thing should be on a

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.760 
well I think this thing should be on a
John<00:02:34.610> Deere<00:02:34.820> showroom<00:02:35.270> floor<00:02:35.540> somewhere<00:02:35.960> yep

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
John Deere showroom floor somewhere yep

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.390 
John Deere showroom floor somewhere yep
I<00:02:37.870> put<00:02:38.870> electric<00:02:39.230> started<00:02:39.710> before<00:02:39.920> that<00:02:40.250> it

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
I put electric started before that it

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.540 
I put electric started before that it
was<00:02:40.520> one<00:02:40.670> hundred<00:02:42.070> five<00:02:43.070> hundred<00:02:43.400> thirty

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
was one hundred five hundred thirty

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.790 
was one hundred five hundred thirty
pounds<00:02:44.090> then<00:02:44.930> I<00:02:44.960> put<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.320> electric<00:02:45.620> started

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
pounds then I put the electric started

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.170 
pounds then I put the electric started
so<00:02:48.800> though<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.310> weight<00:02:49.490> of<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.730> slide<00:02:49.940> is

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
so though the weight of the slide is

00:02:50.180 --> 00:03:02.310 
so though the weight of the slide is
