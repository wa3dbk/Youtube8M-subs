00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
yeah I think that people like this

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.810

anytime<00:05:42.440> you<00:05:42.740> find<00:05:42.950> one<00:05:43.220> them<00:05:43.370> they<00:05:43.520> should<00:05:43.669> be

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
anytime you find one them they should be

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.570 
anytime you find one them they should be

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
but I always heard though that steroids

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.580 
but I always heard though that steroids
especially<00:05:49.910> that<00:05:50.270> they<00:05:50.450> can<00:05:50.660> be<00:05:50.840> gotten<00:05:51.110> very

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
especially that they can be gotten very

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.550 
especially that they can be gotten very
easily<00:05:51.890> in<00:05:52.250> gyms<00:05:52.640> in<00:05:52.880> different<00:05:53.870> places<00:05:54.080> so<00:05:54.380> I

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
easily in gyms in different places so I

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.020 
easily in gyms in different places so I
