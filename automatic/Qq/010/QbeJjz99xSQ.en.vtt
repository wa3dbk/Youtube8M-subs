formwork<00:01:57.700> is<00:01:58.030> by<00:01:58.270> far<00:01:58.539> the<00:01:58.600> most<00:01:58.840> important

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
formwork is by far the most important

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.889 
formwork is by far the most important
thing<00:01:59.590> you<00:01:59.799> can<00:01:59.829> be<00:02:00.549> strong<00:02:01.030> but<00:02:01.630> if<00:02:01.750> you

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
thing you can be strong but if you

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.149 
thing you can be strong but if you
don't<00:02:02.079> know<00:02:02.140> how<00:02:02.289> to<00:02:02.320> bench<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:02.979> have<00:02:03.100> a

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
don't know how to bench and you have a

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.620 
don't know how to bench and you have a
lot<00:02:03.189> of<00:02:03.369> inefficient<00:02:04.030> movements<00:02:04.479> you're

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
lot of inefficient movements you're

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.690 
lot of inefficient movements you're
wasting<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.229> lot<00:02:05.409> of<00:02:05.469> energy<00:02:05.799> one<00:02:06.549> of<00:02:06.640> the

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
wasting a lot of energy one of the

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.580 
wasting a lot of energy one of the
fastest<00:02:07.149> ways<00:02:07.329> I<00:02:07.539> was<00:02:07.689> able<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.960> up<00:02:08.080> my<00:02:08.110> bench

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
fastest ways I was able to up my bench

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.400 
fastest ways I was able to up my bench
was<00:02:09.220> when<00:02:09.610> my<00:02:09.849> bench<00:02:10.209> form<00:02:10.509> got<00:02:10.720> corrected<00:02:11.260> by

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
was when my bench form got corrected by

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.100 
was when my bench form got corrected by
Dave<00:02:11.709> tape<00:02:12.040> it's<00:02:12.310> one<00:02:12.970> of<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.180> things<00:02:13.420> that<00:02:13.569> no

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
Dave tape it's one of the things that no

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.690 
Dave tape it's one of the things that no
one<00:02:14.530> really<00:02:14.650> thinks<00:02:14.950> about<00:02:15.099> because<00:02:15.489> if<00:02:15.610> you

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
one really thinks about because if you

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.890 
one really thinks about because if you
look<00:02:15.849> at<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.060> bench<00:02:16.269> press<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:16.720> such<00:02:16.870> a

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
look at the bench press it's such a

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.440 
look at the bench press it's such a
simple<00:02:17.290> movement<00:02:17.830> grab<00:02:18.400> wait<00:02:18.700> bring<00:02:19.209> down

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
simple movement grab wait bring down

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.110 
simple movement grab wait bring down
push<00:02:19.840> up<00:02:19.870> but<00:02:20.560> it's<00:02:20.739> not<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.519> simple<00:02:21.880> you

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
push up but it's not that simple you

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.420 
push up but it's not that simple you
have<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.750> realize<00:02:23.170> it's<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.860> very<00:02:24.130> technical

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
have to realize it's a very technical

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.220 
have to realize it's a very technical
lift<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.000> there's<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.209> lot<00:02:25.390> going<00:02:25.420> on<00:02:25.930> so

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
lift and there's a lot going on so

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.500 
lift and there's a lot going on so
number<00:02:27.010> one<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.610> have<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:28.060> increase<00:02:28.330> the

properly<00:02:38.180> if<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.780> don't<00:02:38.959> have<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.140> plan<00:02:39.530> that

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
possible then you're kind of wasting

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.240 
possible then you're kind of wasting
your<00:02:45.410> time<00:02:45.530> you're<00:02:45.680> not<00:02:45.739> kind<00:02:45.890> of<00:02:46.010> wasting

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
your time you're not kind of wasting

strength increase your one rep max if I

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.400 
strength increase your one rep max if I
ask<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.430> what<00:02:58.700> your<00:02:58.849> one<00:02:59.060> rep<00:02:59.239> max<00:02:59.269> is<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.050> you

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
ask you what your one rep max is and you

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.300 
ask you what your one rep max is and you

weak points with proper supplemental and
accessory<00:03:23.140> movements<00:03:23.680> for<00:03:24.280> me<00:03:24.489> I'm<00:03:25.269> a<00:03:25.299> raw

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.979 
accessory movements for me I'm a raw
bencher<00:03:26.260> so<00:03:26.620> arm<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.849> have<00:03:28.269> to<00:03:28.450> really<00:03:28.659> increase

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989
