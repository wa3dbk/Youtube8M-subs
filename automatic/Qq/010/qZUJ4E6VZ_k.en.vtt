00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 adventure sprayers along with 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 countryman 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.490
 the staff the great doubt is regular 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.420
 equipment that does not contain 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.689
 jump x benÃ© of the adventure purifiers 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.980
 garbage various types of regulation fury 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.810
 when this game should be regular 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.390
 It's easier for people to finish 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.189
 confusing a lot about the regular and 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.660
 performing right 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.970
 But come on then you will understand 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.820
 on the very simple regulation well do 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.519
 I try to follow are six step first 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.820
 step the equipment you purchase does not 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:44.850
 it could be about 12 meters from a 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.610
 tip to the other as it does not contain tide 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.950
 obika supervisor poverty and 12 meters 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.039
 a tip does not use but for when 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.829
 easier bonbon round it goes 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.440
 being politicized to about 10 meters 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.300
 for you to better understand the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.859
 public equipment from end to end 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.770
 10 meters 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.009
 Let's go to the second step. I'll pay. 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.920
 This two here I'm putting ten 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:15.060
 meters he could from a door 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.599
 in the other series to cover 100 meters in the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.170
 its property advertising 10 meters 

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:26.300
 What will be the square footage of ten 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.670
 times equal to one thousand square meters 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.280
 correct then it 's 90 or pay a 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.349
 business for you deem it 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.030
 sprayed 10 meters 

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:41.580
 without their ten property 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.700
 times when it reached a thousand meters 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.800
 squares that it sprays only 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.739
 generally used in this equipment 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.080
 can start with a guitar that is 10 

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:54.869
 one thousand square meters correct 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.119
 only that it made available only one thousand meters 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.489
 square that is the scope 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.009
 equipment could have walked six meters 

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:03.030
 ilna gave a thousand square meters that he 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.110
 landed 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.300
 so in the case 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.350
 understood the reasoning if anyone knows 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:14.500
 who 100 meters is he publishing 10 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:19.240
 average coverage per thousand meters 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:23.590
 square then just do a thousand times 10 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:27.910
 which will give 10 thousand square meters 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:31.180
 is one hectare correct 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.920
 so we understood the reasoning 3 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:40.570
 step what you will do and will connect the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:45.430
 equipment to be the other pain around 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:49.209
 1200 to 1500 rpm which is to give the 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:52.390
 power take off 540 rpm 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.570
 the power take off is the cardan made it 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.989
 it is functional at 540 rpm 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.070
 I do not know with the fourth step the tie is already 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.130
 working 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.560
 You'll turn on the nozzles. 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.930
 and will go the 100 meters you 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.290
 marcou is born on his property 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.580
 perfect once again remembered 10 meters 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.709
 spanning 100 meters and covering 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.310
 he will be able to use one thousand square meters 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.840
 correct you just mobilized the 100 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.320
 meters at sea with these properties and 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.519
 said the equipment when it got crazy 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.600
 that of March 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:34.360
 you will check the amount spent on the 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.200
 your equipment contains a 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.190
 level is set at 67 500 400 and thus 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.580
 against 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:46.140
 only in case and traveling 100 meters 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.370
 a little bit about 20 30 40 50 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.190
 liters ne 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.770
 in the 100 meters that covered the correct one 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.100
 votes and the palace 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:59.700
 I use an example that supposes years 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.430
 who spent 30 liters to cover the 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.720
 100 meters which is one thousand square meters 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.880
 right 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.820
 so who knows who is spending 30 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.870
 liters per thousand square meters is 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:15.930
 simple 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:21.480
 there are 30 liters times ten times equal to 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:25.140
 300 liters per hectare yield to correct 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.090
 understand the way the kid does not fit 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.180
 easier the adjustment of our 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.180
 equipment
