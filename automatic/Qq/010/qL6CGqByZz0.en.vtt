alright so here we are with the MSR
pocket<00:00:09.450> rocket<00:00:09.870> we're<00:00:09.960> going<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.230> see<00:00:10.380> how

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
pocket rocket we're going to see how

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.589 
pocket rocket we're going to see how
much<00:00:10.769> how<00:00:11.340> much<00:00:11.490> time<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:12.000> takes<00:00:12.150> for<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.540> to

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
much how much time it takes for it to

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.570 
much how much time it takes for it to
boil<00:00:13.170> two<00:00:13.740> cups<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.099> water<00:00:14.309> which<00:00:14.549> is

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
boil two cups of water which is

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.279 
boil two cups of water which is
basically<00:00:15.089> what<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.389> need<00:00:15.570> for<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.929> mountain

usually need two cups of water to

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.230 
usually need two cups of water to
rehydrate<00:00:23.820> them<00:00:24.449> or<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:25.939> bring<00:00:26.939> them<00:00:27.029> back<00:00:27.150> to

life<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.660> speak<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.619> let's<00:00:28.949> go<00:00:29.130> ahead<00:00:29.160> and

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
life so to speak so let's go ahead and

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:50.630 
life so to speak so let's go ahead and
get<00:00:29.490> started

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:02:52.860 

will<00:00:51.640> do<00:00:51.790> about<00:00:51.940> medium<00:00:52.540> on<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.140> heat

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.600 

now<00:02:53.409> the<00:02:53.500> water<00:02:53.680> being<00:02:53.890> used<00:02:53.980> is<00:02:54.340> about<00:02:54.519> the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
now the water being used is about the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.250 
now the water being used is about the
same<00:02:54.790> temperature<00:02:55.330> as<00:02:55.360> water<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:56.049> would<00:02:56.170> get

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
same temperature as water you would get

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.559 
same temperature as water you would get
out<00:02:56.409> any<00:02:56.620> league<00:02:56.890> stream<00:02:57.250> spring<00:02:57.790> or<00:02:58.269> anything

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
out any league stream spring or anything

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.020 
out any league stream spring or anything
like<00:02:58.599> that<00:02:58.830> along<00:02:59.830> the<00:02:59.890> trail<00:03:00.280> that<00:03:00.519> you<00:03:00.730> be<00:03:01.000> on

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
like that along the trail that you be on

00:03:01.030 --> 00:05:16.530 
like that along the trail that you be on
or<00:03:01.480> out<00:03:01.810> camping

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.910 

so<00:05:17.540> as<00:05:17.600> you<00:05:17.690> can<00:05:17.780> see<00:05:17.990> that<00:05:18.020> definitely<00:05:18.500> took<00:05:18.680> a

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
so as you can see that definitely took a

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.500 
so as you can see that definitely took a
lot<00:05:19.340> shorter<00:05:19.580> than<00:05:19.850> if<00:05:20.030> you<00:05:20.150> were<00:05:20.240> to<00:05:20.360> happen

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
lot shorter than if you were to happen

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.030 
lot shorter than if you were to happen
as<00:05:20.840> a<00:05:20.870> bit<00:05:21.140> or<00:05:21.380> if<00:05:22.100> you<00:05:22.250> were<00:05:22.490> to<00:05:22.760> have<00:05:23.030> a

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
as a bit or if you were to have a

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.410 
as a bit or if you were to have a
alcohol<00:05:25.040> stove<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:25.760> alcohol<00:05:26.060> stove<00:05:26.300> is

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
alcohol stove the alcohol stove is

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.330 
alcohol stove the alcohol stove is
pretty<00:05:26.660> comparable<00:05:27.020> you<00:05:27.770> know<00:05:27.860> but<00:05:28.040> even<00:05:28.250> on

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
pretty comparable you know but even on

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.440 
pretty comparable you know but even on
medium<00:05:29.710> pressure<00:05:30.710> for<00:05:31.160> this<00:05:31.280> MSR<00:05:31.790> it's

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
medium pressure for this MSR it's

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.300 
medium pressure for this MSR it's
putting<00:05:32.690> out<00:05:32.780> ton<00:05:33.080> more<00:05:33.290> heat<00:05:33.590> than<00:05:33.770> what<00:05:34.040> you

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
putting out ton more heat than what you

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.260 
putting out ton more heat than what you
know<00:05:34.400> alcohol<00:05:34.820> stove<00:05:35.380> or<00:05:36.380> on<00:05:36.710> as<00:05:37.010> bit<00:05:37.220> is<00:05:37.370> you

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
know alcohol stove or on as bit is you

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.760 
know alcohol stove or on as bit is you
know<00:05:38.390> but<00:05:38.720> do<00:05:38.900> you<00:05:38.960> want<00:05:39.110> to<00:05:39.170> carry<00:05:39.320> the<00:05:39.500> bulk

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
know but do you want to carry the bulk

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.590 
know but do you want to carry the bulk
is<00:05:40.010> basically<00:05:40.520> the<00:05:41.060> question<00:05:41.390> you<00:05:41.450> have<00:05:41.480> to

is basically the question you have to
answer<00:05:41.720> yourself<00:05:42.020> do<00:05:42.440> you<00:05:42.530> want<00:05:42.680> to<00:05:42.740> carry<00:05:42.890> the

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
bulk of having you know the fuel caster

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.560 
bulk of having you know the fuel caster
and<00:05:48.050> stove<00:05:48.770> you<00:05:49.670> know<00:05:49.760> versus<00:05:50.210> carrying

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
and stove you know versus carrying

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.320 
and stove you know versus carrying
something<00:05:51.040> this<00:05:52.040> size<00:05:52.310> which<00:05:52.700> is<00:05:52.820> the<00:05:52.940> alcohol

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
something this size which is the alcohol

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.790 
something this size which is the alcohol
stove<00:05:53.660> which<00:05:54.200> as<00:05:54.380> you<00:05:54.500> can<00:05:54.530> see<00:05:54.860> here<00:05:56.800> very

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
stove which as you can see here very

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.260 
stove which as you can see here very
small<00:05:58.220> compared<00:05:58.760> to<00:05:58.940> that<00:05:59.210> MSR<00:05:59.750> pocket<00:06:00.680> rocket

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
small compared to that MSR pocket rocket

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.400 
small compared to that MSR pocket rocket
even<00:06:02.270> with<00:06:02.480> the<00:06:03.440> alcohol<00:06:04.040> that<00:06:04.160> comes<00:06:04.370> with<00:06:04.610> it

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
even with the alcohol that comes with it

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.650 
even with the alcohol that comes with it
still<00:06:06.410> very<00:06:06.620> small<00:06:07.090> so<00:06:08.090> you<00:06:08.450> know<00:06:08.510> just

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
still very small so you know just

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.510 
still very small so you know just
choices<00:06:09.050> you<00:06:09.140> have<00:06:09.170> to<00:06:09.290> make<00:06:09.410> along<00:06:10.160> the<00:06:10.340> lines

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
choices you have to make along the lines

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.240 
choices you have to make along the lines
of<00:06:10.670> that<00:06:10.870> but<00:06:11.870> you<00:06:12.170> know<00:06:12.200> if<00:06:12.530> you<00:06:12.890> were<00:06:13.100> gone
