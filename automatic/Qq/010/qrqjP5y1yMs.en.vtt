gluing<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:23.960> think<00:02:24.170> just<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.440> tail<00:02:24.620> needs<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.920> be

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
gluing I think just the tail needs to be

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.790 
gluing I think just the tail needs to be
glued<00:02:25.190> on<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:26.420> it's<00:02:27.260> just<00:02:27.320> a<00:02:27.470> real<00:02:27.650> fun

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
glued on so it's just a real fun
