 of this beast 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.630
 before giving the testimonials that go 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.780
 since the 17th century approximately in the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.110
 year 1650 and something when the first one is given 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.380
 sighting I would like to say that the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.530
 most of the people coincide 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.900
 in that this monster is a kind of 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.020
 sea ​​monster with ox head in 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.180
 end some tremendously rare things 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.890
 even annotations of modernity what 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.870
 they qualify as if it were some kind of 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.850
 reptile resembling a dragon 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.060
 before continuing before continuing 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:44.320
 affirming things let's start with the 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.830
 year 1653 giving the testimony of one of 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.200
 the people who have seen the beast 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.369
 I will read your words 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.270
 first of all he said is called lucas 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.579
 fernández de piedrahíta 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.750
 He has seen it a little bit later in the 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:08.270
 year one thousand 676 was a priest and 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.590
 Colombian historian 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.950
 in the condition of Bishop of Santa Marta 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.129
 He said 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.950
 to time discover a black fish with the 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.510
 head like an ox and greater than a 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.909
 whale 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.750
 I leave in addition another additional citation 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.340
 aimed at bringing authenticity to the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.260
 affair 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.629
 Sara says that in his time as 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.319
 affirmed people of great credit and the 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:42.090
 Indians said that it was the devil and for 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:45.090
 the year 600 and 52 in the year 1600 52 thousand 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.970
 653 which is when I told you that the 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.540
 first sighting while I was in that 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:56.490
 site told me that I saw her 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.890
 andrea de vargas lady of that country 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.010
 this is nothing because we have talked about 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.110
 17th century but actually when it 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.360
 when you start talking more about 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.360
 total lake monster when it starts to 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.290
 charge prominence is from 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:17.390
 19th century by the year 1800 and something to 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.910
 mid or mid-pulling late 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.750

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:28.040
