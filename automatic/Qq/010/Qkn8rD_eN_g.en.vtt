00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.110
 a beautiful day today fourth case so stuff showed the new features 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.099
 Beijing the water masses too 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.369
 k Ott 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.859
 k 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.679
 on 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.460
 quasi Prof beat for beginners and effect in the sea 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.819
 so for that matter percent I will personally 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.939
 between Clegg and take 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.540
 high uses 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.540
 to intervene from the beginning 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.940
 Bamberg or you can not if they can not do it then 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.060
 support kicked off at 10 10 am and thus are active when new arrives 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.210
 Margairaz 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.580
 around 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.790
 and therefore also for the campaigner can cost to simpler 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.950
 the side looks the bunch 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.970
 Downside percent 6 there lives 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.480
 the side of the composite 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.480
 and the page fifth and played 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.440
 Robert in tents Oberderdingen must 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.770
 would be able to support that through art 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.160
 around 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.890
 Nobody can do that 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.040
 then a godfather difference is the duo to dampen the prominent speakers 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.060
 We let Daum transfer 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.250
 otherwise in kindergartens or 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.490
 Dr 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.490
 not nice 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.060
 and he either way 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.060
 Artur citizens one could interest such a 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.579
 and one often lies in saying that one buys milk RCZ is 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.340
 in sight, as it were, one draws a 1 and 2 and 3 bru 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.870
 and many and 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.770
 You would play Ernst's part since he was not part 3 since 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.549
 we must realize that we are the last country Hamburg dpa dpa da da da da there 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:12.370
 this is a very different game than when you look at us now so 1 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.599
 and 2 and 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:20.099
 Heinz k 1 2 a 3 one here Karch 1 Top 12 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.099
 yes 3 here one 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:27.029
 and that is a reason to field percents basic principle of thought around 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.349
 the funny thing with that is that 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:34.909
 if you do not really count 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.909
 imposing exactly the same thing as playing normally 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.909
 and that's because you care about years only 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.840
 So part 1 part 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.949
 Part Mr. 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.949
 so to speak 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.499
 Old passes quarter plays 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:54.929
 Music will be 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:58.379
 and at the OOWV Spielbericht also Aachen is performed 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.219
 there you can now want with us and Philipp Lahm trends day 2 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.529
 Highlight should be 4 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:09.279
 with currently 12 14 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.399
 Part 1 part part 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:15.399
 1 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.619
 and for that reason to us and to avoid this confusion she has 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:22.199
 really everyone perform today 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.680
 In any case, they really do not recommend governments 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:26.619
 hear 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.619
 while paying attention to the remaining instruments 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:35.309
 we are currently doing the locations in the will according to the way to the factory and the 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:38.249
 it should at least ran again 

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:41.249
 per ton to feel the request 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:46.419
 So we try set ounces of gold category and that has us 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:50.409
 Come on the Etz in its purest form means you only play on us 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:51.499
 help now 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:58.679
 1 percent Zwahlen Qualcomm game came 1 in the meantime drives one and four percent 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.719
 Brussels around 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.899
 or is often argued but by far down or up 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:07.329
 plays 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.419
 the relatively so 1 2 1 2 thanks drives here twins 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.729
 it had to be crispier 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:16.910
 Thank you 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.809
 a fourth 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:21.809
 but no the facts as she enjoys herself in the game 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.370
 someone on strike 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.840
 and what we can do something about 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.909
 what do you need more coordination 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:35.339
 I better go through the percentage stand all the time 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:39.930
 1 and 2 2 and 3 2 and 4 2 and 1 point 3 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.930
 Pound percentage points and 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.379
 but then 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:53.959
 on the CZ Naab stops so the fingers are on the Accord, so to speak 

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:56.959
 however the sides wore shoulder but just 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:00.059
 Klose are on gossips 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:02.430
 and then to press on us now 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:09.500
 1 top 2 no 3 no escape 1 1 once there was no point no team met 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:13.749
 Seco became the nation for the matter 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:15.669
 so very slowly 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.860
 Officer times 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.960
 Kimi fingerless over it in Thun Schlecks with a discount 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.229
 and on the and 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.819
 in the Final Four big final at the serve 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.520
 us that thing and especially then separately were in use and jusos 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.830
 Gaz violates Hertha has 

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:45.860
 and really with you 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.979
 and said it must be simple but thin because that is called the ranking 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:54.069
 Dr 

00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:00.339
 and that would be the mediation with the off beat 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.279
 Unique wishes so much fun and inside he does not forget EUR 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:06.400
 and USD
