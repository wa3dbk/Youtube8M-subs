and popped it into a cup to hold it so
that<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.690> doesn't<00:00:34.050> itself<00:00:34.440> all<00:00:34.620> ugly<00:00:35.149> so

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
that it doesn't itself all ugly so

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.720 
that it doesn't itself all ugly so
that's<00:00:36.360> our<00:00:36.510> cream<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.129> in<00:00:38.129> with<00:00:38.250> our<00:00:38.370> sugar

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730

and our vanilla

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.790 
and our vanilla
I'm<00:00:42.210> using<00:00:42.420> pure<00:00:42.780> vanilla<00:00:42.989> extract<00:00:43.260> here

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
I'm using pure vanilla extract here

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.440 
I'm using pure vanilla extract here
because<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.309> happen<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.059> flavor<00:00:45.300> of

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
because I happen to like the flavor of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.690 
because I happen to like the flavor of
it<00:00:45.690> now<00:00:48.050> we<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.230> squeeze<00:00:49.890> most<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.550> air

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
it now we can squeeze most of the air

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.279 
it now we can squeeze most of the air
out<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.910> our<00:00:51.090> ziplock<00:00:51.480> bag<00:00:51.719> trying<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.170> use<00:00:52.260> a

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
out of our ziplock bag trying to use a

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.080 
out of our ziplock bag trying to use a
fairly<00:00:52.620> good<00:00:52.770> quality<00:00:53.190> ziplock<00:00:53.579> bag<00:00:53.789> if<00:00:54.000> you

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
fairly good quality ziplock bag if you

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.720 
fairly good quality ziplock bag if you
can<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:54.960> block<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.440> becoming<00:00:56.100> punctured

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
can so this block is becoming punctured

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.720 
can so this block is becoming punctured
and<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.840> squash<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:58.890> much<00:00:59.070> air<00:00:59.250> out<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.609> as

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
and just squash as much air out of it as

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.170 
and just squash as much air out of it as
possible<00:01:00.289> and<00:01:01.289> now<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:01.649> get<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> larger<00:01:02.550> ziplock

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
possible and now we get a larger ziplock

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.469 
possible and now we get a larger ziplock
bag<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.199> into<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.589> large<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.189> okay<00:01:05.700> we
