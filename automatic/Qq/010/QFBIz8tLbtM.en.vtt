00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
nothing like being up there and then

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.800 
nothing like being up there and then
diving<00:01:28.170> off<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.939> rush<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.360> falling

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
diving off and just the rush of falling

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.810 
diving off and just the rush of falling
from<00:01:30.960> 10<00:01:31.170> meters<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.650> hitting<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.890> water<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
from 10 meters and hitting the water the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.850 
from 10 meters and hitting the water the
only<00:01:33.060> thing<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.450> don't<00:01:33.930> miss<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.619> fact

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
only thing that I don't miss is the fact

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.440 
only thing that I don't miss is the fact
that<00:01:34.979> when<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.250> hit<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> water<00:01:35.610> at<00:01:35.759> 35<00:01:36.180> miles

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that when you hit the water at 35 miles

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.600 
that when you hit the water at 35 miles
now<00:01:36.780> are<00:01:36.930> your<00:01:37.110> muscles<00:01:37.350> really<00:01:38.009> ache<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
now are your muscles really ache in the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.780 
now are your muscles really ache in the
morning<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.150> through<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> day<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:41.310> don't

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
morning and through the day and I don't

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.630 
morning and through the day and I don't
miss<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.150> too<00:01:42.390> much<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.490> it's<00:01:44.490> a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
miss that too much but it's it's a

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.730 
miss that too much but it's it's a
different<00:01:45.140> events<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> 3-meter

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
different events in the 3-meter

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.200 
different events in the 3-meter
springboard<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.549> think<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.970> little<00:01:48.090> bit

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
springboard I think it's a little bit

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.480 
springboard I think it's a little bit
easier<00:01:48.750> because<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> rhythm

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
easier because you have to have a rhythm

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.340 
easier because you have to have a rhythm

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
then maybe missing a dive ever so much

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.200 
then maybe missing a dive ever so much
and<00:04:43.540> you<00:04:43.570> know<00:04:43.840> missing<00:04:44.740> a<00:04:44.830> medal<00:04:45.190> or<00:04:45.430> missing

you know I you know I leave that to not
being<00:04:56.350> quite<00:04:56.740> prepared<00:04:57.250> and<00:04:57.520> doubting<00:04:57.880> myself

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
being quite prepared and doubting myself

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.690 
being quite prepared and doubting myself
not<00:04:58.870> doubting<00:04:59.200> myself<00:04:59.320> entirely<00:04:59.920> but<00:05:00.310> maybe

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
not doubting myself entirely but maybe

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.300 
not doubting myself entirely but maybe
doubting<00:05:01.210> a<00:05:01.270> dive<00:05:01.510> a<00:05:01.540> little<00:05:01.750> bit<00:05:02.080> or<00:05:02.470> over

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
doubting a dive a little bit or over

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.130 
doubting a dive a little bit or over
sinking<00:05:03.790> because<00:05:04.210> that's<00:05:04.510> what<00:05:04.720> tends<00:05:05.020> to

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
sinking because that's what tends to

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.810 
sinking because that's what tends to
happen<00:05:05.260> when<00:05:05.620> you're<00:05:05.890> sitting<00:05:06.190> for<00:05:06.580> an<00:05:06.670> hour

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
and a half between dives in a

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.120 
and a half between dives in a
competition<00:05:09.420> so<00:05:10.420> is<00:05:10.540> it<00:05:10.660> just<00:05:11.130> experience

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
competition so is it just experience

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.590 
competition so is it just experience
that<00:05:12.430> has<00:05:12.580> helped<00:05:12.850> you<00:05:12.940> be<00:05:13.090> more<00:05:13.240> mentally

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
that has helped you be more mentally

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.300 
that has helped you be more mentally
prepared<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.170> do<00:05:14.230> you<00:05:14.320> actually<00:05:14.530> do<00:05:14.920> things

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
prepared to do you actually do things

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.090 
prepared to do you actually do things
differently<00:05:15.960> well<00:05:16.960> I<00:05:16.990> mean<00:05:17.320> I<00:05:17.530> mean<00:05:17.560> I'm<00:05:17.800> doing

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
differently well I mean I mean I'm doing

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.650 
differently well I mean I mean I'm doing
things<00:05:18.310> differently<00:05:18.760> better<00:05:19.300> weight

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
things differently better weight

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.140 
things differently better weight
training<00:05:20.260> better<00:05:20.620> diving<00:05:21.280> instead<00:05:22.000> of<00:05:22.030> doing

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
training better diving instead of doing

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.250 
training better diving instead of doing
maybe<00:05:22.660> 20<00:05:23.350> or<00:05:23.380> 30<00:05:23.830> dives<00:05:24.190> I<00:05:25.150> might<00:05:25.900> break<00:05:26.080> it

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
maybe 20 or 30 dives I might break it

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.520 
maybe 20 or 30 dives I might break it
down<00:05:26.380> to<00:05:26.560> 10<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:27.070> instead<00:05:27.700> of<00:05:27.790> doing<00:05:28.530> quantity

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
down to 10 and instead of doing quantity

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.040 
down to 10 and instead of doing quantity
i<00:05:29.680> do<00:05:30.070> quality<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:31.060> idea<00:05:31.360> of<00:05:31.510> hitting<00:05:31.690> dives

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
i do quality the idea of hitting dives

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.290 
i do quality the idea of hitting dives
just<00:05:32.740> like<00:05:32.950> swimming<00:05:33.700> or<00:05:33.850> hitting<00:05:34.000> a<00:05:34.120> golf

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
just like swimming or hitting a golf

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.740 
just like swimming or hitting a golf
ball<00:05:34.540> or<00:05:34.690> shooting<00:05:34.990> basket<00:05:35.440> you<00:05:35.560> know<00:05:35.680> yes

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
ball or shooting basket you know yes

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.140 
ball or shooting basket you know yes
