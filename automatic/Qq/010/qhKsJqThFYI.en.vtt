00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.209
 hello good morning welcome to my channel 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.710
 Mirna and her hands today I'm going to teach you to 

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:12.170
 make this nice wait 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.270
 I hope you like it and make me 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.850
 help to share it and the materials 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.470
 that we are going to use are a stick of 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.380
 wood 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.380
 brush toilet paper tubes 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.060
 acrylic paint rule of your color 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.680
 diamond preference a cap of 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:39.610
 plastic of which you have cordoncito 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.890
 glue silicon scissors and it would be 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:47.210
 everything and let's start 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.720
 we take our paper tube and 5 what 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.320
 we double 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.340
 and what we are going to do is measure our 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.430
 turn 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.850
 when measuring it of faces that you measure almost 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:05.690
 seven centimeters then 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.690
 look is half and you make a streak 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.510
 you take your plastic cap and go to 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.320
 do there 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.320
 its circular shape 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:28.650
 on both sides and then we're going to 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.650
 trim 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.180
 and so we will have our ways that 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.590
 let's stick with silicone 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:08.960
 let's go joining the one by one and 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.960
 there are ten that we are going to join 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.960
 and more 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:53.220
 already joined our 10 what we are going to 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.590
 to do is to accommodate our figures to 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.490
 way to join and we're going to stick 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.040
 with silicone and we already have a part of the 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.819
 sphere 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:08.299
 we re-flatten the other tube and 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.959
 let's cut into thin strips 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:16.959
 we're going to need three we'll cut one of 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.959
 the sides and we're going to join it with silicone 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.140
 since we have our sides we will take 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.569
 our little sticks to start making a 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.569
 little circle with these little tubes 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.269
 since we finished the little circle we are going to 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:45.150
 apply little silicone and what we're going 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:49.720
 to do is apply glue to be able to 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:53.250
 take out a small part or part of 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.400
 in to make our piquito 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.950
 and now we will start painting 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.760
 you know pints 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.810
 with the acrylic and immediately you're going to 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.000
 apply the diamond 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.490
 and so you 're going to go 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.650
 side by side 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:17.500
 you apply paint and add the diamond 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:21.630
 try to make it one if one does not one if 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.630
 one not since you are reapplying 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.420
 let's use the cord 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.610
 We will cut approximately 25 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.310
 centimeters 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.669
 of the cord or what you go to 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:55.020
 use to hang it and good me in my 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:58.430
 cordoncito I will make a small knot for 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.520
 that this cord is subject 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.060
 to 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.060
 ah 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.360
 and now with the help of my stick I'm going to 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.110
 put it through the hole that was left 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.040
 our piquito the cord and apply 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.040
 silicone 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:28.020
 and the cord cited to be fixed in 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:32.550
 the peak and then I will apply silicon to 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.550
 stick it on my sphere 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:12.280
 If you missed some paint, go back to 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:16.790
 apply and then we have our sphere 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:19.670
 actually done it was very cute 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:24.470
 and well, here I am showing you the 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:28.000
 received finished and join in gold 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.000
 one in red 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.820
 you can use it the color you want and 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:40.450
 is in red with gold 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:43.480
 I put one red one golden one red one 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:46.390
 golden would have applied but that yes 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:50.380
 apply the golden color first 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:52.260
 so as not to stir so much the diamond in 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.770
 Red color 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:58.470
 and well, here is the result of 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:01.800
