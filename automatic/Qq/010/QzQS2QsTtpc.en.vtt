00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:10.160
 knitting patterns from simple and 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:13.280
 facial who low bars diagram of this 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.689
 pattern looks like this 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.630
 and facial loops here 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:23.060
 indicated by a small icon 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.789
 pyramids such images 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:30.259
 sometimes it is possible 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.810
 meet in magazines in the front row with us 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:39.890
 must be an odd number 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:43.660
 loops and dial 1 dial 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.329
 simple low bars 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.899
 pulling out one loop with each 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:54.379
 air loop and so to the end of the row here 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:57.079
 I finished all the loops of the dial-up row and 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.980
 need to check the number of loops 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:03.079
 it was odd further close as usual 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.460
 first extreme single air loop 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:11.110
 loop and then two loops together until 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.110
 the end of this series 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.280
 I finished this series to the end and beyond 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.299
 knit the next loop face 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.390
 noose 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.170
 it is bound between the front and 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.700
 the back 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.520
 Tunisian pillar legs and hook 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.310
 pass through the loop and 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.159
 here is the first front is ready next 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.479
 loop is a simple tunisian column and 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.700
 next again 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:46.280
 front loop and so alternate simple 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.710
 Tunisian column and the following we 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.270
 there will be a facial loop 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:57.009
 close to the end of the row in reverse 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.289
 loops like we do it always first 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:06.640
 one air loop extreme loop 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:06.640
 then two loops together until the end next 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.360
 all loops of the back row 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.360
 closed and we will continue to knit in chess 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.120
 okay where we had a facial loop 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:29.680
 it is longer there knit 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:33.020
 simple tunisian column and where 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.209
 simple tunisian column it is shorter than 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:40.930
 front loop there will be knit 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:43.550
 face loop hook dress between 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.720
 front and back leg poles 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:53.060
 through and then alternate simple 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:56.900
 tunisian column front loop simple 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:01.910
 and then the front loop and so on to the end 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:04.850
 this series we close this series again 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:13.910
 as usually first one air 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:17.540
 loop and then two loops together here i am 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:23.269
 I finished this series to the end and then everything 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:26.570
 time alternating 2 and 3 rows placing sawing 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.130
 staggered and this 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.850
 get a pattern 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.820
 he is very neat and beautiful as well 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:39.170
 the seamy side looks like this 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:42.440
 way we invite to visit the page 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.079
 catalog where you will find all the symbols 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.829
 and lessons on tunisian knitting 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:52.760
 as well as if this lesson was helpful to you 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:54.850
 put likes and i will be glad to yours
