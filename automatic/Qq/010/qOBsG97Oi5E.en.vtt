00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
like darker side but it's the characters

again it just is displayed that he is

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.480 
again it just is displayed that he is
very<00:01:57.000> much<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.869> Sasuke<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.710> all<00:01:58.920> about

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
very much like Sasuke is is all about

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.639 
very much like Sasuke is is all about
revenge<00:01:59.880> for<00:02:00.090> him<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.420> wanting<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.869> kill<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
revenge for him and wanting to kill the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.190 
revenge for him and wanting to kill the
Titans<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:03.180> really<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.659> because<00:02:04.049> he

Titans and I really like that because he

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.109 
Titans and I really like that because he
shows<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.100> his<00:02:05.250> main<00:02:05.490> motive<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
shows that that is his main motive and

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.150 
shows that that is his main motive and
passion<00:02:06.659> maybe<00:02:07.469> we<00:02:07.649> would<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.890> see<00:02:08.129> a
