00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.270
 good guys this is the special 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.520
 questions that you asked us 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.500
 some answers to the questions already 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.540
 are official responses of rockstar and 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.279
 others by ourselves so 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:27.610
 let's start 1 when will go gta 5 will come out 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.920
 on September 17 around the world 2 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.260
 will go out for the next generation of 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.120
 consoles like the ps4 and xbox one and 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.770
 also in pc 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.050
 rockstar said he had not planned 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.210
 take it out for the next generation of 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.489
 consoles neither in pc since they put mods and 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.229
 they spoil their 'masterpieces' so 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:50.650
 it will only go out for ps3 and xbox360 3 will come out 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:52.089
 some game guide yes but you do not know 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.140
 if it will be in Mexico 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:59.050
 it is only known that it will come out in the USA 4 how much 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.989
 will cost each edition the standard edition 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.180
 it will leave 60 dollars the special edition 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.640
 will go 80 dollars and the edition 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.460
 collector will go 130 dollars 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.980
 obviously this varies by country 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.530
 where are you 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.950
 5 the clothes as well as shirts and pants 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.410
 will move with the air or when we run if 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.950
 that was already seen in gta 4 and in this it will be 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:26.100
 even better 6 you can enter all the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.760
 houses by the windows only in some 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.360
 houses but not in all 7 there will be rain or 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.840
 earthquakes rains and on earthquakes is not known 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.260
 nothing besides I do not think that happens that 8 in 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.810
 what year it will be set gta v will be 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.640
 set in our current year 2012 to 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.790
 2013 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.320
 9 there will be firefighters yes there will also be 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.540
 mechanical veterinary medical police 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.750
 10 you can invite your friends from the game 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.270
 to take bowling and those things if 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.990
 will have things that were in gta 4 and still 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.689
 more things 11 there will be tricks 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.429
 GTA is not without tricks gta if it 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.030
 There will be but not as many as in San 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.130
 andreas 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.140
 there will be less but more realistic like the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.260
 ammo life cars and they will get 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.110
 by cell 12 you will need 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.180
 gasoline for cars I do not think that 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.569
 rockstar put that since in no gta 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.840
 done that so I do not see it probable 13 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.060
 clothes become dirty or tear themselves the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.099
 dirt of the clothes will look much more 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.069
 between that is not removed by diaz x 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.670
 of 14 will return the cooperative mode 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.010
 offline as in is san andreas mode 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.489
 cooperative will only be online there will no longer be 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.610
 offline mode 15 characters will come out of 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.500
 others gta if you do not know but rockstar 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.560
 He said that if a character appears 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.540
 it will only be from the universe gta 4 without 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.430
 tell niko and román because everything 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.640
 depends on what you have chosen at the end 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.040
 of gta 4 in online mode will come out more 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.680
 in the collector's edition comes the 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.660
 pack with classic characters now 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.820
 you only know that you can use niko 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.620
 bellic in online mode but surely in 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.819
 the pack there will be many more 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.950
 16 will have the game in Spanish would not be 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.290
 practically impossible since rockstar 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.420
 he never doubles his games what he does know 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.900
 is that the subtitles will come in Spanish 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:28.019
 and Latin Spanish 17 may be 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.239
 customize weapons if that's already 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.489
 confirmed laser sights can be placed 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.940
 telescopes handles among others 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.890
 things and apparently you can paint 18 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.950
 will return cars with tuna and not be 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.170
 that can be customized if you 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.140
 They can customize as rims rims 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.120
 Glasses bodies also incorporated 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.010
 that you can customize the engine well 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.540
 like other things that can be done in 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.140
 one of the racing games of 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.650
 rockstar mitnick club los angeles 19 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.750
 You can take pictures from your cell phone and 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.989
 You can share them in the social club of 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.490
 rockstar 20 will improve driving 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.980
 the cars 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.620
 yes since in gta 4 it was a bit unstable 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.460
 in gta 5 it will be better almost as in 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:17.880
 racing games 21 a gameplay will come out 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.489
 of gta 5 if that rockstar has just 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.650
 say a few days ago although I do not know 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.950
 he knows when they took him out rockstar said that 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.250
 is already on the way 22 what kind of 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.130
 animals will come out like sharks 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.880
 leopards sheep and many more 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.760
 that in network dead redemption 23 may be 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.100
 kill animals if there will be many 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.760
 minigames and side missions about 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.520
 that 24 there will be missions like police 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.410
 firefighter and doctor has not said anything 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.540
 about that but I guess so, since 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.240
 in almost all the gta that has been done 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.370
 it is also said that franklin will be of 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.880
 two sides do gang missions and 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.490
 then others with the police 25 there will be 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.990
 gang wars about that has not been 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.640
 said nothing but in the trailer for 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.620
 franklin look at the serious trick 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.290
 against the fences why I say yes 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.470
 26 the missions will be through the 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.690
 phone will not be normally as in 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.169
 the other gta you have to go to some 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:23.080
 point to be able to do the 27 will have 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.330
 Hairdressers yes you will be able 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:30.400
 cut the hair less trevor because he 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:32.800
 it's half bald x of 28 there are gyms yes 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.169
 but you will not be able to put on more muscle 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.530
 rockstar claimed that that would be very fucked 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:41.800
 for the theme of textures 29 it 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.479
 You can put tattoos if you can see what 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.229
 both franklin and trevor have 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:50.320
 tattoos 30 franklin is possible son of 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:52.030
 carl johnson I do not think so but there are many 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.220
 doubts for example 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.530
 rockstar still did not say his last name and 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.330
 also in the trailer the sea ​​tells 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.240
 franklin that groove street is his legacy 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:05.350
 and this would refer to cj or his et but 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:08.199
 they are simply ideas 31 the gta v se 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.110
 can run on pc and if so what 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:12.990
 are the requirements 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.770
 gta 5 will not come out on PC and if it was 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:20.160
 would occupy is a super good computer 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:22.890
 32 will return brides no michael is 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.110
 married franklin is more interested in 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.080
 the money and supposedly also has 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.510
 girlfriend which was seen in trailer 2 and 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.520
 trevor is trevor x of good with that 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.950
 we finalized this video to thank you 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.930

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.000
