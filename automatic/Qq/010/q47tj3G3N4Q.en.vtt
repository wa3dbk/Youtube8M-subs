opening I will take you for a tour of
the<00:00:10.559> packaging<00:00:11.070> so<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.000> like<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.450> big<00:00:12.929> like

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
the packaging so it is like a big like

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.709 
the packaging so it is like a big like
stripy<00:00:13.650> package<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.549> guess<00:00:14.790> which<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.480> it's

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
stripy package I guess which is and it's

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.050 
stripy package I guess which is and it's
like<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> green<00:00:16.529> black<00:00:17.160> silver<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:17.850> white

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
like a green black silver and white

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.080 
like a green black silver and white
coloring<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:20.130> includes<00:00:20.460> two<00:00:20.640> characters

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
coloring and it includes two characters

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.790 
coloring and it includes two characters
a<00:00:21.180> collector<00:00:21.570> card<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.960> secret<00:00:22.260> code<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.769> i

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
a collector card and secret code and i

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.320 
a collector card and secret code and i
believe<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.250> collector<00:00:23.670> cars<00:00:23.850> are<00:00:24.090> like<00:00:24.300> a

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
believe the collector cars are like a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.870 
believe the collector cars are like a
different<00:00:24.689> formation<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.439> time<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.760> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
different formation this time so on the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.490 
different formation this time so on the
packaging<00:00:27.359> obviously<00:00:27.810> I'll<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.199> which

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
packaging obviously I'll have this which

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.810 
packaging obviously I'll have this which
I<00:00:28.590> cut<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.859> don't<00:00:29.070> want<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.279> take<00:00:29.429> off<00:00:29.609> because

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
I cut I don't want to take off because

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.849 
I cut I don't want to take off because
it'll<00:00:29.970> ruin<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.869> as<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.529> see<00:00:31.619> i<00:00:31.650> got

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
it from argos so on the packaging it has

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.280 
it from argos so on the packaging it has
zonkers<00:00:35.040> blinky<00:00:35.670> slurpee<00:00:36.329> Carter<00:00:36.809> Fitch<00:00:37.079> and
