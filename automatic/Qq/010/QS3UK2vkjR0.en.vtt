move<00:00:44.440> a<00:00:44.590> lot<00:00:44.739> of<00:00:44.800> air<00:00:45.930> also<00:00:46.930> so<00:00:47.500> so<00:00:47.890> really

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
move a lot of air also so so really

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.470 
move a lot of air also so so really
there<00:00:48.430> now<00:00:50.129> climate<00:00:51.129> controlled<00:00:51.760> environment

we decided that in order to handle the

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.420 
we decided that in order to handle the
waste<00:00:55.629> stream<00:00:56.079> that<00:00:56.110> we<00:00:56.469> handle<00:00:56.860> on<00:00:56.980> a<00:00:57.010> daily

waste stream that we handle on a daily
basis<00:00:57.850> we<00:00:58.059> had<00:00:58.239> to<00:00:58.360> do<00:00:58.510> it<00:00:58.660> in<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.960> most

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
basis we had to do it in the most

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.049 
basis we had to do it in the most
responsible<00:01:00.039> manner<00:01:00.309> possible

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
responsible manner possible

and<00:01:01.300> the<00:01:01.930> methane<00:01:02.289> digester<00:01:03.039> was<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.520> tool

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
and the methane digester was the tool

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.330 
and the methane digester was the tool
that's<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.420> best<00:01:04.660> that's<00:01:04.869> available<00:01:05.340> to

that's the best that's available to

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.880 
that's the best that's available to
