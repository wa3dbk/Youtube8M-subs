00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
fact it hasn't it just seems that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.190 
fact it hasn't it just seems that
parents<00:01:08.460> views<00:01:08.939> have<00:01:09.420> not<00:01:09.630> really<00:01:09.930> had<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
parents views have not really had the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.230 
parents views have not really had the
waiting<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.650> they<00:01:10.920> deserve<00:01:11.310> there<00:01:11.760> my

waiting that they deserve there my

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.359 
waiting that they deserve there my
recommendation<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.799> voice<00:01:14.070> of

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
because at the time that act was

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.720 
because at the time that act was
produced<00:02:39.380> there<00:02:39.650> weren't<00:02:40.250> such<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.430> thing<00:02:40.610> as

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
produced there weren't such a thing as

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.390 
produced there weren't such a thing as
music<00:02:41.060> videos<00:02:41.090> we<00:02:42.020> believe<00:02:42.320> that<00:02:43.070> they<00:02:43.370> should

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
music videos we believe that they should

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.270 
music videos we believe that they should
become<00:02:43.760> within<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:45.470> scope<00:02:45.710> of<00:02:45.890> that<00:02:46.070> act

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
become within that the scope of that act

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.390 
become within that the scope of that act
and<00:02:46.550> so<00:02:47.030> they<00:02:47.180> should<00:02:47.240> be<00:02:47.420> age<00:02:47.780> rated<00:02:48.440> what

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
and so they should be age rated what

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.790 
and so they should be age rated what
that<00:02:49.550> will<00:02:49.670> mean<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:50.150> not<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.750> huge<00:02:51.290> number<00:02:51.380> of

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
that will mean is not a huge number of

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.620 
that will mean is not a huge number of
changes<00:02:52.220> for<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.760> number<00:02:53.240> of<00:02:53.270> videos<00:02:53.450> that

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
changes for the number of videos that

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.240 
changes for the number of videos that
are<00:02:53.960> bored<00:02:54.170> because<00:02:54.710> actually<00:02:55.100> they're

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
are bored because actually they're

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.310 
are bored because actually they're
relatively<00:02:55.640> small<00:02:55.760> but<00:02:56.570> we<00:02:56.690> think<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:56.990> sends<00:02:57.170> a

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
relatively small but we think it sends a

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.870 
relatively small but we think it sends a
very<00:02:57.350> very<00:02:57.920> clear<00:02:58.280> signal<00:02:58.610> out<00:02:58.850> to

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
very very clear signal out to

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.210 
very very clear signal out to
broadcasters<00:02:59.810> in<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.020> industry<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:01.010> says

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
broadcasters in the industry that says

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.420 
broadcasters in the industry that says
we<00:03:01.940> don't<00:03:02.090> really<00:03:02.360> accept<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:03.530> very

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
we don't really accept that very

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.780 
we don't really accept that very

of<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.760> things<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:14.090> became<00:03:14.210> very<00:03:14.360> clear<00:03:14.660> was

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
of the things that became very clear was

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.020 
of the things that became very clear was
that<00:03:15.170> actually<00:03:15.590> we<00:03:15.800> all<00:03:16.010> live<00:03:16.370> in<00:03:16.610> a<00:03:16.790> very

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
that actually we all live in a very

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.810 
that actually we all live in a very
sexualized<00:03:17.660> environment<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.530> don't<00:03:19.310> know<00:03:19.640> why

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
sexualized environment I don't know why

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.520 
sexualized environment I don't know why
that's<00:03:20.090> happened<00:03:20.450> but<00:03:20.600> it<00:03:20.690> just<00:03:20.930> simply<00:03:21.350> has

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
that's happened but it just simply has

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.010 
that's happened but it just simply has
and<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:22.760> affects<00:03:23.240> all<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:23.480> us<00:03:23.660> whether<00:03:23.810> we're

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
and it affects all of us whether we're

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.350 
and it affects all of us whether we're
adults<00:03:24.530> or<00:03:24.680> children<00:03:24.710> and<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.850> point<00:03:26.090> is<00:03:26.210> we

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
adults or children and the point is we

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.390 
adults or children and the point is we
barely<00:03:26.660> notice<00:03:27.170> anymore<00:03:27.590> it's<00:03:27.740> almost<00:03:28.100> become

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
barely notice anymore it's almost become

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.730 
barely notice anymore it's almost become
like<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.730> wallpaper<00:03:29.180> of<00:03:29.330> our<00:03:29.480> lives<00:03:29.750> but<00:03:30.590> it

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
like the wallpaper of our lives but it

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.430 
like the wallpaper of our lives but it
is<00:03:30.860> a<00:03:30.890> slow<00:03:31.400> drift<00:03:31.850> if<00:03:32.240> you<00:03:32.360> like<00:03:32.570> into<00:03:33.080> a<00:03:33.110> much

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
is a slow drift if you like into a much

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.830 
is a slow drift if you like into a much
