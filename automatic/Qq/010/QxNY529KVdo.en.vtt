00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.580
 it's everybody's audrey then 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.270
 today I'm doing my review on 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.290
 my lipstick from nar so I 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.470
 have three here they are just sumptuous 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:31.550
 as well as each other 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:35.550
 creamy it's just perfect 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:39.780
 it's for me the lipsticks 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.960
 looks very upscale because 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.830
 that we listen anyway 30 euros each 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.339
 for me it's the lipsticks 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.559
 high-end the best pigmented 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.699
 the most comfortable so for you 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.610
 talk about packaging 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.430
 the packaging is just a marvel 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.559
 because they are finally metallized 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.140
 metallized they are 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.460
 yeah it's a bit plastic 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.119
 metallized I do not know how you 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.729
 explain they are magnetized then that 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.450
 it's just at the top 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:19.140
 these are lipsticks they 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:22.109
 do some normal 1.2 g that's it 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.140
 so they are super bowls that besides they 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:28.320
 have narrated written the cinor and engrave 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.750
 directly on the lipstick and in 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.100
 did it was written a weapon 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.579
 that's all around and if we put them side by side 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.240
 beside 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.969
 so if you have 4 if you put them 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.710
 side by side low it is written you have 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.280
 outright the logo that passed that goes 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.960
 appear 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:57.200
 I show you to e3 so I would have 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.200
 what is narre 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.680
 and in fact it's a 4th america zone 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:08.240
 you will see that side appear next 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:11.350
 so I think it's super well thought out here 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.540
 it's detail but but now 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.890
 it's so well spent so his 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.720
 packagings are just wonders 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.400
 because in addition they are magnetized so 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.120
 it can not be removed like that in 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.360
 your bag 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.190
 finally here they are just perfect the 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.810
 colors are all beautiful 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.450
 I have three because it takes when 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.760
 even 30 euros each so enjoy it 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.890
 when you have 20% promo codes 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.640
 or 25% in these fakes for you in 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.850
 take at least one 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.250
 if you hesitate and that also makes you 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.900
 too expensive because that's it's just 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.690
 a killing in lipstick so the atom 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.180
 that I wear is the hue angela I 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.700
 had them with my voucher of 30 euros at 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.360
 sephora for - birthday so I have 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.010
 took it because it was at least 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.570
 well three four months that was in 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.680
 my cart 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.940
 so I love as soon as a thing that is 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.060
 see my voucher to be able to buy it 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.800
 so here it is just beautiful 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.120
 I'm going to zoom you in on 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.540
 lips and at the same time do you and 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:21.670
 pictures of the lipstick that's with the 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.670
 red r next to it is too beautiful 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.030
 then we will go to the hue 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:42.459
 next so those reached alta 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.079
 this is a very very very beautiful 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:50.379
 colors 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:53.409
 I show you is like this and like that 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.430
 so it's a nude beige rose that is 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.579
 really beautiful 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.400
 I'm going to apply myself on the lips 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:17.789
 so here's the hue anita I make you 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:21.910
 a zoom too and we end up 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:24.310
 raquel attack so this is the first 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.419
 that I bought myself because that's it 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.910
 I flashed on this perfect nude I think 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.810
 it's the perfect world so I'm doing you 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.810
 a zoom too 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.850
 so that's my review of 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:59.320
 audacious lipstick of nars that are 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:01.780
 just superbly pigmented of the very 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.410
 very good quality very comfortable 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:09.820
 this is just me I think the 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:13.210
 30 euros good is very expensive but they 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.280
 the worth they are worth because they 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.080
 are largely at the height of the big 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.300
 brands like chanel dior yves saint 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.600
 laurent and all are largely at the 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.030
 height and they are at the top so 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.160
 frankly I advise you one 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.800
 million times it's red to 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.640
 just and south lips of sublime and 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.690
 frankly i love i love i love 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:40.230
 so that's my review of 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:43.450
 audacious lipstick from the arz so 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.190
 I hope you enjoyed this review 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.390

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:51.910

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.660

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:00.400

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:03.090
 its purple pink tones and tell me everything 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.380
 all in comment so that I can 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.480
 buy me a fourth 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.150

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.240

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.370
