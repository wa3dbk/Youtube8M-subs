00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.350 
normal so I wonder why when people put
on<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> mouth<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:27.240> they're

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
on like the mouth because they're

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.120 
on like the mouth because they're
worried<00:01:27.479> about<00:01:27.570> disease<00:01:28.020> nobody's<00:01:28.860> rock<00:01:28.979> oh

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
worried about disease nobody's rock oh

worried about disease nobody's rock oh
they<00:01:29.310> look<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.610> much<00:01:29.700> sexier<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.329> it

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
they look so much sexier because it

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.910 
they look so much sexier because it
takes<00:01:30.540> away<00:01:30.750> all<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.140> asymmetry<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.770> this

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
takes away all the asymmetry of this

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.219 
takes away all the asymmetry of this
area<00:01:32.159> but<00:01:32.850> maybe<00:01:33.030> people<00:01:33.420> find<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.990> lips

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229

them the eye contact helps us make

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.929 
them the eye contact helps us make
judgments<00:02:04.950> about<00:02:05.009> someone's<00:02:05.460> intelligence

confidence and sincerity and sunglasses

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.070 
confidence and sincerity and sunglasses
keep<00:02:07.799> us<00:02:07.950> literally<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.690> dark<00:02:09.720> about

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
keep us literally in the dark about

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.050 
keep us literally in the dark about
forming<00:02:10.530> these<00:02:10.619> perceptions<00:02:11.220> about<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.430> person

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
forming these perceptions about a person

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.850 
forming these perceptions about a person
and<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.300> works<00:02:12.450> both<00:02:12.720> ways<00:02:13.080> because<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.500> wear

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
and it works both ways because the wear

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.070 
and it works both ways because the wear
of<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.250> sunglasses<00:02:14.760> feels<00:02:15.060> more<00:02:15.300> inscrutable

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
of the sunglasses feels more inscrutable

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.440 
of the sunglasses feels more inscrutable
as<00:02:16.470> well<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.910> this<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.090> really<00:02:18.300> interesting

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
as well so this is really interesting

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.479 
as well so this is really interesting
too<00:02:18.810> because<00:02:18.840> we<00:02:19.170> don't<00:02:19.349> realize<00:02:19.530> how<00:02:19.709> much<00:02:20.280> we

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
too because we don't realize how much we

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.430 
too because we don't realize how much we
communicate<00:02:20.940> with<00:02:21.030> our<00:02:21.090> eyes<00:02:21.330> see<00:02:21.870> I'm<00:02:21.989> not<00:02:22.410> a

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
communicate with our eyes see I'm not a

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.620 
communicate with our eyes see I'm not a
very<00:02:22.680> subtle<00:02:22.890> person<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.459> immediately<00:02:24.330> my

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
very subtle person so immediately my

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.900 
very subtle person so immediately my
emotions<00:02:25.170> come<00:02:25.470> through<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:26.430> mean<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.730> can

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
emotions come through you mean you can

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.339 
emotions come through you mean you can
you<00:02:27.090> can<00:02:27.270> speak<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:27.690> back<00:02:27.989> like<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.319> know

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349
