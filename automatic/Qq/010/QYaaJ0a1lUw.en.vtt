00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.530 

okay<00:00:01.319> right<00:00:01.740> after<00:00:01.949> I<00:00:02.190> made<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.790> last<00:00:03.060> video<00:00:03.360> I

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
okay right after I made the last video I

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.470 
okay right after I made the last video I
just<00:00:03.810> thought<00:00:04.020> of<00:00:04.170> something<00:00:05.359> when<00:00:06.359> I

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
just thought of something when I

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.589 
just thought of something when I
described<00:00:07.170> how<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.410> make<00:00:07.680> this<00:00:07.830> turn<00:00:08.780> it<00:00:09.780> works

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
described how to make this turn it works

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.790 
described how to make this turn it works
for<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:12.900> way<00:00:14.210> because<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:16.379> one<00:00:16.560> here

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
for this way because the this one here

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.189 
for this way because the this one here
pushes<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.310> onto<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:17.850> source<00:00:18.210> block<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.810> so

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
pushes it onto this source block and so

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.620 
pushes it onto this source block and so
if<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:20.010> sauce<00:00:20.250> block<00:00:20.580> moves<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.600> that

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
if this sauce block moves in that

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.650 
if this sauce block moves in that
direction<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.380> will<00:00:22.439> still<00:00:22.769> work<00:00:22.920> but

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
direction this will still work but

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.810 
direction this will still work but
obviously<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.930> one<00:00:25.199> can't<00:00:25.920> flow<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.550> way

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
obviously this one can't flow this way

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.599 
obviously this one can't flow this way
because<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.660> does<00:00:27.900> then<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.039> water<00:00:29.220> here

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
because if it does then the water here

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.450 
because if it does then the water here
would<00:00:29.820> interfere<00:00:30.090> with<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.480> water<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:31.019> I

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
would interfere with the water here I

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.620 
would interfere with the water here I
mean<00:00:32.460> although<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:32.880> just<00:00:33.059> reverse<00:00:33.210> this

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
mean although you can just reverse this

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.229 
mean although you can just reverse this
right<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.469> dig<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:35.760> six<00:00:36.000> blocks

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
right you can just dig the six blocks

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.990 
right you can just dig the six blocks
there<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.620> then<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:38.070> would<00:00:38.250> be<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.700> that

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
there so then that would be in that

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.959 
there so then that would be in that
other<00:00:39.239> direction<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.989> then<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.260> can<00:00:40.670> do<00:00:41.670> this

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
other direction and then you can do this

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.520 
other direction and then you can do this
on<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> end<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.200> then<00:00:43.350> they'll

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
on to the end of that and then they'll

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.000 
on to the end of that and then they'll
go<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.460> way<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.480> do<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.649> but

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
go that way so you can do that but

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.119 
go that way so you can do that but
there's<00:00:47.219> another<00:00:47.460> way<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> make<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.210> turn<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
there's another way to make it turn and

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.369 
there's another way to make it turn and
I've<00:00:50.129> extended<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:51.030> there<00:00:51.300> which<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:51.899> too

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
I've extended out there which is too

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.510 
I've extended out there which is too
well<00:00:52.890> do<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.890> let's<00:00:56.100> say<00:00:56.219> i'll<00:00:56.309> take<00:00:56.489> that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
well do it so let's say i'll take that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.900 
well do it so let's say i'll take that
out<00:00:58.309> now<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.370> mess<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.820> up<00:01:00.440> whoops<00:01:01.910> okay

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
out now that mess that up whoops okay

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:11.359 
out now that mess that up whoops okay
well<00:01:05.479> kill<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.900> moment<00:01:07.790> we<00:01:10.340> dig<00:01:11.340> a

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
well kill that for the moment we dig a

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.130 
well kill that for the moment we dig a
hole<00:01:11.580> here<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:13.619> we<00:01:14.280> drop<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.939> water<00:01:15.180> here<00:01:15.689> or

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
hole here and we drop the water here or

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.120 
hole here and we drop the water here or
fluently<00:01:16.650> here<00:01:16.890> right<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.750> one<00:01:19.560> two<00:01:19.740> three

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
fluently here right so one two three

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:34.090 
fluently here right so one two three
four<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:22.729> then<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:25.409> six<00:01:25.680> blocks<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:32.299> then

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
four and then the six blocks and then

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.350 
four and then the six blocks and then
this<00:01:35.100> three<00:01:35.909> there<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.820> then<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.060> fill<00:01:39.329> it

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
this three there and then we fill it

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
this three there and then we fill it
fill<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.079> from<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> back<00:01:40.579> to<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.610> front<00:01:42.140> as<00:01:43.140> we

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
fill it from the back to the front as we

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.600 
fill it from the back to the front as we
did<00:01:43.560> earlier

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.750 

let's<00:01:48.610> see<00:01:51.150> that's<00:01:52.150> no<00:01:52.420> good<00:01:52.630> because<00:01:53.490> oops<00:01:54.490> I

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
let's see that's no good because oops I

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.780 
let's see that's no good because oops I
didn't<00:01:55.150> mean<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.270> do<00:01:55.420> that<00:01:59.250> you<00:02:00.250> guys<00:02:00.460> try<00:02:00.670> that

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
didn't mean to do that you guys try that

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.640 
didn't mean to do that you guys try that
again<00:02:02.550> that<00:02:03.550> goes<00:02:03.910> there<00:02:03.940> I<00:02:04.479> think<00:02:04.869> this

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
again that goes there I think this

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:16.830 
again that goes there I think this
matter<00:02:06.660> let's<00:02:07.660> try<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:07.869> again<00:02:10.440> 93<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:15.840> would

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
matter let's try that again 93 I would

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.060 
matter let's try that again 93 I would
need<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:19.140> do<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.440> as<00:02:20.680> well<00:02:20.709> because

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
need to do that as well because

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.340 
need to do that as well because
otherwise<00:02:22.920> we'll<00:02:23.920> push<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.400> blocks<00:02:24.640> off<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
otherwise we'll push the blocks off the

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.940 
otherwise we'll push the blocks off the
conveyor<00:02:27.870> okay<00:02:28.870> let<00:02:29.170> me<00:02:29.260> get<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.560> water<00:02:30.180> and

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
conveyor okay let me get the water and

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.630 
conveyor okay let me get the water and
the<00:02:32.950> sequence<00:02:34.890> for<00:02:35.890> putting<00:02:36.130> on<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.310> water<00:02:36.459> is

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
the sequence for putting on the water is

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.670 
the sequence for putting on the water is
critical<00:02:36.880> otherwise<00:02:37.600> it<00:02:37.780> won't<00:02:37.930> go<00:02:38.290> in<00:02:38.320> the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
critical otherwise it won't go in the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:49.390 
critical otherwise it won't go in the
direction<00:02:38.800> you<00:02:39.070> want<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:42.270> so<00:02:43.270> that<00:02:44.020> there

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.220 

that<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.670> can't<00:02:51.480> make<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.690> go<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.990> other<00:02:52.050> way

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
that I can't make it go the other way

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.790 
that I can't make it go the other way
that<00:02:52.860> might<00:02:53.040> be<00:02:53.160> easier<00:02:54.410> but<00:02:55.410> will<00:02:55.590> do<00:02:55.680> this

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
that might be easier but will do this

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:12.310 
that might be easier but will do this
for<00:02:55.860> now<00:03:02.360> there<00:03:03.360> we<00:03:03.450> go<00:03:05.240> so<00:03:06.240> now<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:08.430> items

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.960 

okay<00:03:13.320> so<00:03:13.380> as<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.830> saw<00:03:14.130> earlier<00:03:14.340> it's<00:03:14.730> very

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
okay so as you saw earlier it's very

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:22.040 
okay so as you saw earlier it's very
important<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:18.320> be<00:03:19.320> exact<00:03:20.360> you<00:03:21.360> know<00:03:21.450> if<00:03:21.810> you

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
important to be exact you know if you

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.510 
important to be exact you know if you
place<00:03:22.290> an<00:03:22.470> extra<00:03:22.740> block<00:03:22.950> in<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.130> wrong<00:03:23.280> place

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
place an extra block in the wrong place

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.260 
place an extra block in the wrong place
then<00:03:23.760> they'll<00:03:23.880> mess<00:03:24.060> up<00:03:24.240> the<00:03:24.330> whole<00:03:24.420> thing

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
then they'll mess up the whole thing

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:41.440 
then they'll mess up the whole thing
there<00:03:27.270> we<00:03:27.330> go<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:27.720> now<00:03:27.750> put<00:03:30.080> this<00:03:31.080> back<00:03:33.350> here

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:52.920 

and<00:03:42.450> we'll<00:03:42.600> get<00:03:42.750> some<00:03:42.900> water

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:00.059 

fill<00:03:53.829> that<00:03:58.019> and<00:03:59.019> there<00:03:59.170> you<00:03:59.230> go<00:03:59.379> we've<00:03:59.709> made<00:03:59.890> it

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
fill that and there you go we've made it

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.819 
fill that and there you go we've made it
to<00:04:00.099> in<00:04:00.280> a<00:04:00.370> corner<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.810> we<00:04:01.959> can<00:04:02.109> continue<00:04:02.290> from

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
to in a corner and we can continue from

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.339 
to in a corner and we can continue from
this<00:04:02.980> point<00:04:03.040> onwards<00:04:03.640> if<00:04:04.629> that<00:04:04.870> stuff<00:04:05.140> wasn't

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
this point onwards if that stuff wasn't

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:26.010 
this point onwards if that stuff wasn't
in<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.650> way<00:04:10.109> let's<00:04:11.109> drop<00:04:11.319> some<00:04:11.379> stuff<00:04:11.650> in

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:33.280 

that's<00:04:27.020> good<00:04:27.320> that's<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:28.700> same<00:04:28.940> as<00:04:28.970> before<00:04:32.290> we

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
that's good that's the same as before we

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.350 
that's good that's the same as before we
had<00:04:33.410> speed<00:04:33.770> us<00:04:33.890> up<00:04:36.970> actually<00:04:37.970> I<00:04:38.030> shouldn't

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
had speed us up actually I shouldn't

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.970 
had speed us up actually I shouldn't
have<00:04:38.420> dropped<00:04:38.570> it<00:04:38.750> there<00:04:38.780> because<00:04:39.140> wouldn't

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
have dropped it there because wouldn't

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.650 
have dropped it there because wouldn't
be<00:04:40.130> there<00:04:40.450> you<00:04:41.450> will<00:04:41.570> start<00:04:41.930> from<00:04:42.470> there

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
be there you will start from there

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.710 
be there you will start from there
anyway<00:04:47.440> it<00:04:48.440> turns<00:04:48.710> I<00:04:49.070> shall<00:04:49.670> we<00:04:49.790> we<00:04:50.300> don't<00:04:50.480> need

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
anyway it turns I shall we we don't need

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.130 
anyway it turns I shall we we don't need
that<00:04:50.900> do<00:04:51.140> it<00:04:51.290> because<00:04:52.330> it<00:04:53.330> drops<00:04:53.660> it<00:04:53.810> on<00:04:53.900> this

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
that do it because it drops it on this

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.830 
that do it because it drops it on this
edge<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:54.770> so<00:04:55.550> it<00:04:55.700> would<00:04:55.910> never<00:04:56.090> be<00:04:56.210> on<00:04:56.360> that

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
edge and so it would never be on that

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.290 
edge and so it would never be on that
edge<00:04:57.080> its<00:04:57.920> own<00:04:58.070> if<00:04:58.190> it's<00:04:58.340> on<00:04:58.460> that<00:04:58.670> edge<00:04:58.910> there

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
edge its own if it's on that edge there

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.660 
edge its own if it's on that edge there
that<00:05:00.050> it<00:05:00.140> will<00:05:00.260> fall<00:05:00.500> off<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:00.770> conveyor<00:05:01.130> if

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
that it will fall off the conveyor if

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.800 
that it will fall off the conveyor if
it's<00:05:01.820> under<00:05:01.940> sergio<00:05:03.130> come<00:05:04.130> this<00:05:04.280> way<00:05:04.490> quite

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
it's under sergio come this way quite

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.430 
it's under sergio come this way quite
efficiently<00:05:05.810> Oh<00:05:06.670> in<00:05:07.670> any<00:05:07.850> case<00:05:08.110> we've<00:05:09.110> made<00:05:09.320> it

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
efficiently Oh in any case we've made it

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.960 
efficiently Oh in any case we've made it
turn<00:05:09.650> 90<00:05:09.950> degrees<00:05:12.400> so<00:05:13.400> yeah<00:05:13.550> it<00:05:13.670> doesn't<00:05:13.790> have

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
turn 90 degrees so yeah it doesn't have

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.730 
turn 90 degrees so yeah it doesn't have
to<00:05:14.090> be<00:05:14.120> a<00:05:14.270> straight<00:05:14.540> line<00:05:14.720> again<00:05:15.080> going<00:05:15.320> that

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
to be a straight line again going that

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.820 
to be a straight line again going that
any<00:05:15.980> direction<00:05:16.310> you<00:05:16.520> wanted<00:05:16.820> to<00:05:17.410> just<00:05:18.410> takes<00:05:18.740> a

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
any direction you wanted to just takes a

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.910 
any direction you wanted to just takes a
little<00:05:18.980> more<00:05:20.200> thinking<00:05:21.200> and<00:05:21.440> more<00:05:22.240> building

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
little more thinking and more building

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.790 
little more thinking and more building
alright<00:05:24.920> see<00:05:25.670> you<00:05:25.760> later
