 click on win server 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.510
 we wait while servers are loaded 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.560
 ok well, let's 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:07.490
 which server so 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:10.060
 Stefan let's write this 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.410
 game mod that is installed on the server 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:18.850
 dirt is our standard up 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:22.330
 it is with us that mr without match t 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.590
 you know all this construction 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.980
 nation the construction building 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.980
 let's 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.040
 10 to 10 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.000
 let's go now 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.380
 now they will lose the round 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.319
 also besides the mod usual up to 6000 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.659
 standard 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.390
 my sector can be set and 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.000
 to 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.810
 still can 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.209
 and some cards 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.970
 which is downloaded at boot time 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.490
 server 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.770
 for example, such a card is probably 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:10.000
 terrorists here ares 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.090

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.030
 day lying around 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.810

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:23.490
 medicare you somehow much more play 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.490
 clean in this rectangle 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.200
 so on our three against 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.960
 by the way this block 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.560
 gives life like 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.640
 life and 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.450
 gives dollars to uncle 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.849
 due to which you can build 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.849
 but won now I will appear on the game 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.640
