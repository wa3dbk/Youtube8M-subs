00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 all good and welcome this new one 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.589
 videos are the super team's leo and today 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.440
 we are on fifa 15 and I want to show one 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.070
 geek though to get packages 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.180
 free at will as many as you want 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:22.529
 then every now and then there is often a 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.050
 special tournament every tv period from 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.789
 always a different package you 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.920
 completed will give you the package and it 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.640
 gives flight unpacked then 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.040
 later it will tell you that 3,500 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.610
 credits no more package then you 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.239
 what do you do I just completed it do 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.530
 yes you re completed in simulation 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.570
 you do simulation first then 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.700
 when you are in the last game we will see 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.460
 now I vitalize the whole piece in which 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.110
 I make matches there now in this one 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.449
 what had this tournament requirements? 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.379
 but usually has no requirements 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.760
 here there was from 80 to 100 of understanding but oh well 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.470
 it's not a problem 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.570
 you must have an average team because 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.210
 a beginner beginner that 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.130
 just after but a team from 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.470
 centoni for instance 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.930
 then you will get this message with 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.040
 written congratulations to the team won 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.229
 of the year cup 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.360
 or another cup if it is a turin 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.350
 because it applies to all the tournaments in which vi 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.009
 give a package we are here to tell the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.890
 vip 3,500 succeed but remove the 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.579
 chronology that it is apple samsung that 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.490

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.810

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.250
 disgust 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.329
 that is, I could no longer enter it later 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.420
