Tomic<00:01:20.580> industries<00:01:21.090> realizes<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.720> and

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
Tomic industries realizes that and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.450 
Tomic industries realizes that and
that's<00:01:22.200> why<00:01:22.350> they<00:01:22.500> decided<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.040> release<00:01:23.280> this

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
that's why they decided to release this

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.300 
that's why they decided to release this
composite<00:01:23.909> style<00:01:24.360> case<00:01:24.600> that's<00:01:25.229> only<00:01:25.439> partial

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
composite style case that's only partial

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.660 
composite style case that's only partial
aluminum<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.990> three<00:01:28.320> section<00:01:28.979> piece<00:01:29.280> hair

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
aluminum so the three section piece hair

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.390 
aluminum so the three section piece hair
is<00:01:29.880> made<00:01:30.450> from<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.780> composite<00:01:31.439> material<00:01:31.470> that's

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
is made from a composite material that's

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.050 
is made from a composite material that's
composed<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.909> delrin<00:01:33.840> carbon<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.770> graphite

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
composed of delrin carbon and graphite

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.340 
composed of delrin carbon and graphite
and<00:01:36.060> then<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> other<00:01:36.509> piece<00:01:36.810> which<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
and then the other piece which is the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.469 
and then the other piece which is the
right<00:01:37.470> side<00:01:37.740> if<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.009> turn<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.460> way<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.880> made

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
right side if I turn it this way is made

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.539 
right side if I turn it this way is made
of<00:01:40.490> 6061<00:01:41.570> aluminum<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:43.110> weighs<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.649> at<00:01:43.770> only<00:01:43.950> 15

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
of 6061 aluminum it weighs in at only 15

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.819 
of 6061 aluminum it weighs in at only 15
grams<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.450> case<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.960> very<00:01:46.380> light

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
grams so this case is a very light

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.740 
grams so this case is a very light
inside<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> packaging<00:01:48.329> you're<00:01:48.479> going<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.659> get

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
inside the packaging you're going to get

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.020 
inside the packaging you're going to get
the<00:01:48.899> case<00:01:49.110> itself<00:01:49.500> obviously<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.850> uses

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the case itself obviously and it uses

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.499 
the case itself obviously and it uses
for<00:01:51.540> Allen<00:01:52.079> style<00:01:52.610> screws<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.939> lock<00:01:54.119> itself

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
for Allen style screws to lock itself

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.090 
for Allen style screws to lock itself
together<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:55.079> can<00:01:55.229> see<00:01:55.409> two<00:01:55.619> down<00:01:55.799> there<00:01:56.009> at

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
together you can see two down there at

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.819 
together you can see two down there at
the<00:01:56.159> bottom<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.700> then<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.049> up<00:01:58.290> there<00:01:58.680> at

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
the bottom and then to the up there at

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
into the left section the section that

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.550 
into the left section the section that
has<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.790> three<00:03:00.090> covered<00:03:00.450> pieces<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.050> then

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
has the three covered pieces and then

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.170 
has the three covered pieces and then
take<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.980> right<00:03:02.160> piece<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.730> just<00:03:02.850> lay<00:03:03.060> it

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
take the right piece and just lay it

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.540 
take the right piece and just lay it
over<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.660> side<00:03:03.840> like<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:04.500> then<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.430> obviously

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
over the side like so then you obviously

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.760 
over the side like so then you obviously
have<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:05.970> proceed<00:03:06.240> to<00:03:06.450> screw<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.200> screws<00:03:07.740> back
