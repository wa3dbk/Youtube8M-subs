hi<00:00:01.829> there<00:00:02.159> i<00:00:02.429> am<00:00:02.879> TP<00:00:03.419> 8000<00:00:03.990> CFE<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:05.690> today<00:00:06.690> I'm

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
hi there i am TP 8000 CFE and today I'm

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.520 
hi there i am TP 8000 CFE and today I'm
going<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.259> address<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:08.220> very<00:00:09.260> important<00:00:10.260> and

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
going to address a very important and

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.860 
going to address a very important and
very<00:00:10.740> interesting<00:00:11.639> constraints<00:00:12.450> which

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
very interesting constraints which

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.630 
very interesting constraints which
blender<00:00:13.380> has<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.830> offer<00:00:14.210> and<00:00:15.350> I<00:00:16.350> am<00:00:16.830> sorry<00:00:17.279> it

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
blender has to offer and I am sorry it

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.140 
blender has to offer and I am sorry it
is<00:00:17.670> not<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.480> script<00:00:19.170> constraint<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:20.789> script

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
is not the script constraint the script

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.259 
is not the script constraint the script
constraints<00:00:22.609> first<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.789> all<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:23.939> don't<00:00:24.180> know

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
constraints first of all I don't know

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.970 
constraints first of all I don't know
that<00:00:24.449> yeah<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.080> don't<00:00:25.260> know<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.560> first<00:00:25.769> thing

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
that yeah I don't know the first thing

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.700 
that yeah I don't know the first thing
about<00:00:26.689> Python<00:00:29.269> but<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:31.560> as

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
about Python but it's just as

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.090 
about Python but it's just as
interesting<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.700> action<00:00:33.239> constraint

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
interesting it's the action constraint

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.670 
interesting it's the action constraint
now<00:00:35.100> if<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.520> know<00:00:35.760> blender<00:00:36.480> has<00:00:36.660> had<00:00:37.050> several

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
now if you know blender has had several

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.639 
now if you know blender has had several
improvements<00:00:38.870> especially<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
improvements especially on the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.619 
improvements especially on the
constraint<00:00:41.160> system<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.360> cloth

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
constraint system and the cloth

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.459 
constraint system and the cloth
simulator<00:00:43.590> which<00:00:43.829> i<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.100> yet<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:45.230> well<00:00:46.230> I've

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
simulator which i have yet to well I've

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.010 
simulator which i have yet to well I've
tampered<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.879> haven't<00:00:48.149> really

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
tampered with it but I haven't really

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.700 
tampered with it but I haven't really
mastered<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:50.000> but<00:00:51.000> as<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:52.050> know<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.410> older

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
mastered it but as you know the older

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.740 
mastered it but as you know the older
versions<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.160> blender<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.699> could<00:00:53.940> only<00:00:54.180> drive

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
versions of blender you could only drive

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.069 
versions of blender you could only drive
an<00:00:54.989> action<00:00:55.379> constraint<00:00:55.860> by<00:00:56.190> rotation<00:00:57.090> well

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
an action constraint by rotation well

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.040 
an action constraint by rotation well
now<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.829> can<00:00:58.859> drive<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.190> by<00:00:59.430> scaling<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
now you can drive it by scaling the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.579 
now you can drive it by scaling the
target<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.800> moving<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.910> targets<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.930> size

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
target and moving the targets so size

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.679 
target and moving the targets so size
and<00:01:04.979> location<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:07.040> basically<00:01:08.040> I'm<00:01:08.820> going<00:01:09.630> to

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
and location and basically I'm going to

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.200 
and location and basically I'm going to
go<00:01:09.810> through<00:01:10.110> how<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.210> make<00:01:12.210> an<00:01:12.510> action<00:01:13.290> how<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
go through how to make an action how to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.810 
go through how to make an action how to
setup<00:01:15.210> an<00:01:15.509> action<00:01:15.840> constraint<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.610> I'm<00:01:17.610> going

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
setup an action constraint and I'm going

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.149 
setup an action constraint and I'm going
to<00:01:17.880> show<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.180> how<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.450> drive<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.930> by<00:01:19.110> all<00:01:19.350> three

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
to show you how to drive it by all three

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.780 
to show you how to drive it by all three
methods<00:01:20.570> rotation<00:01:21.570> location<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.560> scale<00:01:22.830> so

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
methods rotation location and scale so

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.520 
methods rotation location and scale so
I'm<00:01:23.909> going<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> open<00:01:24.479> up<00:01:24.689> blender<00:01:27.439> open<00:01:28.439> up

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
I'm going to open up blender open up

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.020 
I'm going to open up blender open up
blender<00:01:29.119> thank<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.360> gosh<00:01:34.820> just<00:01:35.820> going<00:01:35.970> to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
blender thank you gosh just going to

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.030 
blender thank you gosh just going to
start<00:01:36.240> with<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.390> default<00:01:36.869> scene<00:01:37.170> going<00:01:37.799> to

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
start with a default scene going to

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.289 
start with a default scene going to
delete<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.579> cube<00:01:39.829> go<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.890> front<00:01:41.159> view<00:01:41.400> shift<00:01:42.000> C

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
delete the cube go to front view shift C

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.999 
delete the cube go to front view shift C
to<00:01:42.600> make<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.369> cursor<00:01:44.369> at<00:01:44.549> 0-0<00:01:45.439> c4<00:01:46.439> center<00:01:46.829> I'm

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
to make the cursor at 0-0 c4 center I'm

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.719 
to make the cursor at 0-0 c4 center I'm
going<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.700> add<00:01:47.880> my<00:01:48.180> armature<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:50.369> reason

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
going to add my armature and the reason

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.889 
going to add my armature and the reason
I'm<00:01:50.880> using<00:01:51.090> armatures<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.200> because<00:01:52.729> I<00:01:53.899> think

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
I'm using armatures is because I think

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.580 
I'm using armatures is because I think
action<00:01:55.829> constraints<00:01:56.369> only<00:01:56.640> apply<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:56.969> bones

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
action constraints only apply to bones

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.219 
action constraints only apply to bones
for<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.740> reason<00:01:59.009> when<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.850> key<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.390> bones

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
for this reason when you key a bones

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.850 
for this reason when you key a bones
scale<00:02:02.009> rotation<00:02:02.670> or<00:02:03.060> location<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.079> stored

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
scale rotation or location it is stored

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.809 
scale rotation or location it is stored
in<00:02:05.100> actions<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.390> information<00:02:07.079> for<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.819> well

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
in actions the information for that well

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.210 
in actions the information for that well
the<00:02:09.509> information<00:02:10.170> for<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.649> stored<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.099> an

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
the information for that is stored in an

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.170 
the information for that is stored in an
action

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
action

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.420 
action
which<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.390> why<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.630> believe<00:02:13.990> it<00:02:14.320> only<00:02:14.500> applies

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
which is why I believe it only applies

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:23.790 
which is why I believe it only applies
for<00:02:15.850> bones<00:02:16.890> go<00:02:17.890> into<00:02:18.130> edit<00:02:18.280> mode<00:02:22.170> just<00:02:23.170> make

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
for bones go into edit mode just make

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.350 
for bones go into edit mode just make
something<00:02:24.040> very<00:02:24.190> simple<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:26.910> your<00:02:27.910> action

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
something very simple and your action

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.080 
something very simple and your action
can<00:02:28.510> be<00:02:28.540> whatever<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:29.020> want<00:02:29.700> now<00:02:30.700> if<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:30.910> know

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
can be whatever you want now if you know

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.080 
can be whatever you want now if you know
what<00:02:31.570> an<00:02:31.750> action<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.500> it's<00:02:32.890> basically<00:02:33.310> blender

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
what an action is it's basically blender

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.080 
what an action is it's basically blender
talk<00:02:34.420> for<00:02:34.810> animation<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:36.610> I'm<00:02:36.670> going<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:36.940> open

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
talk for animation so I'm going to open

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.590 
talk for animation so I'm going to open
up<00:02:37.300> an<00:02:37.450> action<00:02:37.780> editor<00:02:39.090> where<00:02:40.090> are<00:02:40.240> you<00:02:40.390> there

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
up an action editor where are you there

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.240 
up an action editor where are you there
you<00:02:40.720> are<00:02:41.850> okay<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.960> is<00:02:44.080> an<00:02:44.200> animation<00:02:44.590> so

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
you are okay and it is an animation so

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.280 
you are okay and it is an animation so
I'm<00:02:45.400> going<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.700> need<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:45.940> help<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.750> timeline

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
I'm going to need a help of the timeline

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:59.790 
I'm going to need a help of the timeline
if<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:51.100> can<00:02:51.280> open<00:02:51.610> one<00:02:52.000> up<00:02:55.380> not<00:02:56.380> join<00:02:58.410> split<00:02:59.410> dang

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.800 
it so there we go okay make sure we're
at<00:03:06.280> frame<00:03:06.610> one<00:03:06.910> that's<00:03:07.390> very<00:03:07.840> important<00:03:09.810> so

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
at frame one that's very important so

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.160 
at frame one that's very important so
and<00:03:11.170> I'm<00:03:11.710> going<00:03:12.430> I'm<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.120> little<00:03:13.450> bit<00:03:13.570> lazy<00:03:13.810> and

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
and I'm going I'm a little bit lazy and

I want to get this done quickly so I'm
going<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.870> turn<00:03:17.020> AutoKey<00:03:17.560> framing<00:03:18.040> on<00:03:18.160> which

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
going to turn AutoKey framing on which

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.460 
going to turn AutoKey framing on which
is<00:03:18.520> just<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:18.850> little<00:03:19.000> record<00:03:19.450> button<00:03:19.780> I'm

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
is just that little record button I'm

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.410 
is just that little record button I'm
also<00:03:20.709> going<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.100> use<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.490> manipulators<00:03:22.180> and

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
also going to use the manipulators and

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:30.240 
also going to use the manipulators and
turn<00:03:23.320> it<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.620> glue<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:24.250> normal<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:29.010> switch<00:03:30.010> the

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
turn it to glue to normal and switch the

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.199 
turn it to glue to normal and switch the
rotation<00:03:30.820> manipulator<00:03:31.360> on<00:03:31.890> so<00:03:32.890> now<00:03:33.150> what<00:03:34.150> I'm

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
rotation manipulator on so now what I'm

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.130 
rotation manipulator on so now what I'm
going<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.480> do<00:03:34.720> is<00:03:35.650> I'm<00:03:35.860> going<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:37.020> going<00:03:38.020> to

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
going to do is I'm going to going to

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.870 
going to do is I'm going to going to
make<00:03:38.290> this<00:03:38.440> basically<00:03:38.920> two<00:03:39.220> halves<00:03:39.520> of<00:03:39.760> an

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
make this basically two halves of an

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.260 
make this basically two halves of an
animation<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:42.160> first<00:03:42.520> half<00:03:42.760> would<00:03:43.030> be<00:03:43.060> on

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
animation so the first half would be on

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.140 
animation so the first half would be on
frame<00:03:43.630> 1<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.590> second<00:03:45.070> half<00:03:45.310> would<00:03:45.820> be<00:03:45.850> on

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
frame 1 the second half would be on

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.300 
frame 1 the second half would be on
frame<00:03:46.570> 3<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.410> rest<00:03:47.650> position<00:03:48.130> would<00:03:48.280> be

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
frame 3 and the rest position would be

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.110 
frame 3 and the rest position would be
on<00:03:48.520> frame<00:03:48.820> too<00:03:49.260> so<00:03:50.260> I'm<00:03:50.350> going<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.620> KI<00:03:51.489> just

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
on frame too so I'm going to KI just

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.530 
on frame too so I'm going to KI just
these<00:03:52.330> two<00:03:52.600> bones<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:54.450> hit<00:03:55.450> are<00:03:55.840> and<00:03:57.540> will

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
these two bones and hit are and will

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.520 
these two bones and hit are and will
only<00:03:58.570> keep<00:03:59.080> that<00:03:59.380> one<00:03:59.650> and<00:04:00.840> hit<00:04:01.840> our<00:04:02.080> and<00:04:02.380> then

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
only keep that one and hit our and then

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.699 
only keep that one and hit our and then
you<00:04:03.489> basically<00:04:03.760> keyed<00:04:04.209> it<00:04:04.390> now<00:04:05.200> it's<00:04:05.410> going<00:04:05.590> to

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
you basically keyed it now it's going to

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.940 
you basically keyed it now it's going to
basically<00:04:06.310> making<00:04:06.760> a<00:04:06.940> finger<00:04:07.390> type<00:04:07.900> thing<00:04:08.230> I'm

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
basically making a finger type thing I'm

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.240 
basically making a finger type thing I'm
going<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.250> rotate<00:04:09.400> it<00:04:09.670> back<00:04:09.850> like<00:04:10.030> that<00:04:11.250> and

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
going to rotate it back like that and

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.530 
going to rotate it back like that and
rotate<00:04:12.850> it<00:04:12.970> like<00:04:13.180> this<00:04:14.050> and<00:04:15.419> there's<00:04:16.419> our

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
rotate it like this and there's our

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.650 
rotate it like this and there's our
action<00:04:16.989> I'm<00:04:17.770> going<00:04:18.489> to<00:04:18.640> name<00:04:18.850> this<00:04:18.880> action

they want the start frame to be to want
the<00:06:14.349> in<00:06:14.529> frame<00:06:15.210> yeah<00:06:17.009> now<00:06:18.009> the<00:06:18.520> minimum<00:06:19.000> is<00:06:19.180> the

that default size would be one and the

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:32.610 
that default size would be one and the
maximum<00:06:26.139> is<00:06:27.029> the<00:06:28.169> well<00:06:29.169> the<00:06:29.819> the<00:06:30.819> size<00:06:31.620> since

the size of the targets for the action

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:40.110 
the size of the targets for the action
to<00:06:37.690> be<00:06:37.779> completed<00:06:38.169> now<00:06:38.979> it's<00:06:39.339> going

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
to be completed now it's going

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.060 
to be completed now it's going
to<00:06:40.150> be<00:06:40.240> scaling<00:06:40.660> down<00:06:40.690> so<00:06:41.260> I<00:06:41.290> want<00:06:41.560> to<00:06:41.740> the

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
to be scaling down so I want to the

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.219 
to be scaling down so I want to the
action<00:06:42.490> to<00:06:42.580> be<00:06:42.699> completed<00:06:43.180> when<00:06:43.720> it's<00:06:43.960> point

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:44.229 
action to be completed when it's point

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:47.969 
action to be completed when it's point
five<00:06:44.440> smaller<00:06:44.889> so<00:06:45.699> i'll<00:06:46.060> make<00:06:46.540> the<00:06:46.860> make<00:06:47.860> it

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:47.979 
five smaller so i'll make the make it

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:51.060 
five smaller so i'll make the make it
complete<00:06:48.280> itself<00:06:48.520> at<00:06:48.699> point<00:06:48.970> five<00:06:49.210> and<00:06:49.919> if<00:06:50.919> I

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070 
complete itself at point five and if I

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.090 
complete itself at point five and if I
scale<00:06:51.729> this<00:06:51.910> bone<00:06:52.350> as<00:06:53.350> you<00:06:53.650> can<00:06:53.770> see<00:06:53.979> the

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100 
scale this bone as you can see the

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.070 
scale this bone as you can see the
action<00:06:54.430> is<00:06:54.550> being<00:06:54.699> driven<00:06:55.030> but<00:06:55.630> not<00:06:55.810> on<00:06:55.930> this

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
action is being driven but not on this

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.010 
action is being driven but not on this
bone<00:06:56.380> there's<00:06:56.860> a<00:06:56.919> handy<00:06:57.370> way<00:06:57.520> you<00:06:57.580> can<00:06:57.760> do<00:06:57.940> that

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
bone there's a handy way you can do that

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.120 
bone there's a handy way you can do that
or<00:06:59.020> actually<00:06:59.530> I<00:07:01.050> need<00:07:02.050> to<00:07:02.139> add<00:07:02.260> another<00:07:02.290> action

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.130 
or actually I need to add another action

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.550 
or actually I need to add another action
constraint<00:07:03.610> so<00:07:04.270> just<00:07:04.449> grab<00:07:04.570> the<00:07:04.840> target<00:07:05.229> grab

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 
constraint so just grab the target grab

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.010 
constraint so just grab the target grab
the<00:07:05.830> bone<00:07:05.979> curl<00:07:06.370> see<00:07:06.669> action<00:07:07.090> I<00:07:07.270> know<00:07:07.690> I'm

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 
the bone curl see action I know I'm

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.590 
the bone curl see action I know I'm
going<00:07:08.260> a<00:07:08.290> little<00:07:08.410> fast<00:07:08.970> but<00:07:09.970> I<00:07:10.030> don't<00:07:10.389> know<00:07:10.449> how
