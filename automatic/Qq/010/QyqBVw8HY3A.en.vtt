00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.280
 holy 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.860
 to 80 worth basic attacks let's put 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.220
 the good thing to see is that basic attacks 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.910
 let's put it in let's put it in 50 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.910
 more or less 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:30.760
 more than 50 here and health is worth here comes 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.900
 what's important we're going to distribute the kit 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.730
 as well 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.780
 the one that I need also enough here 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.579
 resistance I do not care so much put 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.700
 that I'm not going to look for the super saiyan either 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.860
 You know then, well, let's put 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.819
 obviously the resistance because you have to 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.340
 put resistance let's put 20 and 37 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.730
 of life I think it will be fine as well 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.860
 the truth 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.090
 I do not know whether to remove some point from some 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:05.580
 side I do not know to see if to remove 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.580
 let's remove two here two here 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.980
 41 from here 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.230
 we will leave 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.940
 to remove from here let's put 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.519
 to put five in super bursts and also 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.820
 put something not and well basically 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.790
 so my character would be right now 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:29.129
 truth that you already see physical butt although 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:31.589
 the truth is that I do not know if I should 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:33.280
 elk and life especially life 

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:35.500
 Health 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.030
 I do not know the truth but good anyway 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.440
 I think it's good, well, tell me 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.270
 you think 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.890
 what do you think in the comments 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.020
 if you want that I have done wrong in putting myself 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.690
 well the attributes or so on and so on 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.300
 to save there is and well I hope that 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.950
 now my character hits more and good in 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.860
 As for skills 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.020
 the truth that I continue with them is that 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.510
 the meteor shock is very broken is 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.040
 very broke in this bust and good now 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.230
 same good I have in the attack shine 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.020
 end of the super change me to positions but 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.760
 well, this is obviously going to change 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.410
 getting ready for pvp and other things 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.060
