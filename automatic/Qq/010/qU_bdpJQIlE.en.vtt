I want to talk about the Rope I use and

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.670 
I want to talk about the Rope I use and
why<00:00:03.959> I<00:00:04.560> use<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.580> rope<00:00:05.940> called<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.480> Mach<00:00:06.750> 3<00:00:07.259> plus

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
why I use a rope called the Mach 3 plus

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.180 
why I use a rope called the Mach 3 plus
by<00:00:08.130> fast<00:00:08.519> back<00:00:08.880> ropes<00:00:09.740> they<00:00:10.740> have<00:00:10.980> been

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
by fast back ropes they have been

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.070 
by fast back ropes they have been
building<00:00:11.460> my<00:00:11.730> ropes<00:00:12.000> for<00:00:12.269> quite<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.540> few<00:00:12.809> years

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
building my ropes for quite a few years

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.829 
building my ropes for quite a few years
now<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.980> one<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.880> things<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.480> really

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
now and one of the things that I really

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.470 
now and one of the things that I really
like<00:00:16.109> about<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.650> Mach<00:00:16.859> 3<00:00:17.160> plus<00:00:17.609> it's<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.330> little

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
like about the Mach 3 plus it's a little

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
like about the Mach 3 plus it's a little
longer<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.789> it's<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:21.029> light<00:00:21.300> rope<00:00:21.689> that's<00:00:22.080> body

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
longer and it's a light rope that's body

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.519 
longer and it's a light rope that's body
that<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.910> control<00:00:24.510> from<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.990> long<00:00:25.199> distance

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
that I can control from a long distance

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.939 
that I can control from a long distance
back<00:00:26.480> you<00:00:27.480> know<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:27.779> you're<00:00:27.960> gonna<00:00:28.140> run<00:00:28.500> close

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
back you know if you're gonna run close

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.730 
back you know if you're gonna run close
the<00:00:29.699> rope<00:00:30.000> doesn't<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.810> be<00:00:30.990> exact<00:00:31.500> you

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
the rope doesn't have to be exact you

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.430 
the rope doesn't have to be exact you
can<00:00:31.920> use<00:00:32.099> an<00:00:32.250> older<00:00:32.610> rope<00:00:32.850> or<00:00:33.270> fuzzier<00:00:33.809> rope<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
can use an older rope or fuzzier rope a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.310 
can use an older rope or fuzzier rope a
heavy<00:00:34.710> rope<00:00:35.070> or<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.489> big<00:00:35.730> rope<00:00:36.050> but<00:00:37.050> if<00:00:37.170> you're

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
heavy rope or a big rope but if you're

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.709 
heavy rope or a big rope but if you're
gonna<00:00:37.500> reach<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.460> be<00:00:38.610> consistent<00:00:39.570> at

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
gonna reach and be consistent at

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.410 
gonna reach and be consistent at
reaching<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:41.129> gotta<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.700> something<00:00:42.059> that

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
reaching you gotta have something that

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.990 
reaching you gotta have something that
you<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.840> control<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.739> throw<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> long<00:00:44.700> ways

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
you can control and throw a long ways

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.900 
you can control and throw a long ways
back<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.750> one<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.800> things<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.340> at<00:00:47.700> home

back and one of the things I do at home

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.910 
back and one of the things I do at home
is<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.329> rope<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.629> lot<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.989> mule<00:00:49.260> ease<00:00:49.500> because

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
is I rope a lot of mule ease because

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.729 
is I rope a lot of mule ease because
they're<00:00:50.309> harder<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.910> be<00:00:51.809> able<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.050> reach<00:00:52.379> and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
horse has a chance to get away from me

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.200 
horse has a chance to get away from me
the<00:01:16.229> bigger<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.920> heavier<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.580> slower<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the bigger the heavier the slower the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.450 
the bigger the heavier the slower the
rope<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.810> more<00:01:19.170> chance<00:01:19.530> your<00:01:19.860> horse<00:01:20.130> has<00:01:20.400> to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
rope the more chance your horse has to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.730 
rope the more chance your horse has to
get<00:01:20.790> away<00:01:20.909> from<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.810> then<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.560> affects

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
get away from you and then that affects

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.490 
get away from you and then that affects
your<00:01:23.280> handle<00:01:23.729> now<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.540> one<00:01:24.840> thing<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.229> will<00:01:25.470> say

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
your handle now the one thing I will say

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.569 
your handle now the one thing I will say
about<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.340> Mach<00:01:26.580> 3<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.110> does<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:29.070> does<00:01:29.340> have

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
about the Mach 3 is it does it does have

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.510 
about the Mach 3 is it does it does have
a<00:01:29.610> weakness<00:01:30.150> far<00:01:30.869> as<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.380> weather<00:01:31.650> if<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.280> run

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
a weakness far as the weather if you run

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.050 
a weakness far as the weather if you run
into<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:32.909> extreme<00:01:33.570> heat<00:01:33.930> or<00:01:34.140> extreme<00:01:34.350> cold

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
into this extreme heat or extreme cold

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.670 
into this extreme heat or extreme cold
you<00:01:36.060> really<00:01:36.390> have<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.689> take<00:01:36.869> care<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.439> rope

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
you really have to take care of the rope

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.830 
you really have to take care of the rope
and<00:01:37.950> keep<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.700> out<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.119> those<00:01:39.299> weathers

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
and keep it out of those weathers

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.800 
and keep it out of those weathers
because<00:01:40.829> with<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.220> having<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.790> much<00:01:42.000> body<00:01:42.420> and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
because with it having so much body and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.370 
because with it having so much body and
being<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.170> lighter<00:01:43.470> rope<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.100> will<00:01:44.399> affect<00:01:44.909> it

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
being a lighter rope it will affect it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.109 
being a lighter rope it will affect it
but<00:01:46.380> that's<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> one<00:01:47.009> thing<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> 4th<00:01:47.790> strand

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
but that's the one thing the 4th strand

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.539 
but that's the one thing the 4th strand
has<00:01:48.479> all<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.049> three<00:01:49.320> strand<00:01:49.680> ropes<00:01:49.950> they<00:01:50.369> are

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
has all the three strand ropes they are

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.569 
has all the three strand ropes they are
tougher<00:01:51.149> they're<00:01:51.810> more<00:01:52.140> durable<00:01:52.470> they<00:01:53.369> don't

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
tougher they're more durable they don't

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.060 
tougher they're more durable they don't
change<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.360> much<00:01:54.570> an<00:01:54.840> extreme<00:01:55.380> cold<00:01:55.829> or

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
change so much an extreme cold or

remember it's how you practice you
practice<00:04:57.270> to<00:04:58.050> win<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:59.280> don't<00:04:59.430> practice<00:05:00.150> to

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
practice to win you don't practice to

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.260 
practice to win you don't practice to
fail<00:05:00.720> but<00:05:01.470> you<00:05:01.530> practice<00:05:02.250> to<00:05:02.400> be<00:05:02.580> able<00:05:02.730> to<00:05:03.000> come

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
fail but you practice to be able to come

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.200 
fail but you practice to be able to come
be<00:05:03.870> able<00:05:04.170> to<00:05:04.290> overcome<00:05:04.920> anything<00:05:05.790> that<00:05:06.030> can

be able to overcome anything that can
happen<00:05:06.420> and<00:05:06.870> you<00:05:07.500> make<00:05:07.710> it<00:05:07.890> harder<00:05:08.310> and<00:05:08.430> a

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
happen and you make it harder and a

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.820 
happen and you make it harder and a
practice<00:05:09.000> pin<00:05:09.270> so<00:05:09.570> when<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:09.840> leave<00:05:09.990> home<00:05:10.290> it's

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
practice pin so when you leave home it's

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.320 
practice pin so when you leave home it's
easier<00:05:12.620> one<00:05:13.620> of<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.830> questions<00:05:14.340> I<00:05:14.490> get<00:05:14.550> asked

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
easier one of the questions I get asked

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.390 
easier one of the questions I get asked
when<00:05:15.480> people<00:05:15.810> are<00:05:15.990> talking<00:05:16.350> about<00:05:16.410> ropes<00:05:16.980> is

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
when people are talking about ropes is

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.790 
when people are talking about ropes is
what's<00:05:17.670> the<00:05:17.940> difference<00:05:18.450> in<00:05:18.660> the<00:05:18.690> Mach<00:05:19.020> 3<00:05:19.470> and

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
what's the difference in the Mach 3 and

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.330 
what's the difference in the Mach 3 and
the<00:05:20.010> Mach<00:05:20.220> 3<00:05:20.640> plus<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:22.110> Mach<00:05:22.350> 3<00:05:22.770> is<00:05:22.920> just<00:05:23.190> a

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
the Mach 3 plus the Mach 3 is just a

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.780 
the Mach 3 plus the Mach 3 is just a
toned<00:05:23.700> down<00:05:23.970> version<00:05:24.180> of<00:05:24.990> what<00:05:25.290> I<00:05:25.320> use<00:05:25.890> it

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
toned down version of what I use it

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.520 
toned down version of what I use it
doesn't<00:05:27.330> have<00:05:27.540> as<00:05:27.900> much<00:05:28.410> body<00:05:29.720> it's<00:05:30.720> not<00:05:31.170> as

doesn't have as much body it's not as

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.100 
doesn't have as much body it's not as
light<00:05:32.340> because<00:05:32.940> there<00:05:33.150> is<00:05:33.300> people<00:05:33.570> that<00:05:33.720> want

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
light because there is people that want

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.620 
light because there is people that want
a<00:05:34.200> little<00:05:34.410> more<00:05:34.590> weight<00:05:34.950> in<00:05:35.160> their<00:05:35.370> rope<00:05:35.630> the

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
a little more weight in their rope the

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.580 
a little more weight in their rope the
Mach<00:05:36.870> 3<00:05:37.230> plus<00:05:37.590> is<00:05:37.620> a<00:05:37.950> lighter<00:05:38.400> rope<00:05:39.200> with<00:05:40.200> a<00:05:40.230> lot

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
Mach 3 plus is a lighter rope with a lot

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.800 
Mach 3 plus is a lighter rope with a lot
of<00:05:40.620> body<00:05:41.040> its<00:05:41.460> pulled<00:05:41.820> down<00:05:41.940> really<00:05:42.450> tight

of body its pulled down really tight

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.980 
of body its pulled down really tight
it's<00:05:43.800> actually<00:05:44.280> about<00:05:44.490> two<00:05:44.790> foot<00:05:45.090> longer<00:05:45.690> than

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
it's actually about two foot longer than

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.950 
it's actually about two foot longer than
the<00:05:46.140> Mach<00:05:46.380> 3<00:05:46.890> and<00:05:47.730> what<00:05:48.000> that<00:05:48.270> does<00:05:48.540> it<00:05:48.930> allows

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
the Mach 3 and what that does it allows

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.480 
the Mach 3 and what that does it allows
me<00:05:49.830> to<00:05:50.190> be<00:05:50.340> able<00:05:50.490> to<00:05:50.730> reach<00:05:51.180> that<00:05:51.210> much<00:05:51.900> further

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
me to be able to reach that much further

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
in a head rope you got to be able to

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.350 
in a head rope you got to be able to
snap<00:06:00.900> it<00:06:01.170> closed<00:06:01.620> I've<00:06:02.130> never<00:06:02.550> been<00:06:02.820> one<00:06:03.120> that

behind<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.510> steers<00:06:06.810> head<00:06:07.140> because<00:06:08.130> that

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
behind the steers head because that

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.670 
behind the steers head because that
takes<00:06:08.700> time<00:06:09.090> you<00:06:09.870> want<00:06:10.110> to<00:06:10.200> be<00:06:10.320> able<00:06:10.380> to<00:06:10.560> get

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
takes time you want to be able to get

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.670 
takes time you want to be able to get
your<00:06:10.890> rope<00:06:11.160> as<00:06:11.400> tight<00:06:11.730> as<00:06:12.060> fast<00:06:12.510> as<00:06:12.810> you<00:06:12.960> can<00:06:13.290> on

the horns and you don't want to wave it
off<00:06:17.220> and<00:06:17.670> that's<00:06:18.060> why<00:06:18.330> I<00:06:18.720> like<00:06:19.500> from<00:06:19.740> my<00:06:19.890> rope

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
off and that's why I like from my rope

off and that's why I like from my rope
to<00:06:20.340> have<00:06:20.490> a<00:06:20.520> lot<00:06:20.760> of<00:06:20.790> snap<00:06:21.270> and<00:06:21.300> that's<00:06:21.780> one<00:06:21.990> of

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
to have a lot of snap and that's one of

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.810 
to have a lot of snap and that's one of
the<00:06:22.140> reasons<00:06:22.500> you'll<00:06:22.620> see<00:06:22.860> me<00:06:23.040> use<00:06:23.370> a<00:06:23.400> lot<00:06:23.790> of

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
the reasons you'll see me use a lot of

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.020 
the reasons you'll see me use a lot of
new<00:06:24.180> ropes<00:06:24.510> is<00:06:25.230> I<00:06:25.500> like<00:06:25.800> to<00:06:25.830> be<00:06:26.220> able<00:06:26.370> to<00:06:26.610> snap

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
new ropes is I like to be able to snap

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.380 
new ropes is I like to be able to snap
the<00:06:27.270> rope<00:06:27.480> close<00:06:27.930> around<00:06:28.470> the<00:06:28.770> horns<00:06:29.390> whenever

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
the rope close around the horns whenever

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.330 
the rope close around the horns whenever
you're<00:06:30.630> throwing<00:06:30.990> really<00:06:31.470> fast<00:06:31.770> you<00:06:32.070> want<00:06:32.280> to

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
you're throwing really fast you want to

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.390 
you're throwing really fast you want to
get<00:06:32.460> it<00:06:32.580> tight<00:06:32.910> on<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.270> horse<00:06:33.960> and<00:06:34.260> that<00:06:34.400> is

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
get it tight on the horse and that is

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.240 
get it tight on the horse and that is
the<00:06:35.580> key<00:06:35.850> to<00:06:36.150> not<00:06:36.180> waving<00:06:36.840> it<00:06:36.960> off<00:06:37.140> the<00:06:37.590> faster

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
the key to not waving it off the faster

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.510 
the key to not waving it off the faster
you<00:06:38.430> can<00:06:38.610> get<00:06:38.790> it

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
you can get it

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.029 
you can get it
the<00:06:39.729> horns<00:06:40.240> are<00:06:40.449> better<00:06:40.630> off<00:06:40.900> you<00:06:41.199> are<00:06:41.229> and

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 
the horns are better off you are and

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:44.339 
the horns are better off you are and
that<00:06:42.729> is<00:06:42.880> one<00:06:43.060> of<00:06:43.150> the<00:06:43.330> reasons<00:06:43.690> I<00:06:43.810> like<00:06:44.080> the

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:44.349 
that is one of the reasons I like the

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:46.620 
that is one of the reasons I like the
Mach<00:06:44.530> 3<00:06:44.830> plus<00:06:45.160> it's<00:06:45.460> got<00:06:45.580> a<00:06:45.639> lot<00:06:45.880> of<00:06:45.910> snap<00:06:46.270> to<00:06:46.599> it

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630 
Mach 3 plus it's got a lot of snap to it

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.270 
Mach 3 plus it's got a lot of snap to it
it's<00:06:46.930> almost<00:06:47.199> like<00:06:47.470> putting<00:06:47.710> English<00:06:48.069> on<00:06:48.250> the

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
it's almost like putting English on the

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.180 
it's almost like putting English on the
cue<00:06:48.400> ball<00:06:48.639> if<00:06:49.569> you<00:06:49.690> can<00:06:50.050> control<00:06:50.560> your<00:06:50.620> cue

same as a rope if you can handle your
rope<00:06:55.960> and<00:06:56.289> make<00:06:56.500> it<00:06:56.710> do<00:06:56.979> what<00:06:57.280> you<00:06:57.310> want<00:06:57.490> to<00:06:58.120> it
