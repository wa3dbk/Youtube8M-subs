 Welcome to Metabolism TV your source of correct information on the metabolism 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.650
 and health. I am Frank Suarez specialist in obesity and metabolism Water, pure Water! 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.680
 We are going to talk about that today, they have been asking us that it is the same to drink water, 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.870
 to take with flavor, with jicama flavor, as they use in Mexico or with other juices, with 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.170
 lemon flavor, or whatever. Let's explain that, I'm going to the blackboard for a little while, 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.960
 I'm going to stop carefully because right now it stops me so fast and my friend Jorge 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.880
 is scared, because I get out of the picture and is that I as an artist have not yet done 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:01:00.600
 very good, but let's go here, let's explain this topic OK water is vital to get down 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.320
 of weight, why? Because Water is H2O and O is O of Oxygen, without oxygen 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.260
 there is combustion, so the more water you can drink, the more oxygen you will see, the more 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.270
 combustion will see and less fat will end up taking on the body, so the water is 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.450
 vital. What's going on? the body does not treat as explained in the book The Power of the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.680
 Metabolism, inside the stomach, the body, yes the water that you put in your stomach, 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.410
 It has flavor, some flavor to whatever it is, the body detects that flavor because there are some censors 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.530
 in the wall of the stomach, which tells the brain that this is food, why does it know 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:52.050
 What is food? Because it has flavor, but when you consume water, pure water, it has no flavor 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.440
 and since it has no flavor, it does not activate the censors, and since it does not activate the censors, the body does not 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.360
 produces hydrochloric acid, which is what produces the wall of the stomach, you do not want 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.640
 more acid, what you want is for water to enter, to come out of the wall of the stomach 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.909
 and go to the bloodstream, when you drink water and taste it the body treats it 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:20.030
 as a food and produces hydrochloric acid into the stomach and then it takes 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.840
 a lot of time to go out because then it treats it like a food, to send it through the tract 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.110
 digestive or treating it completely differently, so what we need to 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.490
 Weight loss is water, pure water. We are not talking about flavored water, nor water with crystalline, 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.250
 no water with lemon, no water with nothing, pure water, that does not mean that periodically 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.420
 you are not going to drink a flavored water or something else, we are not prohibiting anything, only 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:55.410
 I am explaining that to raise the metabolism, you need water, pure water! Now, watchful eye, 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.620
 those people who have problems taking water as pure water, what happens is that 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:09.930
 they have not yet created the habit, the habit of drinking water, it takes at least 3 days to create 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.610
 we have seen it in 10 thousand, in 20 thousand, in 25 thousand people, all the person who is not 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.810
 used to drinking water, when you try to drink water for the first time, you feel like 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.870
 to vomit it, because the body does not want it, because you already used it to not have it, 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.319
 but if you start to put water, and water, and water, like who says "you push 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:36.090
 body "I guarantee that by the third day you will feel thirst, and the desire to take 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.080
 water, we have seen it in more than 10 thousand people who have passed through the centers of 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.190
 lose weight of us, come that can not stand the water, that some of them would say "the 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.110
 water is for bathing "or for throwing in plants, and they can drink water with juice, 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.040
 with lemon, with anything but never water alone, but on the third day of drinking water, pure 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.629
 water, the body begins to ask, because there is a censor in the back of the brain, 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.700
 here back in the cerebellum, which quenches thirst and automatically the person wants water 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.850
 and no longer has any stress, not only do you not have any stress but you want to take 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.040
 water, so what we need to lose weight is water, pure water and it's a question 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.599
 to create the habit that takes you only 3 days to do it, how do you get the formula? 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:26.090
 You say what the weight is, divided by the number 16 if it is in pounds, let's say 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.520
 if you weigh 160 pounds, divide it by 16 are 10 glasses a day. yes he is calculating 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.389
 in kilos, you say "well, weight 70 kilograms divided by 7 and you will give the same 10 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:44.069
 glasses "10 glasses of water per day, in the case of measuring it in kilos, would be glasses not 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:50.860
 8 ounces but 250 milliliters, so basically that's the formula but what's important 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.969
 is that you have to create the habit, if you do not create the habit and if it is not water, pure water does not 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:59.189
 It will help the metabolism a lot. And you know what? The truth always triumphs.
