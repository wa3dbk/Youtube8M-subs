comment section across the top right it

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.100 
comment section across the top right it
stopped<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:39.010> eight<00:03:39.129> bytes<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:40.450> I<00:03:40.540> get<00:03:40.930> some

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
stopped the eight bytes so I get some

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:53.619 
stopped the eight bytes so I get some
cut<00:03:41.439> isn't<00:03:41.620> it

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:04:01.440 

yeah

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:39.150 

this<00:04:01.959> way

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.970 

but<00:04:39.970> a<00:04:40.000> bit<00:04:40.450> of<00:04:40.540> Lube<00:04:40.720> help<00:04:41.530> things<00:04:41.740> slide

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
but a bit of Lube help things slide

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.970 
but a bit of Lube help things slide
along<00:04:42.190> nicely<00:04:43.110> one<00:04:44.110> plastic<00:04:44.800> spatula<00:04:46.980> and

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
along nicely one plastic spatula and

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.350 
along nicely one plastic spatula and
then<00:04:48.100> we've<00:04:48.250> literally<00:04:48.460> got<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.670> pull<00:04:49.210> this

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
then we've literally got to pull this

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.260 
then we've literally got to pull this
rubber<00:04:49.540> out<00:04:49.810> as<00:04:50.590> we<00:04:50.800> go<00:04:51.040> it's<00:04:51.790> not<00:04:51.970> joining<00:04:52.180> the

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
rubber out as we go it's not joining the

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.610 
rubber out as we go it's not joining the
glass<00:04:52.510> there<00:04:52.780> so<00:04:52.960> we<00:04:53.080> need<00:04:53.200> to<00:04:53.290> come<00:04:53.410> along<00:04:53.590> a

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
glass there so we need to come along a

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.030 
glass there so we need to come along a
bit<00:04:53.770> further<00:04:54.090> just<00:04:55.090> comes<00:04:55.300> along<00:04:55.890> and<00:04:56.890> the

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
bit further just comes along and the

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.920 
bit further just comes along and the
screen<00:04:57.700> just<00:04:57.910> drops<00:04:58.150> into<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:58.450> slides<00:04:58.720> that

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
screen just drops into the slides that

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.090 
screen just drops into the slides that
you<00:04:59.020> drops<00:04:59.260> into<00:04:59.410> the<00:04:59.500> slot<00:04:59.770> you've<00:04:59.920> got<00:05:00.010> the
