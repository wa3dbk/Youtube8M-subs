00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.210 

I<00:00:10.060> think<00:00:10.780> that<00:00:10.960> if<00:00:11.080> anyone<00:00:11.410> would<00:00:11.710> have<00:00:11.770> asked

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:12.220 
I think that if anyone would have asked

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.130 
I think that if anyone would have asked
me<00:00:12.400> what's<00:00:12.640> the<00:00:12.790> thing<00:00:13.150> you<00:00:13.360> want<00:00:13.540> to<00:00:13.660> do<00:00:13.840> most

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.140 
me what's the thing you want to do most

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.670 
me what's the thing you want to do most
in<00:00:14.620> the<00:00:14.920> world<00:00:15.160> I<00:00:15.580> would<00:00:16.240> have<00:00:16.390> said<00:00:16.750> I'd<00:00:17.410> like

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
in the world I would have said I'd like

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.740 
in the world I would have said I'd like
to<00:00:17.890> go<00:00:18.070> to<00:00:18.520> Europe<00:00:18.880> and<00:00:19.029> eat<00:00:19.300> and<00:00:19.540> if<00:00:19.600> they'd

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
to go to Europe and eat and if they'd

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.450 
to go to Europe and eat and if they'd
asked<00:00:20.020> me<00:00:20.140> to<00:00:20.230> specify<00:00:20.830> where<00:00:21.100> I<00:00:21.130> would<00:00:21.340> have

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
asked me to specify where I would have

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:29.230 
asked me to specify where I would have
said<00:00:21.670> Italy

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.330 

so<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.270> got<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.690> chance<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.200> do<00:00:31.410> just<00:00:31.440> that<00:00:31.860> I

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
so I got the chance to do just that I

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:42.530 
so I got the chance to do just that I
was<00:00:33.180> just<00:00:33.600> over<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.200> moon<00:00:34.380> excited

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.320 

but<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.290> didn't<00:00:43.620> realize<00:00:43.650> was<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:45.000> even

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
but what I didn't realize was that even

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.510 
but what I didn't realize was that even
more<00:00:45.600> than<00:00:45.810> that<00:00:45.840> part<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:46.980> trip<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.460> I

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
more than that part of this trip that I

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.520 
more than that part of this trip that I
would<00:00:47.760> love<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.270> being<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.810> kitchens<00:00:49.290> and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
would love is being in the kitchens and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.350 
would love is being in the kitchens and
the<00:00:49.620> wine<00:00:49.800> cellars<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.460> people<00:00:50.910> here<00:00:51.150> and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the wine cellars of people here and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.770 
the wine cellars of people here and
getting<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.110> talk<00:00:52.350> with<00:00:52.650> them<00:00:52.860> about<00:00:53.160> how<00:00:54.120> they

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
getting to talk with them about how they

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.990 
getting to talk with them about how they
cook<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.260> why<00:00:55.440> they<00:00:55.710> cook<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.250> where<00:00:56.850> they

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
cook and why they cook and where they

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:08.220 
cook and why they cook and where they
got<00:00:57.120> their<00:00:57.330> recipes<00:00:57.780> from

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.750 

I<00:01:09.480> think<00:01:10.480> one<00:01:10.840> of<00:01:10.870> my<00:01:11.050> favorites<00:01:11.680> was<00:01:12.160> making

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
I think one of my favorites was making

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.150 
I think one of my favorites was making
the<00:01:13.240> ravioli<00:01:14.080> one<00:01:14.470> of<00:01:14.560> my<00:01:14.650> first<00:01:14.890> cooking

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
the ravioli one of my first cooking

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.490 
the ravioli one of my first cooking
experiences<00:01:15.940> here<00:01:16.240> because<00:01:17.050> even<00:01:17.380> though

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
experiences here because even though

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.050 
experiences here because even though
there<00:01:17.680> was<00:01:17.770> a<00:01:17.800> bit<00:01:18.040> of<00:01:18.220> a<00:01:18.340> language<00:01:18.790> barrier

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
there was a bit of a language barrier

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.480 
there was a bit of a language barrier
between<00:01:19.620> me<00:01:20.620> and<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.770> woman<00:01:20.890> I<00:01:21.040> was<00:01:21.160> cooking

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
between me and the woman I was cooking

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.390 
between me and the woman I was cooking
with<00:01:21.870> cooking<00:01:22.870> is<00:01:23.110> a<00:01:23.140> universal<00:01:23.830> language<00:01:23.980> you

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
with cooking is a universal language you

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:34.320 
with cooking is a universal language you
can<00:01:24.550> really<00:01:24.760> communicate<00:01:24.970> through<00:01:25.690> food<00:01:33.330> she

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
can really communicate through food she

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.610 
can really communicate through food she
would<00:01:34.480> just<00:01:34.630> show<00:01:34.870> me<00:01:35.050> you<00:01:35.170> know<00:01:35.260> you<00:01:35.380> pinch
