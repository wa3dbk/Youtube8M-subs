00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
from here to here and I think I'm just

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.420 
from here to here and I think I'm just
gonna<00:01:11.370> use<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.820> or<00:01:12.120> maybe<00:01:12.300> this<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:12.690> here<00:01:13.430> to

gonna use this or maybe this one here to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:34.470 
gonna use this or maybe this one here to
length

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.320 

alright<00:01:35.480> here's<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:35.980> the<00:01:36.980> future<00:01:37.640> steering

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
alright here's the the future steering

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.480 
alright here's the the future steering
bearing<00:01:38.810> that<00:01:38.990> I'm<00:01:39.140> going<00:01:39.290> to<00:01:39.350> use<00:01:39.620> it's<00:01:40.250> just

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
bearing that I'm going to use it's just

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.710 
bearing that I'm going to use it's just
gonna<00:01:40.610> be<00:01:40.790> this<00:01:41.000> top<00:01:41.930> part<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.200> bicycle<00:01:42.830> here

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
gonna be this top part the bicycle here

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.660 
gonna be this top part the bicycle here
and<00:01:44.720> I<00:01:44.900> think<00:01:45.170> I'll<00:01:45.320> just<00:01:45.350> cut<00:01:45.830> this<00:01:46.010> off<00:01:46.250> and

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
and I think I'll just cut this off and

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.970 
and I think I'll just cut this off and
make<00:01:46.820> it<00:01:47.000> straight<00:01:47.510> to<00:01:48.380> some<00:01:48.710> sort<00:01:48.950> of

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
make it straight to some sort of

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.140 
make it straight to some sort of
steering<00:01:49.220> wheel<00:01:50.170> you<00:01:51.170> cut<00:01:51.440> right<00:01:51.650> there<00:01:52.150> and

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
steering wheel you cut right there and

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.500 
steering wheel you cut right there and
put<00:01:53.510> like<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:53.750> piece<00:01:54.020> of<00:01:54.050> metal<00:01:54.350> like<00:01:54.380> this<00:01:54.500> and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
put like a piece of metal like this and

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.140 
put like a piece of metal like this and
that<00:01:56.510> will<00:01:56.720> move<00:01:56.870> the<00:01:57.170> joints<00:01:57.650> okay<00:01:58.640> so<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:58.910> got

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
that will move the joints okay so I got

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.710 
that will move the joints okay so I got
the<00:01:59.290> steering<00:02:00.550> from<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:01.730> bicycle<00:02:02.120> welded

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
the steering from the bicycle welded

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.170 
the steering from the bicycle welded
onto<00:02:02.870> the<00:02:03.260> go-kart<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.370> all<00:02:04.700> I<00:02:04.730> need<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.060> do

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
onto the go-kart and all I need to do

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
onto the go-kart and all I need to do
now<00:02:05.390> is<00:02:05.720> connect<00:02:06.550> that<00:02:07.550> thing<00:02:08.030> right<00:02:08.210> there<00:02:08.270> to

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
now is connect that thing right there to

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:36.559 
now is connect that thing right there to
this<00:02:09.619> thing<00:02:09.920> right<00:02:09.950> here

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.050 

check<00:02:37.569> it<00:02:37.750> out<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.900> got<00:02:38.049> myself<00:02:38.379> a<00:02:39.060> steering

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
check it out I got myself a steering

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.410 
check it out I got myself a steering
wheel<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:41.470> works<00:02:41.939> great

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
wheel it works great

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.369 
wheel it works great
the<00:02:44.290> problem<00:02:44.680> is<00:02:45.329> straight<00:02:46.329> against<00:02:46.900> my<00:02:47.170> way

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
the problem is straight against my way

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.670 
the problem is straight against my way
and<00:02:47.650> I<00:02:47.769> don't<00:02:47.799> really<00:02:48.159> like<00:02:48.459> it<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:50.440> might

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
and I don't really like it so I might

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.330 
and I don't really like it so I might
bend<00:02:51.129> it<00:02:51.340> up<00:02:51.610> like<00:02:52.329> that<00:02:52.360> maybe<00:02:53.159> and<00:02:54.159> then<00:02:54.250> I

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
bend it up like that maybe and then I

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.759 
bend it up like that maybe and then I
can<00:02:54.489> also<00:02:54.610> get<00:02:54.970> rid<00:02:55.090> of<00:02:55.209> these<00:02:55.780> supports<00:02:56.530> right

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
can also get rid of these supports right

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.460 
can also get rid of these supports right
here<00:02:57.069> is<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:58.359> isn't<00:02:58.569> really<00:02:58.870> news<00:02:59.170> anymore

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
here is this isn't really news anymore

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.990 
here is this isn't really news anymore
so<00:02:59.859> maybe<00:03:00.299> rid<00:03:01.299> of<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:01.540> bend<00:03:02.379> this<00:03:02.530> out<00:03:03.000> get

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
so maybe rid of that bend this out get

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.229 
so maybe rid of that bend this out get
myself<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.450> little<00:03:04.540> extra<00:03:04.900> room<00:03:05.819> and<00:03:06.819> before<00:03:07.209> I

well<00:05:15.539> guys<00:05:15.750> this<00:05:15.960> thing<00:05:16.169> is<00:05:16.199> absolutely

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
well guys this thing is absolutely

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:17.899 
well guys this thing is absolutely
ridiculous

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
ridiculous

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:20.360 
ridiculous
I<00:05:17.939> was<00:05:18.210> literally<00:05:18.560> idling<00:05:19.560> with<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:19.830> choke<00:05:20.099> on

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
I was literally idling with the choke on

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:26.200 
I was literally idling with the choke on
all<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.629> way<00:05:21.719> up<00:05:21.870> the<00:05:22.110> hill<00:05:22.849> and<00:05:24.590> basically

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
all the way up the hill and basically

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.149 
all the way up the hill and basically
it's<00:05:27.210> so<00:05:27.539> there's<00:05:28.319> not<00:05:28.500> enough<00:05:28.710> weight<00:05:28.949> in<00:05:29.069> the

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
it's so there's not enough weight in the

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.610 
it's so there's not enough weight in the
front<00:05:29.340> that<00:05:30.060> if<00:05:30.240> you<00:05:30.360> put<00:05:30.599> the<00:05:30.780> choke<00:05:31.229> in<00:05:31.439> and<00:05:31.590> a

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
front that if you put the choke in and a

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.830 
front that if you put the choke in and a
throttle<00:05:32.009> starts<00:05:32.250> going<00:05:32.580> you'll<00:05:33.479> just<00:05:33.659> go

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
throttle starts going you'll just go

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.629 
throttle starts going you'll just go
straight<00:05:34.139> forward<00:05:34.469> and<00:05:34.710> the<00:05:34.800> tires<00:05:35.400> don't

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
straight forward and the tires don't

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.879 
straight forward and the tires don't
have<00:05:35.849> any<00:05:36.060> influence<00:05:36.419> on<00:05:36.870> that<00:05:37.289> where<00:05:37.770> the

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
have any influence on that where the

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.249 
have any influence on that where the
go-kart<00:05:38.400> is<00:05:38.580> going<00:05:39.000> it's<00:05:39.270> so<00:05:39.449> stupid

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 
go-kart is going it's so stupid

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:42.200 
go-kart is going it's so stupid
anyways<00:05:40.770> I<00:05:40.949> don't<00:05:41.009> have<00:05:41.219> any<00:05:41.400> patience<00:05:42.030> and<00:05:42.180> I

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
anyways I don't have any patience and I

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.600 
anyways I don't have any patience and I
just<00:05:42.449> kind<00:05:42.659> of<00:05:42.689> barely<00:05:43.530> bolted<00:05:44.069> the<00:05:44.159> engine<00:05:44.490> on

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
just kind of barely bolted the engine on

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.740 
just kind of barely bolted the engine on
and<00:05:44.969> started<00:05:45.719> to<00:05:45.810> go<00:05:46.129> and<00:05:47.129> I<00:05:47.969> got<00:05:48.120> off<00:05:48.449> the<00:05:48.569> hill

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
and started to go and I got off the hill

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.260 
and started to go and I got off the hill
and<00:05:48.810> then<00:05:49.490> the<00:05:50.490> engine<00:05:50.789> fell<00:05:51.060> off<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:52.229> go-kart

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
and then the engine fell off the go-kart

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.200 
and then the engine fell off the go-kart
