00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
of different warps up so it would be

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.550 
of different warps up so it would be
easier<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.210> get<00:01:27.330> around<00:01:27.450> then<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.140> get<00:01:28.259> for

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
easier to get around then you get for
