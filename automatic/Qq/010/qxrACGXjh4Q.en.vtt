00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.720
 cot is out 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.120
 in this video you will learn what 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.580
 are the coast and the outs how she 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.559
 is calculated and how to use it 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.539
 to determine if you can follow a 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.699
 profitably draw 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.679
 on the flop it often happens that one 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.419
 is not the best hand but rather 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.189
 a draw with which one could 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.070
 possibly touch a hand made 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.070
 on one of the streets to come it is by 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.599
 example the case with a color print 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.460
 every map to improve your 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.000
 hand to a hand made is called to 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.610
 August 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.350
 in the case of a color print he 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.920
 this is each card of color in 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.790
 question in this case every heart 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.530
 if it is true that by touching 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.920
 pair you would also have a hand 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.199
 done 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.780
 however, it is unlikely that 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.339
 this one gives you the best hand 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.240
 this and the eight does not count so 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.280
 among your outs 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.350
 let's take a look at the different types of 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.170
 draw number of apps it enjoys 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.400
 a color print is completed by 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.800
 all the cards of the color in 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.890
 question there are thirteen cards from 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.140
 each color of the cards is 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.900
 already on the board and two others in 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.790
 your hand remains so nine cards of 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.910
 this color able to realize the hand 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.300
 would you like to have 9 to August with 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.430
 a bilateral straight draw or sd you 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.650
 have 8 august in our example 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.890
 it's all 9 and all 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.140
 four 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.310
 two overcards of if you have two 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.170
 overcards on the flop 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.580
 it is very likely that you will have the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.190
 best hand if you realize a 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.470
 pair with one of his cards in this 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.800
 example every ace and every lady you 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.340
 help 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.590
 if he makes us six outs you have 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.600
 5 to August when you already have a 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.229
 pair hope to touch a double pair 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.479
 or a set 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.300
 in this case you have 3.9 on the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.340
 flop and so already had a pair each 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.050
 extra king as well as each 9 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.659
 or give you a set or a double 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.819
 pair that corresponds to saint cloud 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.280
 with a ventral draw or 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:06.490
 gunshot you have four outs 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.520
 here you have ace of 4.5 which makes that 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.590
 every 3 will give you a straight 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.800
 you now know of how much doubt 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.510
 each draw data features in order to 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.850
 determine if you can follow a 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.440
 adverse bet with your draw you 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.240
 must first find out what is 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.270
 the probability that one of the outs 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.740
 appear and complete your draw 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.870
 this probability is expressed under 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.880
 corte form 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.950
 how to evaluate this rating as you 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.500
 probably know poker is played with 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.630
 a set of 52 cards 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.330
 on these 52 carp you know of a 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.280
 apart the two you have in hand and 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.900
 on the other hand the three that is on 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.900
 the flop 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.360
 so there is still 47 unknown map 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.800
 to fall on one of the following streets 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.200
 in order to calculate the probability of 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.180
 making your draw you need 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.310
 compare among the remaining cards in 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.890
 heel those that count among your 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.360
 outs those who do not help you here 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.710
 what does this give for a color flush 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.380
 turn flop 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.850
 nine of the remaining 47 cards help you 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.480
 since it would allow you to achieve 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.130
 your color this is your outs 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.220
 the remaining 38 cards are you 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.190
 of no use dividing your outs 9 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:22.420
 by the sum of the remaining cards 47 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.740
 sundown about 20 % or 4 against 1 he 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.200
 this is your rating 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.230
 it is always expressed in x against 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.520
 y for four cards useless a card 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.140
 useful 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.670
 that means that on average you 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.430
 make your color print 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.320
 once in five to decide if 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.690
 you can profitably follow the 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.550
 adverse bet with your draw you 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.410
 have to compare your rating with that 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.120
 we call the pot coast but what is 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.740
 what the pot odds 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.930
 the pot odds help you determine 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.570
 if you can profitably follow 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.860
 with a print it indicates the report 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.440
 profit risks 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.310
 in other words, it compares 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.200
 potential gains 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.760
 and the amount you owe you 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.610
 acquit let's put that your opponent 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.890
 put 2 dollars on the flop 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.750
 you know that if you follow you go 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.330
 miss your color four times and 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.370
 so losing four times is dollars 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.040
 it represents a total investment of 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.090
 8 dollars your draw will come true 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.980
 five times 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.750
 allowing you to pocket tax of 10 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:25.150
 dollars your potential gain and so 10 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.460
 while your stake is 2 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.830
 a ratio of 5 to 1 this is 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.810
 your pot odds in order to decide if a 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.030
 goal is profitable or not you have to 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.730
 now compare your rating to your 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.430
 pot odds if your pot odds are 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.860
 higher than your rating then you 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.880
 can follow if the pot odds are 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.050
 lower the rating 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.300
 you must go to bed 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.699
 let's take a look at the typical draw then 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.190
 out as well as to the probability of each 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.319
 to touch one of his doubts about the or 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.900
 the two streets following a draw 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:58.819
 gutshot to four outs ie a rating of 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.280
 11 forced to make this draw on 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:03.080
 one of the two streets to come if we 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.060
 consider the two remaining streets 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.729
 so it's a 5 to 1 rating 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.129
 a color print runs from 9 to August at 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.889
 corte and therefore 4 against 1 for the turn 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:14.810
 or the river and two against one for the 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.349
 two streets a bilateral straight draw 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.659
 paired with a pair to August be 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.069
 a rating of 2 and a half to 1 see a 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:24.139
 against one you will find a 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:25.789
 summary of all runs and 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.860
 related codes in the article 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.719
 corresponding to this lesson be told in 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.460
 passing there is a rude rule 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:32.780
 allowing a rough evaluation 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.190
 on your side 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.229
 when you do not have the time to 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.300
 make an accurate calculation in order to 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.979
 calculate your rating for a strict 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.409
 you multiply the orders of your 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.539
 draw by two in the case of a draw 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:47.360
 color it's about twice nafa august 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:49.610
 18% correspond to roughly one 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.680
 odds of 4 against for both street 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.039
 remaining you multiply your outs by 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.050
 four in our case we get 36% 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.650
 which corresponds roughly to a rating 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.290
 2 against 1 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.910
 summarize the cards allowing the 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.389
 making a draw are called upon to 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.150
 August 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:08.220
 the probability of touching an out is 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.650
 indicated as a corte with the help of 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.990
 the odds and outs as well as the coast 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:16.880
 of the pot you can determine if you 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.880
 can follow a draw profitably
