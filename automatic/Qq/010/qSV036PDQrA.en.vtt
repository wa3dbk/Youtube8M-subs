 expected tonight let's start 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.320
 with need for speed 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.410

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.420
 gold games executive who 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.879
 introduced the new version of need for 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.220
 speed the saga of fast cars and 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.739
 customizable in fact this time we 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.020
 He told the same Tuesday that this section 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.790
 the personalization of the cars was a 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.560
 of the things that most were put on 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.420
 careful in the development of this game 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.820
 So much so that cars can be 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.590
 customize in thousands of ways so 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.119
 you can start showing off with your 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:25.130
 friends with your new cars 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.130
 personalized this damn 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:39.940
 I never spend all that 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:41.800
 as a game and the game will have double 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.930
 of the size of the previous nitro deliveries 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.479
 speedway bots and it's also going to be a 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.190
 sandbox or be an open world the game 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.930
 It will also include real images that 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.720
 will be mixed with the images created 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.850
 by computer according to the same nelson goes 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.460
 to be very difficult to distinguish which are 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.110
 the real ones and which ones are created for 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.970
 that showed me this video in the 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.610
 conference where it's really done 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.759
 difficult to know what is real and what is not 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.759
 is 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.220
 my fa 16 for this conference 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.790
 electronic arts excelled with a guest 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.640
 of big size, the very same one who 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.130
 with a somewhat bruised English he remembered 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.010
 the first days in united states 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.970
 when he established the phrase forever 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.970
 'nice jogo' 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.320
 after this introduction one of the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.940
 fifa producers 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.640
 deivid words told us about the improvements 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.770
 that this game had one more defense 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.780
 realistic to be able to compete to a greater 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.459
 level new skills in the 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.560
 midfield and new plays for 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.080
 turn every goal opportunity into a 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.120
 true 'jogo bonito' talk about this 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.390
 way makes me look like an expert in 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.130
 football so do not even know a truth 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.840
 They included a new control system 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.790
 that adapts to all levels of the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.590
 players from the most expert up 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.620
 those who will just start playing with the 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.690
 guy to 16 just for me one of the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.000
 more expected features and that already 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.580
 we had previously announced it was 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.600
 the inclusion of women's teams 6 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.330
 gentlemen from 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.760
 we can play on fifa 16 with some 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.860
 women some very good others not so much 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.810
 I mean soccer, I mean the 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.690
 football and this has given a touch 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.910
 quite inclusive to fifa that has been 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.910
 praised in many parts of the world 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.330
 but at the moment 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.930
 if you are one of those people who 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.400
 he practically likes to do what he 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.520
 come to him in the world 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.700
 put in front give fists jumping jump 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.580
 kicking be a hero or in this case 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.030
 a heroine without superpowers mirror 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.340
 state canalis is the game for you in 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.040
 this delivery the study dais improves the 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.470
 original game gives us a superhero 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.720
 that for nothing in the world is going to touch a 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.550
 arms everything he does with his own hands 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.810
 and feet is one of the big ones 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.569
 features of this game 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.060
 the hero or the heroine will never be able to carry 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.040
 a weapon unlike other games in 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.870
 first person your aesthetic is very 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.290
 similar to the film minority 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.290
 report 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.889
 in this installment we are going to focus on 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:30.229
 the history of fate from his childhood until 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.090
 who becomes a hero at the end of the 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.400
 game there are going to be levels in this 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.350
 game which means that 0 screens 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.419
 of cargo quite interesting for a 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.460
 game of this type not the game is 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.129
 full of wells or riddles that we 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.129
 they will help in reaching the end 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:47.469
 of this and face the antagonist of 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:51.280
 fight of broker that is the owner of the 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:53.790
 corporation that governs the entire city 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.790

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.520
 good 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.510
 and finally a game where we can like that 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.510
 give the rebels 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:09.489
 unlike the movies in which 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:12.189
 the tricks no matter how much they shot at 

00:05:09.489 --> 00:05:14.769
 jan only the look and the eia never gave in 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:16.869
 the white dais and lucasfilm joined 

00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:19.269
 to give us a true 

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:22.119
 Game experience star wars 

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:23.919

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:32.949
 arts he was the one who said something like 

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:35.469
 we have not yet begun to see what is 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.779
 able and the results are already 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:39.550
 amazing talking about the engine 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:42.099
 graphic with which this was developed 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.199
 game road bites you can play as one 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:47.199
 of the great heroes or villains of the 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:49.629
 saga look vader or even the same fool 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.009
 fett you can embody battles you saw 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.839
 in the movies like the battle of 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.419
 game fly between the legs of the 

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:57.939

 all 'with a quota of up to 40 people 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:11.590

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:13.870
 get 40 people if they fine 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.700
 I was playing against each other 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.970
 personally it is one of the games that 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:21.070
 more I hope that it goes to the market goes to 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.830

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.590
 electronic arts in the past e3 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.690
