Frank<00:02:51.810> Miller's<00:02:52.109> probably<00:02:52.409> in<00:02:52.889> my<00:02:53.129> opinion<00:02:53.659> he

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
Frank Miller's probably in my opinion he

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.330 
Frank Miller's probably in my opinion he

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
needs a very big influence I mean I

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.780 
needs a very big influence I mean I
think<00:02:56.370> he's<00:02:56.669> probably<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:57.629> greatest
