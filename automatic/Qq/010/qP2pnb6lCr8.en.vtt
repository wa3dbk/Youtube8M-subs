00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
reasons on why i think it will not make

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.169 
reasons on why i think it will not make
it<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.559> metropcs<00:00:11.250> alright<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.000> unless

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
it on to metropcs alright so unless

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.669 
it on to metropcs alright so unless
you've<00:00:12.330> been<00:00:12.389> living<00:00:12.480> under<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:13.049> rock<00:00:13.139> for<00:00:13.380> the

you've been living under a rock for the
past<00:00:13.740> two<00:00:14.160> weeks<00:00:14.370> or<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:15.269> probably<00:00:15.599> have

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
past two weeks or so you probably have

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.870 
past two weeks or so you probably have
heard<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.410> galaxy<00:00:16.830> s4<00:00:17.160> was<00:00:17.400> released<00:00:17.699> by

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
heard that the galaxy s4 was released by

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.490 
heard that the galaxy s4 was released by
samsung<00:00:18.480> now<00:00:18.720> it's<00:00:18.840> going<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.020> be<00:00:19.080> making<00:00:19.289> it

if I can even say it but anyway metropcs
was<00:00:29.010> not<00:00:29.160> included<00:00:29.670> now<00:00:29.970> i'm<00:00:30.359> going<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.810> give

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
was not included now i'm going to give

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.780 
was not included now i'm going to give
you<00:00:30.960> my<00:00:31.199> two<00:00:31.260> reasons<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:31.859> why<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.369> probably

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
you my two reasons on why it probably

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.600 
you my two reasons on why it probably
will<00:00:32.910> not<00:00:33.149> make<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.660> first<00:00:33.899> one<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.559> price<00:00:34.800> if

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
will not make it first one the price if

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.040 
will not make it first one the price if
you're<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.880> be<00:00:35.969> buying<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.329> galaxy<00:00:36.750> s4

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
you're going to be buying the galaxy s4

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.360 
you're going to be buying the galaxy s4
off<00:00:37.140> contract<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.739> probably<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> cost

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
off contract is probably going to cost

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.910 
off contract is probably going to cost
about<00:00:38.809> seven<00:00:39.809> hundred<00:00:39.840> dollars<00:00:40.110> or<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.680> I

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
about seven hundred dollars or so I

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.100 
about seven hundred dollars or so I
remember<00:00:41.550> when<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.790> galaxy<00:00:42.210> s3<00:00:42.570> came<00:00:42.750> out<00:00:42.899> it

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
remember when the galaxy s3 came out it

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.610 
remember when the galaxy s3 came out it
came<00:00:43.260> out<00:00:43.379> six<00:00:43.739> months<00:00:44.070> after<00:00:45.440> pretty<00:00:46.440> much

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
came out six months after pretty much

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.860 
came out six months after pretty much
AT&amp;T<00:00:47.190> t-mobile<00:00:47.430> sprint<00:00:48.030> after<00:00:48.149> they<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:48.539> got

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
AT&amp;T t-mobile sprint after they all got

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.020 
AT&amp;T t-mobile sprint after they all got
the<00:00:49.079> major<00:00:49.289> carriers<00:00:49.620> got<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.820> was<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the major carriers got it and it was the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.910 
the major carriers got it and it was the
cheapest<00:00:51.420> off-contract<00:00:51.840> galaxy<00:00:52.559> s3<00:00:52.860> you

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
cheapest off-contract galaxy s3 you

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.770 
cheapest off-contract galaxy s3 you
could<00:00:53.070> buy<00:00:53.219> at<00:00:53.520> five<00:00:53.910> hundred<00:00:54.059> dollars<00:00:54.539> and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
could buy at five hundred dollars and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.930 
could buy at five hundred dollars and
that<00:00:54.960> even<00:00:55.260> was<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.590> big<00:00:55.770> hit<00:00:55.949> because<00:00:56.190> five

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
that even was a big hit because five

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.540 
that even was a big hit because five
hundred<00:00:57.210> dollars<00:00:57.420> plus<00:00:57.600> taxes<00:00:58.079> that's<00:00:58.550> that

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
hundred dollars plus taxes that's that

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.310 
hundred dollars plus taxes that's that
is<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.820> lot<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.149> money<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.780> anyway<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.289> said

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
is a lot of money so anyway like I said

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.869 
is a lot of money so anyway like I said
the<00:01:01.680> first<00:01:01.890> reason<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.219> probably<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.670> price

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the first reason is probably the price

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.939 
the first reason is probably the price
because<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.420> get<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> galaxy<00:01:04.049> s4<00:01:04.350> off<00:01:04.439> contract

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
because to get a galaxy s4 off contract

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.270 
because to get a galaxy s4 off contract
like<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.220> said<00:01:05.430> probably<00:01:05.820> 700<00:01:06.390> bucks<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.470> that

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
like I said probably 700 bucks so that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.880 
like I said probably 700 bucks so that
is<00:01:08.520> pretty<00:01:09.060> much<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.540> pretty<00:01:10.020> penny<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.500> pay<00:01:10.530> and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
is pretty much a pretty penny to pay and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.340 
is pretty much a pretty penny to pay and
the<00:01:11.040> second<00:01:11.400> reason<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.330> metropcs<00:01:12.659> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the second reason is the metropcs and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.440 
the second reason is the metropcs and
t-mobile<00:01:13.680> merger<00:01:14.159> now<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.790> one<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.390> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
t-mobile merger now this one is going to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.120 
t-mobile merger now this one is going to
have<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> little<00:01:15.869> bit<00:01:16.049> more<00:01:16.170> complications<00:01:16.920> in

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
have a little bit more complications in

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.950 
have a little bit more complications in
the<00:01:17.310> way<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.430> explain<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.750> whole<00:01:18.930> point

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
the way I explain it but the whole point

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.010 
the way I explain it but the whole point
is<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.650> phone<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.280> galaxy<00:01:20.700> s3<00:01:21.060> has<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
is this phone the galaxy s3 has a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.140 
is this phone the galaxy s3 has a
different<00:01:22.439> sort<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.040> band<00:01:23.310> inside<00:01:23.729> that

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
different sort of band inside that

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.010 
different sort of band inside that
accepts<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> cdma<00:01:25.470> band<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> 4g<00:01:26.610> LTE

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
accepts the cdma band and the 4g LTE

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.190 
accepts the cdma band and the 4g LTE
megahertz<00:01:28.020> man<00:01:28.200> whatever<00:01:29.119> spectrum<00:01:30.200> metropcs

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
megahertz man whatever spectrum metropcs

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.740 
megahertz man whatever spectrum metropcs
uses<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.650> their<00:01:31.799> 4g<00:01:32.159> LTE<00:01:32.490> now<00:01:33.329> because<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
uses for their 4g LTE now because of the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.270 
uses for their 4g LTE now because of the
merger<00:01:33.930> coming<00:01:34.380> up<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.680> would<00:01:34.770> be<00:01:34.829> pretty<00:01:35.070> much

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
merger coming up it would be pretty much

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.010 
merger coming up it would be pretty much
pointless<00:01:35.520> for<00:01:35.909> samsung<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.540> make<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.689> phone

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
pointless for samsung to make a phone

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.950 
pointless for samsung to make a phone
that<00:01:37.770> would<00:01:37.890> accept<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> cdma<00:01:38.850> bands<00:01:39.270> when

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
that would accept the cdma bands when

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.120 
that would accept the cdma bands when
they're<00:01:40.170> eventually<00:01:40.350> going<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.860> shut<00:01:41.070> down

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
they're eventually going to be shut down

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.770 
they're eventually going to be shut down
and<00:01:41.310> switched<00:01:41.640> over<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:41.970> t-mobile's<00:01:42.720> network

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and switched over to t-mobile's network

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.690 
and switched over to t-mobile's network
so<00:01:43.380> i<00:01:43.590> doubt<00:01:44.100> they're<00:01:44.310> going<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.490> be<00:01:44.549> making

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
so i doubt they're going to be making

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.149 
so i doubt they're going to be making
galaxy<00:01:45.329> s4<00:01:45.750> for<00:01:46.079> Metro<00:01:46.409> unless<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.979> only

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
galaxy s4 for Metro unless it only

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.490 
galaxy s4 for Metro unless it only
accepts<00:01:47.610> 4G<00:01:48.210> LTE<00:01:48.390> which<00:01:48.960> would<00:01:49.110> be<00:01:49.229> pretty

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
accepts 4G LTE which would be pretty

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.170 
accepts 4G LTE which would be pretty
dumb<00:01:49.710> because<00:01:49.950> there's<00:01:50.220> no<00:01:50.369> backup<00:01:50.610> network

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
dumb because there's no backup network

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.410 
dumb because there's no backup network
for<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.640> will<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.790> go<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.060> metro

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
for that so will it be go in the metro

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.690 
for that so will it be go in the metro
most<00:01:55.049> likely<00:01:55.350> not<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.310> do<00:01:56.430> want<00:01:56.460> to

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
most likely not but if you do want to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.100 
most likely not but if you do want to
get<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.149> would<00:01:57.420> recommend<00:01:57.689> getting<00:01:57.869> on

get it I would recommend getting on

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.810 
get it I would recommend getting on
