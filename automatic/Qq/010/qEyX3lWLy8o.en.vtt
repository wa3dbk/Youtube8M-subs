00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
one thing to keep in mind the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.910 
one thing to keep in mind the
consistency<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.990> actually<00:01:40.439> pretty<00:01:40.619> thin<00:01:40.890> on

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.969 
consistency is actually pretty thin on
these<00:01:41.840> but<00:01:42.840> as<00:01:42.990> far<00:01:43.229> as<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.470> cleaning<00:01:43.829> ability

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
these but as far as the cleaning ability

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.219 
these but as far as the cleaning ability
I<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.399> think<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.939> cleans<00:01:45.210> very<00:01:45.329> well<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.049> it

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
I do think it cleans very well so it

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.310 
I do think it cleans very well so it
does<00:01:46.380> its<00:01:46.560> job<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.689> but<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.720> didn't<00:01:49.110> feel

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
does its job for that but I didn't feel

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.260 
does its job for that but I didn't feel
like<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.710> was<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> spectacular<00:01:50.220> performer<00:01:51.149> I

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
like this was a spectacular performer I

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.359 
like this was a spectacular performer I
think<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.600> one<00:01:51.780> was<00:01:51.869> just<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.500> alright

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
think this one was just on the alright

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.120 
think this one was just on the alright
version<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.540> don't<00:01:55.229> think<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.619> would<00:01:55.829> run<00:01:55.979> out

questionable<00:02:39.560> on<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:41.090> I<00:02:41.120> didn't<00:02:41.510> think<00:02:41.600> this

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
questionable on so I didn't think this

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.300 
questionable on so I didn't think this
woman<00:02:41.990> would<00:02:42.110> perform<00:02:42.560> very<00:02:42.860> well<00:02:43.040> but

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
woman would perform very well but

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.400 
woman would perform very well but
surprisingly<00:02:44.090> out<00:02:44.360> of<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.600> three<00:02:44.900> for<00:02:45.260> my

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
surprisingly out of the three for my

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.400 
surprisingly out of the three for my
hair<00:02:45.710> it<00:02:45.950> was<00:02:46.100> seemed<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.340> work<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.670> best<00:02:46.820> so

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
hair it was seemed to work the best so

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.810 
hair it was seemed to work the best so
although<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:48.620> don't<00:02:48.740> like<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.310> scent<00:02:49.490> at<00:02:49.670> all

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
although I don't like the scent at all

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.580 
although I don't like the scent at all
it<00:02:50.030> has<00:02:50.210> a<00:02:50.240> similar<00:02:50.600> texture<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.440> other

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
it has a similar texture to the other

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.530 
it has a similar texture to the other
one<00:02:51.860> with<00:02:52.100> being<00:02:52.310> kind<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.550> thin<00:02:52.820> but<00:02:53.150> this<00:02:53.390> one

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
one with being kind of thin but this one

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.450 
one with being kind of thin but this one
has<00:02:53.720> more<00:02:53.960> lather<00:02:54.260> that<00:02:54.710> I<00:02:54.920> find<00:02:55.190> in

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
has more lather that I find in

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.780 
has more lather that I find in
comparison<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:57.190> because<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.220> have<00:02:58.430> curly<00:02:58.670> hair

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
comparison and because I have curly hair

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.820 
comparison and because I have curly hair
naturally<00:02:59.570> I<00:02:59.600> do<00:02:59.780> find<00:03:00.230> that<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.380> protein

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
naturally I do find that the protein

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.770 
naturally I do find that the protein
seems<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.310> react<00:03:01.550> well<00:03:01.760> with<00:03:01.790> my<00:03:02.090> hair<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.540> don't

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
and found that this was probably my

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.850 
and found that this was probably my
least<00:03:37.580> favorite<00:03:38.420> out<00:03:38.600> of<00:03:38.630> all<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:38.870> them<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.500> I

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
least favorite out of all of them and I

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.590 
least favorite out of all of them and I

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
was really surprised by that because I

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.300 
was really surprised by that because I
was<00:03:41.720> encouraged<00:03:42.170> by<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.440> smell<00:03:42.830> the<00:03:43.070> scent

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
was encouraged by the smell the scent

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.240 
was encouraged by the smell the scent
was<00:03:43.489> you<00:03:43.760> know<00:03:43.880> pleasant<00:03:44.650> it<00:03:45.650> doesn't<00:03:46.040> lather

unfortunately but if you just like to

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.530 
unfortunately but if you just like to
try<00:04:14.040> something<00:04:14.460> out<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.640> you<00:04:15.420> know

try something out and you know

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.449 
try something out and you know
definitely<00:04:16.320> go<00:04:16.440> for<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.799> but<00:04:17.040> I<00:04:17.070> would<00:04:17.340> be

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
definitely go for it but I would be

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.009 
definitely go for it but I would be
careful<00:04:17.670> because<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.329> did<00:04:18.660> feel<00:04:18.690> like<00:04:18.870> it

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
careful because I did feel like it

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.380 
careful because I did feel like it
stripped<00:04:19.440> my<00:04:19.650> hair<00:04:19.890> too<00:04:20.430> much<00:04:20.459> with<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.120> green

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390

tea<00:04:21.720> tree<00:04:22.079> oil<00:04:22.320> one<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:23.580> actually<00:04:24.000> felt<00:04:24.210> like

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
tea tree oil one it actually felt like

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.330 
tea tree oil one it actually felt like
my<00:04:24.480> hair<00:04:24.630> was<00:04:24.750> kind<00:04:24.870> of<00:04:24.990> squeaky<00:04:25.620> which<00:04:26.040> I

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
my hair was kind of squeaky which I

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.310 
my hair was kind of squeaky which I
don't<00:04:26.640> think<00:04:26.850> was<00:04:26.970> very<00:04:27.000> you<00:04:27.540> know<00:04:27.630> good<00:04:28.020> for

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
don't think was very you know good for

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.830 
don't think was very you know good for
keeping<00:04:28.470> it<00:04:28.740> hydrated<00:04:29.310> or<00:04:29.430> nourished<00:04:29.880> so<00:04:30.360> so

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
keeping it hydrated or nourished so so

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.390 
keeping it hydrated or nourished so so
after<00:04:31.170> testing<00:04:31.530> all<00:04:31.740> three<00:04:31.980> of<00:04:32.070> these<00:04:32.220> out

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
after testing all three of these out

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.100 
after testing all three of these out
unfortunately<00:04:33.180> I'm<00:04:33.390> gonna<00:04:33.510> have<00:04:33.630> to<00:04:33.840> say<00:04:33.990> that
