drill and then dinner was going so I was

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.700 
drill and then dinner was going so I was
running<00:00:49.720> around<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:49.930> halls<00:00:50.110> and<00:00:50.440> I've<00:00:50.530> seen

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
running around the halls and I've seen

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.020 
running around the halls and I've seen
fire<00:00:50.920> exit<00:00:51.250> icing<00:00:51.460> other<00:00:51.579> people<00:00:51.790> going<00:00:51.850> out

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
fire exit icing other people going out

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.910 
fire exit icing other people going out
of<00:00:52.180> it<00:00:52.300> so<00:00:52.809> I'd<00:00:52.870> too<00:00:52.960> broad<00:00:53.140> and<00:00:53.260> do<00:00:53.350> that<00:00:53.559> and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
of it so I'd too broad and do that and

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.310 
of it so I'd too broad and do that and
so<00:00:54.640> it<00:00:54.850> was<00:00:55.030> a<00:00:55.089> horrible<00:00:55.449> experience<00:00:55.690> of

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
so it was a horrible experience of

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.899 
so it was a horrible experience of
fairness<00:00:56.530> and<00:00:57.129> apparently<00:00:57.519> vigils<00:00:57.760> will<00:00:57.850> be

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
fairness and apparently vigils will be

00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:59.819 
fairness and apparently vigils will be
testing<00:00:58.300> it<00:00:58.390> again<00:00:58.659> in<00:00:58.899> any<00:00:59.079> minute<00:00:59.350> now<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.739> I
