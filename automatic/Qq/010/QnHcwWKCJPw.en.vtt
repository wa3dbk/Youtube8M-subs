00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 we therefore both received ranking and such training and then a conversation with the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.860
 national coach 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.310
 well of course the animals are diamond borrowers and certainly with those in the 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.569
 counterattack and team it is of course one 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:13.509
 lee 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.150
 come to the tip 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.050
 the best of the Dutch youth comes here to apply 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.210
 selects the institute and it once and then is there again 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.589
 weather freezing and 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.899
 they ask questions in the olympic committee 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.899
 well and still worked to further develop andy ram those axes 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.290
 tips for years of scholarships 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.749
 that is the purpose of these stores and yes 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:37.840
 the number 130 euros 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.770
 According to the teams Cosyns want HIV done by China and that crowds and half 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.110
 can do for a year 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.010
 and we understand that a pole is the slider kenneth of 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.200
 personality type that is why it was very important 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.630
 because they get to know themselves better and so did the team 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.630
 violence and numbers are alders 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.840
 coach has been spotted by 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.670
 horse owners and yes and within that performance that is surprising 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.200
 the concept of young 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.520
 how do you like this week and especially very educational 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.240
 it's very nice 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.110
 all the stories themselves a number of months and the national coaches is a certain thing 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.970
 to experience 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.120
 certainly interesting is the best thing a couple 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.120
 it is then looked at the experience 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.830
 Yes 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.870
 New York treatment but came to an end for decades 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.820
 I also don't know why in five years 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.560
 therefore the company naturally needs you 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.640
 striking was that one 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.540
 Talent animals are inventing from the barn and can jump here 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.500
 of course a whole lot of learning 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.270
 that is a specific part that you pay extra attention to today as 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.610
 first spring ride 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.490
 well i don't like the first hour is made in the final phase by the mental 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.270
 resilience 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.140
 and there is certainly a coffee after all well done but then 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.880
 human trafficking 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.940
 years and not less 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.270
 it was not posted 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.300
 certainly 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.020
 almost no more room
