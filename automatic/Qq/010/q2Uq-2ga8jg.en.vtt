bothers me is that this entire bag tends
to<00:06:22.009> vibrate<00:06:22.550> when<00:06:22.930> turning<00:06:23.930> on<00:06:24.199> the<00:06:24.380> volume

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
to vibrate when turning on the volume

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.339 
to vibrate when turning on the volume
turning<00:06:25.039> up<00:06:25.220> the<00:06:25.370> body<00:06:25.580> and<00:06:26.150> that<00:06:26.569> music<00:06:26.990> is
