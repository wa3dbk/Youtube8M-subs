 is convinced because that why 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.530
 the snake is so important because the

 the drawing of the creation of a propeller 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.930
 of a DNA chain and why a 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.670
 chance a snake why because 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.280
 when they created these human slaves 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.680
 they wanted to see them with their own gene 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.540
 in some cases with humans 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.820

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.820

 only in the DNA as established in the 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.460

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.890
 is in cash with Greek symbols 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.739
