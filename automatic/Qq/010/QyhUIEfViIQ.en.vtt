00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 every time the new technician becomes 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:07.580
 charge of the selection is spoken of eras 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.580
 so the martino era began 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.440
 exactly I think it was if you want 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.759
 the only setback in his career clear 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.330
 we are also talking about a challenge 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.270
 important as the barcelona 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.060
 it was not easy to get up so quickly 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.350
 had a year I think that deep down is a 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.080
 man so smart that he's going to 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.400
 capitalize in a positive way and that 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.050
 will serve a lot for this new 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.970
 cycle that faces in charge of the selection 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.800
 national in Paraguay did very well and 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.290
 generally on all computers where 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.320
 it was triumph the martyr tata who 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.879
 we remember has a link or is going to have 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.530
 a link that will link you to the 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.850
 end of the tie with the 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.220
 Argentine selection this is 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.629
 automatically renewable clear is 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.420
 for the world cup that is going to be in 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.460
 russia the period is made until the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.290
 eliminatory in the hypothetical case of no 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.330
 classify why that's up there is 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.790
 only a formality but in fact 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.530
 is going to be the coach of the national team 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.900
 Argentina for the next world cup 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.790
 the interference that will want to have the 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.840
 martino 'tata' youth on me 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.420
 it seems to be a very important detail 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.479
 Argentina has promising youngsters 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.830
 always in fact most of the 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.560
 players who arrive at the selection 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.880
 older they come from there at 20 22 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.260
 years can practically be 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.119
 holders of the senior team 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.150
 before that they are components of the 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.100
 sub-20 the tata martino that starts with 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.840
 his coaching staff that has won some 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.180
 important decisions fundamentally 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.150
 what the juveniles said and also in 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.220
 the part of the technical secretariat with the 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.470
 president the current president of level 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.020
 deaf man his rosary 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.300
 absolute confidence as william 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.540
 lorente the tata martino and its new cycle 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.280
 in the albiceleste 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.730
 in my return from barcelona there was 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.730
 decided 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.860
 stop a time evidently from the 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.860
 Argentine team 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.180
 is a 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.060
 a job that is not common to all 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.670
 [Music] 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:10.730
 it implies a work commitment but 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:13.340
 also a sentimental commitment and 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:16.269
 about 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.129
 to the goals and the longing we have 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.340
 fundamentally is to work with a lot 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.340
 professionalism 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.850
 and continue to maintain a line that has 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.510
 started with this with this job 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:34.360
 made by alejandro that has been 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.310
 and wonderful but above all much more 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.120
 beyond the result that sometimes ends 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.959
 being anecdotal and obviously 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.269
 we hope to have the possibility of 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.760
 do it and especially to take it to good 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.610
 port and to know what role it will have in your 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.000
 team -messi and on the other hand the role that 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.280
 has Mascherano and the second is if there 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.159
 Some player in your cycle that is going to have 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.360
 the doors closed as happened in the 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:08.460
 previous cycle in the case of tevez 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:12.120
 good to see first I think a little 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:15.870
 from outside a little from inside 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.670
 that I think there is a decision in the 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.850
 last question and once and there have been 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.350
 a decision 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:26.510
 of the coach that did not imply that there 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.800
 closed door for nobody simply 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.800
 a football decision 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.220
 and obviously if I say no, the 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.530
 his decision was purely 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.090
 football in my case all the 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.510
 Argentine footballers have the 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.510
 open doors 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.409
 in the case of leo and good javier 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.040
 I have the advantage of having lived with 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.970
 them a year and know how they think and how 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.120
 train 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.010
 having talked a long time the role 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.799
 de leo is the role 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.629
 here in Barcelona or wherever you go is the role 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.030
 of the best player in the world and the 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:07.010
 responsibility that it entails and in the 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.110
 case of javier 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.030
 I have the feeling that we have 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.290
 discovered 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.530
 you have now discovered a 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.540
 leadership that for me a long time ago 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.690
 that exists 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.230
 the 'tata' martino in numbers was born in 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.910
 rosario on November 20, 1962 was 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.100
 The news of Carlos Tevez is very good 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.810
 I hope that it can be translated into 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.760
 reality of this I wanted to say and 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.710
 also while we see the data from the 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.060
 Tata Martino wanted to say that Argentina 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.190
 You can get to play the cup 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.460
 confederations if it's that germany win 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.200
 the eurocopa more details of the tata 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.550
 martino air let's say the birth and 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.590
 some of the clubs where he started his 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.140
 sports career in Paraguay that was 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.780
 barbarian with freedom there three stars 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.210
 and three titles with porteño hills 2003 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.690
 4 colón de santa fe 2005 levels at 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.000
 borde rosario 2013 barcelona 2013 now 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.010
 if there is no one to be put in the 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.050
 supercopa road of spain and the 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.000
 Paraguayan selection where he managed 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.340
 practically the main merits 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.550
 the quarterfinals of the cup of the 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.440
 copa america in 2007 you remember 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.670
 which was here in Argentina the 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.190
 quarterfinals of the World Cup 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.140
 South Africa how to forget it not in 2010 almost 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.670
 leaves it out to the Spanish team that 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:25.190
 then he became world champion 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:27.930
 super cup champion is a champion and 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.820
 runner-up in the glass is complicating me 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.050
 but now I see it well runner-up of the 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.100
 copa america and in 2011 but as 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.140
 forget about the tour of tata martino 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.780
 that if it is true has that debt 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:43.740
 pending by the barcelona arrived it to 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.530
 driving too and it's not an excuse 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.669
 had to make the necessary replacement the 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.099
 barcelona already went into crisis 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.900
 definitely and this forces a 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.789
 renovation just and in shape 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.610
 unfortunate for the wishes of the 'tata' 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:58.169
 martino was under his command a 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.259
 technician who arrives with the best 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.819
 possibilities absolutely right in 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:04.919
 this moment after the same that 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:08.220
 experience of Barcelona but with the 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:12.030
 necessary international experience with 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.190
 a Paraguayan team that played better than 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.539
 never in his story did he participate in the 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.280
 world cup also in very shape 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.960
 competitive super champion with newell's 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.789
 old boys of rosario 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.569
 I wish luck to the martini tata 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.569
 thank you
