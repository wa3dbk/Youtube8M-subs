because<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.399> a<00:01:26.579> stage<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.299> go<00:01:27.450> through

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
because it's a stage that you go through

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.870 
because it's a stage that you go through
just<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.409> stage<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.710> everybody<00:01:29.310> goes<00:01:29.549> through

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
just a stage that everybody goes through

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.039

in their own different level or

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.959 
in their own different level or
variances<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.810> it's<00:01:33.810> mostly<00:01:34.729> driven<00:01:35.729> by

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
variances and it's mostly driven by

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:41.240
