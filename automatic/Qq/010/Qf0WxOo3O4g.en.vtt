00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
specialist can then take that piece of

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.700 
specialist can then take that piece of
content<00:02:02.030> for<00:02:03.030> example<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.510> x-ray<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:04.230> I<00:02:04.530> can

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
content for example this x-ray and I can

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.530 
content for example this x-ray and I can
do<00:02:04.800> things<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.070> magnify<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.760> if<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.390> was<00:02:06.510> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
do things like magnify it if it was a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.960 
do things like magnify it if it was a
video<00:02:06.870> I<00:02:06.930> could<00:02:07.200> play<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.560> video<00:02:07.860> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
video I could play the video and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.219 
video I could play the video and
use<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.210> human<00:02:09.479> body<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.899> show<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
use the human body to show the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.990 
use the human body to show the
association<00:02:10.950> between<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.400> video<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.850> the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
association between this video and the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.210 
association between this video and the
body<00:02:12.210> so<00:02:12.420> for<00:02:12.450> example<00:02:12.960> I<00:02:13.140> can<00:02:13.530> just<00:02:13.800> touch<00:02:14.010> the

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
body so for example I can just touch the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.340 
body so for example I can just touch the
heart<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.700> automatically<00:02:15.450> we<00:02:15.690> see<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> line<00:02:16.170> is

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
heart and automatically we see a line is

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.680 
heart and automatically we see a line is
drawn<00:02:16.620> from<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.340> heart<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.850> that<00:02:18.150> piece<00:02:18.570> of

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
drawn from the heart to that piece of

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.500 
drawn from the heart to that piece of
content<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.980> there<00:02:20.490> you<00:02:20.580> have<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.850> it's<00:02:21.210> a<00:02:21.300> very

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
content so there you have it it's a very

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.180 
content so there you have it it's a very
quick<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:21.840> natural<00:02:22.410> way<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.740> which<00:02:22.890> patients

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
quick and natural way in which patients

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.430 
quick and natural way in which patients
and<00:02:23.580> doctors<00:02:23.700> can<00:02:24.290> communicate<00:02:25.290> with<00:02:25.410> each

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
and doctors can communicate with each

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.110 
and doctors can communicate with each
other<00:02:25.680> about<00:02:25.830> medical<00:02:26.520> conditions<00:02:26.970> and

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
other about medical conditions and

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.240 
other about medical conditions and
procedures<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:28.290> just<00:02:28.440> one<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.040> many

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
procedures and it's just one of the many

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.520 
procedures and it's just one of the many
ways<00:02:29.490> in<00:02:29.730> which<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.030> Microsoft<00:02:30.480> Surface<00:02:30.720> can

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
ways in which the Microsoft Surface can

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.910 
ways in which the Microsoft Surface can
assist<00:02:31.920> medical<00:02:32.400> professionals
