00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
practical jokes are great fun as long as

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.079 
practical jokes are great fun as long as
they<00:00:11.299> work<00:00:11.570> very<00:00:12.379> cool<00:00:12.709> but<00:00:13.339> as<00:00:13.519> we've<00:00:13.790> seen

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
they work very cool but as we've seen

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.170 
they work very cool but as we've seen
the<00:00:14.150> phone<00:00:14.900> fizzer<00:00:15.410> from<00:00:15.769> the<00:00:15.860> fansite<00:00:16.400> barely

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
the phone fizzer from the fansite barely

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.970 
the phone fizzer from the fansite barely
registered<00:00:17.870> on<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:18.080> Franco<00:00:18.650> meter

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
registered on the Franco meter

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.800 
registered on the Franco meter
uh<00:00:19.130> this<00:00:19.700> is<00:00:19.850> probably<00:00:19.880> the<00:00:20.150> lamest<00:00:20.330> prank

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
uh this is probably the lamest prank

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.960 
uh this is probably the lamest prank
I've<00:00:21.170> ever<00:00:21.350> seen<00:00:21.680> it's<00:00:22.100> a<00:00:22.520> microscopic

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
I've ever seen it's a microscopic

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.750 
I've ever seen it's a microscopic
proportions<00:00:23.810> so<00:00:24.410> now<00:00:24.650> the<00:00:24.710> team<00:00:25.070> is<00:00:25.100> taking<00:00:25.640> it

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
proportions so now the team is taking it

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
proportions so now the team is taking it
to<00:00:26.050> absolute<00:00:27.050> max<00:00:27.650> with<00:00:28.190> 25<00:00:29.000> gallons<00:00:29.540> of

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:29.780 
to absolute max with 25 gallons of

to absolute max with 25 gallons of
something<00:00:30.290> called<00:00:30.560> a<00:00:30.800> B<00:00:31.340> foam<00:00:31.760> a<00:00:32.149> B<00:00:32.450> foam<00:00:32.719> it

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
something called a B foam a B foam it

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.960 
something called a B foam a B foam it
comes<00:00:32.990> as<00:00:33.170> a<00:00:33.200> liquid<00:00:33.440> it's<00:00:33.830> two<00:00:34.220> parts<00:00:34.430> you<00:00:34.760> mix

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
comes as a liquid it's two parts you mix

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.550 
comes as a liquid it's two parts you mix
equal<00:00:35.210> parts<00:00:35.390> together<00:00:35.750> and<00:00:36.110> then<00:00:36.380> you<00:00:36.440> have

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
equal parts together and then you have

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.440 
equal parts together and then you have
about<00:00:36.740> 30<00:00:36.920> seconds<00:00:37.400> of<00:00:37.490> mixing<00:00:38.000> time<00:00:38.180> before

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
about 30 seconds of mixing time before

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.600 
about 30 seconds of mixing time before
it<00:00:38.510> starts<00:00:38.780> expanding<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:39.740> foaming<00:00:39.890> up<00:00:40.130> but

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
it starts expanding and foaming up but

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.670 
it starts expanding and foaming up but
once<00:00:40.850> it<00:00:41.000> sets<00:00:41.240> after<00:00:41.540> about<00:00:41.660> 20<00:00:41.990> minutes<00:00:42.020> it's

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
once it sets after about 20 minutes it's

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.710 
once it sets after about 20 minutes it's
a<00:00:42.829> hard<00:00:43.280> rigid<00:00:44.230> dense<00:00:45.230> foam<00:00:45.880> in<00:00:46.880> fact<00:00:47.210> it's<00:00:47.450> so

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
a hard rigid dense foam in fact it's so

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.530 
a hard rigid dense foam in fact it's so
quick<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:48.200> expand<00:00:48.680> and<00:00:48.950> so<00:00:49.370> cohesive<00:00:49.820> that

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
quick to expand and so cohesive that

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.569 
quick to expand and so cohesive that
when<00:00:50.780> Adam<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:51.170> Jamie<00:00:51.470> blew<00:00:51.920> up<00:00:52.100> a<00:00:52.250> plane

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
when Adam and Jamie blew up a plane

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.160 
when Adam and Jamie blew up a plane
they<00:00:53.210> used<00:00:53.480> a<00:00:53.720> B<00:00:54.079> foam<00:00:54.440> to<00:00:54.829> seal<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.730> deal

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
they used a B foam to seal the deal

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.349 
they used a B foam to seal the deal
attention<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.290> plane<00:00:57.560> is<00:00:57.860> live

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.600 

but<00:01:02.359> when<00:01:02.570> a/b<00:01:02.899> foam<00:01:03.170> is<00:01:03.379> mixed<00:01:03.829> it<00:01:03.949> gives<00:01:04.400> off

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
but when a/b foam is mixed it gives off

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.690 
but when a/b foam is mixed it gives off
heat<00:01:04.640> in<00:01:05.210> an<00:01:05.449> exothermic<00:01:05.960> reaction<00:01:06.440> and<00:01:07.159> with

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
heat in an exothermic reaction and with

heat in an exothermic reaction and with
25<00:01:08.360> gallons<00:01:08.960> of<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:09.170> stuff<00:01:09.470> that's<00:01:10.040> even<00:01:10.369> got
