to<00:01:37.060> have<00:01:37.150> a<00:01:37.180> lot<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.970> really<00:01:40.150> want<00:01:40.270> to

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
to have a lot and you really want to

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.050 
to have a lot and you really want to
concentrate<00:01:40.480> on<00:01:40.870> Spain<00:01:41.410> Italy<00:01:42.100> Germany<00:01:42.670> and

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
concentrate on Spain Italy Germany and

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.050 
concentrate on Spain Italy Germany and
premier<00:01:43.900> league<00:01:44.050> matches<00:01:44.290> and<00:01:44.680> perhaps<00:01:45.670> early

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
premier league matches and perhaps early

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.820 
premier league matches and perhaps early
Scottish<00:01:46.900> as<00:01:47.740> well<00:01:48.630> today<00:01:49.630> we<00:01:49.840> have<00:01:49.870> Napoli

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
Scottish as well today we have Napoli

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.540 
Scottish as well today we have Napoli
into<00:01:51.130> which<00:01:51.570> Napoli<00:01:52.570> aren't<00:01:53.040> as<00:01:54.040> short<00:01:54.340> as<00:01:54.430> we

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
into which Napoli aren't as short as we

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.400 
into which Napoli aren't as short as we
would<00:01:54.700> perhaps<00:01:54.820> like<00:01:55.030> but<00:01:55.390> is<00:01:55.510> it's<00:01:56.020> got<00:01:56.230> a<00:01:56.260> low

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
would perhaps like but is it's got a low

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.260 
would perhaps like but is it's got a low
draw<00:01:56.680> price<00:01:56.950> so<00:01:57.310> this<00:01:57.460> is<00:01:57.580> one<00:01:57.730> that's<00:01:57.880> perhaps

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
draw price so this is one that's perhaps

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.420 
draw price so this is one that's perhaps
worth<00:01:58.570> looking<00:01:58.930> at<00:01:59.020> so<00:02:00.010> we<00:02:00.070> click<00:02:00.250> on<00:02:00.370> the
