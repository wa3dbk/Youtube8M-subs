I<00:01:00.440> think<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.559> really<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.980> important<00:01:02.699> for<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
I think it really is important for the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.890 
I think it really is important for the
kids<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.559> understand<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.509> world<00:01:06.720> is

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
