I<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.530> purchased<00:01:04.710> these<00:01:05.129> last<00:01:05.489> week<00:01:05.790> so

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
I just purchased these last week so

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.480 
I just purchased these last week so
these<00:01:06.360> are<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.979> 45<00:01:07.979> North

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
these are the 45 North

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.630 
these are the 45 North
Dillinger<00:01:09.240> fives<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.380> these<00:01:10.619> are<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
Dillinger fives so these are the the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.600 
Dillinger fives so these are the the
five<00:01:11.880> inch<00:01:12.119> or<00:01:12.360> 4.8<00:01:13.170> inch<00:01:13.380> version<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.460> this

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
five inch or 4.8 inch version of this

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.920 
five inch or 4.8 inch version of this
tire

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
tire

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.480 
tire
they<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:17.299> 258<00:01:18.299> studs

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
they have 258 studs

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.600 
they have 258 studs
it<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> tread<00:01:21.630> that's<00:01:22.439> designed<00:01:22.860> supposedly

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
it is a tread that's designed supposedly

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.440 
it is a tread that's designed supposedly
with<00:01:23.850> some<00:01:25.460> reduced<00:01:26.460> rolling<00:01:26.790> resistance<00:01:26.909> in

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
with some reduced rolling resistance in

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.859 
with some reduced rolling resistance in
mind

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
mind

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.499 
mind
unlike<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> loo<00:01:29.820> so

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
unlike the the but in the loo so

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.390 
unlike the the but in the loo so
hopefully<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.049> does<00:01:31.229> roll<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> little<00:01:31.829> faster

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
hopefully it does roll a little faster

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.370 
hopefully it does roll a little faster
than<00:01:32.549> then<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.270> but<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> loo<00:01:33.810> even<00:01:34.140> though

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
than then the but in the loo even though

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.760 
than then the but in the loo even though
they<00:01:34.530> are<00:01:34.680> studded<00:01:35.189> they<00:01:36.150> are<00:01:36.530> they<00:01:37.530> are<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
they are studded they are they are the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.850 
they are studded they are they are the
beautiful<00:01:38.150> concave<00:01:39.150> studs<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.380> they<00:01:40.560> got<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
beautiful concave studs so they got the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.560 
beautiful concave studs so they got the
little<00:01:41.100> hole<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> middle<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.150> provide

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
little hole in the middle to provide

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.679 
little hole in the middle to provide
extra<00:01:43.259> bite<00:01:43.560> which<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.399> good<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.729> bad<00:01:44.909> because

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
extra bite which is good and bad because

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.760 
extra bite which is good and bad because
I<00:01:45.750> think<00:01:45.780> yeah<00:01:46.380> you're<00:01:46.560> gonna<00:01:46.680> have

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
I think yeah you're gonna have

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.100 
I think yeah you're gonna have
exceptional<00:01:47.579> bite<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:48.000> ice<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.570> super<00:01:48.930> hard

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
exceptional bite on ice and super hard

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.420 
exceptional bite on ice and super hard
packed<00:01:49.320> snow<00:01:49.470> with<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.070> think<00:01:50.310> it

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
packed snow with that but I think it

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.450 
packed snow with that but I think it
will<00:01:50.729> make<00:01:50.790> them<00:01:51.470> less<00:01:52.470> durable<00:01:52.950> when<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.280> do

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
will make them less durable when you do

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.240 
will make them less durable when you do
get<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.060> pavement<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.720> possibly<00:01:55.649> hit<00:01:56.009> rocks

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
get on pavement and possibly hit rocks

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.530 
get on pavement and possibly hit rocks
with<00:01:56.610> them<00:01:56.790> when<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.060> do<00:01:57.180> do<00:01:57.329> some

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
with them when you do do some

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.260 
with them when you do do some
off-roading<00:01:58.399> but<00:01:59.399> apparently<00:01:59.729> these<00:01:59.880> studs

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
off-roading but apparently these studs

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.149 
off-roading but apparently these studs
are<00:02:00.450> replaceable<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.259> can<00:02:01.469> pull<00:02:01.890> them<00:02:02.040> out

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
are replaceable you can pull them out

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139

durability of these studs in terms of

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.369 
durability of these studs in terms of

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
writing them on pavement and such it'll

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.679 
writing them on pavement and such it'll
hold<00:02:54.560> off<00:02:54.799> putting<00:02:54.919> them<00:02:55.459> we<00:02:55.970> don't<00:02:56.150> we've

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
hold off putting them we don't we've

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.050

because people are always curious about

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:35.189 
because people are always curious about
the<00:04:33.560> weights<00:04:33.860> I<00:04:34.129> work<00:04:34.370> in<00:04:34.610> a<00:04:34.729> medical

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
the weights I work in a medical

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.709 
the weights I work in a medical
microbiology<00:04:36.199> lab<00:04:36.379> so<00:04:37.009> we<00:04:37.520> have<00:04:37.729> a<00:04:37.759> very

00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:38.719 
microbiology lab so we have a very

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:40.450 
microbiology lab so we have a very
accurate<00:04:38.930> scale<00:04:39.409> that<00:04:39.620> gets<00:04:39.800> calibrated

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
accurate scale that gets calibrated

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.860 
accurate scale that gets calibrated
pretty<00:04:41.000> much<00:04:41.150> every<00:04:41.389> year<00:04:41.659> so<00:04:43.539> what<00:04:44.539> were<00:04:44.689> they

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
pretty much every year so what were they

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.969 
pretty much every year so what were they
there<00:04:45.110> are<00:04:45.639> 1,400<00:04:46.639> one<00:04:46.909> of<00:04:47.000> them<00:04:47.120> was<00:04:47.979> 1451

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
there are 1,400 one of them was 1451

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:54.429 
there are 1,400 one of them was 1451
grams<00:04:49.280> and<00:04:49.699> one<00:04:49.849> of<00:04:50.000> them<00:04:50.120> was<00:04:50.419> 1,000<00:04:53.439> 454

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:54.439 
grams and one of them was 1,000 454

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:56.409 
grams and one of them was 1,000 454
grams<00:04:54.469> so<00:04:55.099> there's<00:04:55.310> only<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.669> three<00:04:56.270> gram

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
grams so there's only a three gram

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.089 
grams so there's only a three gram
difference<00:04:56.900> between<00:04:57.229> the<00:04:57.379> tires<00:04:57.590> which<00:04:57.919> is
