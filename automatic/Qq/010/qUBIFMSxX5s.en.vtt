00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.330
 or when android tablets exist in the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.279
 market will certainly get hundreds 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.820
 them and something that called me to 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:28.439
 attention on the hp tablet is the extreme 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:32.520
 Like he has with the ipad me I 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.880
 I have the ipad here in my left hand. 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.510
 and there's hp here in my right hand 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.399
 Look how similar they are and put 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.520
 these users there to see you have 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.719
 various models various forms factor but 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.360
 similar to hp with ipad me is a 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.039
 thing that really calls attention and does not 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.510
 I know how apple has not gone up yet. 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.090
 and probably because they have a 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.879
 long-term partnership just for the people 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.640
 have an idea that I'm comparing 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:12.510
 with the philips that they are well 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:18.390
 different from asus has a 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:20.689
 similar to a galaxytab 21 galaxytab 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.000
 3 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:30.439
 look size and proportion all 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:37.220
 different here one from the lg 500 model 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:37.220
 here we have a nexus 7 2013 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:50.659
 Notice very different aspect ratio 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:53.310
 finishing here a samsung galaxytab 8 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.320
 maybe the closest is but you can see 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.369
 that the different camera has a little calf 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:04.619
 the aspect ratio is different but the 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.719
 ipad is very much like there is inclusive 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.619
 if we put one front of the other 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.360
 it looks like it's in front of a mirror 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.240
 the rear of it has the same finish 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.950
 here o 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:26.940
 the camera is in the same position even 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:31.050
 the screen size is the same here here 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.860
 exactly the same but leaving 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.880
 this extreme resemblance of lake is worth 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.490
 Worth buying this tablet from HP 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.520
 I'm going to enjoy this video and make 2 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.120
 comparisons that since I have with the 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.810
 tegra notes of the gradient it is also 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.810
 Good to start talking a little 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.810
 performance
