00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:11.429
 hi guys i think this video is 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.309
 due as precisely written also in the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.150
 title let 's talk about video games a new one 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.320
 beginning 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.250
 and the reason why I am 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.310
 taking this video with an ipod 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.769
 the ipod is the first device that 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.650
 have you ever used to make mine 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.630
 video in fact who remembers the first 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.600
 episodes of bad games will remind me 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.960
 certainly with this graphic let's say 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.700
 out of time a little retro and not in hd 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.040
 this video serves to tell you what it will be 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.550
 now let's talk about video games 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.289
 let's say it will be a return to the origins 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.809
 I started alone the channel is 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.489
 grew up joined friends 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.480
 we did so many experiences were born 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.579
 new columns so many ideas we can 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.320
 say it without quietly doing it 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.890
 sborone or whatever we have become 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.900
 actually one of the channels they have 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.630
 had more success in Italy than in the sector 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.119
 they were those of the most appreciated 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.960
 however as we know nens cannot be done 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.670
 the same things forever and must 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.759
 adapt the times with what happens 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.280
 so I'll tell you what it will be now let's talk 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.340
 of video games the usual ones 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.439
 they have not ceased they will continue me 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.470
 I refer to games that are ugly 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.780
 bad taste krypi games since it's a 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.049
 heading I write of course I am 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.400
 finish all those rubrics that 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.579
 were made from the other elements of 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.640
 we talk about video games there will be others 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.759
 other new columns as you saw the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.620
 same as becoming and or even 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.110
 lots of other ideas 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.700
 I am not fossilized we say with 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.410
 what was the past we talk about 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.910
 those who say video game 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.000
 will be the classic and 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.040
 sorry the classic columns that 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.680
 will always be part of the channel up to 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.110
 when you will like it and I have so many in mind 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.530
 others to offer as well as many others 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.649
 ideas 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.910
 surely at this point these 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.800
 headings that I have just told you 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.990
 more other things will become more 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.270
 so frequent if a bad game 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.300
 he saw you once every 2 3 months 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.410
 will become more constant you will see a 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.990
 every two weeks 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.260
 3 everything will depend on how you go about it 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.830
 will settle what I promise you what 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.260
 I am committed to doing and it will be like that 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.030
 will always be the constant of maintaining two 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.770
 video a week maybe later in the future 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.890
 pass to three as possible 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.900
 it also depends on the commitments and maintenance 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.670
 active the channel of quality moments 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.520
 as far as gameplay is concerned because 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.510
 you know very well for me the gameplay is 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.400
 what you do only if you say 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.360
 something particularly interesting from 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.320
 to exhibit 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.930
 can be a video what the 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.550
 sheriff you a video of something you don't 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.290
 everyone can 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.720
 they can play as game as can be 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.030
 a normal title anyway 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.620
 particular is a bit eccentric though 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.150
 we mean quality moments for 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.780
 all the rest so not 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.620
 only gameplay but video slice of 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.410
 light we want to call them so with video 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.340
 he mitched that happen around the 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.620
 channel and people precisely who 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.260
 they stay close while the france canal 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.000
 as you've seen it for a while now 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.860
 took a totally different turn not 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.780
 treats more video games but weapons that 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.810
 are shotguns, air weapons 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.970
 compressed firearms 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.590
 by now it is totally dedicated to that 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.870
 so let's talk about video games 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.290
 will continue with his style maybe I will try 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.090
 to give it a tone as it was at the beginning a 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.330
 a little more retro with even more contact with 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.880
 users and above all always 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:58.709
 frankness objectivity in the in 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.540
 reviews in the headings and search 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.010
 always to give you news is something 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.570
 interesting because obviously if you do 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.480
 always fossilize on the same things 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.690
 it becomes boring and therefore not 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.400
 we only see it as a rebirth 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.130
 let's talk about video games let's see it 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.739
 like a new beginning because I do n't 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.410
 I'm never tired of making videos, I don't 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:23.070
 I am never given up and how 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.690
 originally I was alone when I did 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.060
 starting the channel by creating the first 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.340
 rubrics so I will start again I do 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.920
 a reason guys everyone happens to 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.880
 undergo changes in this way 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.670
 and adapts to life as it comes 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.220
 so guys expect so many things 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.940
 I am always loved doing a 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.190
 video with the first camera if so 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.980
 we can define it used for 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.710
 we talk about video games and I hope that 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.360
 show I go ahead and be of yours 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.800
 liking 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.790
 if you want to continue to follow we talk 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.550
 of video games 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.570
 I'll always be with you guys there 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.570
 see you at the next video
