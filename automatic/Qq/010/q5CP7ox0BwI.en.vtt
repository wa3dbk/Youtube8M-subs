00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.110 
your studies and how to do that I'm
could<00:03:32.650> go<00:03:32.799> a<00:03:32.829> little<00:03:33.069> bit<00:03:33.280> more<00:03:33.430> in<00:03:33.579> depth<00:03:33.849> do

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
could go a little bit more in depth do

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.360 
could go a little bit more in depth do
your<00:03:34.540> readings<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.439> try<00:03:35.799> your<00:03:35.949> best<00:03:36.069> to<00:03:36.189> go<00:03:36.310> to

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
your readings and try your best to go to

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.550 
your readings and try your best to go to
lectures<00:03:36.609> unless<00:03:37.389> the<00:03:37.689> prof<00:03:37.870> is<00:03:37.900> that<00:03:38.199> boring

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
lectures unless the prof is that boring

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.809 
lectures unless the prof is that boring
or<00:03:38.680> something<00:03:38.979> but<00:03:39.129> try<00:03:39.310> your<00:03:39.430> best<00:03:39.609> to

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
or something but try your best to

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.789 
or something but try your best to
actually<00:03:40.720> indulge<00:03:41.109> all<00:03:41.409> that<00:03:41.560> information

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
actually indulge all that information

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.499 
actually indulge all that information
and<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.430> thing<00:03:42.609> is<00:03:42.639> everyone<00:03:43.120> learns

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:43.509 
and the thing is everyone learns

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:45.749 
and the thing is everyone learns
differently<00:03:43.720> right<00:03:44.349> so<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:45.220> yourself<00:03:45.639> I

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:45.759 
differently right so you yourself I

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:46.770 
differently right so you yourself I
can't<00:03:45.970> tell<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.239> how<00:03:46.359> to<00:03:46.419> learn<00:03:46.540> because

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
can't tell you how to learn because

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.689 
can't tell you how to learn because
everyone's<00:03:47.379> different<00:03:47.560> so<00:03:47.799> you<00:03:47.919> yourself<00:03:48.519> I

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
everyone's different so you yourself I

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.819 
everyone's different so you yourself I
just<00:03:49.060> poked<00:03:49.389> myself<00:03:49.599> but<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:50.259> yourself<00:03:50.439> you

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
just poked myself but you yourself you

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.339 
just poked myself but you yourself you
have<00:03:50.979> to<00:03:51.009> figure<00:03:51.250> out<00:03:51.340> how<00:03:51.939> you<00:03:52.000> learn<00:03:52.449> best<00:03:52.930> I

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
have to figure out how you learn best I

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.229 
have to figure out how you learn best I
can't<00:03:53.769> really<00:03:54.189> teach<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:54.549> guys<00:03:54.699> that<00:03:54.970> and
