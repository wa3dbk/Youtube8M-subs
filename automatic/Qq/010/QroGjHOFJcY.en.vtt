 execute assault barge tunnel 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.610
 this tactic is quite effective in two 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.440
 reasons first rarely more than 2

 especially when spawn zone 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.559
 counter-terrorists were properly covered 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.360

 and to be more precise do not wait until the last 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.270
 30 seconds round because

 they also have no right to die before 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.770
 time is extremely important because 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.840

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.790
 with them from the side of the tunnel for them not 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.870
