00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
even know if you're going to be able to

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.580 
even know if you're going to be able to
see<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.370> on<00:02:33.550> my<00:02:33.670> skin<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:35.230> can<00:02:35.380> just

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
see that on my skin and you can just

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.470 
see that on my skin and you can just
barely<00:02:35.830> see<00:02:36.070> it<00:02:36.370> when<00:02:36.550> I<00:02:36.580> wear<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:36.970> on<00:02:37.060> my<00:02:37.240> lips

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
barely see it when I wear it on my lips

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.320 
barely see it when I wear it on my lips
but<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.470> know<00:02:38.590> sometimes<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.610> want<00:02:39.970> like<00:02:40.300> a

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
but you know sometimes you want like a

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.930 
but you know sometimes you want like a
really<00:02:40.660> subtle<00:02:41.080> lip<00:02:41.980> if<00:02:42.280> you're<00:02:42.430> gonna<00:02:42.610> do<00:02:42.910> a

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
really subtle lip if you're gonna do a

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.370 
really subtle lip if you're gonna do a
dramatic<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.420> will<00:02:46.660> be<00:02:46.780> good<00:02:46.810> for<00:02:47.020> that

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
dramatic I so that will be good for that

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.800 
dramatic I so that will be good for that
and<00:02:47.680> then<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:48.670> one<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.940> really<00:02:49.240> wasn't<00:02:49.600> sure

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
and then this one I really wasn't sure

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.710 
and then this one I really wasn't sure
about<00:02:50.050> it's<00:02:50.380> called<00:02:50.620> pink<00:02:50.920> truffle<00:02:51.430> and

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.330 

reason<00:02:55.720> why<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:55.870> wasn't<00:02:56.110> sure<00:02:56.470> about<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:57.010> is

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
reason why I wasn't sure about it is

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.290 
reason why I wasn't sure about it is
it's<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.940> brownish<00:02:58.780> pink<00:02:59.410> but<00:03:00.400> actually<00:03:00.670> I

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
it's a brownish pink but actually I

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.120 
it's a brownish pink but actually I
thought<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.780> looked<00:03:01.959> looks<00:03:02.680> pretty<00:03:02.950> good<00:03:05.130> and

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
thought it looked looks pretty good and

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.420 
thought it looked looks pretty good and
that's<00:03:06.519> what<00:03:06.640> it<00:03:06.790> looks<00:03:06.970> like<00:03:08.070> kind<00:03:09.070> of<00:03:09.190> like

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
that's what it looks like kind of like

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.979 
that's what it looks like kind of like
berry<00:03:09.970> smoothie<00:03:10.810> but<00:03:11.530> browner<00:03:12.180> but<00:03:13.180> um<00:03:13.480> yeah<00:03:13.959> I

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
berry smoothie but browner but um yeah I

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.620 
berry smoothie but browner but um yeah I
think<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.470> can<00:03:14.650> just<00:03:14.890> barely<00:03:15.760> pull<00:03:16.209> this<00:03:16.420> off<00:03:18.630> so

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
think I can just barely pull this off so

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.870 
think I can just barely pull this off so
the<00:03:19.840> other<00:03:19.989> colors<00:03:20.320> that<00:03:20.680> I<00:03:20.739> don't<00:03:21.070> have<00:03:21.430> which

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
the other colors that I don't have which

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.259 
the other colors that I don't have which
would<00:03:22.150> be<00:03:22.390> what<00:03:22.810> six<00:03:23.680> colors<00:03:24.190> are<00:03:24.489> either

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
would be what six colors are either

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.890 
would be what six colors are either
brown<00:03:25.840> like<00:03:26.380> straight-up<00:03:26.800> brown<00:03:27.489> or<00:03:27.910> orange

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
brown like straight-up brown or orange

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.830 
brown like straight-up brown or orange
or<00:03:30.090> orangey<00:03:31.090> red<00:03:31.420> or<00:03:32.290> gold<00:03:33.300> goldish<00:03:34.300> nude

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
or orangey red or gold goldish nude

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.729 
or orangey red or gold goldish nude
color<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:36.100> I<00:03:36.130> don't<00:03:36.489> think<00:03:36.700> any<00:03:36.910> of<00:03:37.000> those

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
color so I don't think any of those

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.140 
color so I don't think any of those
would<00:03:38.739> really<00:03:39.160> do<00:03:39.340> anything<00:03:39.610> for<00:03:39.790> me

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
would really do anything for me

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
would really do anything for me
personally<00:03:40.930> with<00:03:41.920> my<00:03:42.160> coloring<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:42.850> stuff<00:03:43.170> so

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
personally with my coloring and stuff so
