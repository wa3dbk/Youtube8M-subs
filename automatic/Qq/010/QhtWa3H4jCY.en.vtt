00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 About 2 years ago I wanted someone to help me with the art side of mine 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.259
 online comic, because I had no idea where to start. 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.969
 I started looking at the art of other people in my school until I saw a girl's drawings ... 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.070
 And I was TOTALLY surprised. 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.110
 (She's the one ...) 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.880
 And I kind of told her, "You're my friend now." 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.250
 She probably didn't know what she did to herself. 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.990
 We are still friends to this day, but still, I am an annoying friend. 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.689
 Seriously ... This one time at lunch I asked her out of nowhere 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.400
 "Do you want to say" fo 'shizzle "?" 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.540
 (Because she is black.) 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.380
 She said "No." 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.070
 "What if I have 100 people sign a petition?" 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.620
 "All right." she said, not assuming that I would go to tables for the rest of the lunch 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.829
 to have them draw a paper and then everyone in my English and 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.110
 Drama class let it draw. 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.470
 I got 100 signatures in 1 day (beat on my level) and she has 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.190
 kept her word and I filmed it. I asked her if I could show the video and she said 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.390
 "No." 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.200
 "What if I give 100 people a signature" - "NO!" So sorry everybody. 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.560
 Here is the audio. 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.420
 "I think I'm going to pronounce it wrong." - * James laughs * 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.200
 "You're going to pronounce it wrong." 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.460
 "How can you pronounce" Fo shizzle "wrong?" - "All right!" 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.260
 "Are you going to say it once? Or ..." 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.100
 "Or do you have more signatures?" 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.440
 "For more than 1 time." 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.980
 "I think once." 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.500
 "All right!" 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.500
 "Say it!" 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.060
 "Okay ..." Fo shizzle. " 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.380
 "YAAAAAAAAAAY!" 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.340
 I am also friends with this red-haired child and for his privacy we call him 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.080
 Nick Jiggly. 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.590
 That was a nickname I gave him, because his real name was "Nick Jernigan" and 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.970
 what really sparked in our friendship was our love for dating women. 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.680
 Just kidding. We played "Magic: The Gathering" and he was slightly better than I was, but 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.369
 that's just because he bought the most expensive things, always like him 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.299
 defeated me 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.299
 I insulted him with his red hair. 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.830
 "I'm attacking with Reaper from the Abyss-" "SAYS THE RED-HAIRED!" 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.620
 He always laughed about it. (But secretly, I meant it.) 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.640
 So this one time my boys scout group went on a trip 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.459
 to a lake and there was one place where you can go cliff diving and I was not 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.780
 so young anymore. 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.709
 I was more in the middle and everyone had fun 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.010
 with swimming and jumping and this one child named "Harris" 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.040
 (he was one of the young ones) came to us and said "My mother told me not to go 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.040
 cliff diving. "and I thought in my head 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.760
 "Okay, Harris. YOUR MOTHER IS NOT HERE!", But it didn't bother me very much. 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.500
 A few hours passed and everyone started talking at the top of the cliff and I mocked 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.100
 Harris, all alone and I got an idea ... 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.470
 I said "Hey, Harris, why don't you come sit with us?" 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.400
 (I hope you know where this is going.) Harris joined our group 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.430
 still very quiet and I wanted to push it off the cliff. 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.070
 I thought about ways to get him close to the edge, but the child 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.340
 was already at the edge, with his back to me, probably thinking or something emotional. 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.990
 Tell me in my position that you would NOT push him off the cliff. 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.620
 And I cried 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.710
 "YOUR MOTHER IS NOT HERE!" while I push him off the cliff. 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.350
 It went well with him, I often got rid of it. I wish we could see his face. 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.500
 His arms didn't look good, but he was silent. 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.209
 He probably thought he was dying. Hey, Harris was the quiet kid, he had too 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.320
 no friends. 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.540
 So after I pushed him off, I talked to him for about 5 minutes. 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.700
 So Harris, if you look at this ... Please. 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.700
