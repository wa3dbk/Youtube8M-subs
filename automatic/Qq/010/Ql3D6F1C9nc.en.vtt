thank you come again we're from sleep

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.840 
thank you come again we're from sleep
solution<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:04.740> remember<00:00:05.279> where<00:00:05.609> there's<00:00:05.759> a

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
solution and remember where there's a

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.339 
solution and remember where there's a
will<00:00:06.029> there's<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.960> way<00:00:06.990> I<00:00:08.929> believe<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:10.139> the

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
will there's a way I believe that the

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.310 
will there's a way I believe that the
with<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.800> materials<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.550> they've<00:00:11.700> given<00:00:11.969> us

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
with the materials that they've given us

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.580 
with the materials that they've given us
it's<00:00:13.320> going<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.590> be<00:00:13.710> kind<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.670> hard<00:00:15.000> because<00:00:15.590> we

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
it's going to be kind of hard because we

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.300 
it's going to be kind of hard because we
only<00:00:16.710> have<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> small<00:00:17.190> budget<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:18.680> it's<00:00:19.680> kind

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
only have a small budget and it's kind

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.189 
only have a small budget and it's kind
of<00:00:20.369> like<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.609> small<00:00:21.270> leak<00:00:21.510> at<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> bottom<00:00:22.140> of

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
of like a small leak at the bottom of

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.769 
of like a small leak at the bottom of
the<00:00:22.320> pool<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.920> it's<00:00:23.580> going<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.939> hard<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.240> cab

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
the pool so it's going to be hard to cab

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.250 
the pool so it's going to be hard to cab
you<00:00:25.350> drew<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.740> we're<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.730> call<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.810> just<00:00:27.990> fill

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
you drew it we're on call you just fill

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.830 
you drew it we're on call you just fill
it<00:00:28.439> locally<00:00:29.189> at<00:00:29.369> all<00:00:29.519> I've<00:00:30.269> been<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
it locally at all I've been in the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.330 
it locally at all I've been in the
program<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.230> three<00:00:31.560> years<00:00:31.800> now<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.250> my

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
program for three years now this is my

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.889 
program for three years now this is my
fourth<00:00:32.610> year<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.059> we've<00:00:33.630> never<00:00:33.660> had

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
fourth year and we've never had

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.020 
fourth year and we've never had
something<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.440> they<00:00:34.890> didn't<00:00:35.309> know<00:00:35.430> if<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
something that they didn't know if the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.479 
something that they didn't know if the
outcome<00:00:36.210> would<00:00:36.690> work<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:37.920> year<00:00:38.219> it's

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
outcome would work so this year it's

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.610 
outcome would work so this year it's
really<00:00:38.790> all<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.660> us<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.290> make<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.590> work

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
really all on us we have to make it work

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.470 
really all on us we have to make it work
so<00:00:41.040> put<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> lot<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.790> pressure<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.450> think

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
so put a lot of pressure on this I think

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:54.650 
so put a lot of pressure on this I think
it's<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.840> little<00:00:43.050> more<00:00:43.140> complicated<00:00:43.500> now

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.480 

so<00:00:55.660> a<00:00:55.690> group<00:00:55.990> of<00:00:56.140> 40<00:00:56.650> high<00:00:56.830> school<00:00:57.100> students

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490 
so a group of 40 high school students

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.880 
so a group of 40 high school students
has<00:00:57.610> been<00:00:57.820> divided<00:00:58.240> into<00:00:58.300> two<00:00:58.630> teams<00:00:58.900> their

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
has been divided into two teams their

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.890 
has been divided into two teams their
challenge<00:01:00.130> as<00:01:00.550> teams<00:01:01.000> is<00:01:01.240> to<00:01:01.390> turn<00:01:01.540> into<00:01:01.750> two

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
challenge as teams is to turn into two

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.530 
challenge as teams is to turn into two
companies<00:01:02.110> to<00:01:03.070> try<00:01:03.220> to<00:01:03.280> stop<00:01:03.580> an<00:01:03.880> oil<00:01:04.059> leak<00:01:04.300> and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
companies to try to stop an oil leak and

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.600 
companies to try to stop an oil leak and
then<00:01:04.839> clean<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.199> water<00:01:05.560> from<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.250> oil<00:01:06.310> leak

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
then clean the water from the oil leak

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.090 
then clean the water from the oil leak
in<00:01:06.850> a<00:01:07.210> swimming<00:01:07.480> pool<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:08.290> whole<00:01:08.470> project<00:01:08.740> the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
in a swimming pool the whole project the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.550 
in a swimming pool the whole project the
camp<00:01:09.370> is<00:01:09.580> about<00:01:09.820> three<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.120> a<00:01:10.210> half<00:01:10.240> weeks<00:01:10.560> we

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
camp is about three and a half weeks we

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.370 
camp is about three and a half weeks we
took<00:01:11.940> as<00:01:12.940> instructors<00:01:13.660> really<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.200> first

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
took as instructors really the first

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.520 
took as instructors really the first
week<00:01:14.770> to<00:01:15.640> give<00:01:16.360> them<00:01:16.510> some<00:01:16.750> tools<00:01:16.960> that<00:01:17.260> we

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
week to give them some tools that we

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.460 
week to give them some tools that we
thought<00:01:17.770> would<00:01:17.950> be<00:01:18.010> helpful<00:01:18.130> along<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:18.940> way

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
thought would be helpful along the way

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.960 
thought would be helpful along the way
some<00:01:20.470> basic<00:01:20.950> sketching<00:01:21.700> and<00:01:21.850> drawing

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
some basic sketching and drawing

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.320 
some basic sketching and drawing
techniques<00:01:22.690> and<00:01:22.960> then<00:01:23.470> some<00:01:23.770> real<00:01:24.070> quick<00:01:25.060> and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
techniques and then some real quick and

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.770 
techniques and then some real quick and
easy<00:01:25.479> ways<00:01:25.780> to<00:01:25.810> use<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:26.920> CAD<00:01:27.460> prog<00:01:27.759> CAD<00:01:28.360> program

easy ways to use a CAD prog CAD program
called<00:01:29.080> inventor<00:01:30.070> we<00:01:30.220> really<00:01:30.580> step<00:01:30.910> back<00:01:31.210> at

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
called inventor we really step back at

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.630 
called inventor we really step back at
this<00:01:31.630> point<00:01:31.930> as<00:01:32.110> you<00:01:32.380> can<00:01:32.530> see<00:01:32.680> today<00:01:32.950> behind

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
this point as you can see today behind

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.070 
this point as you can see today behind
me<00:01:33.759> and<00:01:33.850> around<00:01:34.030> me<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.660> students<00:01:34.990> are

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
me and around me the students are

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.260 
me and around me the students are
working<00:01:35.229> in<00:01:35.530> their<00:01:35.650> small<00:01:35.800> groups<00:01:36.160> we<00:01:36.940> become

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
working in their small groups we become

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.840 
working in their small groups we become
more<00:01:38.130> facilitators<00:01:39.130> of<00:01:39.160> knowledge<00:01:39.580> than<00:01:39.759> we

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
more facilitators of knowledge than we

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:48.139 
more facilitators of knowledge than we
do<00:01:40.000> teachers<00:01:40.420> in<00:01:40.840> front<00:01:41.200> on<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.710> chalkboard<00:01:46.080> I

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
do teachers in front on the chalkboard I

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.780 
do teachers in front on the chalkboard I
think<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.300> best<00:01:49.630> part<00:01:50.160> would<00:01:51.160> be<00:01:51.190> working

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
think the best part would be working

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.249 
think the best part would be working
with<00:01:52.000> a<00:01:52.060> lot<00:01:52.270> of<00:01:52.390> people<00:01:52.660> who<00:01:52.840> are<00:01:52.930> intelligent

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
with a lot of people who are intelligent

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.430 
with a lot of people who are intelligent
because<00:01:54.160> I<00:01:54.580> just<00:01:55.180> like<00:01:55.360> having<00:01:55.899> people<00:01:56.020> who

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
because I just like having people who

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.440 
because I just like having people who
are<00:01:56.560> goal-oriented<00:01:57.550> just<00:01:58.000> like<00:01:58.090> me<00:01:58.300> and

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
are goal-oriented just like me and

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.870 
are goal-oriented just like me and
sharing<00:01:59.200> their<00:01:59.319> ideas<00:01:59.350> we<00:02:00.280> realized<00:02:00.640> that<00:02:00.789> in

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
sharing their ideas we realized that in

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.309 
sharing their ideas we realized that in
the<00:02:00.970> real<00:02:01.119> world<00:02:01.360> there's<00:02:01.600> problems<00:02:01.869> and<00:02:02.229> we

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
the real world there's problems and we

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.020 
the real world there's problems and we
realize<00:02:02.679> that<00:02:02.710> it<00:02:03.009> takes<00:02:03.220> concerted<00:02:03.789> effort

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
realize that it takes concerted effort

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.200 
realize that it takes concerted effort
to<00:02:04.060> try<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.390> solve<00:02:05.380> those<00:02:05.619> problems<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.340> in

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
to try to solve those problems and in

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.050

almost three weeks now I think they're

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.119 
almost three weeks now I think they're
going<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:41.599> be<00:02:41.720> very<00:02:41.930> successful<00:02:42.290> at<00:02:42.769> cleaning

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
that piece the more difficult piece is

our barge over into the middle of the
pool<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.269> drop<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:12.840> plunger<00:03:13.260> down<00:03:13.290> on<00:03:13.829> top<00:03:14.099> of

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
pool and drop the plunger down on top of

the on top of the spewing oil leak and
with<00:03:18.450> our<00:03:18.780> pump<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.560> our<00:03:19.889> pulleys<00:03:20.700> we<00:03:20.969> would

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
with our pump and our pulleys we would

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.899 
with our pump and our pulleys we would
vacuum<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.900> oil<00:03:22.109> up<00:03:22.439> into<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:22.950> safe<00:03:23.280> place<00:03:23.519> on

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
vacuum the oil up into a safe place on

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.670 
vacuum the oil up into a safe place on
the<00:03:24.599> outside<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.079> pool<00:03:25.260> which<00:03:25.530> would

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
the outside the pool which would

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.069 
the outside the pool which would
represent<00:03:25.889> the<00:03:26.370> shoreline<00:03:26.849> we<00:03:27.599> had<00:03:27.810> ideas

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
represent the shoreline we had ideas

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.780 
represent the shoreline we had ideas
about<00:03:28.169> just<00:03:28.590> lowering<00:03:29.099> something<00:03:29.489> onto<00:03:29.700> the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
about just lowering something onto the

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.580 
about just lowering something onto the
cap<00:03:29.970> from<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.329> very<00:03:30.510> beginning<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.200> that<00:03:31.260> idea

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
cap from the very beginning so that idea

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.289 
cap from the very beginning so that idea
kind<00:03:31.829> of<00:03:31.859> developed<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.549> around<00:03:32.879> that<00:03:33.030> we<00:03:33.180> had

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
kind of developed and around that we had

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.800 
kind of developed and around that we had
the<00:03:33.389> idea<00:03:33.569> of<00:03:33.750> containing<00:03:34.709> misko<00:03:35.189> so<00:03:35.909> having

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
the idea of containing misko so having

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:37.940 
the idea of containing misko so having
this<00:03:36.930> ring<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.379> would<00:03:37.470> keep<00:03:37.620> it<00:03:37.769> in<00:03:37.859> the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
this ring that would keep it in the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.740 
this ring that would keep it in the
middle<00:03:38.189> and<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.489> would<00:03:38.609> help<00:03:38.700> center<00:03:39.239> the

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
middle and that would help center the

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.009 
middle and that would help center the
placement<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.379> cat<00:03:41.239> our<00:03:42.239> plan<00:03:42.540> was<00:03:42.750> really

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
placement of the cat our plan was really

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.659 
placement of the cat our plan was really
good<00:03:43.169> at<00:03:43.290> our<00:03:43.500> design<00:03:43.889> was<00:03:44.040> really<00:03:44.280> good<00:03:44.459> so<00:03:44.639> I

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
good at our design was really good so I

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.330 
good at our design was really good so I
like<00:03:44.879> to<00:03:45.030> compliment<00:03:45.239> my<00:03:45.659> team<00:03:45.900> on<00:03:46.109> that<00:03:46.340> on

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
like to compliment my team on that on

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.110 
like to compliment my team on that on
the<00:03:47.549> day<00:03:47.730> of<00:03:47.760> today<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:50.040> forgot<00:03:50.400> one<00:03:50.939> of<00:03:50.969> the

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
the day of today you forgot one of the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.659 
the day of today you forgot one of the
pieces<00:03:51.389> in<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:51.989> room<00:03:52.260> which<00:03:52.980> made<00:03:53.219> it<00:03:53.400> tilt

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
pieces in the room which made it tilt

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.849 
pieces in the room which made it tilt
over<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.419> we<00:03:55.139> couldn't<00:03:55.379> get<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.650> plunger

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
over and we couldn't get the plunger

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.149 
over and we couldn't get the plunger
down<00:03:56.040> all<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.549> way<00:03:56.669> to<00:03:57.409> vacuum<00:03:58.409> up<00:03:58.560> going<00:03:58.859> we

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
down all the way to vacuum up going we

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.409 
down all the way to vacuum up going we
didn't<00:03:59.400> succeed<00:03:59.669> as<00:03:59.819> well<00:04:00.000> as<00:04:00.120> we<00:04:00.239> would<00:04:00.329> have

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
didn't succeed as well as we would have

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:01.789 
didn't succeed as well as we would have
liked<00:04:00.659> but<00:04:00.989> I<00:04:01.049> think<00:04:01.290> it's<00:04:01.409> always<00:04:01.530> good<00:04:01.769> to

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
liked but I think it's always good to

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.409 
liked but I think it's always good to
have<00:04:01.979> higher<00:04:02.250> goals<00:04:02.609> that<00:04:02.909> are<00:04:02.940> necessarily

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
have higher goals that are necessarily

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.110 
have higher goals that are necessarily
reasonable<00:04:04.109> I<00:04:04.260> think<00:04:04.440> we<00:04:04.530> did<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.680> good<00:04:04.859> job

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
reasonable I think we did a good job

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.819 
reasonable I think we did a good job
camping<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.239> that<00:04:06.510> got<00:04:06.690> done<00:04:07.019> and<00:04:07.319> I'm<00:04:07.620> proud

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
camping it that got done and I'm proud

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.439 
camping it that got done and I'm proud
of<00:04:07.979> the<00:04:08.099> filters<00:04:08.459> we<00:04:08.699> had<00:04:08.879> some<00:04:09.030> troubles<00:04:09.389> with

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
of the filters we had some troubles with

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.839 
of the filters we had some troubles with
one<00:04:09.659> of<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.840> ROV<00:04:10.079> s<00:04:10.229> but<00:04:10.620> they<00:04:11.129> were<00:04:11.220> they<00:04:11.669> did

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
one of the ROV s but they were they did

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.309 
one of the ROV s but they were they did
what<00:04:11.970> they<00:04:12.000> were<00:04:12.150> supposed<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.569> do<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.870> think<00:04:13.229> it

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
what they were supposed to do I think it

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.870 
what they were supposed to do I think it
went<00:04:13.409> well<00:04:13.500> i<00:04:13.620> think<00:04:13.739> that<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:15.199> there's<00:04:16.880> oil

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
went well i think that the there's oil

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.520 
went well i think that the there's oil
on<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.239> surface<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:18.750> don't<00:04:18.930> know<00:04:19.049> what<00:04:19.229> to<00:04:19.260> what

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
on the surface I don't know what to what

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.779 
on the surface I don't know what to what
extent<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.039> oil<00:04:20.190> has<00:04:20.340> been<00:04:20.489> observed

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
extent the oil has been observed

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.670 
extent the oil has been observed
absorbed<00:04:21.479> both<00:04:21.630> team<00:04:21.870> where<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.139> teams<00:04:22.560> were

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
absorbed both team where the teams were

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.029 
absorbed both team where the teams were
able<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.889> cap<00:04:23.159> the<00:04:23.340> oil<00:04:24.440> to<00:04:25.440> different<00:04:25.949> degrees

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
able to cap the oil to different degrees

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.159 
able to cap the oil to different degrees
of<00:04:26.370> success<00:04:26.550> must<00:04:27.210> be<00:04:27.360> most<00:04:27.570> about<00:04:27.750> these<00:04:27.930> kids

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
of success must be most about these kids

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.640 
of success must be most about these kids
was<00:04:29.099> the<00:04:30.090> fact<00:04:30.419> that<00:04:30.570> they<00:04:30.750> did<00:04:31.020> not<00:04:31.050> give<00:04:31.440> up

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
was the fact that they did not give up

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.439 
was the fact that they did not give up
their<00:04:31.830> stamina<00:04:32.099> I<00:04:32.580> mean<00:04:32.880> there<00:04:33.240> was<00:04:33.330> some

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
their stamina I mean there was some

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:34.909 
their stamina I mean there was some
conflicts<00:04:33.990> in<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.169> group<00:04:34.380> there<00:04:34.830> was

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
conflicts in the group there was

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.439 
conflicts in the group there was
conflicts<00:04:35.370> that<00:04:35.550> revolved<00:04:36.240> around<00:04:36.300> the

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
conflicts that revolved around the

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.850 
conflicts that revolved around the
project<00:04:36.900> but<00:04:36.990> there<00:04:37.110> was<00:04:37.229> also<00:04:37.349> personal

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
project but there was also personal

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.409 
project but there was also personal
conflicts<00:04:38.310> but<00:04:38.729> in<00:04:38.849> order<00:04:38.940> to<00:04:39.060> solve<00:04:39.270> that

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
conflicts but in order to solve that

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.060 
conflicts but in order to solve that
problem<00:04:39.630> they<00:04:39.780> had<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.110> work<00:04:40.229> together<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.830> so

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
problem they had to work together and so

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.560 
problem they had to work together and so
that<00:04:41.190> was<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.430> thing<00:04:41.550> that<00:04:41.699> impressed<00:04:42.090> me<00:04:42.419> the

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
that was the thing that impressed me the

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.180 
that was the thing that impressed me the
most<00:04:42.599> about<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.020> kids<00:04:43.199> are<00:04:43.349> there<00:04:43.949> their

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
most about the kids are there their

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.290 
most about the kids are there their
willingness<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:44.699> overcome<00:04:45.090> personal

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
willingness to overcome personal

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.980 
willingness to overcome personal
conflicts<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:46.560> be<00:04:46.740> able<00:04:46.830> to<00:04:47.840> solve<00:04:48.840> the

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
conflicts to be able to solve the

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.719 
conflicts to be able to solve the
problem<00:04:49.320> at<00:04:49.380> hand<00:04:49.409> I<00:04:49.800> think<00:04:50.460> we<00:04:50.550> did<00:04:50.669> really

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
problem at hand I think we did really

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.670 
problem at hand I think we did really
well<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.330> amount<00:04:51.539> of<00:04:51.630> teamwork<00:04:51.960> that<00:04:52.349> I<00:04:52.380> saw

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
well the amount of teamwork that I saw

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.469 
well the amount of teamwork that I saw
that<00:04:52.919> people<00:04:53.250> were<00:04:53.400> so<00:04:53.639> willing<00:04:53.789> to<00:04:54.090> listen<00:04:54.270> to

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
that people were so willing to listen to

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.510 
that people were so willing to listen to
each<00:04:54.599> other<00:04:54.840> and<00:04:54.990> to<00:04:55.080> admit<00:04:55.289> I<00:04:55.470> was<00:04:55.949> wrong<00:04:56.159> or

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
each other and to admit I was wrong or

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.370 
each other and to admit I was wrong or
your<00:04:56.880> idea<00:04:57.150> is<00:04:57.330> a<00:04:57.360> better<00:04:57.599> idea<00:04:57.810> than<00:04:58.110> mine<00:04:58.349> and

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
your idea is a better idea than mine and

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.409 
your idea is a better idea than mine and
that<00:04:58.770> was<00:04:58.919> just<00:04:59.220> fantastic<00:04:59.669> to<00:05:00.000> see<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.330> way

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
that was just fantastic to see the way

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.180 
that was just fantastic to see the way
something<00:05:01.050> would<00:05:01.169> start<00:05:01.409> as<00:05:01.529> my<00:05:01.740> idea<00:05:02.130> and

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
something would start as my idea and

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.399 
something would start as my idea and
then<00:05:02.520> change<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:03.419> your<00:05:03.719> idea<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.110> then<00:05:04.289> it's

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409 
then change to your idea and then it's

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.140 
then change to your idea and then it's
everyone's<00:05:04.860> ideas<00:05:05.219> so<00:05:05.400> by<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.580> end<00:05:05.669> it's<00:05:06.000> like

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
everyone's ideas so by the end it's like

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.850 
everyone's ideas so by the end it's like
no<00:05:06.330> one's<00:05:06.479> really<00:05:06.659> sure<00:05:06.779> where<00:05:07.260> it<00:05:07.409> started

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
no one's really sure where it started

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.350 
no one's really sure where it started
from<00:05:08.039> but<00:05:08.580> we<00:05:08.669> know<00:05:08.700> that<00:05:08.940> we<00:05:09.000> all<00:05:09.150> work

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
from but we know that we all work

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.209 
from but we know that we all work
together<00:05:09.570> and<00:05:09.930> without<00:05:10.260> any<00:05:10.469> one<00:05:10.770> of<00:05:10.800> us<00:05:10.979> it

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:11.219 
together and without any one of us it

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:20.959 
together and without any one of us it
wouldn't<00:05:11.400> have<00:05:11.580> become<00:05:11.969> what<00:05:12.150> it<00:05:12.270> was

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:20.969 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:23.029
