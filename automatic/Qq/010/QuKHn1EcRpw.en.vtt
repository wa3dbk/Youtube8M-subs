00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.370
 hello to all friends 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.260
 a greeting from panic, and welcome to this 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.690
 new daily video on destiny 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.730
 continues the flurry of news that bungee 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.250
 has been circulating since yesterday evening 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.230
 the announcement of the dl about wolves below 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.510
 you remember coming out on May 19th though 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.890
 any of you had missed the news or 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.310
 the video in which he spoke I leave you the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.650
 link here pop up in the video I said burst 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.289
 of news that bungee is putting into 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.210
 circle through the internet via too 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.590
 substantially official announcements 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.660
 bunge and released a calendar of 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.590
 events that will start on Wednesday 22 April e 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.390
 which will end on Friday 8 May where 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.770
 several days the different weeks there 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.809
 different themes will be introduced 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.969
 which will then be implemented by 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.129
 introduced directly with the dlc the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.260
 house of wolves but we start with order 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.360
 Wednesday 22 April bunge promised 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.890
 a walk in the atoll where there 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.530
 they will talk about the upgrades of the old ones 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.090
 armaments as we can give in this 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.920
 image that I'm showing you is 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.920
 present a fate fate that the canon 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.080
 portable from the glass vault to 365 of 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.350
 damage with the image we say makes us 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.689
 see the upgrade from 300 365 what 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.180
 it means this we cannot know 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.549
 with certainty my personal hypothesis is that 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.880
 there will be the possibility to upgrade to 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.670
 upgrade areas of weapons maybe not all 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.140
 just as it is to app shout some of the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.229
 equipment maybe from the vaults 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.049
 they also become gods of others 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.060
 raid as the end of crota is of 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.890
 bring as I said about the value of 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.320
 attack of weapons as the fatal fort 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.990
 in this photo but in my opinion also of the 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.000
 equipments all this will happen in the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.970
 new social new social space that 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 will be the atoll where we will also find gods 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.439
 vendors dedicated to the sizes of 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.610
 reggina that will give us new ones 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.939
 new items of equipment 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.130
 in other words, April 22nd we will take a tour 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.200
 we will take a first look at this 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.210
 atoll wednesday 29 April banks ci 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.310
 will reveal the first gameplay and weaponry 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.159
 of the much rumored in the past rehearsals of 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.439
 osiris if you love mythology 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.000
 Egyptian this is the activity he does for 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.830
 you because as you can see from this 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.570
 photos are present 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.370
 three guardians a hunter a titan 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.970
 a sorcerer with the equipment and the 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.850
 weapons that will be given to us as loot of 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.370
 reward for these osiride tests 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.680
 they will be a crucible only mode 3 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.320
 against 3 similar to the iron banner 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.810
 so with the skill modifiers of 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.370
 value defense attack valid as well 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.050
 just like the banner of doing it e 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.330
 who will reward us for these 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.850
 special armor and weapons 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.710
 we still don't know much about details 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.630
 specifically if not precisely that there 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.880
 I was saying that they will be modalities only 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.950
 beams three we will probably find out of 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.930
 more precisely Wednesday, April 29th then 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.270
 sign in this date for another date 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.190
 really important is Wednesday 6 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.920
 May bungee will reveal a gameplay to us 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.050
 of the old people's prison a new one 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.450
 cooperative arena mode from three 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.260
 fair players let's move on to the note 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.570
 sore of the argument because I eat 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.750
 announced that with the dl about under 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.310
 wolves no raid will be introduced 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.130
 no new incursion then 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:18.720
 the six-person cooperative activity 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.790
 this is because I quote verbatim we say 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.250
 so well already taken a cold shower from 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.830
 what were the feedbacks and the 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.810
 user complaints about these 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.550
 raid these raids they had 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.040
 objectively many many problems and 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.830
 so they decided not to introduce 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.110
 no raid with the case of wolves but the 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.370
 raid will be introduced later earlier 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.910
 of the end of this year probably 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.040
 together with the new comet expansion that 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.290
 will come to the end went the mega 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.420
 expansion but this will be introduced 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.670
 old people's prison a mode 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.950
 three-player cooperative arena 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.340
 it will probably be some kind of modality 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.010
 to hordes of enemies then survival pv e 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.290
 so don't pvp and we'll see a first one 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.360
 gameplay precisely Wednesday 6 May 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.769
 what to expect from this prison 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.620
 of the elderly 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.310
 I do not know I do not know according to me here too 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.489
 unique armaments and equipment 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.560
 therefore related to this mode of 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:19.109
 sure of the sizes and or things 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.609
 however, keep one thing in mind 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.590
 very very interesting and sincerely 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.020
 I don't really mind that I don't 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.139
 there is a raid because I think it will come 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.430
 replaced worthily replaced by 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.070
 this prison to some elders are 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.020
 very very curious to know about that 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.430
 what will it be in the last specific one 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.680
 date to be marked off Friday 8 May 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.669
 where benches leave us with a simple 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.100
 stay tuned 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.790
 that is we can not tell you 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.410
 nothing 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.770
 We'll talk to you later about what you will have 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.630
 I really don't know in Serbian, I don't know 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.820
 I can imagine then let's recap 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.470
 Wednesday 22 April walk 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.690
 in the atoll where they will show us the 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.150
 upgradeable weapons equipment ed 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.160
 armani and armaments will show us 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.120
 maybe new revenge no setting 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.490
 etc. etc. 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.050
 Wednesday, April 29 first gameplay e 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.639
 first look at the rigging e 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.370
 osiride test equipment 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.440
 pvp mode 3 against 3 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.120
 Wednesday 6 May first gameplay of the 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.370
 old people's prison new mode 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.919
 cooperative by three people probably 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.280
 adored and therefore survival that will replace 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.870
 the raid until the next exit of the 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.970
 next raid that probably will happen 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.510
 with the expulsion comet and then Friday 8 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.160

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.280
 comments what you think 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.260
 let's try to open up some kind of 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.770
 debate on the raid issue that exists 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.720
 who in favor who is not against is 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.740
 in other words let's get loose here below 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.370
 in the comments 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.960
 I need and want so much to express 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.850
 your opinion in description vi 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.710
 I also leave the link to the article 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.479
 tower where you can read in a way 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.400
 little bit more in depth all 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.350
 issues we talked about in 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.770
 this video don't forget to leave 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.389
 a nice lay and date to the next 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.860
 video daily south east of a greeting 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:03.860
 the boys panic but no step
