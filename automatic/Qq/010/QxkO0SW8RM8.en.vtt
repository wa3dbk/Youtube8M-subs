I'm<00:00:12.690> just<00:00:12.840> going<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:12.990> isolate<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.559> boiler

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
I'm just going to isolate the boiler

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.960 
I'm just going to isolate the boiler
from<00:00:15.059> these<00:00:15.299> two<00:00:15.540> valves<00:00:16.820> the<00:00:17.820> flow<00:00:19.760> and<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
from these two valves the flow and the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.650 
from these two valves the flow and the
return<00:00:21.949> then<00:00:22.949> we're<00:00:23.100> going<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.279> drain<00:00:23.660> the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
return then we're going to drain the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.320 
return then we're going to drain the
boiler<00:00:24.990> down<00:00:27.230> on<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> drain<00:00:28.619> off<00:00:28.849> okay<00:00:29.880> that's

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
boiler down on the drain off okay that's

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.299 
boiler down on the drain off okay that's
on<00:00:30.599> there<00:00:30.810> now<00:00:31.380> we're<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:31.619> going<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.769> open<00:00:32.189> up

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
on there now we're just going to open up

00:00:32.309 --> 00:01:14.870 
on there now we're just going to open up
the<00:00:32.489> valve

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.530 

member

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.990 

okay<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.990> change<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> diverter<00:01:25.800> valve<00:01:26.130> now

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
okay so change the diverter valve now

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.370 
okay so change the diverter valve now
we're<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> top<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.960> system

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
we're going to top up the system

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.520 
we're going to top up the system
pressure<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.820> here's<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> gauge<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:31.170> filling

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
pressure so here's the gauge the filling

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.440 
pressure so here's the gauge the filling
loops<00:01:31.710> underneath<00:01:32.220> we're<00:01:32.820> going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.030> put<00:01:33.300> this

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
loops underneath we're going to put this

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.990 
loops underneath we're going to put this
indicator<00:01:34.080> it<00:01:34.710> takes<00:01:34.920> up<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.280> one<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:35.880> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
indicator it takes up to one to one and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.880 
indicator it takes up to one to one and
our<00:01:36.119> bar<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.320> we're<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.590> turn<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
our bar and we're going to turn the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.070 
our bar and we're going to turn the
boiler<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.580> test<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.060> hopefully<00:01:39.720> there's

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
boiler on and test it hopefully there's

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.850 
boiler on and test it hopefully there's
no<00:01:40.200> leaks

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.310 

okay<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:43.920> let's<00:01:44.250> not<00:01:44.400> let<00:01:44.610> him<00:01:44.790> buy<00:01:44.970> anymore

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
okay so let's not let him buy anymore

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.050 
okay so let's not let him buy anymore
diverter<00:01:46.320> valves<00:01:46.650> been<00:01:46.800> replaced<00:01:47.190> and<00:01:47.910> it's

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
diverter valves been replaced and it's

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.859 
diverter valves been replaced and it's
done<00:01:48.210> its<00:01:48.360> job

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
