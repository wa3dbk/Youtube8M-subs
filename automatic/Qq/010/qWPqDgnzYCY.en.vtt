00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
for a new reissue that we wanted to

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:46.590 
for a new reissue that we wanted to
spring<00:00:45.260> out<00:00:45.440> which<00:00:45.679> they<00:00:45.710> haven't<00:00:46.010> done<00:00:46.250> since

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
1966 and so of course we started at the

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.340 
1966 and so of course we started at the
top<00:00:49.760> of<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:49.969> line<00:00:50.179> which<00:00:50.660> at<00:00:50.839> the<00:00:50.960> time<00:00:50.989> they

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
top of the line which at the time they

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.349 
top of the line which at the time they
were<00:00:51.410> originally<00:00:52.309> dying<00:00:52.519> which<00:00:52.699> is<00:00:52.850> 58

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
were originally dying which is 58

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.369 
were originally dying which is 58
through<00:00:53.660> 62<00:00:54.129> our<00:00:55.129> complete<00:00:55.489> failure<00:00:56.260> so<00:00:57.260> they

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
through 62 our complete failure so they

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:58.989 
through 62 our complete failure so they
discontinued<00:00:57.980> all<00:00:58.070> that<00:00:58.190> stuff<00:00:58.370> at<00:00:58.489> 60<00:00:58.850> but

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:58.999 
discontinued all that stuff at 60 but

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:01.299 
discontinued all that stuff at 60 but
the<00:00:59.449> models<00:00:59.749> that<00:00:59.780> they<00:00:59.989> had<00:01:00.079> made<00:01:00.260> between<00:01:00.440> 57

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
the models that they had made between 57

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.369 
the models that they had made between 57
and<00:01:01.429> 60<00:01:01.879> with<00:01:02.089> a<00:01:02.120> Barney<00:01:02.510> Kessel<00:01:02.690> series<00:01:03.260> they

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
and 60 with a Barney Kessel series they

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.439 
and 60 with a Barney Kessel series they
had<00:01:03.530> a<00:01:03.559> pretty<00:01:04.370> full<00:01:04.640> line<00:01:04.940> of<00:01:05.120> guitar<00:01:05.360> I<00:01:05.390> think

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
had a pretty full line of guitar I think

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.330 
had a pretty full line of guitar I think
that<00:01:05.720> four<00:01:05.960> or<00:01:05.990> five<00:01:06.230> Barney<00:01:06.620> Kessel<00:01:06.800> models

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
that four or five Barney Kessel models

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.820 
that four or five Barney Kessel models
so<00:01:08.000> we<00:01:08.030> started<00:01:08.480> there<00:01:08.690> and<00:01:08.840> then<00:01:08.930> we<00:01:09.260> also

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
so we started there and then we also

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.090 
so we started there and then we also
went<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.370> the<00:01:11.150> thin<00:01:11.390> twin<00:01:11.630> version<00:01:12.110> which

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
went to the the thin twin version which

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.460 
went to the the thin twin version which
was<00:01:13.280> reissued<00:01:13.990> originally<00:01:14.990> brought<00:01:15.170> out<00:01:15.350> in

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
was reissued originally brought out in

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.650 
was reissued originally brought out in
about<00:01:15.650> 53<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:16.700> so<00:01:17.180> those<00:01:17.390> were<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:17.570> two

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
about 53 and so those were the two

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.450 
about 53 and so those were the two
guitars<00:01:18.290> that<00:01:18.440> were<00:01:18.500> something<00:01:18.830> more<00:01:19.220> coveted

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
guitars that were something more coveted

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.910 
guitars that were something more coveted
by<00:01:19.790> cake<00:01:20.690> collectors<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.350> there<00:01:21.470> was<00:01:21.620> also

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
by cake collectors and there was also

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.920 
by cake collectors and there was also
the<00:01:22.190> high<00:01:22.340> end<00:01:22.610> so<00:01:23.240> they<00:01:23.420> were<00:01:23.540> a<00:01:23.600> little<00:01:23.750> bit

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
the high end so they were a little bit

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.900 
the high end so they were a little bit
better<00:01:24.440> made<00:01:24.770> than<00:01:24.800> most<00:01:25.280> of<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:25.490> caves<00:01:25.730> of

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
better made than most of the caves of

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.450 
better made than most of the caves of
that<00:01:26.030> period<00:01:26.300> and<00:01:27.050> so<00:01:27.560> we<00:01:27.710> took<00:01:28.100> about<00:01:28.250> two

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
that period and so we took about two

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.480 
that period and so we took about two
years<00:01:28.490> to<00:01:28.850> get<00:01:29.420> all<00:01:29.480> the<00:01:29.720> details<00:01:30.110> down<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:31.190> we

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
years to get all the details down and we

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.400 
years to get all the details down and we
reverse<00:01:31.880> engineered<00:01:32.480> all<00:01:32.660> the<00:01:32.840> original

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
reverse engineered all the original

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.950 
reverse engineered all the original
parts<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:34.250> all<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.180> construction<00:01:35.840> is<00:01:35.930> the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
parts and all the construction is the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.890 
parts and all the construction is the
same<00:01:36.350> we<00:01:37.040> just<00:01:37.070> added<00:01:37.580> a<00:01:37.640> few<00:01:37.790> new<00:01:38.030> things<00:01:38.330> like

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
same we just added a few new things like

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.290 
same we just added a few new things like
truss<00:01:39.560> rods<00:01:39.830> let's<00:01:40.790> take<00:01:40.940> a<00:01:40.970> look<00:01:41.150> a<00:01:41.180> little

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
truss rods let's take a look a little

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.640 
truss rods let's take a look a little
closer<00:01:41.570> look<00:01:41.720> here<00:01:41.990> tell<00:01:42.230> us<00:01:42.320> about<00:01:44.650> the
