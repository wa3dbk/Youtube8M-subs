00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.860
 the secret of healthy and strong nails is 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.710
 correct signing of the nail 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.839

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.080

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.470
 nail file and in what way 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.260
 best to file nail 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.990
 plate to create a shape in order to 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.689
 nails remained strong and healthy 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.090
 by the way I want to show you this 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.829
 already funny summer manicure 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.350
 made me like it very much 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.379
 uplifting as you know 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.870
 I love purple hues Well all 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.809
 invite to watch my listen 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.600
 little secret nail care 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.120
 before you go to those and how to 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.300
 file the nail plate I 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.090
 I propose to consider what is necessary 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.680
 do this procedure and tried 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.920
 already a huge number of different 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.159
 nail files and I can say that 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.619
 one of the first nail files that immediately 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.680
 whole it was a metal file 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.520
 according to all indications and those reviews that 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.799
 I read 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.530
 It is from the metal file more often 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:22.189
 nail splitting occurs 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:25.290
 plate and she is too rough and on 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.659
 Goes and nail files are such abrasive 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.960
 for example i have a nail file from 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.369
 famous company deborah lippmann she 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.070
 Here is such a rough which reminds 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.500
 sandpaper such nail files to me also 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.619
 don't like too they are rude to me 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.740
 There are files of a similar type but already with 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.829
 fine 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.990
 here it is and abrasive particles that 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.700
 very quickly so absorbed by me 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.579
 seems to be a hiking option a couple of times 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.470
 used and threw away 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:01.670
 further file which 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.100
 more or less it is a nail file which 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.560
 similar to glass on plastic too 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.910
 applied abrasive layer which 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.260
 file off with me 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.120
 judging by the color as you see it above 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.560
 quite a long time was in use 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.750
 and already served its own than such a nail file 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.970
 I liked to distinguish its glass 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.970
 you can easily carry bags only on 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.000
 she will not break down and in the right 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.310
 time and can take advantage of, and the most 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.340
 my favorite nail file 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.920
 This glass they are different 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.010
 sizes of different widths and lengths 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.770
 it doesn't matter which ones 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.890
 I washed and in various firms I do not 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.970
 found no difference but in its 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:55.470
 action of course glass nail file on 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:58.380
 level and much higher than others personally 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.650
 For me, glass nail file is a favorite 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.840
 so if you are thinking what 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.550
 nail file buy pay attention to 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.769
 glass nail files and also 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.280
 those reviews that are considered different 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.150
 masters 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.760
 again using such a nail file 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.680
 minimizes the risk that there will be 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.800
 exfoliation of the nail 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.530
 plate morny come to the main topic 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.920
 This video is how to properly file 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.840
 the nail plate is not only correct 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.660
 to file the nail plate first 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.299
 queue not to hurry 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.370
 in order to not have any 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.350
 relax correctly saw it 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.450
 ready to constantly in the same 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.940
 Direction 5 food you decided today 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.340
 gash them a plate something else 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.580
 do let's say one way then 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.070
 constantly you will produce 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.250
 zapilivaniya nail plate and all 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.590
 time in one even side ie 1 time 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.049
 and every time that is not like this 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.060
 back and forth right left right left 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.090
 constantly let's right and either 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.670
 constantly to the left so you haven't 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.959
 will be 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.330
 loosen and exfoliate nail 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.739
 plate there is a risk that there will be 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.109
 stratification occur 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.220
 will decline to a minimum yes it 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:22.290
 takes longer but it is much 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.010
 safer and healthier for your marigolds 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.540
 the agency needed to cut 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.820
 quite a large number 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:34.470
 nail plate there is a sense of happiness 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.120
 nail plate cut off for example you 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.340
 wish to shorten by several 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.200
 millimeters that is 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.510
 scissors cut into 2 3 millimeters and 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.620
 already made the edge that you 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.650
 like that suits you here 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.900
 In this way I use for many years 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.030
 as soon as I found out about what is right 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.750
 file all the time in the same 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:01.970
 the side they are different at once became this 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:05.220
 way to use and forget about what 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:08.850
 Such a problem is just about and not the nail 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.130
 plates generally exist i believe that 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.789
 this is one of the important factors that 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.669
 affect the state of the nail bed yes 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:21.210
 there are many factors but how to 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:25.560
 file the nail plate also in 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:30.780
 This influences a lot, therefore, for those who 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:33.050
 did not know about it or did not accept 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.330
 seriously given information 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.210
 try maybe your condition 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.660
 nails will also improve to new videos 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.660
 bye everyone
