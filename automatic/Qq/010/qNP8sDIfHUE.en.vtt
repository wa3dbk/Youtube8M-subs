00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 but we at least three because 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:16.350
 they are very good well welcome to 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:18.570
 Anime words, well, we started with 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.210
 the second week of this new channel 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.400
 anime word and then we started strong 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.769
 this week we will start with a top 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.050
 of women can be any topic and 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.080
 Well, I 've chosen a top 5 women 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.730
 bravest of the anime are not the most 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.399
 are not going to be the best 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.110
 characters are not going to be in iraq and the 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.750
 favorite characters mine but the masses 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.120
 among which I consider that they put more 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.829
 the desire to get things right to the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.320
 and so good to say that this matter 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.789
 very small only is a top 5 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.739
 I really did not want to saturate a lot in 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.510
 video with many women and well 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.250
 we started in fifth place is a 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.490
 unanimous character 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.350
 He liked the 2013 this is my house 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.910
 edit and keynote link I like the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.370
 courage of her then do whatever 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.650
 for being able to save that is a total inept 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.860
 but I like her life 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.420
 get to things and then the truth is 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.780
 one of the strongest people in the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.490
 anime and I think that with her and I saw her they are 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.950
 the best characters of this series the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.840
 that they have more football to the series and therefore 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.369
 I personally like it a lot in the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.710
 fourth place we have a person from 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.100
 vampire and this will be the victory of 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.380
 anime housing although I put more effort 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.110
 it will be victory to leave your last and the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.149
 ova that they took out then obviously there 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.369
 they show more potential of all 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.830
 characters of the series is very much 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.560
 better and well now we can see a series 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.960
 of victory much stronger more 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.509
 brave that gets him more he grabs the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.670
 things and well it is very much smaller 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.140
 in this series if you have not seen yourself exercise 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.940
 Ultime only stayed with a 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.130
 jersey I recommend you totally go to 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.490
 see a serious victory totally 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.340
 different in the last chapters and a 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.110
 very rich very epic and the truth is going to 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.799
 give very surprised already in the third 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.170
 Market Stall 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.790
 we have a character with a sword those who 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.830
 follow me on my channel is that he followed me 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.140
 a long time ago and they know me they know 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.260
 that I love swords and in this top 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.019
 they could not miss obviously this is the 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.130
 green face 0 or first at night as 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.450
 want 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.280
 by god saints to those who have already 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.200
 seen obviously know that these are the 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.569
 strongest anime characters have 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.069
 an excellent spa control when 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.519
 activates the power of the excalibur sword 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:32.060
 it's totally going to a total orgasm is 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.230
 very good this series too but then to 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.060
 me what I like the most 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.549
 obviously it 's the see that it's too much 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.440
 strong very brave and obviously for 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.150
 something is in that top and I love 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.370
 Well, I want to remind you that this 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.660
 top is the brave women most not to 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.459
 the strongest 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.530
 that's why they may be surprised with 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.660
 this position and put in the second 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.580
 put we have the blonde of bliss and 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.890
 obviously I could not try this 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.750
 the character is too much 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.790
 lens I'm not saying it 's the 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.709
 strongest person there 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.840
 anime I'm not saying it's the best 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.519
 of blys, however, it gets him a lot 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.209
 the claws knowing that she is the most 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.760
 strong 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.340
 neither the strongest character the series 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.019
 has known that I managed to do very well in the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.730
 series and it has had very good 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.340
 battles with your intelligence has been able 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.260
 solve things here and we do not 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.329
 only force what is important to win 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.310
 also that strategy is needed and 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.889
 I would have it and I really like it 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.299
 quite what she does in bridge and 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.819
 it may be the first position that I 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.500
 you know, I'm sure you already know which 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.170
 will be in the first place from the 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.720
 It's obviously my beginning 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.489
 favorite female character could not 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.919
 put it in another position that did not do the 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.230
 first wait for scarlett simply 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:44.069
 what we are incredible thanks every 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.319
 it surprises me more 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.510
 it's too strong without a doubt it's my 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.409
 favorite female anime character and 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.629
 if the anime will not change what is 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:57.389
 very good I love that character not 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.549
 I can stop watching her singing a lot 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:02.250
 had quite a few complicated fights every 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.840
 time it goes up a lot more in my level in 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.670
 the last one close the sleeve that I do not want 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.250
 go into a lot of detail it looks pretty 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.109
 well and well I do not think so 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.579
 a lot because a lot of people know her and 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.260
 Many people know the series to which 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.840
 belongs but by God I love this 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.400
 obviously he could not miss 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.989
 this top and obviously I could not leave her 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.519
 in another position that is not the first and 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.620
 Well, these would be my five 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.810
 bravest female characters of the 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.610
 anime is to say that this is an opinion 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.470
 nothing else I'm not saying this 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.930
 have to be a universal law or something 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.430
 that's my opinion and that's why I want 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.479
 you leave in the comments what is 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.800
 for you are the characters 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:39.599
 bravest female anime and then 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.750
 Well, it would not be more, thank you very much 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.680
 for joining me once again this week 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.060
 remember that I am I ata cult 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.500
 the description of the video will suffice 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.210
 everything on my channel 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.720
 obviously the networks are also going to be 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.160
 social the world of the channel and then 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.670
 my channels will also be 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.670
 companions
