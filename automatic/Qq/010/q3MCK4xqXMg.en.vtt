00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.960
 euros on the square 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.760

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.380
 young people have for the entire year 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.610

 So 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.280
 here it was once we started but luckily we have become very common 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.380
 anyway what a walk with this new l 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.850
 and see if even a success story awaits our creativity 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.110
 This is then a great bicycle parking plan for 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.820
 two years 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.850
 steel 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.850
 staggered the bus trip things for the cause 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.980
 the high moors 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.830
 we feed 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.150
 the 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.490
 central role of gaal 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.490

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.619
 after I am sitting there the fisherman is also much lighter there is a lot of glass at the time 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.350
 a lot of people from the area come rubbish of course 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.320
 the choose to 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.100
 the information market where you go with your code 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:16.250
 that recognizes pilots in all but fears mainly hvc employment agency 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.399
 and then we hope an important one 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:19.739
 twenty organized 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.739

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.010
 Wassenaar Westland It's going to score the fact
