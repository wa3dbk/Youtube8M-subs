 hi there is the 25th edition of mod reviews 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.839
 for minecraft and today we have a mod 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.849
 aircraft 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:12.030
 which maykkravt adds only 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.690
 one thing is it is very similar to 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.789
 enchanted table enchantment but it is not 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:26.060
 so let's scrub that proper 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:31.920
 called a physicist and this thing allows 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:35.489
 make any planes and well any 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.399
 vehicles let's take not 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.500
 I know wool 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.290
 sandstone here I still have obsidian and 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.920
 some practical purpose there 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.920
 I will make it clear bullshit so 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.830
 so well and actually know her on 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.089
 anything 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:08.320
 here let's say there will be sandstone 2 here 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:13.140
 will be how wool and dark so tree 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:17.290
 let's do all this married obsidian 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.259
 setting the garbage itself by clicking 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.960
 right click we here she wrote 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:29.950
 that all the blocks get out of here all the blocks have 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.780
 as if we found the truth and now we can 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.940
 take off is controlled it's all with him bada 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.050
 and only with him again control 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.680
 Nezhin will 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:42.220
 I will certainly tell you, but the parcel is all 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.470
 will be the actual eight takes off 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.140
 deuce sits here sits 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.440
 by the way there and here we sit down then write 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:55.509
 where we strongly what coordinates here 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:02:00.880
 take off 5 abrupt stop 79 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:06.729
 this turns aside also 45 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:10.630

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:14.730
 right-left and one is forward 3 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.650
 this is back here of such a simple control 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.310

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.790
