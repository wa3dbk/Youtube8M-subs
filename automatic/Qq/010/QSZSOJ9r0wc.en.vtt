00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
kind of determine how how stiff it's

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.250 
kind of determine how how stiff it's
going<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.890> be<00:03:05.510> instead<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.600> dumping<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.990> all<00:03:07.050> in

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
going to be instead of dumping it all in

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:16.340 
going to be instead of dumping it all in
at<00:03:07.350> once

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.750 

we're<00:03:17.350> looking<00:03:17.560> for<00:03:17.740> that<00:03:17.860> breadcrumbs<00:03:18.460> to

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
we're looking for that breadcrumbs to

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.300 
we're looking for that breadcrumbs to
dry<00:03:19.150> out<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.360> texture<00:03:19.750> just<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:20.050> little<00:03:20.260> bit<00:03:20.410> so

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
dry out the texture just a little bit so

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.120 
dry out the texture just a little bit so
it's<00:03:21.460> not<00:03:21.520> sticky<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:22.560> starts<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.650> firm<00:03:23.800> up<00:03:23.980> a

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
it's not sticky and starts to firm up a

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.160 
it's not sticky and starts to firm up a
little<00:03:24.310> bit<00:03:24.520> well<00:03:25.360> it<00:03:25.480> shouldn't<00:03:25.780> be<00:03:25.840> sticking

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
little bit well it shouldn't be sticking

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.910 
little bit well it shouldn't be sticking
to<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.350> spatula<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:29.140> once<00:03:29.410> we<00:03:29.560> reach<00:03:29.710> this

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
to the spatula so once we reach this

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.560 
to the spatula so once we reach this
texture<00:03:30.340> we're<00:03:31.000> going<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.180> cover<00:03:31.390> it<00:03:31.540> with

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
texture we're going to cover it with

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.800 
texture we're going to cover it with
plastic<00:03:31.690> wrap<00:03:32.050> stick<00:03:32.800> it<00:03:32.890> in<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.070> walk-in<00:03:33.280> and

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
plastic wrap stick it in the walk-in and

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.290 
plastic wrap stick it in the walk-in and
get<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.900> sauce<00:03:35.080> ready

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
and while that's happening we can form

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.879 
and while that's happening we can form
our<00:04:45.290> chickpea<00:04:45.620> patties

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.589 

this<00:04:49.129> will<00:04:49.280> genuinely<00:04:49.550> make<00:04:49.849> like<00:04:50.090> four<00:04:50.509> or

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
this will genuinely make like four or

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:53.559 
this will genuinely make like four or
five<00:04:50.659> patties<00:04:51.490> you<00:04:52.490> can<00:04:52.639> freeform<00:04:53.180> them<00:04:53.360> or

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569 
five patties you can freeform them or

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:55.270 
five patties you can freeform them or
however<00:04:54.050> you<00:04:54.139> want<00:04:54.289> to<00:04:54.379> form<00:04:54.560> them<00:04:54.740> I<00:04:54.919> prefer

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
however you want to form them I prefer

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.820 
however you want to form them I prefer
to<00:04:55.340> use<00:04:55.490> the<00:04:55.699> top<00:04:55.909> of<00:04:55.960> one<00:04:56.960> of<00:04:56.990> our<00:04:57.139> lids<00:04:57.409> it

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
to use the top of one of our lids it

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.640 
to use the top of one of our lids it
kind<00:04:58.189> of<00:04:58.219> gives<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.460> perfect<00:04:59.409> circular<00:05:00.409> shape

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
kind of gives the perfect circular shape

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.499 
kind of gives the perfect circular shape
that<00:05:00.860> fits<00:05:01.069> perfectly<00:05:01.490> in<00:05:01.669> our<00:05:01.819> and<00:05:02.180> our<00:05:02.270> nan

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
that fits perfectly in our and our nan

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:04.600 
that fits perfectly in our and our nan
but<00:05:03.020> it's<00:05:03.259> just<00:05:03.409> as<00:05:03.560> easy<00:05:03.740> to<00:05:03.889> preform<00:05:04.340> these

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
but it's just as easy to preform these

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.989 
but it's just as easy to preform these
at<00:05:04.969> home<00:05:05.210> just<00:05:05.870> took<00:05:06.050> a<00:05:06.110> little<00:05:06.759> bread<00:05:07.759> crumbs

00:05:07.989 --> 00:05:07.999 
at home just took a little bread crumbs

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:10.499 
at home just took a little bread crumbs
in<00:05:08.120> there<00:05:08.240> just<00:05:08.479> so<00:05:08.539> it<00:05:08.599> won't<00:05:08.749> stick<00:05:08.840> to<00:05:09.080> the

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
in there just so it won't stick to the

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:15.100 
in there just so it won't stick to the
form<00:05:11.509> for<00:05:11.870> the<00:05:11.900> mole<00:05:13.479> we<00:05:14.479> just<00:05:14.659> press<00:05:14.840> it<00:05:15.020> in

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
form for the mole we just press it in

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.989 
form for the mole we just press it in
there<00:05:15.879> so<00:05:16.879> it's<00:05:16.999> a<00:05:17.029> nice<00:05:17.150> uniform<00:05:17.659> shape<00:05:18.999> and

00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:19.999 
there so it's a nice uniform shape and

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:24.070 
there so it's a nice uniform shape and
