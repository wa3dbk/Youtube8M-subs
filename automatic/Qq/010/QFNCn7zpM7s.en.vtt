00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:14.950
Night-time sharpens, heightens each sensation;

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:24.700
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:35.280
Silently the senses abandon their defenses.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:56.160
Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendour;

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:05.410
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.590
Turn your face away from the garish light of day,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:21.260
turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:29.780
and listen to the music of the night.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.450
Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams!

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.100
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before!

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:57.520
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:09.500
and you'll live as you've never lived before.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.990
Softly, deftly, music shall caress you.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:27.250
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.240
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.480
in this darkness which you know you cannot fight,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.510
the darkness of the music of the night.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.170
Let your mind start a journey through a strange, new world;

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.700
leave all thoughts of the life you knew before.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:14.810
Let your soul take you where you long to be!

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:27.580
Only then can you belong to me.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.910
Floating, falling, sweet intoxication.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.440
Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.210
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.630
to the power of the music that I write,

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:09.670
the power of the music of the night.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:44.570
You alone can make my song take flight,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:05:21.110
help me make the music of the night. __________________
