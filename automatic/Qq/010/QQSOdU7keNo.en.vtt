the<00:01:14.310> vial<00:01:14.550> job<00:01:14.940> so<00:01:15.420> let's<00:01:15.720> go<00:01:15.899> ahead<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.409> get

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the vial job so let's go ahead and get

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.590 
the vial job so let's go ahead and get
this<00:01:16.740> part<00:01:17.070> underway<00:01:17.549> look<00:01:18.330> what<00:01:18.570> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
this part underway look what a

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
I used a half inch rolls for this really

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.970 
I used a half inch rolls for this really
don't<00:02:10.330> matter<00:02:10.509> which<00:02:10.959> way<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.319> go<00:02:11.680> but<00:02:11.920> I

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
go ahead get that and switch to the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.910 
go ahead get that and switch to the
three-eighths<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:42.930> go<00:02:43.930> from<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.440> with<00:02:44.770> her

see<00:02:45.640> look<00:02:45.880> here<00:02:46.150> you<00:02:46.390> can<00:02:46.540> already<00:02:46.630> tell<00:02:47.020> the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
see look here you can already tell the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.040 
see look here you can already tell the
difference<00:02:47.800> it<00:02:48.040> side-by-side<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:49.600> can<00:02:49.690> just

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
difference it side-by-side you can just

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.280 
difference it side-by-side you can just
see<00:02:50.290> where<00:02:51.280> one<00:02:51.610> was<00:02:51.910> stoned<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.750> then<00:02:53.140> the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
see where one was stoned and then the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.280 
see where one was stoned and then the
other<00:02:53.530> one<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:54.210> quarter<00:02:55.210> was<00:02:55.570> it<00:02:55.780> let<00:02:55.930> me<00:02:56.050> get<00:02:56.230> it

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
other one a quarter was it let me get it

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.670 
other one a quarter was it let me get it
set<00:02:56.560> up<00:02:56.590> for<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.160> right<00:02:57.460> to<00:02:58.330> get<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.690> exact

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
set up for you right to get the exact

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.730 
set up for you right to get the exact
reflectivity<00:03:00.459> of<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.820> light

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
reflectivity of the light

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:19.780 
reflectivity of the light
ya<00:03:02.740> think<00:03:03.100> that's<00:03:03.400> doing<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:04.030> right<00:03:04.240> there

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.229 

on<00:03:20.360> this<00:03:20.769> situation<00:03:21.769> this<00:03:22.040> is<00:03:22.280> not<00:03:22.610> just<00:03:23.060> about

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
on this situation this is not just about

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.720 
on this situation this is not just about
pretty<00:03:23.810> this<00:03:24.680> has<00:03:24.950> a<00:03:24.980> pumpkin

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.400 

question<00:03:29.010> borderline

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.620 

polishing<00:03:33.410> that<00:03:33.560> tangle<00:03:34.250> keep<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:34.850> comment

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.470 

there's<00:03:37.810> big<00:03:38.170> differences<00:03:38.940> so<00:03:39.940> this<00:03:40.210> you

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
there's big differences so this you

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.920 
there's big differences so this you
think<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:41.200> know<00:03:41.350> it<00:03:41.710> still<00:03:42.040> necessarily<00:03:42.970> on

switch<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.760> smaller<00:03:55.180> one<00:03:55.510> pay<00:03:55.750> let's<00:03:56.049> zoom

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
switch to the smaller one pay let's zoom

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:03.830 
switch to the smaller one pay let's zoom
in<00:03:56.590> on<00:03:56.620> our<00:03:56.920> valve<00:03:57.190> area<00:03:57.640> there<00:04:02.610> all<00:04:03.610> right

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
in on our valve area there all right

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.869 
in on our valve area there all right
this<00:04:04.840> is<00:04:05.140> what<00:04:05.349> I'm<00:04:05.470> using<00:04:05.830> see<00:04:06.310> it's<00:04:06.549> a<00:04:06.700> lot

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
this is what I'm using see it's a lot

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:07.970 
this is what I'm using see it's a lot
smaller

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
smaller

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.740

that's<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.220> diameter<00:04:09.430> 1/2<00:04:10.060> inch<00:04:10.420> I'm<00:04:10.720> going

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
that's the diameter 1/2 inch I'm going

00:04:10.750 --> 00:05:45.820 
that's the diameter 1/2 inch I'm going
to<00:04:11.230> three-eighths<00:04:11.879> because<00:04:12.879> this
