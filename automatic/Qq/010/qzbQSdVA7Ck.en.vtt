abuse so I don't see a point now this
might<00:02:15.930> change<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:17.280> only<00:02:17.520> way<00:02:17.640> around<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:18.120> is

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
might change the only way around this is

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.300 
might change the only way around this is
that<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.440> can<00:02:20.040> do<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.220> test<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:21.180> youtube<00:02:21.720> like
