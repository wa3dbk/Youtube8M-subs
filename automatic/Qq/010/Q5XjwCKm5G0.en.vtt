of<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:33.050> floor<00:00:34.050> I've<00:00:34.350> made<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> space<00:00:36.000> below

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
of this floor I've made a space below

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.700 
of this floor I've made a space below
the<00:00:36.540> studio<00:00:36.870> where<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.410> put<00:00:37.530> all<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
the studio where I can put all the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.680 
the studio where I can put all the
redstone<00:00:38.070> there'll<00:00:38.910> be<00:00:39.000> some<00:00:39.300> note<00:00:39.480> blocks

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
redstone there'll be some note blocks

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.810 
redstone there'll be some note blocks
that<00:00:39.870> trigger<00:00:40.079> after<00:00:40.260> one<00:00:40.500> minute<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.610> let's

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
that trigger after one minute so let's

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.369 
that trigger after one minute so let's
start<00:00:42.030> putting<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> redstone<00:00:43.140> I'm<00:00:43.260> gonna

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
start putting in the redstone I'm gonna

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.900 
start putting in the redstone I'm gonna
put<00:00:43.590> some<00:00:43.710> redstone<00:00:43.890> dust<00:00:44.219> right<00:00:44.520> below<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
put some redstone dust right below the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.520 
put some redstone dust right below the
button<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.329> then<00:00:45.660> repeater<00:00:46.579> right<00:00:47.579> here<00:00:48.030> and

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
button and then repeater right here and

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.130 
button and then repeater right here and
the<00:00:49.530> way<00:00:49.649> I've<00:00:49.770> done<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.190> now<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:51.140> block

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
the way I've done this now I can block

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200 
the way I've done this now I can block
off<00:00:52.410> all<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.699> when<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.879> push<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
off all of this and when I push the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.029 
off all of this and when I push the
button<00:00:54.239> you'll<00:00:54.989> see<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> repeater<00:00:55.559> turns<00:00:55.829> on

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
button you'll see the repeater turns on

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.119 
button you'll see the repeater turns on
below<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:57.449> completely<00:00:57.780> block<00:00:58.020> off<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
below so I can completely block off the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.410 
below so I can completely block off the
floor<00:00:59.730> below<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.890> or<00:01:01.890> or<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.640> redstone<00:01:03.120> below

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
floor below and or or the redstone below

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.600 
floor below and or or the redstone below
from<00:01:03.809> view<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.949> will<00:01:05.040> still<00:01:05.309> all<00:01:05.430> get

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
from view but it will still all get

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.460 
from view but it will still all get
triggered<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.119> that's<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.960> handy<00:01:07.350> little

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
triggered and that's a handy little

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.310 
triggered and that's a handy little
trick<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:08.010> will<00:01:08.850> need<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.180> block<00:01:09.420> here<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.229> I'm

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
trick I will need a block here so I'm

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.560 
trick I will need a block here so I'm
gonna<00:01:10.409> put<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> floor<00:01:11.040> black<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.700> back<00:01:12.240> there

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
gonna put the floor black for back there

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.340 
gonna put the floor black for back there
the<00:01:13.409> block<00:01:13.619> here<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.189> then<00:01:14.340> now<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.150> can<00:01:15.479> get

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
the block here and then now I can get

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.560 
the block here and then now I can get
the<00:01:16.380> redstone<00:01:16.860> signals<00:01:17.220> from<00:01:17.400> up<00:01:17.759> there<00:01:17.970> I'm

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the redstone signals from up there I'm

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.240 
the redstone signals from up there I'm
gonna<00:01:18.750> I'm<00:01:19.380> gonna<00:01:19.560> put<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> button<00:01:19.979> right<00:01:20.070> here

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
gonna I'm gonna put a button right here

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.340 
gonna I'm gonna put a button right here
because<00:01:20.850> that'll<00:01:21.150> simulate<00:01:21.630> pressing<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
because that'll simulate pressing the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.890 
because that'll simulate pressing the
button<00:01:22.650> from<00:01:23.040> Pyro's<00:01:23.369> seat<00:01:23.720> it'll<00:01:24.720> trigger

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
button from Pyro's seat it'll trigger

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.810 
button from Pyro's seat it'll trigger
this<00:01:25.110> redstone<00:01:25.590> which<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.580> will<00:01:26.670> trigger

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
this redstone which is what will trigger

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.120 
this redstone which is what will trigger
the<00:01:26.939> whole<00:01:27.030> circuit<00:01:27.420> okay<00:01:28.380> now<00:01:28.799> I'm<00:01:28.920> gonna<00:01:29.040> use

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
the whole circuit okay now I'm gonna use

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.149 
the whole circuit okay now I'm gonna use
some<00:01:29.280> droppers<00:01:29.970> one<00:01:30.869> goes<00:01:31.200> here<00:01:31.619> facing<00:01:31.890> that

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
some droppers one goes here facing that

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.770 
some droppers one goes here facing that
way<00:01:32.310> one<00:01:32.549> goes<00:01:32.759> here<00:01:33.060> facing<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.570> way

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
way one goes here facing this way

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
way one goes here facing this way
they're<00:01:33.960> facing<00:01:34.200> each<00:01:34.470> other<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.070> they're

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
they're facing each other and they're

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.060 
they're facing each other and they're
gonna<00:01:35.340> spit<00:01:35.670> items<00:01:36.000> back<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.329> forth<00:01:36.509> between

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.130 
gonna spit items back and forth between
between<00:01:38.070> two<00:01:38.600> droppers<00:01:39.600> I'm<00:01:39.810> gonna<00:01:39.930> put<00:01:40.110> just

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
between two droppers I'm gonna put just

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.109 
between two droppers I'm gonna put just
a<00:01:40.380> single<00:01:40.650> item<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.340> one<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.180> droppers<00:01:42.630> and

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
a single item in one of the droppers and

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.460 
a single item in one of the droppers and
that'll<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.180> useful<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.930> stress<00:01:46.140> me<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.380> will

that'll be useful to stress me it will
okay<00:01:47.250> we're<00:01:47.399> gonna<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:47.610> some<00:01:47.790> comparators

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
okay we're gonna have some comparators

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.090 
okay we're gonna have some comparators
so<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:48.990> comparator<00:01:49.350> goes<00:01:49.470> here<00:01:49.799> one<00:01:49.950> goes

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
so one comparator goes here one goes

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.649 
so one comparator goes here one goes
here<00:01:50.430> you'll<00:01:50.820> notice<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.420> on

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
here you'll notice this one is on

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.880 
here you'll notice this one is on
because<00:01:51.990> they<00:01:52.110> know<00:01:52.140> there's<00:01:52.470> an<00:01:52.619> item<00:01:52.799> in

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
because they know there's an item in

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.380 
because they know there's an item in
this<00:01:52.950> dropper<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:53.759> there's<00:01:53.939> no<00:01:54.030> item<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.329> this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
this dropper but there's no item in this

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.569 
this dropper but there's no item in this
Traverse<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.930> one's<00:01:55.079> off<00:01:55.259> now<00:01:56.219> I'm<00:01:56.430> gonna

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
Traverse so this one's off now I'm gonna

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.850 
Traverse so this one's off now I'm gonna
take<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> couple<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.450> hoppers<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.530> I'm<00:01:58.770> gonna

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
take a couple of hoppers and I'm gonna

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.090 
take a couple of hoppers and I'm gonna
face<00:01:59.100> them<00:01:59.340> towards<00:01:59.759> each<00:01:59.850> other<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:01.100> these

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
face them towards each other and these

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.910 
face them towards each other and these
this<00:02:02.430> will<00:02:02.610> form<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> basis<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.990> delay<00:02:04.649> in

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
this will form the basis of the delay in

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.580 
this will form the basis of the delay in
the<00:02:05.040> clock<00:02:05.930> now<00:02:06.930> I'm<00:02:07.140> gonna<00:02:07.229> want<00:02:07.469> a

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
the clock now I'm gonna want a

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.979 
the clock now I'm gonna want a
comparator<00:02:08.039> coming<00:02:08.399> off<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.970> one<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.509> a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
comparator coming off of this one and a

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.270 
comparator coming off of this one and a
comparator<00:02:10.379> coming<00:02:10.679> off<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.069> one

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
comparator coming off of this one

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.170 
comparator coming off of this one
and<00:02:13.230> let's<00:02:14.230> grab<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.470> block<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.910> there's<00:02:16.060> gonna

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
and let's grab a block and there's gonna

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.820 
and let's grab a block and there's gonna
be<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.360> torch<00:02:16.600> on<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.780> side<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:17.590> this

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
be a torch on the side of this so this

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.250 
be a torch on the side of this so this
torch<00:02:18.100> is<00:02:18.130> on<00:02:18.460> whenever<00:02:19.060> there's<00:02:19.630> nothing<00:02:20.110> in

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
torch is on whenever there's nothing in

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.830 
torch is on whenever there's nothing in
this<00:02:20.410> hopper<00:02:21.160> I'm<00:02:21.730> gonna<00:02:21.880> put<00:02:22.150> some<00:02:22.390> items<00:02:22.660> in

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
this hopper I'm gonna put some items in

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.540 
this hopper I'm gonna put some items in
this<00:02:22.960> hopper<00:02:23.320> just<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.710> few<00:02:24.580> seven<00:02:25.330> let's<00:02:25.510> say

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
this hopper just a few seven let's say

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.190 
this hopper just a few seven let's say
I'm<00:02:27.550> gonna<00:02:27.760> add<00:02:27.910> more<00:02:28.090> later<00:02:28.390> should<00:02:28.959> be<00:02:29.050> about

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
I'm gonna add more later should be about

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.470 
I'm gonna add more later should be about
75<00:02:29.740> when<00:02:29.920> I'm<00:02:30.010> done<00:02:30.190> but<00:02:30.520> for<00:02:30.730> now<00:02:30.850> just<00:02:31.150> for

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
75 when I'm done but for now just for

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.940 
75 when I'm done but for now just for
testing<00:02:31.780> purposes<00:02:32.230> it'd<00:02:32.380> be<00:02:32.530> nice<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.800> have<00:02:32.920> a

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
testing purposes it'd be nice to have a

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.180 
testing purposes it'd be nice to have a
smaller<00:02:33.250> number<00:02:33.310> so<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.750> clock<00:02:35.190> goes

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
smaller number so that the clock goes

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.760 
smaller number so that the clock goes
off<00:02:36.370> quicker<00:02:36.790> I'm<00:02:37.750> going<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.200> run<00:02:38.380> this<00:02:38.500> line

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
off quicker I'm going to run this line

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.199 
off quicker I'm going to run this line
around<00:02:38.890> I'm<00:02:39.310> gonna<00:02:39.490> put<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.670> block<00:02:39.880> here<00:02:39.910> so

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
around I'm gonna put a block here so

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.810 
around I'm gonna put a block here so
whenever<00:02:41.140> what<00:02:41.890> basically<00:02:42.190> what<00:02:42.430> was<00:02:42.580> going

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
whenever what basically what was going

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.790 
whenever what basically what was going
on<00:02:42.850> is<00:02:43.030> whenever<00:02:43.209> there's<00:02:43.720> no<00:02:44.050> items<00:02:44.410> left<00:02:44.680> in

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
on is whenever there's no items left in

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.960 
on is whenever there's no items left in
this<00:02:44.920> hopper<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.489> source<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.790> going<00:02:45.910> to

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
this hopper and the source is going to

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.890 
this hopper and the source is going to
turn<00:02:46.150> on<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.600> trigger<00:02:47.500> this<00:02:48.010> dropper<00:02:48.900> okay

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
turn on and trigger this dropper okay

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.970 
turn on and trigger this dropper okay
cool<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:51.180> that's<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.540> for<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.959> timer<00:02:53.260> I'm

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
cool so that's it for the timer I'm

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.479 
cool so that's it for the timer I'm
gonna<00:02:54.190> put<00:02:54.430> in<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.970> block<00:02:55.630> here<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:57.190> redstone

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
gonna put in a block here and a redstone

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.620 
gonna put in a block here and a redstone
torch<00:02:57.780> here<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.880> these<00:03:00.880> are<00:03:01.120> gonna<00:03:01.270> is

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
torch here and these are gonna is

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.270 
torch here and these are gonna is
basically<00:03:01.930> going<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.170> trigger<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.709> note

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
basically going to trigger the note

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.060 
basically going to trigger the note
blocks<00:03:03.520> so<00:03:03.880> oops<00:03:04.680> there's<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.739> torch<00:03:05.920> on<00:03:06.010> the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
blocks so oops there's a torch on the

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.940 
blocks so oops there's a torch on the
wall<00:03:06.300> so<00:03:07.300> I'm<00:03:07.390> gonna<00:03:07.480> clear<00:03:08.080> out<00:03:08.110> three<00:03:08.620> spots

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
wall so I'm gonna clear out three spots

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.710 
wall so I'm gonna clear out three spots
four<00:03:09.430> note<00:03:10.060> blocks<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:12.180> I'm<00:03:13.180> gonna<00:03:13.360> use<00:03:13.510> dirt

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
four note blocks and I'm gonna use dirt

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.690 
four note blocks and I'm gonna use dirt
underneath<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.410> note<00:03:14.560> blocks<00:03:14.800> because

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
underneath the note blocks because

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.600 
underneath the note blocks because
that'll<00:03:15.940> make<00:03:16.330> them<00:03:16.480> play<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:17.040> piano<00:03:18.040> slash

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
that'll make them play the piano slash

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.780 
that'll make them play the piano slash
harp<00:03:19.450> sound<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:21.420> three<00:03:22.420> note<00:03:22.570> blocks<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:24.040> I

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
harp sound and three note blocks and I

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.520 
harp sound and three note blocks and I
can<00:03:24.970> set<00:03:25.330> them<00:03:25.570> to<00:03:25.780> whatever<00:03:25.930> tune<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.320> want

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
can set them to whatever tune I want

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.759 
can set them to whatever tune I want
I'll<00:03:26.650> probably<00:03:26.830> do<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.100> later<00:03:27.340> off-camera

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
I'll probably do that later off-camera

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.660 
I'll probably do that later off-camera
but<00:03:29.769> we're<00:03:29.890> gonna<00:03:29.980> test<00:03:30.280> that<00:03:30.340> everything

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
but we're gonna test that everything

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.810 
but we're gonna test that everything
works<00:03:30.820> first<00:03:31.420> okay<00:03:31.870> so<00:03:31.930> from<00:03:32.590> now<00:03:32.820> basically

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
works first okay so from now basically

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.100 
works first okay so from now basically
what's<00:03:34.000> gonna<00:03:34.120> go<00:03:34.299> on<00:03:34.330> is<00:03:34.570> when<00:03:34.690> I<00:03:34.750> push<00:03:34.930> the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
what's gonna go on is when I push the

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.500 
what's gonna go on is when I push the
button<00:03:35.140> this<00:03:36.070> hopper<00:03:36.519> is<00:03:36.670> gonna<00:03:36.820> unload<00:03:37.239> all

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
button this hopper is gonna unload all

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.880 
button this hopper is gonna unload all
seven<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:37.900> this<00:03:37.989> cobblestone<00:03:38.230> into<00:03:38.769> this

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
seven of this cobblestone into this

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.259 
seven of this cobblestone into this
hopper<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.430> then<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:41.410> then<00:03:42.280> this<00:03:42.850> hopper

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
hopper and then and then this hopper

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.150 
hopper and then and then this hopper
well<00:03:43.540> after<00:03:43.900> that<00:03:44.049> unload<00:03:44.470> all<00:03:44.709> seven

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
well after that unload all seven

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
well after that unload all seven
cobblestone<00:03:45.610> back<00:03:45.760> into<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.060> original

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
cobblestone back into the original

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.970 
cobblestone back into the original
hopper<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.840> that<00:03:47.079> will<00:03:47.230> complete<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.590> timer

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
hopper and that will complete the timer

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.009 
hopper and that will complete the timer
so<00:03:48.820> we'll<00:03:48.970> see<00:03:49.090> that<00:03:49.209> happening<00:03:49.600> I<00:03:49.690> press<00:03:49.870> the

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
so we'll see that happening I press the

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.960 
so we'll see that happening I press the
button<00:03:50.049> I<00:03:50.440> look<00:03:50.680> in<00:03:50.769> this<00:03:50.860> hopper<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.790> gets

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
button I look in this hopper it gets

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.560 
button I look in this hopper it gets
emptied<00:03:52.329> out<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.750> then<00:03:52.989> it<00:03:53.200> fills<00:03:53.440> back<00:03:53.620> up

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
emptied out and then it fills back up

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.449 
emptied out and then it fills back up
and<00:03:55.570> then<00:03:56.170> we<00:03:56.320> heard<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.799> note<00:03:56.950> box<00:03:57.070> go<00:03:57.340> off

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
and then we heard the note box go off

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.680 
and then we heard the note box go off
I'm<00:03:57.670> gonna<00:03:57.820> add<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:57.940> little<00:03:58.000> bit<00:03:58.180> more<00:03:58.209> delay<00:03:58.600> on

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
I'm gonna add a little bit more delay on

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.150 
I'm gonna add a little bit more delay on
these<00:03:58.870> guys<00:03:59.790> just<00:04:00.790> so<00:04:00.880> that<00:04:01.060> there's<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.980> can

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
these guys just so that there's you can

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.440 
these guys just so that there's you can
hear<00:04:03.370> each<00:04:03.459> one<00:04:03.670> independently

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.330 

there<00:04:09.450> we<00:04:09.540> go<00:04:09.840> so<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.620> only<00:04:10.739> thing<00:04:10.950> left<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.190> do

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
there we go so the only thing left to do

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.470 
there we go so the only thing left to do
is<00:04:11.580> add<00:04:11.819> more<00:04:12.120> cobblestone<00:04:12.900> here<00:04:13.190> should<00:04:14.190> be

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
is add more cobblestone here should be

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.520 
is add more cobblestone here should be
75<00:04:15.480> so<00:04:16.340> 64<00:04:17.340> plus<00:04:17.579> 11<00:04:18.060> should<00:04:18.690> be<00:04:18.780> about<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.290> 1

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
75 so 64 plus 11 should be about a 1

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.590 
75 so 64 plus 11 should be about a 1
minute<00:04:19.739> timer<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.669> there<00:04:21.180> we<00:04:21.269> go

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
minute timer and there we go

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.520 
minute timer and there we go
the<00:04:21.810> whole<00:04:22.320> circuit<00:04:22.620> here<00:04:22.800> is<00:04:22.830> done<00:04:23.160> I'm<00:04:23.370> in<00:04:23.490> a

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
the whole circuit here is done I'm in a

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.150 
the whole circuit here is done I'm in a
four<00:04:25.530> five<00:04:25.889> six<00:04:26.700> seven<00:04:27.450> eight<00:04:27.990> nine<00:04:28.160> ten

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
four five six seven eight nine ten

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.879 
four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven<00:04:29.940> twelve<00:04:30.080> so<00:04:31.080> I'm<00:04:31.169> probably<00:04:31.290> gonna<00:04:31.530> up

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
eleven twelve so I'm probably gonna up

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:39.170 
eleven twelve so I'm probably gonna up
these<00:04:32.100> all<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:32.639> twelve<00:04:34.760> and<00:04:37.790> there<00:04:38.790> we<00:04:38.880> go

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
these all to twelve and there we go

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.850 
these all to twelve and there we go
and<00:04:39.300> now<00:04:40.080> there<00:04:40.350> should<00:04:40.440> be<00:04:40.560> a<00:04:40.590> one<00:04:40.710> minute

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
and now there should be a one minute

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
and now there should be a one minute
timer<00:04:41.389> so<00:04:42.389> I'm<00:04:42.510> gonna<00:04:42.630> press<00:04:42.840> this<00:04:42.960> button<00:04:43.200> and

timer so I'm gonna press this button and

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.840 
timer so I'm gonna press this button and
we'll<00:04:44.880> see<00:04:45.090> how<00:04:45.690> close<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:46.080> got<00:04:46.520> I'm<00:04:47.520> gonna<00:04:47.700> have

staircase like you have it and let's see

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:25.040 
staircase like you have it and let's see
does<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.460> timer<00:05:14.669> go<00:05:14.880> off

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.640 

and<00:05:26.050> long<00:05:26.260> journey<00:05:26.560> to<00:05:26.650> get<00:05:26.800> that<00:05:28.020> hitting<00:05:29.020> it

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650

I<00:05:43.960> didn't<00:05:44.470> have<00:05:44.620> the<00:05:44.949> clock<00:05:45.310> on<00:05:45.580> I<00:05:46.060> added<00:05:47.020> that

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
I didn't have the clock on I added that

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.629 
I didn't have the clock on I added that
in<00:05:47.229> post-production<00:05:47.560> so<00:05:48.100> I<00:05:48.130> couldn't<00:05:48.490> tell

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
in post-production so I couldn't tell

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.040 
in post-production so I couldn't tell
there<00:05:49.630> we<00:05:49.720> go

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
there we go

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.370 
there we go
so<00:05:50.229> about<00:05:50.949> a<00:05:50.979> minute<00:05:51.340> and<00:05:52.139> there<00:05:53.139> you<00:05:53.260> go

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
so about a minute and there you go

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.950 
so about a minute and there you go
that's<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:53.940> that's<00:05:54.940> the<00:05:55.060> clock<00:05:55.330> for<00:05:55.750> the

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
that's the that's the clock for the

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.390 
that's the that's the clock for the
studio<00:05:56.289> it<00:05:56.560> should<00:05:56.740> work<00:05:56.860> pretty<00:05:57.010> well<00:05:57.130> for

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
studio it should work pretty well for

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.760 
studio it should work pretty well for
those<00:05:57.520> one<00:05:57.699> minute<00:05:58.000> interviews<00:05:58.620> that's<00:05:59.620> about

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
those one minute interviews that's about

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.550 
those one minute interviews that's about
it<00:05:59.919> thanks<00:06:00.190> for<00:06:00.220> watching
