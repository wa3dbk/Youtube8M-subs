00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.740
 and the other day it was seen out there that I do not know 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.200
 played well but the intention always 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.510
 always so typical of the croni-k group 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.100
 good on sunday the world san lorenzo 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.330
 He was very angry about the performance 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.620
 of lunati for that criminal that 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.750
 I probably would have given the title 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.430
 until lorenzo as a point of reference for the club 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.030
 what opinion do you have and if you are worried about that 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.950
 theme facing the match in liniers 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.670
 with respect to that complicated medium 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.140
 then they call you a crybaby that 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.000
 when it favors you not to say anything 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.910
 then when they hurt you if you go out to 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.410
 talk and then I think it's not already 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.690
 it happened for me it was criminal 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.090
 and there was everyone but they are good 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.370
 they are decisions that out there sometimes do not 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.410
 they charge it and sometimes they charge in favor 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.150
 I'm talking about referees a lot 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.370
 because of the way I told you 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.650
 principle of the answers that 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.660
 You kind of cry like that if it's not the 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.470
 idea of ​​this group was the idea this 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.960
 late 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.080
 to face that match that so much 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.330
 is talking and that was postponed by 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.490
 order of lanús and sometimes they favor 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.210
 one and do not favor the other the others 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.860
 so nothing we're good we're 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.890
 training this week or keep it 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.920
 it comes to be able to come from the best 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.050
 way I think that's the goal 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.480
 We are live for sport and just 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.090
 protester that is this party or this 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.340
 definition of championship as the cup 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.930
 get in this case in quotes like 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.970
 favorite with two points above the 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.560
 persecutors do not enter your head 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.630
 you do not understand the fact that they can not 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.399
 win this title 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.140
 personally the monument in the 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.960
 I do not see no head was not complaining 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.170
 not always in privacy or when 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.420
 you are just thinking many things 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.759
 think about when you're giving the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.930
 turn or also think sometimes a little 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.930
 in the negative 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:02.200
 but hey they are are matches are final 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.360
 against arsenal we think a lot that they 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.530
 I was going to give and then we ended up losing 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.770
 incredible match 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.950
 and this is in the same category 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.750
 it's a final over him 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.140
 and with whom he played he also asked 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.810
 championship 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.330
 it's going to be very one but we're good 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.560
 psyched for that we know how hard 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.360
 what is going to be the party 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.890
 obviously that we have a 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.840
 result more than that that is the tie 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.660
 and if the other team wins some of 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.190
 joves or lanús you assure a final but 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.560
 the idea of tickets go find the 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.170
 match and try to win it 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.150
 listening to this reflection that just 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.040
 you commented out there not winning the 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.040
 championship would be a big disappointment 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.840
 I always talked about the characters as 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:54.120
 I can give this whole note to me if it's me 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.519
 it's going to hurt a lot not to win like me 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.140
 It hurt a lot and I repeat all the notes that 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.220
 they make me those of the cup and I still have 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.220
 nailed to the chest 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.739
 out there some can say a year ago 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.319
 a year and a half we fought we fought the 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.599
 descent and we finished when a 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.880
 promotion and suffering in that way as 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.780
 we suffer 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.540
 and today you see san lorenzo 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.670
 better located in what is the club 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.129
 in what is in sports played a 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.079
 final and a cup final came to 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.840
 championship on the last date with many 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.720
 possibilities and some you see from that 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.180
 positive way 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.860
 obviously positive yes but once 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.140
 that you are at this height of the last 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.840
 date and with two points difference and with 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.730
 a lot of chance to come out champion I think 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.520
 that he can not let it escape and that 's 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.040
 what we are going to try to follow so that 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.830
 this happens what you're talking about in 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.590
 football that will weigh more what 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.470
 what can they do 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.200
 inside the court as a team or be 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.420
 okay from above as they rise up overcome 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.790
 anxiety what psychological play without 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.800
 public that that for the player must be 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:10.430
 quite important when defining 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.840
 a championship if obviously and not play 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.710
 with our people with the people of san 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.350
 lorenzo with the support he always gives us 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.889
 obviously playing now because there's no 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.830
 public visitor but always 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.080
 when when there was the visiting public 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.030
 the holy people always note the court 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.539
 and the support he always gave us was 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.539
 fundamental
