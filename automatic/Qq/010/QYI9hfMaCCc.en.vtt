00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
here's what we have so far we completely

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.730 
here's what we have so far we completely
organized<00:00:03.060> all<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:03.510> book<00:00:03.720> information<00:00:04.020> it

all<00:00:04.890> ties<00:00:05.100> back<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.549> this<00:00:05.700> you<00:00:06.299> follow<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.720> bar

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
all ties back to this you follow the bar

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.629 
all ties back to this you follow the bar
so<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.259> show<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:07.470> how<00:00:07.560> they're<00:00:07.799> connected<00:00:08.189> you

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
so to show you how they're connected you

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:09.770 
so to show you how they're connected you
can<00:00:08.670> see<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.030> connects<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.599> book

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
can see this connects to the book

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.480 
can see this connects to the book
authors<00:00:10.200> but<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.530> doesn't<00:00:10.800> directly<00:00:11.160> connect

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
authors but it doesn't directly connect

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.870 
authors but it doesn't directly connect
to<00:00:11.580> authors<00:00:11.940> but<00:00:12.570> authors<00:00:13.019> connects<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.130> book

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
to authors but authors connects to book

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.369 
to authors but authors connects to book
authors<00:00:15.299> which<00:00:15.570> connects<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.929> books

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
authors which connects to books

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.590 
authors which connects to books
so<00:00:16.949> these<00:00:17.130> are<00:00:17.340> technically<00:00:17.910> connected<00:00:18.240> as

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
so these are technically connected as

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.800 
so these are technically connected as
you<00:00:18.660> can<00:00:19.020> see<00:00:19.170> if<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.470> expand<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.359> a<00:00:21.359> little

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
you can see if you expand this a little

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.880 
you can see if you expand this a little
more<00:00:22.250> and<00:00:23.250> then<00:00:23.640> it'll<00:00:24.119> show<00:00:24.150> these<00:00:24.740> so<00:00:25.740> now

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
more and then it'll show these so now

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.650 
more and then it'll show these so now
