it isn't it's not it's like it's quite a
lot<00:03:34.830> of<00:03:35.420> pushing<00:03:36.420> just<00:03:36.750> push<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.890> down

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
lot of pushing just push that down

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.330 
lot of pushing just push that down
that's<00:03:39.180> not<00:03:39.299> very<00:03:39.630> good<00:03:39.780> because<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:41.040> one

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
that's not very good because this one

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.310 
that's not very good because this one
it's<00:03:41.519> just<00:03:41.580> really<00:03:41.880> simple<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.780> can<00:03:43.140> just

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
it's just really simple you can just

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.940 
it's just really simple you can just
press<00:03:43.500> down<00:03:43.820> but<00:03:44.820> it<00:03:45.030> isn't<00:03:45.299> lag<00:03:45.530> just<00:03:46.530> push<00:03:46.799> it

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
press down but it isn't lag just push it

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
didn't get the little memory chip it's

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.759 
didn't get the little memory chip it's
been<00:03:55.890> opposed<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.370> being<00:03:56.549> here<00:03:57.440> this<00:03:58.440> little

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
to look like an actual memory stick I

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:34.219 
to look like an actual memory stick I
just<00:04:29.759> zooming<00:04:30.030> in<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.300> bit<00:04:30.800> how<00:04:31.800> humans<00:04:33.229> get

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
around it and this is just a little just

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.089 
around it and this is just a little just
a<00:04:40.620> little<00:04:40.800> piece<00:04:41.630> so<00:04:42.860> it's<00:04:43.860> not<00:04:43.979> good<00:04:44.190> at<00:04:44.280> all

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
a little piece so it's not good at all

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.310

and I'm going to give this back I'm not
going<00:04:49.500> to<00:04:49.560> exchange<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:50.039> for<00:04:50.070> a<00:04:50.250> new<00:04:50.280> one<00:04:50.490> and

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
going to exchange it for a new one and

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.990 
going to exchange it for a new one and
we<00:04:51.300> get<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.570> wired<00:04:51.949> glow-in-the-dark<00:04:52.949> no<00:04:53.789> not

we get the wired glow-in-the-dark no not

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.560 
we get the wired glow-in-the-dark no not
blowing<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.419> docs<00:04:54.630> it's<00:04:55.289> some<00:04:56.120> it<00:04:57.120> just<00:04:57.300> glows

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
blowing the docs it's some it just glows

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.279 
blowing the docs it's some it just glows
I<00:04:57.960> think<00:04:58.530> it's<00:04:58.680> about<00:04:59.479> 14<00:05:00.479> pounds<00:05:01.020> and<00:05:01.169> it's

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
I think it's about 14 pounds and it's

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.689 
I think it's about 14 pounds and it's
wired<00:05:01.530> this<00:05:02.250> is<00:05:02.840> 20<00:05:03.840> pounds<00:05:04.139> originally<00:05:04.699> but

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
wired this is 20 pounds originally but

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.310 
wired this is 20 pounds originally but
it's<00:05:05.849> cheaper<00:05:06.330> and<00:05:08.539> just<00:05:09.539> give<00:05:09.690> me<00:05:09.840> what<00:05:09.960> you

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
it's cheaper and just give me what you

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.159 
it's cheaper and just give me what you
one<00:05:10.590> quick<00:05:10.889> thing<00:05:11.099> round<00:05:11.340> so<00:05:11.910> every<00:05:12.900> time<00:05:13.110> I

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
one quick thing round so every time I

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.250 
one quick thing round so every time I
watch<00:05:13.440> a<00:05:13.830> control<00:05:14.310> review<00:05:14.580> they<00:05:15.539> never<00:05:15.780> give

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
watch a control review they never give

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.520 
watch a control review they never give
you<00:05:16.289> a<00:05:16.409> spin<00:05:16.620> round<00:05:17.300> unless<00:05:18.300> some<00:05:18.810> people<00:05:19.169> some

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
you a spin round unless some people some

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.670 
you a spin round unless some people some
viewers<00:05:19.919> actually<00:05:20.310> do<00:05:21.349> pushes<00:05:22.349> all<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:22.620> way

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
viewers actually do pushes all the way

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.520 
viewers actually do pushes all the way
down<00:05:24.349> up<00:05:25.349> proper<00:05:25.889> one<00:05:26.570> it<00:05:27.570> won't<00:05:27.750> break<00:05:28.020> you

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
down up proper one it won't break you

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.529 
down up proper one it won't break you
can<00:05:28.650> turn<00:05:28.860> on<00:05:29.099> for<00:05:29.370> many<00:05:29.639> times<00:05:29.909> like<00:05:30.180> I<00:05:30.300> have

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
can turn on for many times like I have

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.189 
can turn on for many times like I have
still<00:05:31.349> won't<00:05:31.500> break<00:05:32.090> it<00:05:33.090> gets<00:05:33.360> scratched<00:05:33.810> and

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
still won't break it gets scratched and

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.070 
still won't break it gets scratched and
damaged<00:05:34.909> this<00:05:35.909> bit<00:05:36.210> it<00:05:36.449> looks<00:05:36.690> really

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
damaged this bit it looks really

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.379 
damaged this bit it looks really
uncomfortable<00:05:37.289> it's<00:05:38.099> not<00:05:38.310> so<00:05:38.550> bad<00:05:38.760> it<00:05:39.330> just

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
uncomfortable it's not so bad it just

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.120 
uncomfortable it's not so bad it just
stops<00:05:39.810> you<00:05:39.930> from<00:05:40.020> dropping<00:05:40.650> the<00:05:40.770> controller

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
stops you from dropping the controller

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:49.430 
stops you from dropping the controller
you<00:05:41.430> can<00:05:41.729> hear<00:05:42.090> it<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:47.810> it's<00:05:48.810> like<00:05:48.900> proper

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
you can hear it and it's like proper

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.439 
you can hear it and it's like proper
rubber<00:05:49.620> and<00:05:49.889> it<00:05:49.979> gives<00:05:50.159> you<00:05:50.280> rubber<00:05:50.550> gun<00:05:50.820> for<00:05:51.419> a

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
rubber and it gives you rubber gun for a

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.649 
rubber and it gives you rubber gun for a
while<00:05:51.630> so<00:05:52.349> you<00:05:52.590> know<00:05:52.800> when<00:05:52.919> you<00:05:53.009> rub<00:05:53.280> it<00:05:53.659> all

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:54.659 
while so you know when you rub it all

00:05:54.659 --> 00:06:01.640 
while so you know when you rub it all
right<00:05:55.610> all<00:05:56.610> I<00:05:56.669> really<00:05:57.060> have<00:05:57.389> to<00:05:57.419> say<00:06:00.650> okay
