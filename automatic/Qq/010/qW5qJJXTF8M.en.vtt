00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
straightening up on the way back so

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.299 
straightening up on the way back so
stand<00:00:42.660> up<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.140> then<00:00:43.230> are<00:00:43.350> lifting<00:00:43.890> up<00:00:44.040> from

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
stand up and then are lifting up from

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.650 
stand up and then are lifting up from
your<00:00:44.430> spine<00:00:44.760> still<00:00:45.059> coming<00:00:45.360> from<00:00:45.480> your<00:00:45.600> core

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660

so<00:00:46.289> even<00:00:46.500> though<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:46.829> might<00:00:47.489> see<00:00:47.820> if<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.690> put

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
so even though we might see if I put

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.040 
so even though we might see if I put
some<00:00:49.079> markers<00:00:49.469> say<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:49.980> your<00:00:50.010> head<00:00:50.610> here

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
some markers say on your head here

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.330 
some markers say on your head here
people<00:00:52.050> would<00:00:52.170> kind<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.530> say<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.949> head<00:00:53.190> up

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
people would kind of say this is head up

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.650 
people would kind of say this is head up
this<00:00:53.460> isn't<00:00:53.640> head<00:00:53.910> up<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.510> your

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
this isn't head up this is that your

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.810 
this isn't head up this is that your
spine<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.469> coming<00:00:55.829> up<00:00:55.949> which<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.309> turn<00:00:56.520> lift

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
spine is coming up which in turn lift

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.869 
spine is coming up which in turn lift
your<00:00:57.030> head<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:59.100> then<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> downswing<00:00:59.699> is

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
your head up and then the downswing is

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.119 
your head up and then the downswing is
coming<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.270> hit<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> ball<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:00.809> see<00:01:00.989> very<00:01:01.440> very

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
coming to hit the ball we see very very

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.410 
coming to hit the ball we see very very
straight<00:01:02.670> impact<00:01:03.539> position<00:01:04.640> with<00:01:05.640> your<00:01:05.970> body

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
straight impact position with your body

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.200 
straight impact position with your body
so<00:01:06.840> look<00:01:07.560> let's<00:01:08.369> get<00:01:08.549> out<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.790> range<00:01:08.970> give

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
so look let's get out on the range give

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.640 
so look let's get out on the range give
you<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.330> few<00:01:09.479> drills<00:01:09.689> give<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.049> an<00:01:10.110> idea<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.500> how

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
you a few drills give you an idea of how

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.250 
you a few drills give you an idea of how
to<00:01:10.680> improve<00:01:11.189> your<00:01:11.270> spine<00:01:12.270> angle<00:01:12.630> throughout

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
to improve your spine angle throughout

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.390 
to improve your spine angle throughout
your<00:01:13.380> backswing<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.799> your<00:01:14.010> impact<00:01:14.280> position

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
your backswing and your impact position

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.100 
your backswing and your impact position
trying<00:01:15.150> get<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.360> making<00:01:15.630> some<00:01:15.750> better<00:01:15.900> golf

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
trying get you making some better golf

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.080 
trying get you making some better golf
shots<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.680> as<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.159> see<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.640> classic

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
shots so as we can see it's a classic

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.179 
shots so as we can see it's a classic
spine<00:01:18.420> angle<00:01:18.689> issue<00:01:19.049> what<00:01:19.530> we're<00:01:19.710> seeing<00:01:19.950> as

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
spine angle issue what we're seeing as

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.950 
spine angle issue what we're seeing as
he<00:01:20.310> swings<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.939> we're<00:01:21.119> seeing<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.450> spine<00:01:21.750> angle

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
he swings is we're seeing a spine angle

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.140 
he swings is we're seeing a spine angle
changing<00:01:22.890> throughout<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.520> swing<00:01:23.729> which<00:01:24.000> is

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
changing throughout the swing which is

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.719 
changing throughout the swing which is
giving<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.689> complete<00:01:25.500> contradiction<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.400> plain

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
giving a complete contradiction in plain

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.580 
giving a complete contradiction in plain
each<00:01:27.030> time<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.450> changes<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.140> spine<00:01:28.380> angle

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
each time it changes the spine angle

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.109 
each time it changes the spine angle
it's<00:01:28.860> moving<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> plane<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.640> club<00:01:29.880> around

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
it's moving the plane of the club around

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.640 
it's moving the plane of the club around
so<00:01:30.360> drills<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.900> work<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.380> really

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
so drills for you to work on you really

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.200 
so drills for you to work on you really
got<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.860> work<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.250> trying<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.579> maintain<00:01:32.700> your

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
got to work on trying to maintain your

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.090 
got to work on trying to maintain your
spine<00:01:33.540> angle<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.680> we're<00:01:34.799> talking<00:01:34.920> about

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
spine angle so we're talking about

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.950 
spine angle so we're talking about
trying<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.610> keep<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.119> spine<00:01:36.390> angle<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.840> you

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
trying to keep the spine angle that you

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080 
trying to keep the spine angle that you
begin<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.979> angle<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.610> begin<00:01:38.909> in

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
begin in so the angle that you begin in

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.910 
begin in so the angle that you begin in
here<00:01:39.420> you've<00:01:39.930> got<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.229> be<00:01:40.259> trying<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.619> turn

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
here you've got to be trying to turn

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.800 
here you've got to be trying to turn
around<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.820> position<00:01:42.299> great<00:01:42.570> way<00:01:42.780> of

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
around this position great way of

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.679 
around this position great way of
practicing<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.939> get<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.119> shaft<00:01:45.390> cross

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
practicing this is to get a shaft cross

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.719 
practicing this is to get a shaft cross
your<00:01:45.869> shoulders<00:01:46.290> here<00:01:46.530> try<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.399> get<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> butt

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
your shoulders here try and get the butt
