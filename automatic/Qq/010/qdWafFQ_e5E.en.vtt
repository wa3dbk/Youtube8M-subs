cs2 or CS so what we're gonna do is

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.269 
cs2 or CS so what we're gonna do is
we're<00:00:20.490> gonna<00:00:20.580> make<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.789> new<00:00:21.000> file<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:22.279> then

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
we're gonna make a new file and then

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.009 
we're gonna make a new file and then
make<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.850> solid<00:00:24.359> square<00:00:25.670> 720<00:00:26.670> by<00:00:26.820> 720<00:00:27.449> we're

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
make it a solid square 720 by 720 we're

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.910 
make it a solid square 720 by 720 we're
gonna<00:00:28.140> grab<00:00:28.980> some<00:00:29.630> some<00:00:30.630> squares<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.529> to

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
gonna grab some some squares here to

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.590 
gonna grab some some squares here to
make<00:00:32.040> some<00:00:32.219> shapes<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> board<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.239> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
make some shapes on the board on the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.190 
make some shapes on the board on the
page<00:00:35.120> I'm<00:00:36.120> gonna<00:00:36.329> go<00:00:36.420> over<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.719> shape<00:00:36.989> one

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
page I'm gonna go over here to shape one

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.270 
page I'm gonna go over here to shape one
I'm<00:00:37.350> going<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.620> duplicate<00:00:38.070> these<00:00:38.280> layers<00:00:40.280> make

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
I'm going to duplicate these layers make

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.380 
I'm going to duplicate these layers make
two<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.610> them<00:00:41.969> by<00:00:42.420> right-clicking<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.170> them<00:00:44.390> so

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
two of them by right-clicking on them so

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.319 
two of them by right-clicking on them so
now<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:45.629> three<00:00:45.899> shapes<00:00:46.200> right<00:00:46.860> here<00:00:47.329> so

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
now we have three shapes right here so

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.150 
now we have three shapes right here so
I'm<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.600> move<00:00:48.780> them<00:00:48.989> over<00:00:49.320> then<00:00:49.920> giving

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
I'm going to move them over then giving

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.830 
I'm going to move them over then giving
them<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.340> different<00:00:50.430> color<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.719> can

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
them a different color just so you can

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.049 
them a different color just so you can
see<00:00:52.320> them<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.710> little<00:00:53.100> bit<00:00:53.340> better<00:00:53.520> distinguish

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
see them a little bit better distinguish

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.029 
see them a little bit better distinguish
them<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> little<00:00:54.510> bit<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.110> these<00:00:55.739> over<00:00:55.980> here

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
them a little bit and these over here

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.849 
them a little bit and these over here
are<00:00:56.309> actually<00:00:56.760> vector<00:00:57.090> images<00:00:57.510> right<00:00:57.719> now<00:00:57.930> so

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
are actually vector images right now so

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.200 
are actually vector images right now so
you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.280> go<00:00:59.370> over<00:00:59.520> here<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.879> when<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.059> want

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
you can go over here and when you want

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.700 
you can go over here and when you want
to<00:01:00.300> change<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.840> color<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.410> double

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
to change this color you just double

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.529 
to change this color you just double
click<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.550> color<00:01:02.699> we'll<00:01:03.030> make<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.480> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
click on the color we'll make this one a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.750 
click on the color we'll make this one a
reddish<00:01:03.930> color<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.439> we'll<00:01:05.010> make<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.339> one<00:01:05.549> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
reddish color and we'll make this one a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.190 
reddish color and we'll make this one a
greenish<00:01:06.420> color<00:01:08.479> and<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:09.960> three

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
greenish color and so we have three

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.740 
greenish color and so we have three
shapes<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.770> here<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.240> what<00:01:12.240> we're<00:01:12.360> gonna<00:01:12.450> do

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
shapes in here and what we're gonna do

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.219 
shapes in here and what we're gonna do
is<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.710> use<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.880> pen<00:01:15.390> tool<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.049> make<00:01:16.200> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
is to use the pen tool and to make a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.070 
is to use the pen tool and to make a
vector<00:01:16.560> image<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.950> these<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.670> will<00:01:17.880> need<00:01:18.540> to

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
vector image of these we will need to

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.570 
vector image of these we will need to
actually<00:01:19.590> merge<00:01:19.830> these<00:01:20.159> three<00:01:20.460> images

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
actually merge these three images

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.730 
actually merge these three images
together<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.630> what<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.810> do<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.259> grab

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
together and so what we do is you grab

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.410 
together and so what we do is you grab
the<00:01:22.920> top<00:01:23.100> one<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.460> hold<00:01:23.640> shift<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.270> can

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the top one and hold shift and you can

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.460 
the top one and hold shift and you can
select<00:01:24.600> all<00:01:24.900> three<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.170> them<00:01:25.290> at<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.409> same

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
select all three of them at the same

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.530 
select all three of them at the same
time<00:01:25.890> we're<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.670> merge<00:01:26.880> these<00:01:27.210> and

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
time we're going to just merge these and

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.760 
time we're going to just merge these and
the<00:01:27.600> way<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.780> do<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.409> go<00:01:28.500> up<00:01:28.619> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
the way you do that is you go up to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.190 
the way you do that is you go up to
layer<00:01:29.100> go<00:01:29.670> down<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.119> set<00:01:30.509> merge<00:01:30.780> layers

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
layer go down you can set merge layers

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.230 
layer go down you can set merge layers
and<00:01:31.829> what<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.130> does<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.490> rasterizes

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
and what that does is that rasterizes

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.560 
and what that does is that rasterizes
them<00:01:33.390> brings<00:01:33.630> them<00:01:33.780> all<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.020> one<00:01:34.200> one<00:01:34.890> place

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
them brings them all to one one place

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.490 
them brings them all to one one place
then<00:01:36.570> we're<00:01:36.689> going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> go<00:01:36.990> over<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> pen

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
then we're going to go over to the pen

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.679 
then we're going to go over to the pen
tool<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.040> we're<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.390> start

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
tool and we're going to just start

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.800 
tool and we're going to just start
making<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.110> little<00:01:40.290> shape<00:01:40.619> here<00:01:41.689> we're<00:01:42.689> going

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
making a little shape here we're going

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.210 
making a little shape here we're going
to<00:01:42.869> make<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> vector<00:01:43.409> image<00:01:43.710> out<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:43.950> these

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
to make a vector image out of these

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.679 
to make a vector image out of these
images<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.759> aren't<00:01:45.119> vector<00:01:45.509> anymore<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:48.090> so

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
images that aren't vector anymore and so

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.620 
images that aren't vector anymore and so
now<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:48.990> have<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.350> shape<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.329> that<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.479> on

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
now we have that shape and that is on

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.109 
now we have that shape and that is on
top<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.649> layer<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.159> we<00:01:53.280> want<00:01:53.579> we're

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
top of the the layer that we want we're

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.670 
top of the the layer that we want we're
going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> go<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.630> vector<00:01:54.960> mask<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.439> do

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
going to go in a vector mask and do

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.730 
going to go in a vector mask and do
current<00:01:56.100> path<00:01:56.509> and<00:01:57.509> there<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.899> go<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.619> now

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
current path and there you go and now

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.459 
current path and there you go and now
you<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.979> vector<00:01:59.340> image<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.810> beauty

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
you have a vector image the beauty

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.580 
you have a vector image the beauty
behind<00:02:01.619> vector<00:02:02.189> images<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.420> they<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.469> be

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
behind vector images is that they can be

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.850 
behind vector images is that they can be
shifted<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.159> moved<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.619> distorted<00:02:07.619> any

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
shifted and moved and and distorted any

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.559 
shifted and moved and and distorted any
way<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.310> would<00:02:08.520> like<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.940> they<00:02:09.030> don't<00:02:09.270> lose

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
way you would like and they don't lose

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.390 
way you would like and they don't lose
any<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.800> their<00:02:11.220> clarity

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
any of their clarity

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.100 
any of their clarity

the Christmas so that's the beauty of

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.580 
the Christmas so that's the beauty of
