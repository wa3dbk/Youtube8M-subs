spear oh and yeah the reason I helped it

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.950 
spear oh and yeah the reason I helped it
is<00:01:53.310> because<00:01:53.579> once<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.119> attack<00:01:54.450> somebody<00:01:54.479> with

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
is because once you attack somebody with

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.800 
is because once you attack somebody with
it<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.470> degrades<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.460> can't<00:01:57.149> really<00:01:57.329> trade

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
it it degrades so you can't really trade

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.670 
it it degrades so you can't really trade
it<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.619> like<00:01:58.799> borrows<00:01:59.189> items<00:01:59.549> borrows<00:02:00.240> yeah
