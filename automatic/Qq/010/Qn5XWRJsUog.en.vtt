first<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.880> all<00:00:14.940> fantasy<00:00:15.299> very<00:00:15.480> creative

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
first of all fantasy very creative

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.750 
first of all fantasy very creative
against<00:00:16.049> zerg<00:00:16.199> actually<00:00:17.010> looks<00:00:17.160> up<00:00:17.369> at<00:00:17.550> his

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
against zerg actually looks up at his

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.220 
against zerg actually looks up at his
statistics<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.480> between<00:00:18.779> games<00:00:18.960> and

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
statistics in between games and

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.019 
statistics in between games and
surprisingly<00:00:19.740> zerg<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.250> actually<00:00:20.609> his<00:00:20.730> lowest

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
surprisingly zerg is actually his lowest

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.540 
surprisingly zerg is actually his lowest
rated<00:00:21.270> matchup<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.900> i'm<00:00:22.289> not<00:00:22.439> sure<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
rated matchup and i'm not sure what the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.509 
rated matchup and i'm not sure what the
cause<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.269> but<00:00:25.019> on<00:00:25.680> paper<00:00:26.070> i<00:00:26.250> think

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
cause of that is but on paper i think

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.769 
cause of that is but on paper i think
he's<00:00:26.640> much<00:00:26.789> better<00:00:27.000> against<00:00:27.359> zerg<00:00:27.510> than<00:00:27.720> he

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
he's much better against zerg than he

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.089 
he's much better against zerg than he
has<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.900> other<00:00:28.170> two<00:00:28.320> matches<00:00:28.650> even<00:00:28.830> though

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
has the other two matches even though

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.640 
has the other two matches even though
Protoss<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.330> apparently<00:00:30.900> fantasies<00:00:31.439> best

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
Protoss is apparently fantasies best

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.979 
Protoss is apparently fantasies best
matchup<00:00:32.070> statistically<00:00:32.780> anyway<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.870> is

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
matchup statistically anyway this is

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.240 
matchup statistically anyway this is
going<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.200> be<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> Oh<00:00:34.469> harmony<00:00:34.800> which<00:00:35.100> is

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
going to be on the Oh harmony which is

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.389 
going to be on the Oh harmony which is
also<00:00:35.460> about<00:00:36.180> even<00:00:36.750> maps<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.410> according<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
also about even maps to according to the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.850 
also about even maps to according to the
map<00:00:38.550> statistics<00:00:39.500> initially<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.530> thought<00:00:40.680> this

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
map statistics initially I thought this

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.049 
map statistics initially I thought this
would<00:00:40.980> be<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.100> really<00:00:41.160> strong<00:00:41.550> Zerg<00:00:41.820> map

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
would be a really strong Zerg map

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.420 
would be a really strong Zerg map
because<00:00:42.750> even<00:00:43.230> though<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.829> two<00:00:44.070> angles

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
because even though you have two angles

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.889 
because even though you have two angles
on<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:45.030> hatchery<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.539> could<00:00:45.690> still

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
on that that hatchery you could still

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.740 
on that that hatchery you could still
cover<00:00:46.110> those<00:00:46.350> two<00:00:46.559> angles<00:00:46.920> from<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.690> a

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
cover those two angles from with just a

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.720 
cover those two angles from with just a
couple<00:00:48.870> salt<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.289> colonies<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.770> then<00:00:50.370> past

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
couple salt and colonies and then past

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.250 
couple salt and colonies and then past
that<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.270> really<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.690> difficult<00:00:52.140> to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
that you really it's difficult to

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.750 
that you really it's difficult to
contain<00:00:52.590> zur<00:00:52.860> because<00:00:53.070> they<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.309> squirt<00:00:53.610> out

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
contain zur because they can squirt out

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.389 
contain zur because they can squirt out
from<00:00:54.000> either<00:00:54.030> direction<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.980> then<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.280> just

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
from either direction and then it's just

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.770 
from either direction and then it's just
a<00:00:56.520> matter<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.730> taking<00:00:56.879> your<00:00:57.090> third<00:00:57.300> base<00:00:57.510> which

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
a matter of taking your third base which

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.630 
a matter of taking your third base which
I<00:00:57.989> thought<00:00:58.199> we<00:00:58.379> would<00:00:58.500> see<00:00:58.710> more<00:00:58.980> hide<00:00:59.340> list

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
I thought we would see more hide list

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.510 
I thought we would see more hide list
clerk<00:00:59.910> or<00:01:00.090> play<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.649> thought<00:01:02.010> from<00:01:02.340> there

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
clerk or play and I thought from there

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.609 
clerk or play and I thought from there
basically<00:01:02.969> yeah<00:01:03.570> would<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:03.870> pretty<00:01:04.110> easy<00:01:04.170> are

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
basically yeah would be pretty easy are

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.070 
basically yeah would be pretty easy are
capable<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.540> shows<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.689> why<00:01:06.810> I'm<00:01:06.930> not<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
capable but shows you why I'm not a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.530 
capable but shows you why I'm not a
circa<00:01:07.409> expert<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.520> been<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:09.150> about<00:01:09.299> even

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
circa expert it's been just about even

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.660 
circa expert it's been just about even
and<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.350> guess<00:01:10.560> taking<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.040> third<00:01:11.250> base<00:01:11.460> is

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
and I guess taking a third base is

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.520 
and I guess taking a third base is
proven<00:01:12.030> more<00:01:12.180> difficult<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.869> Zurich<00:01:13.320> players

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
proven more difficult for Zurich players

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.310 
proven more difficult for Zurich players
across<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.040> board<00:01:14.280> then<00:01:15.180> prior<00:01:15.780> then

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
across the board then prior then

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.050 
across the board then prior then
probably<00:01:16.799> thought<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.979> lot<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.340> what<00:01:17.759> well<00:01:18.030> I

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
probably thought a lot of what well I

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.100 
probably thought a lot of what well I
think<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.299> lot<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.450> Terran<00:01:18.720> players<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.020> been

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
think a lot of Terran players have been

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.359 
think a lot of Terran players have been
doing<00:01:19.320> has<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.530> been<00:01:19.650> going<00:01:19.680> drop<00:01:20.009> shipped<00:01:20.280> and

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
doing has it been going drop shipped and

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.820 
doing has it been going drop shipped and
things<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:21.140> kind<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.200> bypass

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
things like that just kind of bypass

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.039 
things like that just kind of bypass
that<00:01:22.970> we<00:01:23.970> seen<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> little<00:01:24.420> bit<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.540> mech<00:01:24.750> even

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
that we seen a little bit of mech even

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.390 
that we seen a little bit of mech even
though<00:01:25.140> i<00:01:25.170> don't<00:01:25.380> think<00:01:25.560> mex<00:01:25.740> very<00:01:26.070> good<00:01:26.280> on

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
though i don't think mex very good on

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.219 
though i don't think mex very good on

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
come out in time and it looks like we're

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.840 
come out in time and it looks like we're
seeing<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.350> 12<00:02:04.560> hatch<00:02:04.710> build<00:02:04.950> here<00:02:05.130> from<00:02:05.369> luxury

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
seeing a 12 hatch build here from luxury

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.789 
seeing a 12 hatch build here from luxury
but<00:02:06.090> we'll<00:02:06.600> see<00:02:06.719> what<00:02:06.780> luxury<00:02:06.960> does<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.560> I

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
but we'll see what luxury does and I I

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.249 
but we'll see what luxury does and I I
can't<00:02:08.160> say<00:02:08.340> i<00:02:08.369> can<00:02:08.580> predict<00:02:09.000> his<00:02:09.119> play<00:02:09.420> at<00:02:10.020> this

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
can't say i can predict his play at this

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.140 
can't say i can predict his play at this
stage<00:02:10.500> because<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.310> map<00:02:11.520> I've<00:02:11.730> seen<00:02:11.940> just

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
stage because on this map I've seen just

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.370 
stage because on this map I've seen just
about<00:02:12.300> everything

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
about everything

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.600 
about everything
and<00:02:13.440> I<00:02:13.500> think<00:02:13.770> that's<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.100> hallmark<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.520> a

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
and I think that's the hallmark of a

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.110 
and I think that's the hallmark of a
good<00:02:14.730> map<00:02:15.590> that's<00:02:16.590> just<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.490> guess<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.880> can<00:02:18.030> be

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
good map that's just I guess I can be

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.970 
good map that's just I guess I can be
opinionated<00:02:18.300> about<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:19.080> but<00:02:19.320> that's<00:02:19.770> why<00:02:19.950> i

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
opinionated about that but that's why i

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.140 
opinionated about that but that's why i
like<00:02:20.130> seeing<00:02:20.280> it's<00:02:20.520> not<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.640> very<00:02:20.820> good<00:02:20.880> map

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
like seeing it's not a very good map

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.590 
like seeing it's not a very good map
terran<00:02:21.930> vs<00:02:22.320> protoss<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:23.460> i<00:02:23.730> think<00:02:24.270> it's<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.420> fun

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600

bunker<00:03:37.170> up<00:03:37.290> momentarily<00:03:37.820> but<00:03:38.820> yeah<00:03:39.450> the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
bunker up momentarily but yeah the

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.000 
bunker up momentarily but yeah the
zerglings<00:03:39.930> starting<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.350> pour<00:03:40.500> out<00:03:40.560> let's<00:03:40.920> see

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
zerglings starting to pour out let's see

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.530 
zerglings starting to pour out let's see
if<00:03:41.070> they<00:03:41.190> go<00:03:41.310> after<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.700> SCV<00:03:42.060> initially

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
if they go after that SCV initially

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.820 
if they go after that SCV initially
looks<00:03:42.750> like<00:03:42.870> they<00:03:42.959> could<00:03:43.200> test<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.590> front

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
looks like they could test that front

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.640 
looks like they could test that front
door<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.190> Overlord<00:03:44.490> sees<00:03:44.900> it<00:03:45.900> had<00:03:46.200> vision

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
door that Overlord sees it had vision

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
there but the timing is going to be off

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.030 
there but the timing is going to be off
that<00:03:48.300> bunker<00:03:48.600> should<00:03:48.840> be<00:03:48.959> finished<00:03:49.410> by<00:03:49.680> the

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
that bunker should be finished by the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
take a third base somewhere most likely

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.159 
take a third base somewhere most likely
in<00:04:43.350> that<00:04:43.470> bottom<00:04:43.770> right-hand<00:04:43.919> corner<00:04:45.050> which<00:04:46.050> I

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
in that bottom right-hand corner which I

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.960 
in that bottom right-hand corner which I
will<00:04:46.320> not<00:04:46.470> say<00:04:46.800> again<00:04:47.310> I've<00:04:47.430> seen<00:04:47.610> these<00:04:47.699> games

will not say again I've seen these games

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.340 
will not say again I've seen these games
so<00:04:48.120> I<00:04:48.150> won't<00:04:48.389> say<00:04:48.570> whether<00:04:48.720> that<00:04:48.960> is<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.229> case

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
so I won't say whether that is the case

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.379 
so I won't say whether that is the case

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
or not all that it is that that's

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.749 
or not all that it is that that's
essentially<00:04:51.810> a<00:04:51.840> spoiler<00:04:52.169> or<00:04:53.100> he<00:04:53.550> can<00:04:53.639> go

force between I'm sorry fantasies forces
and<00:05:42.539> his<00:05:42.690> use<00:05:43.320> those<00:05:43.500> minerals<00:05:43.860> to<00:05:44.039> pick<00:05:44.190> off

and his use those minerals to pick off

and his use those minerals to pick off
troops<00:05:44.639> as<00:05:44.849> much<00:05:45.389> as<00:05:45.570> possible<00:05:45.750> in<00:05:46.139> between<00:05:46.409> if

troops as much as possible in between if

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.350 
troops as much as possible in between if
they<00:05:46.800> try<00:05:46.979> to<00:05:47.039> approach<00:05:47.699> that<00:05:47.940> base<00:05:48.150> that

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
they try to approach that base that

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.480 
they try to approach that base that
zergling<00:05:48.780> taking<00:05:49.409> it<00:05:49.560> looks<00:05:49.889> like<00:05:50.010> a<00:05:50.099> hit<00:05:50.310> and

zergling taking it looks like a hit and
just<00:05:50.760> going<00:05:50.849> to<00:05:50.940> start<00:05:51.120> wandering<00:05:51.300> off<00:05:51.570> from

just going to start wandering off from
that<00:05:51.840> stage<00:05:52.139> looks<00:05:53.070> like<00:05:53.220> that<00:05:53.370> son<00:05:53.550> Connie

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
home base let's see if he'll have if

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:10.969 
home base let's see if he'll have if
i'll<00:06:09.750> have<00:06:09.780> the<00:06:10.020> defenses<00:06:10.380> up<00:06:10.530> i<00:06:10.650> assume<00:06:10.860> he

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
i'll have the defenses up i assume he

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:13.879 
i'll have the defenses up i assume he
will<00:06:11.159> simply<00:06:11.639> because<00:06:11.970> he<00:06:12.780> saw<00:06:13.289> this<00:06:13.470> coming

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
will simply because he saw this coming

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:15.890 
will simply because he saw this coming
that<00:06:14.310> he<00:06:14.520> had<00:06:14.669> this<00:06:14.820> completely<00:06:15.210> scouted<00:06:15.750> so

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
that he had this completely scouted so

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.110 
that he had this completely scouted so
he<00:06:15.990> should<00:06:16.260> be<00:06:16.440> pretty<00:06:17.159> solid<00:06:17.520> in<00:06:17.639> his<00:06:17.789> defense

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
he should be pretty solid in his defense

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.969 
he should be pretty solid in his defense

might<00:06:24.360> be<00:06:24.510> able<00:06:24.599> to<00:06:24.750> concept<00:06:25.229> that<00:06:25.349> expansion

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
might be able to concept that expansion

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
get killed before it mentions to get

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.469 
get killed before it mentions to get
there<00:06:29.250> but<00:06:29.370> i<00:06:29.580> think<00:06:29.789> fantasy<00:06:30.150> is<00:06:30.240> a<00:06:30.270> pretty

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
there but i think fantasy is a pretty

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:32.240 
there but i think fantasy is a pretty
good<00:06:30.630> idea<00:06:30.720> of<00:06:30.900> where<00:06:31.110> that's<00:06:31.289> at<00:06:31.409> a<00:06:31.830> couple

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
good idea of where that's at a couple

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.710 
good idea of where that's at a couple
turrets<00:06:32.490> going<00:06:32.669> up<00:06:32.789> critically<00:06:33.330> one<00:06:33.539> at<00:06:33.630> the

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
turrets going up critically one at the

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.969 
turrets going up critically one at the
ramp<00:06:33.960> and<00:06:34.110> a<00:06:34.199> high<00:06:34.380> drill<00:06:34.560> stand<00:06:34.800> being

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
ramp and a high drill stand being

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.129 
ramp and a high drill stand being
produced<00:06:35.669> right<00:06:35.969> after<00:06:36.300> that<00:06:36.450> to<00:06:36.990> produce

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 
produced right after that to produce

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:38.690 
produced right after that to produce
perhaps<00:06:37.770> some<00:06:37.979> lurkers<00:06:38.250> in<00:06:38.370> that<00:06:38.460> bottom

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700 
perhaps some lurkers in that bottom

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.080 
perhaps some lurkers in that bottom
right-hand<00:06:38.849> corner<00:06:39.000> to<00:06:39.360> kind<00:06:39.900> of

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
right-hand corner to kind of

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.360 
right-hand corner to kind of
add<00:06:40.210> that<00:06:40.360> defense<00:06:40.720> so<00:06:41.199> the<00:06:41.230> medalists<00:06:42.100> just

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
add that defense so the medalists just

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.860 
add that defense so the medalists just
kind<00:06:42.520> of<00:06:42.550> wither<00:06:42.730> those<00:06:42.940> forces<00:06:43.270> down<00:06:43.570> and

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
kind of wither those forces down and

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.760 
kind of wither those forces down and
then<00:06:44.500> the<00:06:46.230> what's<00:06:47.230> the<00:06:47.290> word<00:06:47.440> I'm<00:06:47.530> looking<00:06:47.560> for

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
then the what's the word I'm looking for

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.100 
then the what's the word I'm looking for
lurkers<00:06:48.360> afterwards<00:06:49.360> to<00:06:49.600> provide<00:06:49.900> some

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110 
lurkers afterwards to provide some

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.780 
lurkers afterwards to provide some
padded<00:06:50.410> defense<00:06:50.680> and<00:06:50.860> maybe<00:06:51.010> do<00:06:51.190> some<00:06:51.220> and

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:51.790 
padded defense and maybe do some and

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.430 
padded defense and maybe do some and
that's<00:06:52.120> the<00:06:52.210> nice<00:06:52.419> thing<00:06:52.449> with<00:06:52.630> lurker

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
that's the nice thing with lurker

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.659 
that's the nice thing with lurker
approaches<00:06:53.889> you<00:06:54.010> can<00:06:54.100> come<00:06:54.250> from<00:06:54.280> multiple

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:54.669 
approaches you can come from multiple

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:56.610 
approaches you can come from multiple
angles<00:06:54.820> as<00:06:55.120> well<00:06:55.300> that<00:06:55.840> bunker<00:06:56.169> doesn't<00:06:56.440> cover

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 
angles as well that bunker doesn't cover

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.080 
angles as well that bunker doesn't cover
as<00:06:56.770> much<00:06:56.919> as<00:06:57.100> you'd<00:06:57.220> really<00:06:57.520> want<00:06:57.550> it<00:06:57.790> to<00:06:57.910> its

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
as much as you'd really want it to its

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.830 
as much as you'd really want it to its
it<00:06:58.330> is<00:06:58.510> hugging<00:06:58.960> that<00:06:59.919> command<00:07:00.280> center<00:07:00.840> so

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 
it is hugging that command center so

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.290 
it is hugging that command center so
we'll<00:07:02.110> provide<00:07:02.380> some<00:07:02.590> defense<00:07:02.889> but<00:07:03.100> luxury<00:07:03.729> he

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
we'll provide some defense but luxury he

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.969 
we'll provide some defense but luxury he
doesn't<00:07:04.570> have<00:07:04.630> enough<00:07:04.900> mules<00:07:05.139> to<00:07:05.530> really<00:07:05.740> do

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:05.979 
doesn't have enough mules to really do

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:07.500 
doesn't have enough mules to really do
this<00:07:06.130> against<00:07:06.460> this<00:07:06.550> larger<00:07:06.910> force<00:07:07.180> here<00:07:07.360> so

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:07.510 
this against this larger force here so

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.140 
this against this larger force here so
he<00:07:07.630> should<00:07:07.870> back<00:07:08.080> off<00:07:08.220> I<00:07:09.220> think<00:07:09.580> this<00:07:09.699> is<00:07:09.820> more

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.150 
he should back off I think this is more

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.030 
he should back off I think this is more
to<00:07:10.300> keep<00:07:10.419> those<00:07:10.540> mute<00:07:10.810> Allah<00:07:10.960> that<00:07:11.110> he<00:07:11.350> just

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.040 
to keep those mute Allah that he just

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.280 
to keep those mute Allah that he just
wants<00:07:12.280> to<00:07:12.340> keep<00:07:12.460> them<00:07:12.639> at<00:07:12.760> home<00:07:13.139> fantasy<00:07:14.139> knows

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:14.290 
wants to keep them at home fantasy knows

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.260 
wants to keep them at home fantasy knows
that<00:07:14.470> he's<00:07:14.590> only<00:07:14.710> going<00:07:14.919> up<00:07:15.070> against<00:07:15.460> what<00:07:16.180> is

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270 
that he's only going up against what is

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.600 
that he's only going up against what is
that<00:07:16.360> six<00:07:16.630> I<00:07:16.840> think<00:07:16.870> six<00:07:17.320> at<00:07:18.070> this<00:07:18.250> stage<00:07:18.430> but

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610 
that six I think six at this stage but

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.010 
that six I think six at this stage but
yeah<00:07:18.790> that<00:07:19.000> bunker<00:07:19.300> in<00:07:19.389> that<00:07:19.510> position<00:07:19.660> should

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:20.020 
yeah that bunker in that position should

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.230 
yeah that bunker in that position should
defend<00:07:20.290> but<00:07:20.530> still<00:07:21.220> lurkers<00:07:21.580> can't<00:07:21.850> plant<00:07:22.120> at

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 
defend but still lurkers can't plant at

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.460 
defend but still lurkers can't plant at
the<00:07:22.330> bottom<00:07:22.630> they<00:07:22.900> can<00:07:23.020> take<00:07:23.169> out<00:07:23.320> those

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:23.470 
the bottom they can take out those

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.140 
the bottom they can take out those
turrets<00:07:23.800> at<00:07:23.950> that<00:07:24.100> location<00:07:24.430> looks<00:07:25.000> like

dedicating a little bit longer than I

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:36.570 
dedicating a little bit longer than I
thought<00:07:35.500> it<00:07:35.650> would<00:07:35.770> bring<00:07:35.950> up<00:07:36.130> the<00:07:36.220> servings

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:36.580

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 
like he was going to go all in but

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:42.240 
like he was going to go all in but
backing<00:07:39.729> off<00:07:39.880> now<00:07:40.620> that'll<00:07:41.620> keep<00:07:41.740> fantasy<00:07:42.130> in

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.250 
backing off now that'll keep fantasy in

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.520 
backing off now that'll keep fantasy in
his<00:07:42.370> base<00:07:42.550> a<00:07:43.210> lot<00:07:43.630> longer<00:07:43.870> as<00:07:44.139> well<00:07:44.320> and<00:07:44.470> it

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:44.530 
his base a lot longer as well and it

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.390 
his base a lot longer as well and it
looks<00:07:44.710> like<00:07:44.770> drones<00:07:45.039> going<00:07:45.250> to<00:07:45.310> be

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:45.400 
looks like drones going to be
