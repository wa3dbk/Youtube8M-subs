00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.670

 You will notice the school first and then 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.860

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.380

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.159

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:58.750
 the same in green with orange so that 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.509
 By the way, that's my favorite 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.090
 color combination so that has me now 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.789
 new balance sent because they say yes 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.539
 okay that is also great that couples 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.160
 that directly and yes so thank you me 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.770
 feel very honored that I am now 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.410
 practically while a great athlete 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.090
 sponsored so I find absolutely 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.230
 class 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.120
 Now I am provided with the schools 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.790
 Of course, now I will become some 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.210
 Doing photography trips and traveling where I am 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.700
 my 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.110
 to produce the trainings and I will 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.960
 running around with these debts soon 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.110
 By the way, it is very convenient 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.880
 so it's actually I recommend that 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.460
 I'm convinced I already have 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.410
 some cameras in full so 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.710
 that's what it is too and I would now 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:48.220
 do not recommend any where 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.810
 I practically get physically injured 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.740
 when wearing yes but this is here 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.750
 really cool 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.820
 yes this one again thanks 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.250
 and as I said photographer must be like that 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.690
 be designed that he is on the way 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.810
 well he feels that 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.500
 has endurance and can run a lot and 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.860
 Of course, shoes are very important 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.080
 At this point, wish you all the best 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.630
 carries important shoes that suit you 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.690
 and then we'll see each other again 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.080
 other video trainings or youtube 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.080
