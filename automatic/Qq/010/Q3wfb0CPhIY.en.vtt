00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.700
 I have a rectangle whose face I want to measure. 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.100
 I want to know what place on my screen it occupies. 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.200
 I advise you to stop this video for a while and try to identify yourself personally. 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.000
 Anyway, think about the two ways that this task can be solved. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.200
 The first way is to multiply the length of the entire rectangle by its width. 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.500
 This will give you the face of the big rectangle. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.000
 The other way is to find the face of the purple rectangle first 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.900
 and then find the face of the blue rectangle, 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.100
 and finally to think that by gathering the face of one with the face of the other rectangle, 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.100
 you will actually get the face of the big rectangle. 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.400
 Stop the video for a bit and try to solve in both ways. 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.600
 Let's do it together. 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.400
 Let's first see what the size of the large rectangle is. 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.700
 Its width is 9. We have to multiply it along the length. 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.800
 Let's see how long it is. 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.500
 The length will be found by adding 8 plus 12. 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.300
 So all this will be 8 plus 12. 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.900
 That is, 9 multiplied by 8 plus 12. 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.200
 This is one way we can find the face of the big rectangle. 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.600
 By multiplying the width along the length. 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.800
 9 at 20. 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.800
 The other way to solve the problem, 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.700
 as we should get exactly the same result, 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.000
 is to divide this rectangle into two smaller ones. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Let `s try. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.300
 And let's see if we get the same result. 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.400
 How much is the face of the purple rectangle? 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.200
 We will find it by multiplying it 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:43.430
 the length that is 9, the width that is 8. 9 at 8. 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.800
 Now let's see the face of the blue rectangle. 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.600
 Again, multiply the width by the width: 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.800
 The width is 9 again. 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.000
 How long is our length here? 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.700
 We have a length of 12. 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.400
 And how do we find the common face? 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.700
 We want to gather these two faces - the purple and the blue rectangles, 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.800
 we just have to collect them. 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.699
 We collect these two things here. 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.200
 And of course, by gathering them, 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.900
 we get the face of this entire rectangle. 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.100
 These two things should be equal. 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.300
 Because they calculate the same person. 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.700
 The good thing about what we did was, 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.400
 that we showed the distribution property 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.400
 with respect to these numbers. 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.800
 But we can try it with any other numbers. 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.500
 And again we will get a true result because the distribution property applies to all numbers. 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.500
 Look: we multiplied 9 by the sum of the numbers 8 and 12, 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.500
 which is as if we have multiplied by 9 by 8 and gathered 9 by 12. 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.500
 In this case, we distribute 9. 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.400
 9 at 8 plus 9 at 12. 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.400
 Time to calculate. 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.200
 To get the final solution to the task. 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.500
 We multiply the width along the width. 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.600
 9 at 8 plus 12. 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.200
 It's like we've multiplied by 9 by 20, which makes 180. 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.300
 To calculate the face of the purple rectangle, 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.100
 which will be equal to 9 by 8, 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.400
 we will get 72. 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.900
 This is for the purple rectangle. 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.900
 The face of the blue rectangle: 9 by 12. 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.100
 That's 108. 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.000
 We will take the sum of the two 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.100
 and he will give us the common face of the big rectangle. 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.100
 How much is 72 plus 108? 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.100
 72 + 108 also makes 180. 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.700
 We really confirmed that these two are equal. 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.300
 We calculated and made sure they were equal. 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.200
 And this is perfectly logical, as they express the same thing - the face of the big rectangle.
