00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:07.810
 good people today I bring you a tutorial of 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.740
 minecraft on a scary collector 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.530
 like the one we have here 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.930
 and good the functionality of this is 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.169
 hit this lever and it's already picking us up 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.700
 all the wheat we are going to give it so that what 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:24.940
 let's see 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.070
 when you give it there is water and then 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:32.820
 the water drags all the wheat and 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.820
 seeds up here and we collect them 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.850
 if we want to wait for it to fall 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.859
 everything and now if we pick it up 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.550
 if that we give to work the lever 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:49.670
 to pick it up well at all 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.829
 well look we give it and it does not bother us anymore 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.829
 the water and we collect everything well 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.580
 well, good 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.270
 now I will explain how it is built 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.510
 all 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.220
 it's worth these things 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.760
 from here to the side 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.500
 serves to moisten the earth of this 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.040
 from here to the side 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.970
 in the two blogs 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.970
 the bakery 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:30.380
 well here is water worth humid 4 to 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:36.170
 lateral though it would be 1 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:39.640
 2 3 and 4 up here moisten the other side 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.159
 of the same 1 2 3 and 4 what do you mean 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.310
 that this would be everything always wet and 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.920
 the earth would not dry up and you can 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.240
 plant well 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.830
 the wheat for this has these two 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.290
 water streams 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.220
 so we have this 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.160
 all humidity 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.170
 then we have here a lever is worth 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.970
 activates and deactivates the pistons 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.410
 from there above all 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.360
 that goes from here the subtraction circuit 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.950
 here we put an amplifier because if 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.950
 we are not short of signal 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.400
 a better repeats said down here 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.400
 and this is repeated 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.860
 you give these pistons that lift or 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:35.980
 lower these iron blocks 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.980
 and then jump and water or 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.720
 Nothing is this 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.220
 things another thing that you have to have in 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.890
 realize that this mechanism is made 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.370
 I say this structure is made 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.500
 7 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.010
 so long 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.490
 because if they did one more the water would 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.240
 would stay here and it would not fall down and 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:06.090
 it would not leave the resources well down 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.290
 although we put seven and here if 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.500
 we would like to put 77 and what 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.590
 we want 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.710
 I believe that this size is enough 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.770
 because for a person 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.290
 they have enough food and wheat 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.480
 to make bread and everything 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.390
 with this amount 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:35.540
 and when it was over we would have 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:38.840
 this field of wheat already restored 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.270
 and you will not have to put all of them here 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.540
 the seeds again again 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.569
 I'm going to do it 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:52.100
 as we see there is no need for high air 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:56.080
 a while ago again 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:59.400
 although it's pretty good 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.400
 Well, it's like that 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.970
 and up 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:18.130
 and then if you spare in bone 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:21.519
 Bonnie is me, you give her that 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:27.150
 and you will have grown culture 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.150
 that this grows trees and everything 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:35.330
 even flowering weeds and all the 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.330
 fights with him 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.290
 with na 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.290
 here we will have the new 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:53.189
 and has been able to give it again again 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:56.939
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:59.540
 this tutorial and that you can subscribe 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:02.710
 and see you in another video 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.710
 come from usa
