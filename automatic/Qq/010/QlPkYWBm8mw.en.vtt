00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 Hello everyone, Maxim and you 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.010
 Now let's talk about flash drives 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.580
 surely each of you is 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.160
 happy owner of some old 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.230
 ancient flash drives that don't start 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.770
 ok no matter how you tried her 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.100
 run there is the possibility of her 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.600
 restore of course the possibility of not 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.510
 one hundred percent because one hundred percent 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.519
 no one can promise anything now either 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.380
 What kind of software do I need 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.440
 applets 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.510
 but still there is the option of a flash drive 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.090
 what dead can i recover 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.879
 now I want to show you how I do it 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.090
 I have one killed flash drive 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.760
 I have her of course, just now literally 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.449
 before recording this video I managed 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.110
 did you run to view in 4 ports 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.180
 yusb fifth and somehow with grief in half 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.340
 recognized but again I'm not sure what 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.620
 next time after i insert 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.260
 This computer flash drive she will 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.689
 recognized so i will take it 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.760
 Still, it's as if dead and necessary 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.510
 will be like working on her 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.460
 restore 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.740
 what we do we are with you 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.590
 we will go to a special flash site 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.369
 dot ru I 'll give you a little syllable on this site 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.030
 we need to download the program check disk 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.850
 program it 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.890
 scans your flash drive even if 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.220
 computer and u see this one 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.330
 the program can recognize it and 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.930
 pull out of this flash drive 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.750
 fender go and product go it is very important 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.690
 so that later it could be 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.960
 Go download a special utility that 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.750
 Fully format the USB flash drive on this 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.880
 deep level that is 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.910
 I correct myself system errors and how would 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.860
 gives and the chance to work as if the second 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.520
 breathing and gives ie we download here 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.649
 I will give this program a reference to it 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.360
 me version 50 of you you may be 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:06.610
 already more on the new version look like this 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.399
 pressed a button to download it right here I 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.210
 Now on the desktop to not those then 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.440
 I do not search for it in a zip archive 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.070
 now we have it 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.490
 we launch directly we launch from from this from 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.490
 archive 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.450
 so well, here's the program started like me 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.120
 my computer told you on a flash drive 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.000
 hardly recognized of course 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.060
 so this program is also 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.450
 recognized my flash drive but there are such 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.570
 cases that you are right here will be the place 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.690
 the name of the flash drive will be written but 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.760
 He device that is an unknown device 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.950
 unknown device and as it were already by 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.140
 secondary to some of their signs can 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.050
 there may be one thing 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.930
 that is, we are interested in anyway 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.430
 This vendor go and product that is 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.490
 this is vid and pid 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.110
 here are these numbers serial numbers on 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.150
 which we will calculate 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.220
 model of our flash drive and then her 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.860
 repair means what we do 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.640
 farther farther we are at this here website 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.640
 flash put 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.900
 we go to the oh flash tab then 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.840
 I will also give you a link so that you will not be long 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.240
 searched nothing this didn't try there 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.550
 how to manually find it all will be under 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.910
 video means look here here is 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.510
 vid and pid we need to insert values 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.510
 these ones 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.540
 and pit too 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.900
 there is now click the search button 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.900
 Search 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.990
 and see what's here 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:04:00.990
 as you can see manufacturers of flash drives 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:05.520
 that is, the program as the site found all 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.060
 flash drives under these vid values here and 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.700
 pid 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.970
 and as we see here the manufacturer 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.240
 Kingston flash model called dt mini 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.430
 light with such and such a pit there 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.300
 so on all the information on it is 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.760
 but the problem is that there is no utility 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.430
 utility that repairs at the very 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.900
 so here it is a flash drive so honestly 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.680
 saying don't even know what can 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.930
 do and how is it now 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.930
 recover because i was hoping for 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.690
 the fact that there will be some kind of utility but 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.060
 your case is normal several times with 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.410
 these problems usually encountered 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.430
 there is a special utility here which 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.860
 intended to 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.290
 repair this flash drive you 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.220
 you just need to click on the link 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:58.470
 here where utils is written download this 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.540
 utility and there will be just a few 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.270
 buttons one of them press the button 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.670

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.640
 the utility will automatically format your 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.950
 flash drive will put it in order and in 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.020
 Basically about half the time your 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.720
 the flash drive will work fine that is 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.640
 I'm not sorry, nothing I'm sorry 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.790

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:27.180
 I donâ€™t know light flash drives for some reason 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.510
 why is it possible of course we will sing
