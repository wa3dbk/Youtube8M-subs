to<00:00:55.469> make<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.579> easy<00:00:58.820> now<00:01:00.649> you<00:01:01.649> need<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.859> turn

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
to make it easy now you need to turn

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.929 
to make it easy now you need to turn
terminal<00:01:02.550> for<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:04.159> only<00:01:05.159> i<00:01:05.400> need<00:01:05.640> four

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
terminal for this and only i need four

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.230 
terminal for this and only i need four
lines<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.240> code<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.780> it's<00:01:06.930> pretty<00:01:07.020> easy<00:01:08.240> first

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
lines of code so it's pretty easy first

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.050 
lines of code so it's pretty easy first
one<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:10.970> this<00:01:13.549> this<00:01:14.549> will<00:01:14.700> change<00:01:14.850> depending

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
one is this this will change depending

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.120 
one is this this will change depending
on<00:01:15.360> where<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.470> location<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.189> your<00:01:19.130> android

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
on where the location of your android

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.370 
on where the location of your android
sdk<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.580> platform<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.299> those<00:01:21.390> folders<00:01:21.720> if<00:01:22.140> you

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
sdk and platform to those folders if you

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.719 
sdk and platform to those folders if you
want<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> know<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.070> right<00:01:23.400> click<00:01:23.430> on

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
want to know you can just right click on

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.910 
want to know you can just right click on
a<00:01:23.790> file<00:01:24.060> get<00:01:24.869> info<00:01:26.240> here<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.770> that's<00:01:28.770> what

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
a file get info here it is that's what

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.410 
a file get info here it is that's what
you<00:01:28.979> typed<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.549> after<00:01:29.909> CD<00:01:30.380> click<00:01:31.380> enter

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
you typed in here after CD click enter

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.249 
you typed in here after CD click enter
so<00:01:33.420> now<00:01:33.860> basically<00:01:35.360> you're<00:01:36.360> executing<00:01:37.110> code

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
so now basically you're executing code

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.870 
so now basically you're executing code
or<00:01:37.619> commanding<00:01:38.220> code<00:01:38.400> for<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> platform

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
or commanding code for the platform

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.039 
or commanding code for the platform
tools<00:01:39.270> folder<00:01:41.210> that's<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> location

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
tools folder that's just the location

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.050 
tools folder that's just the location
you<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.770> way<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.189> use<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.520> db2

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
you in so that way you can use a db2

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.969 
you in so that way you can use a db2
siloed<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.920> zip<00:01:47.159> file<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.649> next<00:01:49.680> line<00:01:49.950> of

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
siloed this zip file so the next line of

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.630 
siloed this zip file so the next line of
code<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.340> dot<00:01:50.670> slash<00:01:50.909> adb<00:01:51.479> devices<00:01:52.490> what<00:01:53.490> that

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
code is dot slash adb devices what that

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.389 
code is dot slash adb devices what that
does<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.180> checks<00:01:54.570> see<00:01:55.439> drew<00:01:55.619> there's<00:01:56.310> a

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
does is it checks see drew there's a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.709 
does is it checks see drew there's a
device<00:01:56.880> plugged<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.420> make<00:01:57.630> sure

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
device plugged in to make sure

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.260 
device plugged in to make sure
everything's<00:01:58.170> working<00:01:58.729> she<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.030> that's

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
everything's working she it is that's

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.380 
everything's working she it is that's
your<00:02:00.450> advice<00:02:02.060> pretty<00:02:03.060> simple<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:04.430> now<00:02:05.430> you

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
your advice pretty simple and now you

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.399 
your advice pretty simple and now you
don't<00:02:06.479> have<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.719> do<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.020> can<00:02:07.229> actually

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
don't have to do this you can actually

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.809 
don't have to do this you can actually
just<00:02:08.270> do<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.420> manually<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.530> phone<00:02:11.520> well

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
just do it manually on the phone well

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.140 
just do it manually on the phone well
this<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:11.940> easier

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
this is easier

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.380 
this is easier
just<00:02:13.329> type<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:13.480> in<00:02:13.659> and<00:02:14.129> it<00:02:15.209> should<00:02:16.209> take

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390
