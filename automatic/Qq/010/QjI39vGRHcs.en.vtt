00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hey people and welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.310
 Thank you video turn on and my 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.220
 name is rising more and looking today 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.780
 Let's look at what happened in 2014 like this 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.429
 The whole thing is almost like that 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.980
 a kind of timelapse video of the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.080
 battlefield year 2014 just and that 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.240
 will hopefully be very interesting 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.340
 helped as much as possible with all the information 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.279
 By the way, I got back from 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.980
 battlefield - four points net also 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.289
 wrote an article about it 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.060
 who remembers the end of 2013 the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.309
 will probably be the main topic 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.710
 Remember january has netcode so remember 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.170
 just begun again that the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.489
 work on further projects 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.219
 has laid down and instead 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.960
 actually wanted to work on patches 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.030
 to improve the netcode but that went 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.309
 in the player appreciation month and the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.410
 associated battle pack rain 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.270
 besides, there were already the first ones 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.850
 Rumors to a new battlefield 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.039
 title that should be in the police setting 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.699
 and from the knowledge games are developed 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.890
 Should be in coats for February 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.899
 the user activates second it should 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.090
 for all platforms out and besides 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.040
 Further updates came about 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.780
 real money in battlefield we acquire 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.900
 shortcuts was also introduced 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.280
 after second came out there was also 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.380
 already directly new information to label strike 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.540
 just a month later namely 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.549
 already in march came already label 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.260
 strike the market and who would 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.930
 thought there may also be a new one 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.940
 patch in no case as april fools 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.590
 meant the message came that gamespy 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.509
 should be turned off 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.700
 that would mean that many old ones 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.340
 Battlefield titles and other games 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.799
 no longer officially supported 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.619
 The may then brought back but is good 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.390
 dsl launched the community test 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.460
 Dementia and it was already directly 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.720
 started on the netcode with an increased 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.720
 ticket to work 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.020
 another dlc called dragon steve 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.300
 by the way was already by dice 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.310
 announced though the ce so the 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.530
 community testing was really immense 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.450
 something good is so much we know now 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.000
 In any case, there were people in the beginning 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.450
 the ce as a pure marketing action 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.729
 his 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.709
 In january we had the first rumors 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.930
 about a new battlefield police game 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.090
 heard in may but it went on but 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.160
 he officially has not got anything yet 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.900
 said about it, however, there was 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.030
 battlelog information on one 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.680
 close beta to exactly this game 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.930
 let and then there was also 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.640
 a month old video of the game that 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.450
 for internal presentation purposes 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.570
 was used 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.519
 it became official with the e3 in june 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.799
 Battlefield are blind was announced 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.680
 and there was also right on the e3 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.090
 so to speak a new beta to that was 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.489
 really cool and it came for me too 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.470
 Almost unexpectedly there were as well 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.380
 a very first look at the new 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.000
 star wars battlefront 3 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.820
 It was actually announced but 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.920
 in july it was time and gamespy 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.140
 was turned off a bunch 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.450
 multiplayer games by ea and others 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.730
 Publishers were not at the moment 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.299
 more in the multiplayer game Battlefield 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.650
 1942 battlefield vietnam battlefield 2 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.940
 and battlefield 21 42 were part of the 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.010
 the community has gotten lucky by now 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.930
 her ways found around the games 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.350
 still further online play 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.720
 can 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.820
 on the other side there were new ones too 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.980
 steve steve a nice dc with 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.260
 City maps is published and as well 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.500
 there was a first rough appointment for 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.340
 star wars battlefront 3 the end of 2015 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.680
 should appear 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.500
 dslr also announced that one 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.270
 the hair 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.280
 which should adapt to battlefield and 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.800
 already announced a big patch 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.410
 on battlefield hotline was in august 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.720
 quite surprisingly postponed to 2015 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.090
 the reason was the community feedback 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.770
 and the use of developers as well 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.390
 was playable by leyen at gamescom 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.380
 and could with many improvements 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.750
 shine 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.180
 there were changes to the class 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.459
 balance faction specific weapons and 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.500
 bigger games wanted to show that they were 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.120
 can stand out from battlefield 4 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.250
 and have done that too 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.060
 Battlefield 4 continued 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.220
 worked this time on the rush mode of 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.040
 big september patch was there before 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.959
 big announced new patch so many 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.850
 Changes in only one patch had the 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.630
 battlefield 4 community really still 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.330
 never seen 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.190
 were tested in the community could 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.640
 Already in the same month an alpha 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.260
 version of final stand test 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.360
 after some rest too hard leyen there was in the 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.820
 october new information about 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.160
 In addition, there was a new beta for 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.260
 Fein stood in the community test in 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.100
 warm theis also announced again 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.470
 new one 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.290
 first was promised b4 even further 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.360
 to support and to the next year 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.400
 it was also remake after cards 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.380
 Wish you could ask for that 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.900
 of course new rumors to new ones 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.180
 do not go out of the way also in content 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.190
 the ce was hardworking and one night 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.169
 version of pearl market in the context of 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.120
 halloween was game and as well 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.250
 of course, you will find the community directly 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.110
 to speculate about it maybe 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.810
 another eight cards for 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.160
 Battlefield 4 would give 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.050
 In addition it became also known that the 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.320
 next battlefield at the earliest against 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.810
 end of 2016 and to good 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.760
 last there was a ct update to collision 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.710
 system so you do not have to corner every corner 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.810
 Keeps hanging 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.090
 november brought the new and 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.479
 supposedly last dlc for battlefield 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.130
 4 and indeed it was final 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.650
 again at the time of the new fendt im 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.370
 to puzzeln program because, there was 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.080
 a great reward, namely the bow 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.870
 dslr started at the same time also the 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.620
 work on the new prototypes in the cd 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.479
 version 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.930
 for example, it was about a new one 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.430
 Flight huge for chats or helicopters 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.070
 Improvement of the annoying headcoach in 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.289
 comparative matchmaking and more 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.050
 Also new was that premium owner of 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.610
 consoles now at least on the pc in the 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.830
 ce could be there 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.890
 In december it is official 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.660
 even if it has not been official before 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.510
 we already knew it already 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.400
 all before battlefield 4 was with finer 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.050
 was not finished yet and it should 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.229
 be further supported next 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.690
 new maps such as map remakes will be there 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:11.430
 even more patches of night versions of 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.950
 already existing cards and 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.690
 hopefully even more can give 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.550
 one still from the official side 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.680
 not really talk about what 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.620
 everything will come that is us 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.460

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.200
 to be seen 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.720
 There was also another one
