00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.350
 situations that someone is calling his 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.300
 an acquaintance holds him a bazaar in his 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.310
 companies and damn not signing a contract 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.160
 and literally in a day in two 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.930
 another friend is calling the same person 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.400

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.280
 high mental things do not understand what 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.290

 every morning opened and a bunch of 1 in 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.250
 some incomprehensible 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.170
 and the other talked about practice about how 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.690
 way today start earning 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.149

 you can buy them clothes blasphemy 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.329
 you can buy shoes you can 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.090
 buy a handbag something else every month 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.930

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.250
 eight million rubles every month 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.049
 no one makes the question of your choice 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.000
 you to be professional networkers and 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.740
 do this one hundred percent in this 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.210
 huge plus because you can 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.729
 quietly little by little 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.409
 there is no start here so what if 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.750
 you don't come as a professional here and 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.290
 forever come the lowest layer where 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.140
 people earn the most there I don't know 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.579
 there are 8 thousand rubles every month there is no you 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.380
 can try and move 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.920
 further but if we talk about what 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.259
 specifically you need to do the first important 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.060
 understand people will never end all 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.649
 these people want to live better everyone wants to live 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.810
 better absolutely everyone wants 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.450
 better car better trip better 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.250
 clothes are the best phone he wants and when 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.720
 are you talking to this person if 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.430
 you understand that when you 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.350
 tell my man ask me 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.600
 I would like to live better stupid question I 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.909
 I understand, but he is very action you wanted 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.530
 would a better person live on you inside 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.750
 with square eyes, you understand 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.210
 ask something not at home and you can 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.680
 decipher how to buy a new car 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.520
 Is there more money to spend on clothes? 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.290
 spend more time 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.660
 and money for rest every weekend 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.930
 go somewhere to rest you like 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.060
 would 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.830
 or would not want this very key 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.060
 question because there are people who 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.010
 burn no suits me 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.510
 end the conversation with him 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.450
 man you just take the time 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.120
 end the conversation is meaningless 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.160
 waste of time the very fact of understanding 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.230
 that most people would like to live 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.570
 better like making money he 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.920
 gives you the opportunity to understand what people 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.840
 never end and then you 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.380
 make a list of names at all 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.240
 differently 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.160
 the list of names of the Kiev division is necessary 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.870
 spend every month you sit today 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.940
 one of you may be thinking of everything 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.950
 ended list of names ended or am I 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.170
 just started my business and made 30 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.000
 the person of the names of those people who exactly 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.680
 will go ask yourself the question you don't 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.240
 total marketing professional like you 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.060
 you can definitely think that these people 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.620
 they will surely deal with you 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.270
 you need to sit down and start all over again 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.460
 make a list just one more time 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.380
 remember all all of all people whom 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.000
 you know in other cities in other 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.680
 countries must all write them 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.100
 you can say the data is not going to go 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.200
 to another city, nothing terrible 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.240
 there can be no fear now 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.240
 may these people come to you tomorrow 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.310
 be something else make a list of names 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.380
 start here make a decision for yourself 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.800
 do what the higher ones say to you 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.080
 sponsors do exactly what you want 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.290
 say sponsors and try not to do 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.940
 nothing more than that because 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.330
 very often a person does what he 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.190
 said and a whole lot more and he did 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.500
 what he was told at 100 percent and 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.660
 he did everything right but thanks 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.140
 to what he additionally did 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.720
 you know a lot of things, that is, nothing 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.790
 works for example the cat had to 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.930
 to wash 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.100
 cut brush and feed 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.080
 some initiative then take 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.690
 gun also and and and shot and 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.070
 wonder what happened to her very much 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.650
 often the same happens with business 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.940
 the man did everything right then got it 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.780
 a gun and shot his organization 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.340
 not a question of why decide for themselves 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.380
 do what the sponsor tells you 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.890
 make the decision for yourself to do only 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.810
 what does the sponsor tell you then you 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.940
 the situation will start to change first 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.520
 must make a list of names big 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.780
 big and every month spend it 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.310
 revision take a new notebook and 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.410
 rewrite there people take new 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.090
 notebook and rewrite there people you 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.860
 you say well, that this will change, and also 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.240
 won't change the number of people in my 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.740
 organizations cannot change either 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.250
 the number of people on my list me 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.110
 and you try quite recently I'm with one 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.610
 man talked social networks and I said 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.170
 do the same pere leave your 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.270
 the list of names was the same problem 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.670
 run out of people he began to make up his 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.380
 the list of names again and the miracle turned out 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.060
 that he knows a huge number of people about 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.650
 miracle it turned out that he begins 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.410
 remember all new and new people about 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.290
 miracle these people suddenly turned themselves 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.850
 started going out on him I don't know how 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.860
 explain it but it is very frequent 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.420
 when you suddenly add a person to the list 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.520
 names and suddenly in a day or two you are with her 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:12.500
 are you dating him calling you i don't 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:15.290
 I can explain it but I can not but it 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.270
 fact and among you there are people who exactly 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.290
 also know that this is a fact because you 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.730
 already faced it 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:24.620
 the second point is the key invitation 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.450
 you know often i see networkers who 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.220
 I was tired of inviting as possible 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.680
 invite to spend 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.800
 trandle but understand it about the same 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.870
 the most that you went to work as a doctor and 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.880
 be upset about what you need 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.500
 you need every day to wear a white coat I 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.300
 I do not know about the same thing that you 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.310

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.260

 I will stop driving in every profession 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.660

 do not lose shape so that you can 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.020
 to an ordinary distributor to explain how 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.850

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.290
 which every day notice every day 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.530
 you must have time allocated if you 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.389
 invite 2-3 people a day 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.680

 maybe there are so rare 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.220
 cases even I you know know a couple at all 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.530
 with memory I remember there are such cases 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.240
 when a man invited one of not 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.610
 organization exploded huge 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.889
 turnover and so on but the success of that 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.570
 the person who came and built 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:08.910

 the number of people should invite 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:24.270
 every day there are 15-20 people 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.250
 Generally the minimum bar that 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.650
