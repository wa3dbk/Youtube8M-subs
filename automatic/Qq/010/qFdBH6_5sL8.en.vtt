at<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.210> same<00:01:02.449> time<00:01:02.659> you<00:01:03.170> know<00:01:03.260> there's<00:01:03.470> almost

at the same time you know there's almost

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.730 
at the same time you know there's almost
an<00:01:04.370> instantaneous<00:01:04.820> transfer<00:01:05.360> of<00:01:05.420> energy<00:01:05.740> so

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
an instantaneous transfer of energy so

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.080 
an instantaneous transfer of energy so
you<00:01:06.830> don't<00:01:07.010> see<00:01:07.100> any<00:01:07.280> of<00:01:07.430> these<00:01:07.549> balls<00:01:07.850> move

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
you don't see any of these balls move

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.840 
you don't see any of these balls move
until<00:01:08.360> they<00:01:08.479> all<00:01:08.690> react<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:10.190> it's<00:01:10.400> it's<00:01:10.640> cool

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
until they all react and it's it's cool

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.490 
until they all react and it's it's cool
to<00:01:11.060> that<00:01:11.270> though<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.630> one<00:01:11.810> ball<00:01:12.080> which<00:01:12.290> you're

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
to that though the one ball which you're

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.830 
to that though the one ball which you're
hitting<00:01:12.770> head<00:01:13.190> on<00:01:13.369> forward<00:01:13.970> has<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:14.659> much

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
hitting head on forward has so much

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.840 
hitting head on forward has so much
internal<00:01:15.320> dealings<00:01:15.830> with<00:01:15.979> other<00:01:16.250> balls<00:01:16.460> that

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
internal dealings with other balls that

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.120 
internal dealings with other balls that
it<00:01:17.090> actually<00:01:17.240> immediately<00:01:17.990> moves<00:01:18.170> toward<00:01:18.950> the

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
it actually immediately moves toward the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.590 
it actually immediately moves toward the
cue<00:01:19.369> that's<00:01:19.850> why<00:01:20.030> we<00:01:20.119> pay<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:20.330> much<00:01:20.540> attention

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
cue that's why we pay so much attention

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.660 
cue that's why we pay so much attention
to<00:01:21.020> how<00:01:21.440> tight<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.830> rack<00:01:21.979> is<00:01:22.190> to<00:01:22.400> make<00:01:22.549> sure

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
to how tight the rack is to make sure

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.219 
to how tight the rack is to make sure
all<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:22.909> balls<00:01:23.090> are<00:01:23.210> frozen<00:01:23.479> because<00:01:23.990> if

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
all the balls are frozen because if

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.990 
all the balls are frozen because if
there<00:01:24.350> any<00:01:24.500> gaps<00:01:24.710> in<00:01:24.860> it<00:01:25.010> you<00:01:25.130> know<00:01:25.250> transfer

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
there any gaps in it you know transfer

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.719 
there any gaps in it you know transfer
the<00:01:26.090> energies<00:01:26.450> to<00:01:26.780> all<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:26.990> balls<00:01:27.170> as<00:01:27.530> well<00:01:27.729> so

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
the energies to all the balls as well so

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.399 
the energies to all the balls as well so
what<00:01:28.909> about<00:01:29.000> this<00:01:29.270> stop<00:01:29.570> spin<00:01:29.900> shot

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
what about this stop spin shot

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.640 
what about this stop spin shot
I<00:01:30.729> don't<00:01:31.729> curious<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.120> see<00:01:32.150> that<00:01:32.420> actually<00:01:32.810> the

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
I don't curious to see that actually the

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.210 
I don't curious to see that actually the
stop<00:01:33.980> spin<00:01:34.490> shot<00:01:34.820> that's<00:01:35.630> well<00:01:35.930> named<00:01:36.230> the<00:01:36.980> cue

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
stop spin shot that's well named the cue

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.420 
stop spin shot that's well named the cue
ball<00:01:37.430> hits<00:01:37.750> stops<00:01:38.750> in<00:01:39.020> its<00:01:39.110> track<00:01:39.230> and<00:01:39.710> spins

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
ball hits stops in its track and spins

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.580 
ball hits stops in its track and spins
the<00:01:40.820> most<00:01:41.360> interesting<00:01:41.810> thing<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.080> me<00:01:42.200> here<00:01:42.470> is

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
the most interesting thing to me here is

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.400 
the most interesting thing to me here is
actually<00:01:43.030> when<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:44.120> study<00:01:44.420> physics<00:01:45.110> you

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
actually when you study physics you

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.360 
actually when you study physics you
study<00:01:45.650> superposition<00:01:46.960> so<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.710> are<00:01:49.040> putting<00:01:49.250> a

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
study superposition so you are putting a

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.800 
study superposition so you are putting a
lot<00:01:49.460> of<00:01:49.520> forward<00:01:49.910> momentum<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.480> but<00:01:50.690> you're

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
lot of forward momentum and but you're

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.570 
lot of forward momentum and but you're
also<00:01:50.960> putting<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:51.320> lot<00:01:51.440> of<00:01:51.560> spin<00:01:51.770> right<00:01:52.370> these

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
also putting a lot of spin right these

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.520 
also putting a lot of spin right these
balls<00:01:52.820> are<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.120> same<00:01:53.330> mass<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.050> that<00:01:54.080> forward

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
balls are the same mass so that forward

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.930 
balls are the same mass so that forward
momentum<00:01:54.650> gets<00:01:55.100> transferred<00:01:55.430> into<00:01:55.520> moving

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
momentum gets transferred into moving

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.030 
momentum gets transferred into moving
the<00:01:56.030> other<00:01:56.120> one<00:01:56.330> forward<00:01:56.659> but<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:57.200> spin<00:01:57.680> is

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
the other one forward but that spin is

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.130 
the other one forward but that spin is
all<00:01:58.340> that's<00:01:58.490> left<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:59.060> it<00:01:59.450> acts<00:01:59.690> as<00:01:59.900> if<00:02:00.020> the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
all that's left and it acts as if the

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.510 
all that's left and it acts as if the
two<00:02:00.260> things<00:02:00.440> were<00:02:00.530> completely<00:02:00.950> separate<00:02:01.340> and

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
two things were completely separate and

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.950 
two things were completely separate and
you<00:02:01.580> took<00:02:01.760> care<00:02:01.970> of<00:02:02.030> one<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.630> left<00:02:02.810> the

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
you took care of one and you left the

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.960 
you took care of one and you left the
other<00:02:03.080> one<00:02:03.170> behind<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:04.159> there's<00:02:04.610> like<00:02:04.790> I've

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
other one behind and there's like I've

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.550 
other one behind and there's like I've
never<00:02:05.210> seen<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:05.420> better<00:02:05.630> demonstration<00:02:06.320> of<00:02:06.440> how

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
never seen a better demonstration of how

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.760 
never seen a better demonstration of how
those<00:02:06.770> things<00:02:06.980> those<00:02:07.400> components<00:02:08.000> ever

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
those things those components ever

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.400 
those things those components ever
now<00:02:09.770> spin<00:02:10.340> has<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.670> purpose<00:02:11.420> no<00:02:11.900> we're<00:02:12.319> not

spin<00:02:14.989> let's<00:02:15.739> stick<00:02:15.980> with<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.220> game<00:02:16.370> we

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
spin let's stick with the game we

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.809 
spin let's stick with the game we
actually<00:02:17.090> enjoy<00:02:17.209> watching<00:02:18.670> ideally<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:19.700> would

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
actually enjoy watching ideally I would

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.120 
actually enjoy watching ideally I would
not<00:02:20.300> want<00:02:20.510> there<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.690> be<00:02:20.840> spin<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.349> would<00:02:22.040> be

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
not want there to be spin I would be

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.290 
not want there to be spin I would be
hoping<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:22.459> was<00:02:22.580> hitting<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.849> center<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.209> the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
hoping I was hitting the center of the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.330 
hoping I was hitting the center of the
ball<00:02:23.480> but<00:02:24.140> sometimes<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:25.010> know<00:02:25.100> you<00:02:25.190> hit<00:02:25.310> a

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
ball but sometimes you know you hit a

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.460 
ball but sometimes you know you hit a
little<00:02:25.520> right<00:02:25.819> or<00:02:25.940> left<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:26.540> where<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.840> want

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
little right or left so where you want

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.830 
little right or left so where you want
it<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.680> go<00:02:27.830> but<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.489> lot<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.150> times<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.480> use<00:02:29.630> that

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
it to go but a lot of times you use that

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.870 
it to go but a lot of times you use that
to<00:02:30.080> maneuver<00:02:30.260> around<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.680> table<00:02:31.010> now<00:02:31.520> how

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
to maneuver around the table now how

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.270 
to maneuver around the table now how
about<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.120> spin<00:02:32.510> shot<00:02:32.780> in<00:02:33.020> Reverse<00:02:33.410> what<00:02:34.040> Liz

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
about a spin shot in Reverse what Liz

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.270 
about a spin shot in Reverse what Liz
calls<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.910> backspin<00:02:35.630> shot<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:37.040> what's<00:02:37.190> gonna

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
calls a backspin shot so what's gonna

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.660 
calls a backspin shot so what's gonna
happen<00:02:37.370> I'm<00:02:37.730> gonna<00:02:37.849> hit<00:02:38.750> low<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.140> cue<00:02:39.319> ball

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
happen I'm gonna hit low on the cue ball

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.280 
happen I'm gonna hit low on the cue ball
make<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.790> seven<00:02:41.120> draw<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:41.989> cue<00:02:42.140> ball<00:02:42.200> back

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
make the seven draw the cue ball back

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.320 
make the seven draw the cue ball back
okay<00:02:43.190> so<00:02:43.250> you're<00:02:43.489> giving<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:43.910> spin<00:02:44.120> that's

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
okay so you're giving it a spin that's

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.370 
okay so you're giving it a spin that's
opposite<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:44.989> way<00:02:45.080> it<00:02:45.170> would<00:02:45.260> normally

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
opposite to the way it would normally

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.350 
opposite to the way it would normally
roll<00:02:45.860> it's<00:02:46.069> gonna<00:02:46.220> be<00:02:46.400> sliding<00:02:46.970> along<00:02:47.209> the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
roll it's gonna be sliding along the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.300 
roll it's gonna be sliding along the
cloth<00:02:47.660> while<00:02:48.410> spinning<00:02:48.680> backwards<00:02:51.790> very<00:02:52.790> nice

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
cloth while spinning backwards very nice

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.250 
cloth while spinning backwards very nice

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:05.330

it<00:02:57.410> looks<00:02:57.650> even<00:02:57.920> nicer

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.530 

that<00:03:06.300> is<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.569> lot<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.990> expen<00:03:07.500> oh<00:03:07.740> wow<00:03:08.610> just<00:03:09.330> hangs

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
that is a lot of expen oh wow just hangs

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.420 
that is a lot of expen oh wow just hangs
there<00:03:09.660> that's<00:03:10.140> cool<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.650> definitely<00:03:11.100> get<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.220> I

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
there that's cool you definitely get a I

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.580 
there that's cool you definitely get a I
wonder<00:03:11.670> how<00:03:11.790> many<00:03:11.850> times<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.360> just<00:03:13.110> spins

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
wonder how many times it just spins

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.949 
wonder how many times it just spins
there<00:03:13.890> well<00:03:14.280> we<00:03:14.459> keep<00:03:14.730> slowdown<00:03:15.180> education

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
there well we keep slowdown education

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:23.420 
there well we keep slowdown education
slowdowns<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.800> slowed<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.280> down<00:03:17.430> but<00:03:22.430> that's

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
slowdowns I slowed it down but that's

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.670 
slowdowns I slowed it down but that's
probably<00:03:24.209> five<00:03:24.600> rotations<00:03:25.140> before<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.530> even

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
probably five rotations before it even

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.920 
probably five rotations before it even
goes<00:03:25.860> one<00:03:26.100> balling<00:03:26.430> back<00:03:26.940> yeah<00:03:27.360> that's<00:03:27.750> pretty

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
goes one balling back yeah that's pretty

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.050 
goes one balling back yeah that's pretty
cool<00:03:28.020> it's<00:03:28.980> weird<00:03:29.310> as<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.459> player<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:29.880> have<00:03:29.910> a

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
cool it's weird as a player you have a

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.210 
cool it's weird as a player you have a
sense<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.720> it's<00:03:30.900> just<00:03:31.500> kind<00:03:31.830> of<00:03:31.860> floating

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
sense that it's just kind of floating

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.890 
sense that it's just kind of floating
there<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.550> stopping<00:03:32.850> before<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.450> spin<00:03:33.690> grabs

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
there and stopping before the spin grabs

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.050 
there and stopping before the spin grabs
but<00:03:34.170> I<00:03:34.230> guess<00:03:34.860> I<00:03:34.980> never<00:03:35.010> would<00:03:35.819> have<00:03:35.850> thought

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
but I guess I never would have thought

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.140 
but I guess I never would have thought
that<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.390> was<00:03:36.860> spinning<00:03:37.860> in<00:03:37.890> place<00:03:40.880> liz<00:03:41.880> has

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
that it was spinning in place liz has

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.620 
that it was spinning in place liz has
one<00:03:42.360> more<00:03:42.660> trick<00:03:43.050> on<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.350> tip<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.680> her<00:03:43.800> cue

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
one more trick on the tip of her cue

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.479 
one more trick on the tip of her cue
what's<00:03:45.630> gonna<00:03:45.750> happen<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.650> force<00:03:46.920> of<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.310> hit

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
what's gonna happen the force of the hit

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.150 
what's gonna happen the force of the hit
is<00:03:47.700> gonna<00:03:47.940> send<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.300> cue<00:03:48.480> ball<00:03:48.690> this<00:03:48.900> way

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
is gonna send the cue ball this way

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.199 
is gonna send the cue ball this way
there's<00:03:50.160> gonna<00:03:50.280> be<00:03:50.459> some<00:03:50.640> backspin<00:03:51.030> on<00:03:51.150> the

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
there's gonna be some backspin on the

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.790 
there's gonna be some backspin on the
ball<00:03:51.300> which<00:03:51.690> is<00:03:51.720> gonna<00:03:51.930> slow<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.260> down<00:03:52.380> and

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
ball which is gonna slow it down and

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.680 
ball which is gonna slow it down and
then<00:03:53.610> there's<00:03:53.790> gonna<00:03:53.910> be<00:03:54.090> some<00:03:54.269> right-hand

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
then there's gonna be some right-hand

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.080 
then there's gonna be some right-hand
spin<00:03:54.930> which<00:03:55.800> once<00:03:56.040> it's<00:03:56.190> moving<00:03:56.700> slow<00:03:56.880> enough

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
spin which once it's moving slow enough

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.970 
spin which once it's moving slow enough
is<00:03:57.239> gonna<00:03:57.420> grab<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:58.110> take<00:03:58.380> it<00:03:58.500> back<00:03:58.620> into<00:03:58.800> the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
is gonna grab and take it back into the

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:09.170 
is gonna grab and take it back into the
night<00:04:03.590> amazing<00:04:06.890> okay<00:04:07.890> we<00:04:08.220> are<00:04:08.400> seriously

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
impressed that is get really awesome I'm

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:12.710 
impressed that is get really awesome I'm
curious<00:04:11.880> to<00:04:12.000> see<00:04:12.030> what<00:04:12.269> happens

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
curious to see what happens

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.830 
curious to see what happens
at<00:04:12.900> any<00:04:13.320> speed<00:04:13.739> this<00:04:14.280> is<00:04:14.549> an<00:04:14.790> incredible<00:04:15.570> shot

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
at any speed this is an incredible shot

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.659 
at any speed this is an incredible shot
so<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:16.380> can<00:04:16.500> see<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.769> really<00:04:16.919> does<00:04:17.040> deflect<00:04:17.579> to

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
so you can see it really does deflect to

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.340 
so you can see it really does deflect to
the<00:04:17.790> side<00:04:17.970> I'm<00:04:18.479> barely<00:04:18.660> missing<00:04:19.019> that<00:04:19.169> ball
