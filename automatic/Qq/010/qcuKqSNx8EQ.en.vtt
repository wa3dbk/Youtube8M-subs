00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
whole front diet gone so I my edges

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.170 
whole front diet gone so I my edges
would<00:05:55.680> have<00:05:55.770> just<00:05:55.950> blended<00:05:56.340> on<00:05:56.490> end<00:05:56.790> with<00:05:57.060> this

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
would have just blended on end with this

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.000 
would have just blended on end with this
blonde<00:05:57.450> hair<00:05:57.690> I<00:05:57.810> ever<00:05:58.020> since<00:05:58.230> man<00:05:58.470> has<00:05:58.590> grown

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
blonde hair I ever since man has grown

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.460 
blonde hair I ever since man has grown
out<00:05:59.370> that<00:06:00.240> was<00:06:00.360> not<00:06:00.480> gonna<00:06:00.660> work<00:06:00.840> so<00:06:01.110> I<00:06:01.200> was

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
out that was not gonna work so I was

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.170 
out that was not gonna work so I was
thinking<00:06:01.740> about<00:06:01.860> he<00:06:02.010> took<00:06:02.190> some<00:06:02.610> dark<00:06:02.880> roots

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
thinking about he took some dark roots

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.810 
thinking about he took some dark roots
that<00:06:03.450> could<00:06:03.570> get<00:06:03.900> thrown<00:06:04.050> at<00:06:04.710> the<00:06:05.490> root<00:06:05.670> area

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
that could get thrown at the root area

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.960 
that could get thrown at the root area
so<00:06:06.300> this<00:06:06.480> can<00:06:06.720> blend<00:06:06.930> in<00:06:07.110> put<00:06:07.520> the<00:06:08.520> heck<00:06:08.730> with

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
so this can blend in put the heck with

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.550 
so this can blend in put the heck with
it<00:06:09.000> I<00:06:09.240> ain't<00:06:09.420> wearing<00:06:09.720> my<00:06:09.810> nerves<00:06:10.050> about<00:06:10.380> I
