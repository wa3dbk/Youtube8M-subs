are<00:00:30.570> some<00:00:30.750> things<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:30.990> point<00:00:31.230> out<00:00:31.380> around

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
are some things that point out around

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.840 
are some things that point out around
the<00:00:31.740> bike<00:00:32.600> first<00:00:33.600> thing<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.430> seat<00:00:35.430> lock<00:00:35.670> is

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
the bike first thing is the seat lock is

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.940 
the bike first thing is the seat lock is
missing<00:00:36.300> now<00:00:36.570> they<00:00:36.780> put<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.989> bolt<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.620> there

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
missing now they put a bolt in there

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.100 
missing now they put a bolt in there
like<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.460> however<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.270> mechanism<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:40.079> can

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
like that however the mechanism you can

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.810 
like that however the mechanism you can
put<00:00:40.440> your<00:00:40.590> hands<00:00:40.920> underneath<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.340> back<00:00:41.550> here

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
put your hands underneath the back here

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.760 
put your hands underneath the back here
another<00:00:42.030> latch<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> same<00:00:43.320> anyway<00:00:43.710> so

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
another latch it just the same anyway so

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.670 
another latch it just the same anyway so
it's<00:00:44.100> probably<00:00:44.930> newly<00:00:45.930> secured<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.559> was

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it's probably newly secured as it was

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.080 
it's probably newly secured as it was
before<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.570> there's<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.399> the<00:00:50.399> tires<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
before so there's that the tires on the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.560 
before so there's that the tires on the
bike<00:00:51.300> would<00:00:51.539> probably<00:00:52.050> pass<00:00:52.260> an<00:00:52.500> MOT<00:00:53.570> but

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
bike would probably pass an MOT but

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.180 
bike would probably pass an MOT but
they're<00:00:54.840> worn<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.230> anyways<00:00:55.710> you'll<00:00:55.920> need<00:00:56.129> to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
they're worn out anyways you'll need to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.000 
they're worn out anyways you'll need to
replace<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.390> here<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.199> tread<00:00:58.800> wear

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
replace and this here is the tread wear

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.130 
replace and this here is the tread wear
indicator<00:00:59.489> there<00:01:00.120> now<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.539> showing<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> tread

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
indicator there now is showing the tread

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.160 
indicator there now is showing the tread
wear<00:01:01.289> indicator<00:01:01.710> pretty<00:01:02.609> close<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> to

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
wear indicator pretty close to the to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.479 
wear indicator pretty close to the to
the<00:01:04.290> wailing<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.949> Front's<00:01:05.280> pretty

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the wailing and the Front's pretty

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.609 
the wailing and the Front's pretty
similar<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:06.060> well<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.600> you're<00:01:07.350> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.500> need

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
similar as well so you're going to need

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.010 
similar as well so you're going to need
to<00:01:07.740> do<00:01:07.860> something<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.430> that

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
to do something with that

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.649 
to do something with that
both<00:01:10.500> riser<00:01:10.920> bolts<00:01:11.310> these<00:01:11.760> are<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> handlebar

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
risers bolts are bent I don't know

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.890 
risers bolts are bent I don't know
whether<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.700> straighten<00:01:18.330> those<00:01:18.509> or

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
whether you can straighten those or

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.499 
whether you can straighten those or

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
probably want to replace those if you if

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.910 
probably want to replace those if you if
you<00:01:21.630> didn't<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:22.020> them<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:22.380> slightly<00:01:22.680> out

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
you didn't like them it was slightly out

when you start the engine on the choke

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.999 
when you start the engine on the choke
it<00:01:39.720> starts<00:01:40.049> off<00:01:40.200> with<00:01:40.290> fair<00:01:40.530> enough<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:40.890> when

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
it starts off with fair enough but when

you<00:01:41.130> ride<00:01:41.369> off<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.880> realize<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.409> on<00:01:43.409> take

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
you ride off you realize that on take

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.310 
you ride off you realize that on take
over<00:01:44.090> it<00:01:45.090> doesn't<00:01:45.270> take<00:01:45.540> over<00:01:45.750> both<00:01:45.899> Sooners

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
over it doesn't take over both Sooners

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.810 
over it doesn't take over both Sooners
unless<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.649> pull<00:01:46.799> out<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.979> bit<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.220> choke<00:01:47.460> now

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
unless you pull out a bit of choke now

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.580 
unless you pull out a bit of choke now
the<00:01:47.880> trigger<00:01:48.210> mechanism<00:01:48.420> operates<00:01:49.170> both<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the trigger mechanism operates both the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.580 
the trigger mechanism operates both the
carburetors<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.220> course<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.810> are<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.320> fact

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
carburetors of course so you are in fact

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.870 
carburetors of course so you are in fact
although<00:01:52.860> you're<00:01:53.100> making<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.430> balanced<00:01:53.729> who

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
although you're making it balanced who

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.249 
although you're making it balanced who
soon<00:01:54.119> as<00:01:54.240> you're<00:01:54.420> making<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.810> other<00:01:54.840> side<00:01:55.020> of

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
soon as you're making the other side of

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.870 
soon as you're making the other side of
the<00:01:55.320> run<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> little<00:01:55.680> bit<00:01:55.860> rich<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.670> can

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
the run a little bit rich and that can

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.429 
the run a little bit rich and that can
then<00:01:57.000> cause<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.630> suit<00:01:57.840> up<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.079> little<00:01:58.229> bit

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
then cause it to suit up a little bit

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.800 
then cause it to suit up a little bit
and<00:01:58.530> occasionally<00:01:59.280> backfire<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.450> could<00:02:00.600> just

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
and occasionally backfire you could just

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.420 
and occasionally backfire you could just
carry<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.110> riding<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> last

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
carry on riding like that like the last

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.069 
carry on riding like that like the last
owner<00:02:02.640> did<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.149> isn't<00:02:03.420> right<00:02:03.630> what<00:02:03.960> you

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
owner did but it isn't right what you

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.690 
owner did but it isn't right what you
really<00:02:04.320> want<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.829> clear<00:02:05.520> out<00:02:05.670> that

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
really want to do is to clear out that

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.730 
really want to do is to clear out that
pile<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.299> jet<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.600> then<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.840> thing<00:02:07.020> will<00:02:07.170> take

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
pile of jet and then the thing will take

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.859 
pile of jet and then the thing will take
over<00:02:07.950> smoothly<00:02:08.369> with<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.090> choke<00:02:09.360> off<00:02:09.629> of

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
over smoothly with the choke off of

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.250 
over smoothly with the choke off of
course<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:11.700> don't<00:02:11.849> need<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.060> do<00:02:12.180> with<00:02:12.330> that

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
course so you don't need to do with that

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.899 
course so you don't need to do with that
fairly<00:02:13.650> straight<00:02:13.890> for<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.459> job<00:02:14.700> I

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
fairly straight for and of a job I

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.539 
fairly straight for and of a job I
expect<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.450> little<00:02:15.540> bit<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:16.159> markers<00:02:17.159> come<00:02:17.370> down

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
expect a little bit of markers come down

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.399 
expect a little bit of markers come down
from<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.909> tank<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.540> blocked<00:02:19.140> up<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
from the tank and and blocked up the

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.490 
from the tank and and blocked up the
smallest<00:02:19.680> jet<00:02:20.069> there<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.459> there's<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:21.500> there

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
smallest jet there so there's that there

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.050 
smallest jet there so there's that there
was<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> tiny<00:02:22.980> fracture<00:02:23.640> in<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.790> front

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
was a tiny fracture in the front

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.149 
was a tiny fracture in the front
mudguard<00:02:24.360> here<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:25.049> little<00:02:25.709> bit<00:02:25.830> there<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:25.980> can

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
mudguard here a little bit there you can

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.740 
mudguard here a little bit there you can
see<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.580> detailed<00:02:27.000> pictures<00:02:27.450> below

paintwork<00:02:32.040> on<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.489> bike<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:33.180> not<00:02:33.540> original

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
paintwork on the bike is not original

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.300 
paintwork on the bike is not original
but<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.349> isn't<00:02:34.620> bad<00:02:34.799> either

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
but it isn't bad either

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.190 
but it isn't bad either
it's<00:02:35.610> got<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.790> nice<00:02:36.000> shiny<00:02:36.299> kind<00:02:36.599> of<00:02:36.690> finish<00:02:36.989> to

it's got a nice shiny kind of finish to

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.559 
it's got a nice shiny kind of finish to
it<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:38.069> think<00:02:38.640> it's<00:02:38.760> probably<00:02:39.000> an<00:02:39.180> original

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
it I think it's probably an original

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.780 
it I think it's probably an original
color<00:02:39.840> but<00:02:40.379> it<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.010> an<00:02:41.099> original<00:02:41.280> one<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:41.640> can

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
color but it is an original one you can

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.470 
color but it is an original one you can
see<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.000> if<00:02:42.299> you<00:02:42.390> look<00:02:42.599> carefully<00:02:42.989> at<00:02:43.409> it<00:02:44.480> the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
see that if you look carefully at it the

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.949 
see that if you look carefully at it the
exhaust<00:02:45.810> pipes<00:02:46.260> on<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.590> bike<00:02:46.920> are<00:02:47.959> original

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
exhaust pipes on the bike are original

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.530 
exhaust pipes on the bike are original
style<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:50.340> fact<00:02:50.640> nothing<00:02:50.819> they<00:02:51.060> are<00:02:51.090> Yamaha

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
style of fact nothing they are Yamaha

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.670 
style of fact nothing they are Yamaha
but<00:02:51.720> they've<00:02:51.810> been<00:02:51.959> modified<00:02:52.170> they're

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
but they've been modified they're

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.619 
but they've been modified they're
slightly<00:02:53.190> louder<00:02:53.370> than<00:02:53.700> standard<00:02:54.269> but<00:02:54.599> not

slightly louder than standard but not

slightly louder than standard but not
much<00:02:55.079> louder<00:02:55.470> just<00:02:56.340> gives<00:02:56.519> it<00:02:56.640> back<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.819> little

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
much louder just gives it back a little

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.460 
much louder just gives it back a little
bit<00:02:57.150> more<00:02:57.359> of<00:02:57.480> us<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.780> meaty<00:02:58.019> sort<00:02:58.349> of<00:02:58.410> a

bit more of us of a meaty sort of a

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.479 
bit more of us of a meaty sort of a
sound<00:03:00.319> one<00:03:01.319> of<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.530> questions<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.010> get<00:03:02.190> asked

quite<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.670> lot<00:03:02.760> with<00:03:02.970> bikes<00:03:03.209> been<00:03:03.450> left<00:03:03.599> sitting

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
quite a lot with bikes been left sitting

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.539 
quite a lot with bikes been left sitting
around<00:03:04.109> a<00:03:04.260> little<00:03:04.440> bit<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.739> other<00:03:04.920> folks<00:03:05.310> it

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
around a little bit is other folks it

around a little bit is other folks it
was<00:03:05.609> okay<00:03:06.000> because<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.299> seals<00:03:06.540> can<00:03:06.750> go<00:03:06.870> hard

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
was okay because the seals can go hard

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.869 
was okay because the seals can go hard
after<00:03:07.410> one<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:07.890> they<00:03:08.010> use<00:03:08.340> him<00:03:08.519> before<00:03:08.760> this

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
after one and they use him before this

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.789 
after one and they use him before this
seal<00:03:09.120> but<00:03:09.299> in<00:03:09.450> this<00:03:09.690> case<00:03:09.930> both<00:03:10.140> folk<00:03:10.440> silver

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
seal but in this case both folk silver

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.750 
seal but in this case both folk silver
wraps<00:03:10.950> it's<00:03:11.160> fine<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:13.530> there<00:03:13.680> we<00:03:13.799> go<00:03:13.829> that's

that's everything I've seen on the bike

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.440 
that's everything I've seen on the bike

one last thing was I did notice this
rear<00:03:20.190> left<00:03:20.370> indicators<00:03:21.000> got<00:03:21.150> some<00:03:21.299> tape

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
rear left indicators got some tape

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.890 
rear left indicators got some tape
around<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:22.099> it<00:03:23.099> seems<00:03:23.310> firm<00:03:23.609> enough<00:03:23.849> but<00:03:24.150> just

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900
