00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 go today I will lift a 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.210
 mystery the mystery of split grafting 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello everyone then for that we're going 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.500
 use an apple tree a rootstock that 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.969
 will we need in the first thing 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.889
 before grafting them frozen well smooth and 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.509
 a graft we will cut the trunk 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.770
 so for group and the trunk there you 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.930
 need a good if we go there 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.730
 generously at one meter from the ground if you 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.660
 would like to see a doctor when you have 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.949
 it all depends if you want to make a 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.660
 stem or half stems 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.099
 I remember a half tyche to more than one 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.210
 fifty meters high that we do not care 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.670
 is what we want today 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.960
 these two graft then once you 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.230
 have cut the stem 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.120
 you have to parry the piece of wood your 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.820
 graft that will carry your 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.219
 graft for that you use a good 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.559
 serpette to clean it and to say 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.460
 clean up the wound once you have 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.350
 finished off your your pleases you 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.610
 take your pruner and happened 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.780
 four o'clock it's a serpette 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.890
 we will take it so I started 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.949
 to take it a little bit a little bit 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.250
 noise here it is not if we see 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.809
 well like that a nice feint 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.670
 always pay attention to the finger because 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.619
 it's quite complicated once you 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.930
 have removed your serpette 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.670
 it will stall that the gap must be the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.270
 keep well apart it's not always 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.210
 easy 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.460
 a small mallet always we are very 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.439
 sweet with what we do we recover 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.259
 our plugins remember the plugins 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.299
 I told you about it in full pot I 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.830
 kept them all winter in a 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.409
 potato so what the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.560
 graft rather late on the 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.310
 vegetation and here I am taking a 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.229
 piece of grafts under one eye then 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.150
 at the level of delicacy it is cut and 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.630
 always with a serpette that 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:47.909
 normally should cut his cut 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:51.990
 the opposite, so you see here the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:56.100
 melted on both sides so that's not it 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.070
 complicated just slide in the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.530
 slot the graft once you have 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.869
 glee drag the graft into the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.920
 slot we remove the small hold serves more 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.299
 I could have put a second 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.540
 answer I get along after what we can 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.030
 make 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.630
 so once you're done that's it 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.730
 the myth 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.740
 father of the transplant that appears one will 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.150
 use you all know one the 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.710
 electricians especially know this well 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.250
 to isolate the electricity the wires 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.900
 electrical 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.300
 it's not my thing but it's okay for 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:27.690
 grafts we will tighten properly 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.460
 this is the most 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.720
 hermetic possible we serve well go 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.380
 we do not hesitate once we have 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:39.360
 tight her transplant is pretty much going 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:42.960
 cut three eyes above 1 2 3 to 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.110
 bizots once we've carved 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.790
 uses mastic to graft not 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.260
 anything good condemned mastic 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.270
 it is in a room to pay attention 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.330
 this one we do not do it heated and 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.280
 we chew all his way this is 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.330
 well born hermetic 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.010
 all around it's not complicated actually 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.780
 to graft once we've seen it 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.780
 do it once
