every
um<00:03:55.740> I<00:03:56.340> got<00:03:56.910> good<00:03:57.420> genes<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:04.530> these<00:04:05.010> ones<00:04:05.280> are

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
um I got good genes and these ones are

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.970 
um I got good genes and these ones are
supposed<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.850> be<00:04:06.060> like<00:04:06.480> improved<00:04:07.050> formula<00:04:07.500> and

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.150 
supposed to be like improved formula and
more<00:04:08.700> pigmented<00:04:09.390> I<00:04:09.690> really<00:04:10.590> didn't<00:04:10.800> notice<00:04:10.920> a

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
more pigmented I really didn't notice a

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.380 
more pigmented I really didn't notice a
difference<00:04:11.370> because<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:11.970> thought<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.300> other

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
difference because I thought the other

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.770 
difference because I thought the other
ones<00:04:12.630> were<00:04:12.780> pigmented<00:04:13.260> enough<00:04:13.560> but<00:04:13.890> oh<00:04:14.780> this

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
ones were pigmented enough but oh this

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.110 
ones were pigmented enough but oh this
one's<00:04:15.990> called<00:04:16.260> I'm<00:04:16.620> getting<00:04:16.980> sunburned<00:04:20.120> and

one's called I'm getting sunburned and
then<00:04:21.989> this<00:04:22.169> one's<00:04:22.380> called<00:04:22.530> silent<00:04:23.250> treatment

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.620 

um<00:04:28.740> like<00:04:29.130> I<00:04:29.250> said<00:04:29.280> there<00:04:29.640> were<00:04:29.760> two<00:04:29.790> more<00:04:30.240> and<00:04:30.510> I
