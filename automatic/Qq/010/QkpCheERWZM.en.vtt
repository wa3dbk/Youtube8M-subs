well<00:00:27.130> it's<00:00:27.430> a<00:00:27.550> power<00:00:27.730> supply<00:00:27.939> what<00:00:28.240> do<00:00:28.300> you<00:00:28.360> say

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.540 
well it's a power supply what do you say

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.450 
well it's a power supply what do you say
about<00:00:28.570> it<00:00:28.779> either<00:00:29.349> works<00:00:29.740> or<00:00:29.950> doesn't<00:00:30.160> right

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
about it either works or doesn't right

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.090 
about it either works or doesn't right
well<00:00:30.759> it<00:00:31.239> has<00:00:31.419> a<00:00:31.450> few<00:00:31.750> features<00:00:31.930> as<00:00:32.770> you<00:00:32.950> can

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
well it has a few features as you can

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.979 
well it has a few features as you can
see<00:00:33.220> on<00:00:33.310> the<00:00:33.399> front<00:00:33.610> for<00:00:34.030> independent<00:00:34.630> 10<00:00:34.840> amp

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
see on the front for independent 10 amp

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.110 
see on the front for independent 10 amp
output<00:00:35.140> so<00:00:35.620> if<00:00:35.680> you're<00:00:35.800> someone's<00:00:36.100> cut<00:00:36.340> for

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
output so if you're someone's cut for

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.299 
output so if you're someone's cut for
chargers<00:00:37.660> I<00:00:37.780> guess<00:00:38.020> so<00:00:38.170> come<00:00:38.320> on<00:00:38.680> or<00:00:39.010> maybe

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
chargers I guess so come on or maybe

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:40.530 
chargers I guess so come on or maybe

less than a third what my power lab 8

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.910 
less than a third what my power lab 8
can<00:01:09.940> even<00:01:10.180> do<00:01:10.360> so<00:01:10.840> I've<00:01:10.960> had<00:01:11.110> it<00:01:11.230> at<00:01:11.320> 40<00:01:11.680> amps

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
can even do so I've had it at 40 amps

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.250 
can even do so I've had it at 40 amps
for<00:01:11.980> a<00:01:12.130> good<00:01:12.520> hours<00:01:12.880> straight<00:01:13.270> and<00:01:13.570> it<00:01:13.990> smells

now<00:01:21.370> at<00:01:21.640> 40<00:01:21.940> amps<00:01:22.180> with<00:01:22.270> no<00:01:22.630> problem<00:01:23.230> so<00:01:23.470> really

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
now at 40 amps with no problem so really

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.860 
now at 40 amps with no problem so really
high<00:01:24.070> quality<00:01:24.100> power<00:01:24.550> supply<00:01:24.880> what<00:01:25.600> I<00:01:25.630> like

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
high quality power supply what I like

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.060 
high quality power supply what I like
about<00:01:25.900> it<00:01:26.260> which<00:01:26.410> might<00:01:26.590> be<00:01:26.620> weird<00:01:26.830> you<00:01:26.920> guys

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
about it which might be weird you guys

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.430 
about it which might be weird you guys
it's<00:01:27.460> actually<00:01:27.850> really<00:01:28.120> light<00:01:28.390> most<00:01:29.200> power

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
it's actually really light most power

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.140 
it's actually really light most power
supplies<00:01:29.770> of<00:01:29.950> this<00:01:30.070> are<00:01:30.250> quite<00:01:30.610> heavy<00:01:30.850> bulky

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
supplies of this are quite heavy bulky

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.670 
supplies of this are quite heavy bulky
to<00:01:31.420> carry<00:01:31.450> around<00:01:31.660> this<00:01:32.170> thing<00:01:32.350> is<00:01:32.530> i<00:01:32.650> don't

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
to carry around this thing is i don't

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.320 
to carry around this thing is i don't
know<00:01:32.890> maybe<00:01:33.070> only<00:01:33.220> a<00:01:33.280> couple<00:01:33.400> pounds<00:01:33.640> for<00:01:34.030> 40

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
know maybe only a couple pounds for 40

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.390 
know maybe only a couple pounds for 40
amps<00:01:34.600> that's<00:01:34.780> that's<00:01:35.140> pretty<00:01:35.410> good<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:36.280> it

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
amps that's that's pretty good and it

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.880 
amps that's that's pretty good and it
does<00:01:36.550> have<00:01:36.580> a<00:01:37.110> fuse<00:01:38.110> in<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.320> back<00:01:38.470> so<00:01:38.710> if<00:01:38.800> you

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
does have a fuse in the back so if you

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.620 
does have a fuse in the back so if you
happen<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.160> go<00:01:39.250> past<00:01:39.550> that<00:01:39.700> 40<00:01:40.060> which<00:01:40.210> i<00:01:40.450> might

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
happen to go past that 40 which i might

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.600 
happen to go past that 40 which i might
have<00:01:40.720> done<00:01:40.810> a<00:01:40.870> couple<00:01:41.050> times<00:01:41.350> you<00:01:42.280> can<00:01:42.400> reset

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
have done a couple times you can reset

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.700 
have done a couple times you can reset
the<00:01:42.670> future<00:01:43.030> replace<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:43.780> yeah<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.320> so<00:01:44.500> in

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
the future replace it yeah and so in

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.770 
the future replace it yeah and so in
terms<00:01:44.920> of<00:01:45.100> cost<00:01:45.400> of<00:01:45.520> operations<00:01:45.970> /<00:01:46.150> noon<00:01:46.540> or<00:01:46.690> we

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
terms of cost of operations / noon or we

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.510 
terms of cost of operations / noon or we
talk<00:01:46.960> about<00:01:47.110> durability<00:01:47.560> well<00:01:48.100> you<00:01:48.280> answered

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
talk about durability well you answered

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.040 
talk about durability well you answered
durability<00:01:48.970> already<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.540> pounded<00:01:49.930> this

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
durability already you pounded this

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.140 
durability already you pounded this
thing<00:01:50.290> you<00:01:50.830> know<00:01:50.920> we've<00:01:51.160> had<00:01:51.190> this<00:01:51.370> for<00:01:51.790> this

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
thing you know we've had this for this

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.430 
thing you know we've had this for this
is<00:01:52.270> one<00:01:52.390> of<00:01:52.450> our<00:01:52.570> oldest<00:01:52.930> pieces<00:01:53.110> actually

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
is one of our oldest pieces actually

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.200 
is one of our oldest pieces actually
we've<00:01:53.770> had<00:01:53.920> this<00:01:54.070> particular<00:01:54.610> unit<00:01:54.850> for<00:01:55.180> a

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
we've had this particular unit for a

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.930 
we've had this particular unit for a
long<00:01:55.450> long<00:01:55.660> time<00:01:55.720> and<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.670> know<00:01:57.760> I<00:01:57.790> bought

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
long long time and you know I bought

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.280 
long long time and you know I bought
this<00:01:58.120> originally<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.660> go<00:01:58.780> along<00:01:58.990> with<00:01:59.170> the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
this originally to go along with the

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.320 
this originally to go along with the
Hyperion<00:01:59.770> chargers<00:02:00.220> and<00:02:00.730> that's<00:02:01.150> obviously

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
Hyperion chargers and that's obviously

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.270 
Hyperion chargers and that's obviously
held<00:02:01.780> up<00:02:01.930> so<00:02:02.140> durability<00:02:02.500> is<00:02:02.710> a<00:02:02.800> great<00:02:03.010> five

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
held up so durability is a great five

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.030 
held up so durability is a great five
out<00:02:03.460> of<00:02:03.490> five<00:02:03.700> I'm<00:02:04.300> cost<00:02:04.630> of<00:02:04.750> operation<00:02:05.230> like

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
out of five I'm cost of operation like

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.980 
out of five I'm cost of operation like
most<00:02:06.220> pro<00:02:06.460> tech<00:02:06.670> stuff<00:02:06.940> which<00:02:07.510> is<00:02:07.660> a<00:02:07.690> mains

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
most pro tech stuff which is a mains

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.809 
most pro tech stuff which is a mains
house<00:02:08.200> brand<00:02:08.530> it's<00:02:09.220> going<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.399> be<00:02:09.489> just<00:02:09.519> a

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
house brand it's going to be just a

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.670 
house brand it's going to be just a
little<00:02:09.849> bit<00:02:10.119> less<00:02:10.390> expensive<00:02:11.019> than<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.290> name

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
little bit less expensive than the name

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.920 
little bit less expensive than the name
brand<00:02:11.920> stuff<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.849> so<00:02:13.360> if<00:02:13.450> it's<00:02:13.569> a<00:02:13.629> little<00:02:13.720> bit

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
brand stuff and so if it's a little bit

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.600 
brand stuff and so if it's a little bit
less<00:02:14.050> expensive<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:14.860> performs<00:02:15.250> just<00:02:15.340> as

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
less expensive and it performs just as

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.509 
less expensive and it performs just as
well<00:02:15.989> that's<00:02:16.989> a<00:02:17.140> that's<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.560> win<00:02:17.739> my<00:02:18.099> book<00:02:18.340> I

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
well that's a that's a win my book I

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.729 
well that's a that's a win my book I
think<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:19.060> thing<00:02:19.239> is<00:02:19.269> going<00:02:19.510> for<00:02:19.840> 149<00:02:20.349> right

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
think this thing is going for 149 right

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.320 
think this thing is going for 149 right
now<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.099> it's<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.610> second<00:02:22.000> most<00:02:22.030> powerful

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
now and it's the second most powerful

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.089 
now and it's the second most powerful
power<00:02:22.719> supply<00:02:23.079> they<00:02:23.290> only<00:02:23.409> have<00:02:23.560> one<00:02:23.799> above<00:02:24.040> it

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
power supply they only have one above it

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.100 
power supply they only have one above it
yeah<00:02:24.459> I<00:02:24.489> was<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:24.849> what<00:02:24.969> Maxwell<00:02:25.569> your<00:02:25.749> wall

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
yeah I was and what Maxwell your wall

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.350 
yeah I was and what Maxwell your wall
yeah<00:02:28.110> be<00:02:28.230> careful<00:02:28.380> with<00:02:28.620> those<00:02:29.150> we'll<00:02:30.150> just

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
yeah be careful with those we'll just

yeah be careful with those we'll just
skip<00:02:30.510> right<00:02:30.570> over<00:02:30.690> fun<00:02:31.020> factor<00:02:31.380> because<00:02:31.590> it's

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
skip right over fun factor because it's

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.230 
skip right over fun factor because it's

probably say today I might push that

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.840 
probably say today I might push that
bigger<00:03:21.570> power<00:03:22.080> supply<00:03:22.500> yeah<00:03:22.980> now<00:03:23.190> say<00:03:23.700> the

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
bigger power supply yeah now say the

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.300 
bigger power supply yeah now say the
same<00:03:24.090> thing<00:03:24.360> only<00:03:24.840> because<00:03:24.990> we<00:03:25.200> have<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.590> power

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
same thing only because we have a power

look at what your charger needs they'll
tell<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.500> how<00:03:31.590> many<00:03:31.650> watts<00:03:31.920> it<00:03:32.160> can<00:03:32.280> take<00:03:32.460> in

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
tell you how many watts it can take in

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.670 
tell you how many watts it can take in
you<00:03:33.150> buy<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.390> power<00:03:33.750> supply<00:03:33.960> cord<00:03:34.380> in<00:03:34.530> that

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
you buy a power supply cord in that

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.410 
you buy a power supply cord in that
usually<00:03:35.070> by<00:03:35.190> with<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.610> little<00:03:35.880> bit<00:03:36.000> more<00:03:36.120> power

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
usually by with a little bit more power

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.270 
usually by with a little bit more power
than<00:03:36.570> you<00:03:36.630> need<00:03:36.870> this<00:03:37.380> thing<00:03:37.590> has<00:03:37.800> a<00:03:38.010> ton<00:03:38.250> of

than you need this thing has a ton of
wattage<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.940> mean<00:03:39.240> more<00:03:39.690> than<00:03:39.750> most<00:03:40.020> you<00:03:40.260> need

but<00:03:40.710> with<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.190> power<00:03:41.370> lab<00:03:41.580> we<00:03:41.820> could<00:03:41.970> push<00:03:42.180> it

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
but with the power lab we could push it

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.000 
but with the power lab we could push it
even<00:03:42.420> farther<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.110> yeah<00:03:43.260> we<00:03:43.470> probably<00:03:43.710> buy<00:03:43.950> the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
even farther so yeah we probably buy the

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.310 
even farther so yeah we probably buy the
next<00:03:44.340> one<00:03:44.370> up<00:03:44.610> but<00:03:44.790> yeah<00:03:45.110> ninety-nine<00:03:46.110> point

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
next one up but yeah ninety-nine point

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.110 
next one up but yeah ninety-nine point
nine<00:03:46.470> percent<00:03:46.920> of<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.040> RC<00:03:47.310> population<00:03:47.910> or<00:03:48.030> is

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
nine percent of the RC population or is

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.940 
nine percent of the RC population or is
only<00:03:48.300> going<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.600> need<00:03:48.630> 40<00:03:49.080> amps<00:03:49.350> yes<00:03:49.710> so
