00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.000

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.420
 let's try to do this in all 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.729
 missions because if we can get 20 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.789
 People unlock lion, we will power. 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.489

 can take no zombie damage 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.060
 Let's stay inside because it seems easy. 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.600
 but for one thing we can take 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.570
 damage and it's not what we want to take 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.320
 Every care of the world here 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:36.540
 Beauty opa two boys here remembering 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.630
 who still has a pistol I have to 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.060
 evolve my character raise the level 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.390
 to be able to carry other weapons to 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.460
 legend of the pistol next plus a gun 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.260
 just not necessarily because the pistol 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.860
 which might be for other weapons in it 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.650
 but let's go for a while with the gun, right? 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:00.900
 where are these a bis 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:03.209
 damn you sweety beauty 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.160
 when we have to kill 39 sumbe 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.440
 for the time being we killed the six 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.490
 It will take a little time for us to defeat 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.580
 all right 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.380
 I hear you Paulo in the area but do not know 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.910
 exactly what you are to take 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.700
 careful we do not lose all 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:23.580
 bullets 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:33.980
 Let's economise. Speak here. Do not go there. 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:33.980
 There goes there to be on the knife and you 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.810
 unfortunately this game here in your 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.300
 version for pc is not used there much 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.030
 so there are going to be some legs 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.340
 have occurred and how much have you played here 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.470
 but are bones of the trade 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.080
 There's no way people go, let's go there 14 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.690
 I will not even calculate how many are left 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.600
 because I'm very bad math 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:04.120
 so I will not even embarrass shame 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:08.450

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.120

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.820
 I do not know if all the characters can 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.100
 but at least with it we can 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.540
 you press the button and the blow will come out 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.830

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.860

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.800

 very good people if you are looking for 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.810
 for a game 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.700
 resident of the franchise resident evil and 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.710
 disenchanted at some point after the 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.170
 resident evil 4 because it's very much 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.440
 abandon the roots and this 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:17.540
 revelations rain the foot europe does not stop 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.370
 there there to catch an instance staff and 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:23.360
 This is dangerous. I do not know what it is. 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.760
 exactly but it's dangerous or it did not run 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.090
 so easy that I do not know if it is or not 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:33.230
 finally disenchanted with resident in some 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:35.330
 I was able to enjoy it from here. 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.250
 very good, very cool a ransom is not 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.790
 a return to origins 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:43.130
 he has elements of terror are cool 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.080
 if you take it harder and harder 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.150
 difficult you have a shortage of 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.250
 ammo so you will spend for 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.810
 other perrengues in this mode in this game 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.260
 Beauty here 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:57.680

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.210
 none were we do not take any 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.620
 We defeated all enemies and 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.500
 get all the medallions 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.890
 win medallions conclusion that is what 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:21.080
 We need to release the lion. 

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:23.900
