00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 very good files today I bring you a 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.870
 tutorial on how to throw one of the 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.700
 most complicated fouls of fifa 13 but to 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.000
 the time one of the most beautiful and with the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.889
 that we will mark authentic goals I do not know 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.680
 if some of you will have a good memory this 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.390
 missing came out in the trailer of fifa 13 and 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.300
 most people wondered 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.160
 how to make this kind of fault so 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.619
 I'm going to say two things very first 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.750
 important the first is that you have to 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.179
 have patience since the technique of 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.210
 lack is very easy but what will you 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.160
 prove a bit more complicated is 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.340
 catch the trick shot power 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.100
 depending on where you are shooting 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.500
 the lack so you have to have patience 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.020
 with that and practice shooting power 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.450
 second and the most important of all 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.820
 both to launch and to feint with 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.800
 second and the third pitcher we have to 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.899
 leave the same button pressed 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.510
 with what we call it vale with which 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.730
 we take it out in this case to get the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.920
 third launcher press r1 or rp in xbox 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.200
 and let's do to do it we have to 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.420
 hold down r1 which is the button with 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.710
 which we have called and pressed 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.650
 circle and X 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.930
 you see that automatically the player 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.450
 store the shot 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:24.100
 we went to the second launcher in this case 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.050
 let's press the 2 or the ether and we do 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.800
 the same as with the previous one maintaining 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.380
 pressed this button of l2 press x 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.020
 and circle but of a circle and X 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.570
 to amagar and as you see the second one has already 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.500
 already paid in this case we want that 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.410
 also threaten the third one because r1 and 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.289
 circle now let's move on to the tutorial 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.960
 of the lack we need both the third 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.600
 pitcher like the second and the first 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.570
 what we are going to do is turn off the 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.510
 third pitcher 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.090
 and with the second we give a soft touch 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.130
 cited the center button 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.329
 we notice you see 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.329
 let's do it again 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.760
 we request the third launcher and the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.460
 second another thing like that exploded on the side 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.750
 right of the goal is preferable that 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.640
 the first pitcher is right-handed 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.100
 let's go with the third and with the 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.880
 second gives a light touch he cited and 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.590
 we shoot 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.800
 normally depending on the power 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.600
 usually go or down or to the squad and you 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.490
 I say it 's a matter of trying 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.950
 we go to the left side and that's 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.990
 when we execute this type of fault the 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.810
 first pitcher must be left handed as in 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.210
 this case a lame di maria and remember 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.410
 that has power and we do the same 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.970
 process 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.780
 we turn off 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.700
 and a little bit and for that yes 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.680
 that the squad has taken this kind of 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.230
 We can also run foul of 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.940
 another way and it's with a fourth pitcher 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.819
 that we do not have to request it, not what 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.420
 you are going to see 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.250
 you see 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.620
 appears the player who stays next 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.860
 of the lack and launches the only thing we have 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.709
 what to do is when we are going to execute the 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.050
 small centripe with the second launcher 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.470
 we have to give it more power we put 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.959
 the barrier well shut off we center a 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.440
 little bit more powerful and we kicked with a 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.500
 quarter 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.390
 finally left with some examples for 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.790
 that you see that the fault can be executed 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.140
 from any distance the only thing 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.660
 we have to do is practice the 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.380
 power if we are closer or we are 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.540
 further away from the goal remember that the 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.640
 planter with which we are going to execute 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.450
 the lack has to have good power 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.730
 of shooting is minimal I would put it to 82 and 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.010
 if we are on the right side of the 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.460
 goal to shoot with a southpaw and if we're 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.010
 on the left pull with a right-handed if 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.680
 you liked the video like i 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.140
 subscribe to the channel because I promise 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.480
 bring tutorials so you can learn to 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.990
 throw all the faults and also 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.360
 we will continue as not with the guide from behind 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.700
 from ohl if you have any questions 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.130
 put in the comments and if it has 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.100
 cost a lot to throw away faults or have 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.720
 I learned fast because you also tell me 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.740
 your experiences this has been all 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.340
 a little kiss and 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.340
 God
