hey<00:00:06.180> youtube<00:00:06.569> today<00:00:06.930> I'm<00:00:07.350> going<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.680> talk

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
hey youtube today I'm going to talk

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.950 
hey youtube today I'm going to talk
about<00:00:08.099> testing<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.760> salinity<00:00:09.510> in<00:00:09.750> your

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
about testing the salinity in your

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.990 
about testing the salinity in your
aquarium<00:00:10.349> now<00:00:10.830> we've<00:00:11.400> got<00:00:11.550> three<00:00:11.880> different

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
aquarium now we've got three different

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.390 
aquarium now we've got three different
ways<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.389> can<00:00:12.719> do<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:12.900> here<00:00:13.290> we've<00:00:13.980> got<00:00:14.160> a

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
ways you can do that here we've got a

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.710 
ways you can do that here we've got a
refractometer<00:00:16.880> floating<00:00:17.880> thermometer

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720

with<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.170> refractometer<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.550> most<00:00:26.730> accurate

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
with the refractometer the most accurate

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.660 
with the refractometer the most accurate
way<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.599> can<00:00:27.930> test<00:00:28.199> your<00:00:28.349> water<00:00:28.560> they're<00:00:29.519> not

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
way you can test your water they're not

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.060 
way you can test your water they're not
cheap<00:00:29.970> though<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.779> refractometer<00:00:31.349> cost<00:00:31.890> me

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
cheap though this refractometer cost me

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.770 
cheap though this refractometer cost me

give<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> clean<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.129> then<00:00:59.550> it's<00:00:59.699> ready<00:00:59.910> to

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
give it a clean and then it's ready to

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.439 
give it a clean and then it's ready to
go<00:01:00.329> next<00:01:00.960> time

the<00:01:03.449> floating<00:01:03.920> hydrometer<00:01:04.920> now<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the floating hydrometer now this is the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.539 
the floating hydrometer now this is the
most<00:01:06.180> inexpensive<00:01:06.780> way<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.619> test<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.280> water

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
most inexpensive way to test the water

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.630 
most inexpensive way to test the water
it's<00:01:09.090> also<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.510> most<00:01:09.630> inaccurate<00:01:10.400> very<00:01:11.400> easy

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
it's also the most inaccurate very easy

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.149 
it's also the most inaccurate very easy
to<00:01:11.880> use<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.299> just<00:01:12.360> simply<00:01:12.960> drop<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
to use you just simply drop it in the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.570 
to use you just simply drop it in the
water<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.299> bumps<00:01:15.540> within<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> green<00:01:16.740> area

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
water if it bumps within the green area

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.940 
water if it bumps within the green area
then<00:01:18.210> you're<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.600> clear<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.619> once<00:01:19.830> again

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
then you're in the clear but once again

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.539 
then you're in the clear but once again
you<00:01:20.670> can't<00:01:20.970> get<00:01:21.240> accurate<00:01:21.780> results<00:01:22.200> from<00:01:22.320> this

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
you can't get accurate results from this

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.210 
you can't get accurate results from this
the<00:01:23.549> swingarm<00:01:24.030> hydrometer<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.860> our<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
the swingarm hydrometer this is our a

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.280 
the swingarm hydrometer this is our a
lot<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.520> people<00:01:26.909> test<00:01:27.180> their<00:01:27.270> aquariums<00:01:27.960> water

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
lot of people test their aquariums water

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.600 
lot of people test their aquariums water
very<00:01:29.130> easy<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.610> use<00:01:29.790> simply<00:01:30.390> fill<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.229> up

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
very easy to use simply fill it up

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.469 
very easy to use simply fill it up
ensure<00:01:32.610> there's<00:01:32.880> no<00:01:32.939> air<00:01:33.420> bubbles<00:01:35.479> underneath

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
ensure there's no air bubbles underneath

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.889 
ensure there's no air bubbles underneath
the<00:01:36.720> arm<00:01:37.939> let<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> arm<00:01:39.210> settle<00:01:41.509> as<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.750> can

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
the arm let the arm settle as you can

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.499 
the arm let the arm settle as you can
see<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.860> bobbing<00:01:44.520> between<00:01:44.970> one<00:01:45.270> point

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
see this is bobbing between one point

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.520 
see this is bobbing between one point
zero<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.930> four<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.619> one<00:01:47.130> point<00:01:47.399> zero<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.939> five

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
zero to four and one point zero to five

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.920 
zero to four and one point zero to five
now<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:50.280> know<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.640> correct<00:01:50.939> reading<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.540> one

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
now we know the correct reading is one

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.929 
now we know the correct reading is one
point<00:01:52.170> zero<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.770> four<00:01:53.100> because<00:01:53.280> we've<00:01:53.640> just

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
point zero to four because we've just

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.020 
point zero to four because we've just
used<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.390> refractometer<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.610> little

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
used a refractometer so this is a little

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.469 
used a refractometer so this is a little
high

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
high

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.190 
high
but<00:01:57.960> hey<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.770> cheap<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.790> does<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.210> job<00:02:00.450> it's

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
but hey it's cheap it does the job it's

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.469 
but hey it's cheap it does the job it's
what<00:02:01.320> most<00:02:01.619> people<00:02:02.009> need<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.909> it's<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.149> great

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
what most people need so it's a great

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.570 
what most people need so it's a great
way<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.719> test<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> water

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.640
