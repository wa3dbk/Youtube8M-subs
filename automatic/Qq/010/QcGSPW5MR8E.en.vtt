00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.090
 up with the new colors of the mascara bat 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.040

 brettenti chimenti out first 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.789
 step to create the perfect base 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.920
 for our makeup 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.100
 we are going to apply the professional 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.440
 first and foremost a product that has one 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.780
 slight pigmentation and therefore corrects 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.610

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.320
 lower 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:04.250
 now let's go fade with the brush 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.990
 for precise nuances and leave the 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:13.040
 color well saturated a near the base 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:15.680

 previously the multiple e 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.930
 intensifies the corner of the eye 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.180

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:32.870
