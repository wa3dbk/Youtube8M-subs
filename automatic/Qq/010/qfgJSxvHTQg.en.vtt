00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
I think it's great anytime kids can be a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.550 
I think it's great anytime kids can be a
part<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.810> something<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.380> whole

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.170 
part of something and the whole
community<00:02:38.070> can't<00:02:38.310> can't<00:02:38.550> embrace<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.000> game

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
community can't can't embrace the game

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.600 
community can't can't embrace the game
with<00:02:39.420> chest<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.990> think<00:02:40.950> that's<00:02:41.130> what<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.430> all

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
it's about involvement it's about people

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.740 
it's about involvement it's about people
