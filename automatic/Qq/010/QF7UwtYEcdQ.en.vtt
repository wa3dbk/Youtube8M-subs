an<00:00:12.179> unusual<00:00:12.719> way<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:12.929> counting<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:13.860> grouping

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
an unusual way of counting this grouping

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.670 
an unusual way of counting this grouping
which<00:00:14.429> begins<00:00:14.790> not<00:00:15.059> with<00:00:15.090> the<00:00:15.360> one<00:00:15.599> but<00:00:16.500> rather

the buleria a helpful teaching aid here

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.080 
the buleria a helpful teaching aid here
is<00:00:26.699> using<00:00:26.910> an<00:00:27.090> analogy<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.840> clock<00:00:28.109> face<00:00:28.380> if

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
is using an analogy of a clock face if

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.370 
is using an analogy of a clock face if
you<00:00:30.090> divide<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.539> clock<00:00:30.750> face<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.140> half

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
you divide the clock face in half

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.049 
you divide the clock face in half
vertically<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.580> mark<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.969> twelve<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.540> six

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
vertically you mark the twelve and six

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.549 
vertically you mark the twelve and six
then<00:00:36.059> if<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.420> divide<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.840> right<00:00:37.020> half<00:00:37.290> in

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
then if you divide the right half in

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.520 
then if you divide the right half in
three<00:00:37.829> equal<00:00:38.160> parts<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:39.149> mark<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.540> three<00:00:42.530> now

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
three equal parts you mark the three now

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.380 
three equal parts you mark the three now
divide<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:43.980> left<00:00:44.309> half<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.820> three<00:00:45.149> equal

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
divide the left half in three equal

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.420 
divide the left half in three equal
parts<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.289> will<00:00:46.410> mark<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.890> eight<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
parts and you will mark the eight and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.110 
parts and you will mark the eight and
ten

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.200
