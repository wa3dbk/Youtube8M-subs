00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.080 
what I noticed was that these even have
a<00:01:44.729> more<00:01:45.090> creamy<00:01:45.740> texture<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.860> them<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.790> when

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
a more creamy texture to them like when

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.710 
a more creamy texture to them like when
you<00:01:48.119> put<00:01:48.509> your<00:01:48.630> finger<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.259> them<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:50.509> like<00:01:51.509> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
you put your finger on them it like the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.200 
you put your finger on them it like the
product<00:01:52.439> almost<00:01:52.649> instead<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.579> like<00:01:53.759> flaking

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
product almost instead of like flaking

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.810 
product almost instead of like flaking
off<00:01:54.509> or<00:01:54.689> dusting<00:01:55.170> away<00:01:55.290> it's<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.340> almost

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
off or dusting away it's like it almost

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.050 
off or dusting away it's like it almost
hangs<00:01:57.329> together<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.960> your<00:01:58.079> fingertip<00:01:58.710> and

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.670 
each shade kind of has its own identity

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.690
