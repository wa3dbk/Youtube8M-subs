00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590

too bad I think thirty thousand gold is
the<00:01:25.710> most<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.070> get<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.340> level<00:01:27.330> 5<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.380> level<00:01:28.409> 6<00:01:28.799> is

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the most to get to level 5 to level 6 is

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.899 
the most to get to level 5 to level 6 is
probably<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.670> upwards

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
probably going to be upwards

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.310 
probably going to be upwards
75<00:01:31.909> or<00:01:32.030> hundred<00:01:32.270> thousand<00:01:32.540> for<00:01:32.720> long<00:01:32.930> just

Valkyries<00:02:17.060> will<00:02:17.209> have<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.360> decreased<00:02:17.780> training

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
Valkyries will have a decreased training

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.350 
Valkyries will have a decreased training
time<00:02:18.470> which<00:02:18.680> is<00:02:18.830> pretty<00:02:19.160> cool<00:02:19.550> I<00:02:19.790> don't<00:02:20.209> use

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
time which is pretty cool I don't use

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.120 
time which is pretty cool I don't use
Valkyries<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.900> ton<00:02:21.170> although<00:02:21.410> my<00:02:21.560> clan<00:02:21.830> members

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
Valkyries a ton although my clan members

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.100 
Valkyries a ton although my clan members
do<00:02:22.310> use<00:02:22.580> them<00:02:22.760> in<00:02:22.880> wars<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.269> their<00:02:23.630> absolute

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
do use them in wars and their absolute

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.930 
do use them in wars and their absolute
beast<00:02:24.319> they<00:02:24.560> tackle<00:02:25.220> buildings<00:02:25.550> at<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.700> time

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
beast they tackle buildings at a time

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.490 
beast they tackle buildings at a time
and<00:02:26.150> they're<00:02:26.300> so<00:02:26.480> strong<00:02:26.750> when<00:02:26.959> Ruth<00:02:27.170> together

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
and they're so strong when Ruth together

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.140 
and they're so strong when Ruth together
so<00:02:27.920> that's<00:02:28.100> pretty<00:02:28.250> cool<00:02:28.340> decreased<00:02:28.850> training

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
so that's pretty cool decreased training

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.240 
so that's pretty cool decreased training
time<00:02:29.330> I<00:02:29.540> know<00:02:29.900> they<00:02:30.110> were<00:02:30.170> probably<00:02:30.500> 15<00:02:30.920> or<00:02:30.980> 20

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
time I know they were probably 15 or 20

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.949 
time I know they were probably 15 or 20
minutes<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.640> get<00:02:32.030> each<00:02:32.209> one<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:32.600> that's<00:02:32.720> quite

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
minutes to get each one so that's quite

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.960 
minutes to get each one so that's quite
a<00:02:33.080> long<00:02:33.290> time<00:02:33.319> heroes<00:02:34.250> will<00:02:34.459> also<00:02:34.790> have<00:02:34.940> a

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
a long time heroes will also have a

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.930 
a long time heroes will also have a
decreased<00:02:35.360> regen<00:02:36.110> time<00:02:36.380> I<00:02:36.650> was<00:02:36.920> thinking<00:02:37.280> it

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
decreased regen time I was thinking it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.000 
decreased regen time I was thinking it
had<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.209> do<00:02:38.299> with<00:02:38.329> healing<00:02:38.810> actually<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:39.920> know

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
had to do with healing actually you know

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.380 
had to do with healing actually you know
in<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.220> battle<00:02:40.489> when<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:40.700> use<00:02:40.880> an<00:02:41.090> iron<00:02:41.150> fist

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
in the battle when you use an iron fist

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.520 
in the battle when you use an iron fist
in<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.570> air<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:41.750> cloak<00:02:42.019> but<00:02:42.200> it's<00:02:42.350> not<00:02:42.500> that

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
in the air and cloak but it's not that

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.530 
in the air and cloak but it's not that
at<00:02:42.739> all<00:02:42.980> it's<00:02:43.220> actually<00:02:43.640> after<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.090> battle

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
at all it's actually after the battle

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.180 
at all it's actually after the battle
once<00:02:44.989> they've<00:02:45.170> been<00:02:45.200> taken<00:02:45.650> out<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:46.010> then

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
once they've been taken out and then

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.220 
once they've been taken out and then
regen<00:02:46.790> it's<00:02:47.600> going<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:47.780> be<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:47.900> shorter<00:02:48.200> amount

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
regen it's going to be a shorter amount

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.720 
regen it's going to be a shorter amount
of<00:02:48.410> time<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:48.799> we<00:02:48.950> went<00:02:49.040> off<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.250> way<00:02:49.400> an<00:02:49.519> hour

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
of time so we went off the way an hour

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.270 
of time so we went off the way an hour
you<00:02:50.060> know<00:02:50.180> plus<00:02:50.480> for<00:02:50.690> each<00:02:50.810> hero<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.410> regen<00:02:51.829> we

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
you know plus for each hero to regen we

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.380 
you know plus for each hero to regen we
could<00:02:52.400> get<00:02:52.489> them<00:02:52.640> back<00:02:52.790> baby<00:02:52.970> within<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.209> half

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
could get them back baby within a half

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.360 
could get them back baby within a half
an<00:02:53.510> hour<00:02:53.600> that's<00:02:54.410> speculation<00:02:54.920> hopefully

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
an hour that's speculation hopefully

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.650 
an hour that's speculation hopefully
they<00:02:55.459> cut<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.700> down<00:02:55.790> an<00:02:55.940> apple<00:02:56.269> they<00:02:56.420> cut<00:02:56.570> it

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
they cut it down an apple they cut it

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.880 
they cut it down an apple they cut it
down<00:02:56.750> by<00:02:56.959> a<00:02:56.989> quarter<00:02:57.380> that<00:02:57.709> would<00:02:57.829> be

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
down by a quarter that would be

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
me but in hindsight that's actually kind

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.510 
me but in hindsight that's actually kind
of<00:03:34.690> cool<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.230> is<00:03:35.410> basically<00:03:35.860> an<00:03:35.980> air<00:03:36.130> golem

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
of cool it is basically an air golem

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.340 
of cool it is basically an air golem
which<00:03:36.640> is<00:03:36.760> gonna<00:03:36.940> attack<00:03:37.240> the<00:03:37.510> closest<00:03:38.170> air

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
which is gonna attack the closest air

which is gonna attack the closest air
defense<00:03:38.680> once<00:03:38.920> you<00:03:39.010> drop<00:03:39.220> it<00:03:39.430> so<00:03:39.670> kind<00:03:40.150> of<00:03:40.240> acts

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
defense once you drop it so kind of acts

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.870 
defense once you drop it so kind of acts
like<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.660> golem<00:03:41.260> you<00:03:41.350> know<00:03:41.730> disrupting<00:03:42.730> the

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
like a golem you know disrupting the

pattern<00:03:43.210> of<00:03:43.420> their<00:03:44.170> defenses<00:03:44.800> so<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:45.100> can

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
pattern of their defenses so you can

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.070 
pattern of their defenses so you can
drop<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.400> some<00:03:45.640> dragons<00:03:46.000> behind<00:03:46.270> them<00:03:46.420> clear

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
quite a bit of hit points so it'll soak

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.940 
quite a bit of hit points so it'll soak
up<00:03:52.900> a<00:03:52.990> lot<00:03:53.020> of<00:03:53.230> damage<00:03:53.410> and<00:03:53.560> then<00:03:53.770> when<00:03:53.860> it

hits on things so a lava hound it my

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.730 
hits on things so a lava hound it my
first<00:04:04.360> impression<00:04:04.810> was<00:04:04.870> like<00:04:05.050> that<00:04:05.380> blows<00:04:05.710> and

first impression was like that blows and
then<00:04:06.280> my<00:04:07.090> second<00:04:07.510> impression<00:04:07.900> of<00:04:07.990> it<00:04:08.080> actually

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
then my second impression of it actually

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.990 
then my second impression of it actually
after<00:04:08.650> thinking<00:04:08.980> about<00:04:09.100> it<00:04:09.220> being<00:04:09.670> in<00:04:09.820> some

out<00:04:19.090> clan<00:04:19.330> troops<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:19.870> when<00:04:20.380> you<00:04:20.470> don't<00:04:20.710> if

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
out clan troops and when you don't if

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.350 
out clan troops and when you don't if
they've<00:04:21.070> got<00:04:21.190> wizards<00:04:21.580> and<00:04:21.730> witches<00:04:21.910> in<00:04:22.180> there

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
they've got wizards and witches in there

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.300 
they've got wizards and witches in there
it's<00:04:22.510> really<00:04:23.110> really<00:04:23.410> difficult<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.950> take<00:04:24.130> one

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
it's really really difficult to take one

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.520 
it's really really difficult to take one
down<00:04:24.460> so<00:04:24.820> that's<00:04:25.630> actually<00:04:25.870> cool<00:04:26.170> i<00:04:26.230> will<00:04:26.380> be

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
down so that's actually cool i will be

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.710 
down so that's actually cool i will be
using<00:04:26.620> one<00:04:26.950> although<00:04:27.550> it's<00:04:27.730> 30<00:04:28.000> spaces<00:04:28.540> that's

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
using one although it's 30 spaces that's

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.750 
using one although it's 30 spaces that's
quite<00:04:29.140> a<00:04:29.170> lot<00:04:29.470> of<00:04:29.590> troops<00:04:29.830> but<00:04:30.400> if<00:04:30.490> you<00:04:30.580> think

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
quite a lot of troops but if you think

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.250 
quite a lot of troops but if you think
about<00:04:30.850> it<00:04:31.030> in<00:04:31.300> hindsight<00:04:31.480> you're<00:04:31.990> really

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
about it in hindsight you're really

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.930 
about it in hindsight you're really
using<00:04:32.410> you<00:04:32.800> know<00:04:32.890> four<00:04:33.190> or<00:04:33.220> five<00:04:33.460> hot

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
using you know four or five hot

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.610 
using you know four or five hot
sometimes<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:34.720> those<00:04:34.810> are<00:04:34.930> five<00:04:35.080> spaces<00:04:35.410> of

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
sometimes and those are five spaces of

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.440 
sometimes and those are five spaces of
peace<00:04:35.800> so<00:04:36.070> love<00:04:36.490> how<00:04:36.670> it<00:04:36.760> isn't<00:04:37.000> too<00:04:37.090> much<00:04:37.120> more

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
peace so love how it isn't too much more

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.730 
peace so love how it isn't too much more
and<00:04:37.600> you'll<00:04:37.690> actually<00:04:37.840> be<00:04:37.990> able<00:04:38.050> to<00:04:38.200> knock<00:04:38.590> out

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
and you'll actually be able to knock out

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.290 
and you'll actually be able to knock out
maybe<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.400> little<00:04:39.550> bit<00:04:39.760> of<00:04:39.820> an<00:04:39.910> air<00:04:40.030> defense

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
maybe a little bit of an air defense

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.690 
maybe a little bit of an air defense
health<00:04:40.510> as<00:04:40.690> well<00:04:40.720> so<00:04:41.080> that's<00:04:41.440> kind<00:04:41.740> of<00:04:41.830> cool<00:04:41.980> I

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
health as well so that's kind of cool I

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.220 
health as well so that's kind of cool I
was<00:04:43.000> hoping<00:04:43.240> for<00:04:43.300> something<00:04:43.630> maybe<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:44.020> little

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
was hoping for something maybe a little

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.950 
was hoping for something maybe a little
bit<00:04:44.500> I<00:04:45.220> don't<00:04:45.640> know<00:04:45.730> more<00:04:45.940> usable<00:04:46.420> for<00:04:46.630> me<00:04:46.780> I

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
bit I don't know more usable for me I

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.840 
bit I don't know more usable for me I
don't<00:04:47.290> use<00:04:47.440> a<00:04:47.470> ton<00:04:47.740> of<00:04:47.770> air<00:04:48.010> attacks<00:04:48.460> anymore
