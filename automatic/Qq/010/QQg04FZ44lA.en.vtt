hey<00:00:08.450> everyone<00:00:08.870> Robert<00:00:09.320> de<00:00:09.440> Bru's<00:00:09.469> here<00:00:10.010> again

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
hey everyone Robert de Bru's here again

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.060 
hey everyone Robert de Bru's here again
with<00:00:10.969> another<00:00:11.000> tutorial<00:00:11.600> for<00:00:12.139> battlefield<00:00:12.680> 3

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
with another tutorial for battlefield 3

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.520 
with another tutorial for battlefield 3
I<00:00:13.760> actually<00:00:14.150> received<00:00:14.540> a<00:00:14.719> lot<00:00:14.900> of<00:00:14.930> requests

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
I actually received a lot of requests

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.839 
I actually received a lot of requests
for<00:00:15.679> this<00:00:15.830> so<00:00:16.130> today<00:00:16.400> we're<00:00:16.550> going<00:00:16.670> to<00:00:16.730> be

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:16.849 
for this so today we're going to be

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.660 
for this so today we're going to be
looking<00:00:17.240> at<00:00:17.360> landing<00:00:17.810> aircraft<00:00:18.470> will<00:00:19.250> start

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
looking at landing aircraft will start

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.089 
looking at landing aircraft will start
out<00:00:19.849> focusing<00:00:20.420> on<00:00:20.630> helicopters<00:00:21.529> and<00:00:21.740> we'll

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
out focusing on helicopters and we'll

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.370 
out focusing on helicopters and we'll
move<00:00:22.250> into<00:00:22.430> jets<00:00:22.790> after<00:00:23.149> that<00:00:23.300> so<00:00:23.930> let's<00:00:24.169> dive

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
move into jets after that so let's dive

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.769 
move into jets after that so let's dive
right<00:00:24.590> in

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.019 

now<00:00:30.470> there<00:00:30.619> are<00:00:30.710> two<00:00:30.859> basic<00:00:31.250> ways<00:00:31.429> the<00:00:31.699> lander

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
now there are two basic ways the lander

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.880 
now there are two basic ways the lander
helicopter<00:00:32.720> we're<00:00:33.200> gonna<00:00:33.320> start<00:00:33.559> off<00:00:33.649> putting

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
helicopter we're gonna start off putting

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.799 
helicopter we're gonna start off putting
it<00:00:34.010> to<00:00:34.100> slow<00:00:34.430> in<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:34.700> safe<00:00:34.970> landing<00:00:35.510> this<00:00:35.660> is

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
it to slow in the safe landing this is

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.290 
it to slow in the safe landing this is
if<00:00:35.960> you<00:00:36.079> are<00:00:36.200> not<00:00:36.260> being<00:00:36.680> pursued

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
if you are not being pursued

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.420 
if you are not being pursued
there's<00:00:38.899> no<00:00:39.050> danger<00:00:39.290> you<00:00:39.649> can<00:00:39.829> take<00:00:40.010> your<00:00:40.190> time

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
there's no danger you can take your time

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.880 
there's no danger you can take your time
basically<00:00:41.030> just<00:00:41.420> a<00:00:41.690> couple<00:00:42.559> of<00:00:42.620> things<00:00:42.710> to

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
basically just a couple of things to

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.430 
basically just a couple of things to
focus<00:00:43.070> on<00:00:43.309> keep<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:43.730> nose<00:00:43.940> up<00:00:44.239> and<00:00:44.510> decelerate

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
focus on keep the nose up and decelerate

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.479 
focus on keep the nose up and decelerate
slowly<00:00:46.010> use<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:47.769> accelerate<00:00:48.769> button<00:00:49.129> if<00:00:49.309> you

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
slowly use the accelerate button if you

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:50.439 
slowly use the accelerate button if you
should<00:00:49.640> feel<00:00:49.730> like<00:00:49.820> you're<00:00:49.940> going<00:00:50.059> down<00:00:50.300> too

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
should feel like you're going down too

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.210 
should feel like you're going down too
fast<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:51.050> just<00:00:51.230> set<00:00:51.470> it<00:00:51.589> down<00:00:51.620> nice<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:51.980> easy

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
fast and just set it down nice and easy

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.220 
fast and just set it down nice and easy
the<00:00:52.850> biggest<00:00:53.150> thing<00:00:53.269> to<00:00:53.300> focus<00:00:53.510> on<00:00:53.870> here<00:00:54.170> is

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
the biggest thing to focus on here is

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.770 
the biggest thing to focus on here is
keeping<00:00:54.949> it<00:00:55.070> level<00:00:55.400> if<00:00:56.089> you're<00:00:56.329> tilted<00:00:56.659> one

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
keeping it level if you're tilted one

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.090 
keeping it level if you're tilted one
way<00:00:56.989> or<00:00:57.110> the<00:00:57.199> other<00:00:57.230> it's<00:00:57.530> going<00:00:57.650> to<00:00:57.739> be<00:00:57.829> real

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
way or the other it's going to be real

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.579 
way or the other it's going to be real
easy<00:00:58.129> to<00:00:58.489> flip<00:00:59.089> the<00:00:59.210> helicopter<00:00:59.750> this<00:01:00.379> one

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
easy to flip the helicopter this one

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.020 
easy to flip the helicopter this one
comes<00:01:00.800> in<00:01:00.890> a<00:01:00.949> little<00:01:01.250> bit<00:01:01.370> faster<00:01:01.790> but<00:01:01.939> it's

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
comes in a little bit faster but it's

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.450 
comes in a little bit faster but it's
still<00:01:02.239> relatively<00:01:02.780> slow<00:01:03.379> I'll<00:01:03.860> even<00:01:04.129> hop<00:01:04.280> out

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
still relatively slow I'll even hop out

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.130 
still relatively slow I'll even hop out
for<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.729> second<00:01:05.119> so<00:01:05.239> you<00:01:05.330> can<00:01:05.420> see<00:01:05.540> that<00:01:06.020> the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
for a second so you can see that the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.929 
for a second so you can see that the
helicopters<00:01:06.740> will<00:01:07.070> you<00:01:07.250> stopped<00:01:07.549> in<00:01:07.790> just

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
helicopters will you stopped in just

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.000 
helicopters will you stopped in just
chilling<00:01:08.330> you<00:01:09.020> see<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:09.200> bounced<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.680> little<00:01:09.710> bit

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
chilling you see I bounced a little bit

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.660 
chilling you see I bounced a little bit
there<00:01:10.250> but<00:01:10.280> again<00:01:11.090> just<00:01:11.600> focus<00:01:11.930> on<00:01:12.080> keeping<00:01:12.350> it

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
there but again just focus on keeping it

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.270 
there but again just focus on keeping it
level<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:15.140> nose<00:01:15.350> up<00:01:15.710> if<00:01:15.950> you<00:01:16.070> start

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
level and the nose up if you start

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.070 
level and the nose up if you start
pointing<00:01:16.460> that<00:01:16.670> nose<00:01:16.909> down<00:01:17.180> or<00:01:17.540> you<00:01:17.659> come<00:01:17.930> in

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
pointing that nose down or you come in

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.870 
pointing that nose down or you come in
too<00:01:18.229> quickly<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:18.979> you're<00:01:19.280> rolling<00:01:19.490> a<00:01:19.759> little

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
too quickly and you're rolling a little

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.640 
too quickly and you're rolling a little
bit<00:01:20.150> you're<00:01:20.720> going<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:20.900> flip<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.380> blow<00:01:21.560> if

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
bit you're going to flip and blow if

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.670 
bit you're going to flip and blow if
they<00:01:21.740> look<00:01:21.950> after<00:01:22.070> real<00:01:22.400> quick

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.130 

now<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.610> same<00:01:28.790> basic<00:01:29.150> rules<00:01:29.390> apply<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.840> the

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
now the same basic rules apply to the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.470 
now the same basic rules apply to the
combat<00:01:30.530> landings<00:01:31.130> it's<00:01:31.640> just<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.030> stakes<00:01:32.300> are

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
combat landings it's just the stakes are

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.020 
combat landings it's just the stakes are
much<00:01:32.510> higher<00:01:33.010> you'll<00:01:34.010> see<00:01:34.280> here<00:01:34.580> I<00:01:34.610> come<00:01:34.880> in

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
much higher you'll see here I come in

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.170 
much higher you'll see here I come in
real<00:01:35.300> fast<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.200> helicopter<00:01:36.970> takes<00:01:37.970> a

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
real fast and the helicopter takes a

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.260 
real fast and the helicopter takes a
little<00:01:38.450> bit<00:01:38.540> of<00:01:38.630> a<00:01:38.690> hop<00:01:38.930> as<00:01:39.200> it<00:01:39.350> goes<00:01:39.560> forward

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
little bit of a hop as it goes forward

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.760 
little bit of a hop as it goes forward
you<00:01:41.270> do<00:01:41.480> want<00:01:41.690> to<00:01:41.720> remember<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.230> come<00:01:42.470> in<00:01:42.620> and

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
you do want to remember to come in and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.100 
you do want to remember to come in and
not<00:01:42.860> sit<00:01:43.130> down<00:01:43.160> too<00:01:43.670> rough<00:01:44.000> again<00:01:44.720> you<00:01:44.870> come

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
not sit down too rough again you come

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.660 
not sit down too rough again you come
down<00:01:45.350> with<00:01:45.380> too<00:01:45.740> much<00:01:45.920> speed<00:01:46.250> towards<00:01:46.580> the

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
down with too much speed towards the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.970 
down with too much speed towards the
ground<00:01:46.910> and<00:01:47.150> it'll<00:01:47.480> blow<00:01:47.690> up<00:01:47.810> quickly<00:01:48.110> but<00:01:48.710> the

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
ground and it'll blow up quickly but the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.860 
ground and it'll blow up quickly but the
most<00:01:49.250> important<00:01:49.820> thing<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.240> remember<00:01:50.360> for<00:01:50.840> a

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
most important thing to remember for a

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.930 
most important thing to remember for a
combat<00:01:51.350> landing<00:01:51.830> is<00:01:52.010> not<00:01:52.550> to<00:01:52.760> have<00:01:52.880> the

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
combat landing is not to have the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.300 
combat landing is not to have the
helicopter<00:01:53.210> angled<00:01:54.110> or<00:01:54.260> turned<00:01:54.620> in<00:01:54.830> any<00:01:55.040> sort

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
helicopter angled or turned in any sort

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.040 
helicopter angled or turned in any sort
of<00:01:55.370> direction<00:01:55.550> because<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.390> is<00:01:56.570> going<00:01:56.900> to

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
of direction because it is going to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.110 
of direction because it is going to
slide<00:01:57.380> forward<00:01:57.410> and<00:01:58.100> probably<00:01:58.490> bounce<00:01:58.760> if

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
slide forward and probably bounce if

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.030 
slide forward and probably bounce if
it's<00:01:59.720> going<00:01:59.930> in<00:02:00.080> a<00:02:00.140> straight<00:02:00.200> line<00:02:00.680> with<00:02:01.010> the

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
it's going in a straight line with the

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.790 
it's going in a straight line with the
nose<00:02:01.310> ahead<00:02:01.610> of<00:02:01.730> you<00:02:01.910> you'll<00:02:02.360> be<00:02:02.480> fine<00:02:02.780> if<00:02:03.530> it's

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
nose ahead of you you'll be fine if it's

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.230 
nose ahead of you you'll be fine if it's
turned<00:02:04.010> in<00:02:04.220> any<00:02:04.340> sort<00:02:04.610> of<00:02:04.670> way<00:02:04.730> it's<00:02:05.120> gonna

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
turned in any sort of way it's gonna

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.570 
turned in any sort of way it's gonna
flip<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:05.840> you're<00:02:05.960> gonna<00:02:06.080> die<00:02:06.320> or<00:02:06.860> at<00:02:07.370> least

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
flip and you're gonna die or at least

flip and you're gonna die or at least
hop<00:02:07.790> out<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.510> helicopter<00:02:08.960> gonna<00:02:09.110> be

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
hop out and the helicopter gonna be

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.170 
hop out and the helicopter gonna be
blown<00:02:09.380> up<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.830> you'll<00:02:10.130> be<00:02:10.160> stranded<00:02:10.490> now

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
blown up and you'll be stranded now

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.400 
blown up and you'll be stranded now
right<00:02:11.360> there's<00:02:11.600> one<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:11.810> my<00:02:11.870> favorite<00:02:12.200> moves

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
right there's one of my favorite moves

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.990 
right there's one of my favorite moves
is<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.710> hop<00:02:12.830> out<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.070> heal<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.550> even<00:02:13.790> if<00:02:13.880> you're

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
is to hop out and heal it even if you're

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.270 
is to hop out and heal it even if you're
outside<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.810> safe<00:02:15.380> zone<00:02:15.410> you've<00:02:15.920> got<00:02:16.070> ten

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
outside of the safe zone you've got ten

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.670 
outside of the safe zone you've got ten
seconds<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:16.790> might<00:02:16.940> as<00:02:17.000> well<00:02:17.060> use<00:02:17.360> them<00:02:17.560> we<00:02:18.560> do

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
seconds you might as well use them we do

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.410 
seconds you might as well use them we do
one<00:02:18.890> more<00:02:19.040> here<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.340> stay<00:02:19.610> in<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.850> helicopter

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
one more here I stay in the helicopter

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.870 
one more here I stay in the helicopter
you<00:02:20.630> can<00:02:20.660> see<00:02:21.020> that<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.830> is<00:02:21.980> safe<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.490> can<00:02:22.670> pull

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
you can see that it is safe you can pull

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.520 
you can see that it is safe you can pull
it<00:02:22.970> off<00:02:23.060> without<00:02:23.240> much<00:02:23.570> of<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.750> problem<00:02:23.780> you've

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
it off without much of a problem you've

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.880 
it off without much of a problem you've
got<00:02:24.770> to<00:02:24.920> keep<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.220> nose<00:02:25.430> pointed<00:02:25.880> forward<00:02:26.240> I

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
got to keep that nose pointed forward I

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.310 
got to keep that nose pointed forward I
do<00:02:27.890> not<00:02:28.160> recommend<00:02:28.520> this<00:02:28.930> but<00:02:29.930> if<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:30.200> helps

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
do not recommend this but if it helps

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.050 
do not recommend this but if it helps
you<00:02:30.590> starting<00:02:31.160> out<00:02:31.280> get<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.460> feel<00:02:31.550> for<00:02:31.940> the

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
you starting out get a feel for the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.820 
you starting out get a feel for the
landing<00:02:32.480> switch<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.870> an<00:02:32.930> outside<00:02:33.290> view<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:33.770> you

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
landing switch to an outside view so you

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.050 
landing switch to an outside view so you
can<00:02:33.980> get<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.160> better<00:02:34.310> look<00:02:34.459> at<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.850> whole

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
can get a better look at the whole

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.870 
can get a better look at the whole
helicopter<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:35.870> what's<00:02:36.050> going<00:02:36.350> on<00:02:36.500> there

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
helicopter and what's going on there

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.460 
helicopter and what's going on there
you<00:02:38.180> need<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.510> practice<00:02:38.690> inside<00:02:39.260> though

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
you need to practice inside though

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.479 
you need to practice inside though
because<00:02:39.680> eventually<00:02:39.920> that's<00:02:40.250> what<00:02:40.370> you'll

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
because eventually that's what you'll

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.850 
because eventually that's what you'll
need<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.760> do<00:02:40.910> more<00:02:41.900> importantly<00:02:42.320> I<00:02:42.380> recommend

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
need to do more importantly I recommend

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.030 
need to do more importantly I recommend
a<00:02:42.920> repair<00:02:43.070> tool<00:02:44.170> with<00:02:45.170> an<00:02:45.320> engineering<00:02:45.770> class

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
a repair tool with an engineering class

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.560 
a repair tool with an engineering class
obviously<00:02:46.340> if<00:02:46.880> you're<00:02:47.030> going<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.209> be<00:02:47.270> doing<00:02:47.390> a

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
obviously if you're going to be doing a

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.960 
obviously if you're going to be doing a
lot<00:02:47.720> of<00:02:47.750> helicopter<00:02:48.350> piloting<00:02:48.860> it<00:02:49.640> becomes

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
lot of helicopter piloting it becomes

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.580 
lot of helicopter piloting it becomes
invaluable<00:02:50.300> while<00:02:50.840> you're<00:02:50.959> out<00:02:51.110> there<00:02:51.140> and

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
invaluable while you're out there and

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.800 
invaluable while you're out there and
can<00:02:51.770> fix<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.130> on<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.280> go<00:02:52.520> now<00:02:53.150> here<00:02:53.450> you'll<00:02:53.630> see

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
can fix it on the go now here you'll see

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.390 
can fix it on the go now here you'll see
we<00:02:53.989> get<00:02:54.110> hit<00:02:54.350> so<00:02:54.560> I'm<00:02:54.620> going<00:02:54.830> down<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.100> repair

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
we get hit so I'm going down to repair

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.190 
we get hit so I'm going down to repair
again<00:02:55.700> this<00:02:55.940> is<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.090> classic<00:02:56.270> example<00:02:57.020> I'm

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
again this is a classic example I'm

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.990 
again this is a classic example I'm
moving<00:02:57.530> sideways<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.459> doesn't<00:02:58.670> even<00:02:58.700> seem

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
moving sideways and it doesn't even seem

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.880 
moving sideways and it doesn't even seem
like<00:02:59.180> I'm<00:02:59.330> moving<00:02:59.480> sideways<00:03:00.050> that<00:03:00.260> much<00:03:00.560> but

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
like I'm moving sideways that much but

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.670 
like I'm moving sideways that much but
it<00:03:01.070> is<00:03:01.100> enough<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.850> flip<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.300> helicopter<00:03:02.989> once

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
it is enough to flip the helicopter once

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.890 
it is enough to flip the helicopter once
I<00:03:03.830> land<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:04.340> hop<00:03:04.489> out<00:03:04.700> that's<00:03:05.420> all<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.750> takes

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
I land and hop out that's all it takes

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.960 
I land and hop out that's all it takes
so<00:03:06.260> you've<00:03:06.410> got<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.860> keep<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.160> nose<00:03:07.400> pointed

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
so you've got to keep the nose pointed

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.310 
so you've got to keep the nose pointed
in<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.209> direction<00:03:08.239> your<00:03:08.780> helicopter<00:03:09.290> is

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
in the direction your helicopter is

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.130 
in the direction your helicopter is
moving<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.070> set<00:03:10.850> it<00:03:10.970> down<00:03:11.000> without<00:03:11.360> without<00:03:12.110> a

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
moving and set it down without without a

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.960 
moving and set it down without without a
lot<00:03:12.350> of<00:03:12.470> turning<00:03:12.830> or<00:03:12.950> lateral<00:03:13.370> movement<00:03:13.790> or

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
lot of turning or lateral movement or

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.050 
lot of turning or lateral movement or
you'll<00:03:14.090> wind<00:03:14.360> up<00:03:14.480> in<00:03:14.630> this<00:03:14.750> situation<00:03:14.810> here

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
you'll wind up in this situation here

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.100 
you'll wind up in this situation here
there<00:03:17.060> was<00:03:17.150> some<00:03:17.180> confusion<00:03:17.450> with<00:03:17.840> me<00:03:17.989> and

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
this random guy and I eventually bailed

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.640 
this random guy and I eventually bailed
and<00:03:19.790> said<00:03:19.970> I<00:03:20.060> was<00:03:20.180> out<00:03:20.300> of<00:03:20.330> there<00:03:20.540> then<00:03:21.290> I<00:03:21.320> saw

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
and said I was out of there then I saw

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.620 
and said I was out of there then I saw
my<00:03:21.860> teammate<00:03:22.280> my<00:03:22.820> squad<00:03:23.060> mate<00:03:23.300> it<00:03:23.420> just

helicopter<00:05:16.419> in<00:05:16.510> the<00:05:16.540> water<00:05:16.810> all<00:05:17.080> hope<00:05:17.290> is<00:05:17.440> not

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
helicopter in the water all hope is not

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.770 
helicopter in the water all hope is not
lost<00:05:17.620> if<00:05:18.070> there's<00:05:18.310> enough<00:05:18.580> health<00:05:19.240> in<00:05:19.450> it<00:05:19.570> left

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
lost if there's enough health in it left

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.720 
lost if there's enough health in it left
to<00:05:19.960> get<00:05:20.080> it<00:05:20.200> out<00:05:20.320> of<00:05:20.440> there<00:05:20.560> do<00:05:20.800> it<00:05:20.950> now<00:05:21.460> that

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
to get it out of there do it now that

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.670 
to get it out of there do it now that
being<00:05:21.940> said<00:05:22.000> be<00:05:22.419> careful<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:22.990> health<00:05:23.230> will<00:05:23.530> go

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
being said be careful the health will go

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.620 
being said be careful the health will go
down<00:05:23.950> once<00:05:24.310> it's<00:05:24.460> in<00:05:24.550> it<00:05:24.700> in<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:24.970> water<00:05:25.210> so<00:05:25.540> if

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
down once it's in it in the water so if

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.990 
down once it's in it in the water so if
it's<00:05:25.780> if<00:05:26.530> it's<00:05:26.620> already<00:05:26.830> about<00:05:27.040> blown<00:05:27.310> up<00:05:27.490> you

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
it's if it's already about blown up you

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.880 
it's if it's already about blown up you
need<00:05:28.120> to<00:05:28.180> be<00:05:28.300> aware<00:05:28.570> that<00:05:28.630> it<00:05:29.440> could<00:05:29.620> blow<00:05:29.770> up

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
need to be aware that it could blow up

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:30.980 
need to be aware that it could blow up
at<00:05:29.980> any<00:05:30.130> moment<00:05:30.250> of<00:05:30.520> that

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
at any moment of that

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:38.440 
at any moment of that
you

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.720 

now<00:05:39.170> jets<00:05:39.560> are<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:39.770> same<00:05:39.950> basic<00:05:40.280> principles

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
now jets are the same basic principles

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.150 
now jets are the same basic principles
as<00:05:40.850> the<00:05:40.970> helicopters<00:05:41.570> keep<00:05:42.380> the<00:05:42.500> nose<00:05:42.680> pointed

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
as the helicopters keep the nose pointed

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.130 
as the helicopters keep the nose pointed
up<00:05:43.340> and<00:05:43.520> forward<00:05:43.790> and<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:44.300> airspeed<00:05:44.660> load<00:05:44.960> and

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
up and forward and the airspeed load and

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.510 
up and forward and the airspeed load and
you<00:05:45.200> just<00:05:45.380> guide<00:05:45.530> it<00:05:45.740> in<00:05:45.860> for<00:05:46.100> a<00:05:46.130> nice<00:05:46.310> easy

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
you just guide it in for a nice easy

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.700 
you just guide it in for a nice easy
landing<00:05:47.120> I<00:05:47.300> will<00:05:47.900> say<00:05:48.140> I<00:05:48.170> think<00:05:48.440> it's<00:05:48.590> very

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
landing I will say I think it's very

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.320 
landing I will say I think it's very
important<00:05:49.190> the<00:05:49.280> Jets<00:05:49.550> to<00:05:49.640> focus<00:05:50.090> on<00:05:50.210> the

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
important the Jets to focus on the

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.790 
important the Jets to focus on the
airspeed<00:05:50.750> because<00:05:51.170> if<00:05:51.350> you're<00:05:51.470> going<00:05:51.650> too

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
airspeed because if you're going too

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.940 
airspeed because if you're going too
fast<00:05:52.040> you<00:05:52.280> can<00:05:52.400> crash<00:05:52.850> overshoot<00:05:53.570> the<00:05:53.690> runway

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
fast you can crash overshoot the runway

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.830 
fast you can crash overshoot the runway
or<00:05:54.950> land<00:05:55.700> but<00:05:55.940> not<00:05:56.090> give<00:05:56.270> yourself<00:05:56.330> enough<00:05:56.720> for

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
or land but not give yourself enough for

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.080 
or land but not give yourself enough for
them<00:05:56.930> to<00:05:56.990> take<00:05:57.200> off<00:05:57.350> again<00:05:57.650> I<00:05:57.920> like<00:05:58.640> to<00:05:58.790> get<00:05:58.910> low

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
them to take off again I like to get low

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.420 
them to take off again I like to get low
in<00:05:59.240> my<00:05:59.330> altitude<00:05:59.690> on<00:06:00.110> my<00:06:00.410> approach<00:06:00.770> and<00:06:01.100> then

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
in my altitude on my approach and then

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.720 
in my altitude on my approach and then
once<00:06:01.730> I'm<00:06:01.910> low<00:06:02.150> then<00:06:03.080> I<00:06:03.170> focus<00:06:03.560> on<00:06:03.740> reducing<00:06:04.370> my

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730 
once I'm low then I focus on reducing my

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.400 
once I'm low then I focus on reducing my
airspeed<00:06:05.210> you'll<00:06:05.750> actually<00:06:05.900> hear<00:06:06.260> your

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
airspeed you'll actually hear your

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.250 
airspeed you'll actually hear your
landing<00:06:06.860> gear<00:06:06.890> come<00:06:07.310> down<00:06:07.580> and<00:06:07.910> just<00:06:08.750> Coast<00:06:09.050> it

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
landing gear come down and just Coast it

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.050 
landing gear come down and just Coast it
in<00:06:09.350> after<00:06:09.620> that<00:06:09.830> don't<00:06:10.280> point<00:06:10.550> them<00:06:10.700> those<00:06:10.850> too

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
in after that don't point them those too

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.700 
in after that don't point them those too
far<00:06:11.300> down<00:06:11.480> once<00:06:11.840> you<00:06:11.900> get<00:06:12.050> close<00:06:12.350> you<00:06:12.380> might

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
far down once you get close you might

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.110 
far down once you get close you might
even<00:06:12.770> want<00:06:12.950> to<00:06:12.980> pull<00:06:13.160> back<00:06:13.190> a<00:06:13.370> little<00:06:13.520> bit<00:06:13.730> but

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
even want to pull back a little bit but

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.210 
even want to pull back a little bit but
it<00:06:14.780> stops<00:06:15.080> pretty<00:06:15.350> quick<00:06:15.590> once<00:06:15.770> you<00:06:15.920> set<00:06:16.130> it

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
it stops pretty quick once you set it

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.460 
it stops pretty quick once you set it
down<00:06:16.250> on<00:06:16.400> the<00:06:16.640> smooth<00:06:16.970> surface<00:06:17.420> and<00:06:17.660> that's<00:06:18.260> it

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
down on the smooth surface and that's it

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.250 
down on the smooth surface and that's it
if<00:06:19.160> you<00:06:19.250> need<00:06:19.430> repairs<00:06:19.730> hop<00:06:19.970> out<00:06:20.150> repair<00:06:20.510> night

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
if you need repairs hop out repair night

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.390 
if you need repairs hop out repair night
your<00:06:21.470> plane<00:06:21.680> do<00:06:21.800> whatever<00:06:21.920> you<00:06:22.100> want

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
hop back in if you've got enough room

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.960 
hop back in if you've got enough room
you<00:06:24.800> can<00:06:24.950> take<00:06:24.980> off<00:06:25.280> again<00:06:25.430> and<00:06:25.760> you're<00:06:25.850> good

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970 
you can take off again and you're good

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:32.429 
you can take off again and you're good
to<00:06:26.000> go

00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:32.439 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:33.929 

now<00:06:33.009> we're<00:06:33.159> going<00:06:33.249> to<00:06:33.309> watch<00:06:33.459> part<00:06:33.789> of<00:06:33.849> this

00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:33.939 
now we're going to watch part of this

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:35.489 
now we're going to watch part of this
clip<00:06:34.209> again<00:06:34.539> and<00:06:34.809> we're<00:06:35.019> going<00:06:35.169> to<00:06:35.229> bring<00:06:35.349> the

00:06:35.489 --> 00:06:35.499 
clip again and we're going to bring the

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:37.290 
clip again and we're going to bring the
in-game<00:06:35.800> audio<00:06:36.009> up<00:06:36.399> because<00:06:36.849> I<00:06:36.879> want<00:06:37.149> you<00:06:37.269> to

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
in-game audio up because I want you to

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.209 
in-game audio up because I want you to
be<00:06:37.449> able<00:06:37.539> to<00:06:37.719> hear<00:06:38.139> when<00:06:38.409> the<00:06:38.559> landing<00:06:38.979> gear

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:39.219 
be able to hear when the landing gear

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:41.070 
be able to hear when the landing gear
comes<00:06:39.489> down<00:06:39.819> you<00:06:40.119> need<00:06:40.209> to<00:06:40.330> be<00:06:40.449> listening<00:06:40.659> for

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
comes down you need to be listening for

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.389 
comes down you need to be listening for
this<00:06:41.199> as<00:06:41.349> you're<00:06:41.469> going<00:06:41.619> in<00:06:41.830> for<00:06:42.009> an<00:06:42.069> approach

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:42.399 
this as you're going in for an approach

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:44.459 
this as you're going in for an approach
to<00:06:42.999> make<00:06:43.179> sure<00:06:43.389> that<00:06:43.569> your<00:06:43.719> plane<00:06:43.959> is<00:06:44.139> ready<00:06:44.289> to

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:44.469 
to make sure that your plane is ready to

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:50.600 
to make sure that your plane is ready to
land<00:06:44.679> and<00:06:44.919> you're<00:06:45.009> not<00:06:45.159> going<00:06:45.399> too<00:06:45.550> fast

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.859 

it's<00:06:51.610> subtle<00:06:51.969> but<00:06:52.270> if<00:06:52.360> you<00:06:52.479> know<00:06:52.629> what<00:06:52.719> you're

00:06:52.859 --> 00:06:52.869 
it's subtle but if you know what you're

00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:54.209 
it's subtle but if you know what you're
listening<00:06:53.020> for<00:06:53.259> you'll<00:06:53.649> be<00:06:53.800> able<00:06:53.889> to<00:06:54.069> hear

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:54.219 
listening for you'll be able to hear

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:55.980 
listening for you'll be able to hear
that<00:06:54.279> in<00:06:54.610> game<00:06:54.939> and<00:06:55.270> it'll<00:06:55.479> be<00:06:55.599> a<00:06:55.629> little<00:06:55.869> extra

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
that in game and it'll be a little extra
