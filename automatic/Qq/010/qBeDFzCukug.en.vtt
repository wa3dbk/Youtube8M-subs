00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.340
 I hope it is very good today 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.500
 we are in a video about 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.020
 news for what is the new version 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.300
 that is going to come out the good the 0.8 points 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.890
 but which is the closest but 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.590
 a quick notice before starting the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.559
 video the 0 points 7.6 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.050
 to this day I think it's 14 of 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.629
 October for android already came out and for 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.730
 it is not gone, they have almost nothing 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.019
 of change only a few book fix as well 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.120
 that when you create it in your account 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.769
 when you're out of your account, you do not 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.010
 those of play or large crosses appear 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.079
 only that they have changed but good the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.100
 great is update we hope 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.809
 right now is 0.8 point zero and then here 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.260
 I bring you a few images about 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.110
 what will be 0.8 points 0 and then not 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.860
 I know tell me what is going on this way 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.690
 to make videos about news I am 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.979
 recording directly from my reel 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.289
 team, as you can see there, I'm going to 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.060
 show but it's an easier way more 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.380
 fast and more entertaining 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.840
 so let's start again as you can 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.460
 here this photo the tuti or jb is recent 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.920
 the cabaretera is still a few hours 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.020
 and as you can see, it's great that 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.840
 will see shades of wood that is the 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.550
 clear the dark good was normal the 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.280
 dark the clear and what is that of the 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.390
 jungle this is something incredible because this 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.820
 means that maybe there will be 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.530
 jungle and well it is obvious that there will be 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.270
 mule because if not how it would be achieved 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.729
 that material that is the way it is 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.890
 to the right or closer to 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.690
 let's say it like that and also like 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.399
 you can see there are a few sponges there 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.640
 how good the sponges do not work 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.310
 absolutely for nothing but word there 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.020
 are are ornaments and because what good 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.030
 have added it so good 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.770
 next image that I have here is 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.020
 pumpkins though they will be able to 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.690
 plant pumpkins is also tweeted 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.490
 jb and in fact in the tweet said that apart 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.019
 of pumpkins will also have cake 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.810
 of pumpkin which is also something 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:13.420
 amazing the pumpkin pie is this 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.310
 great because if that cake 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.560
 pumpkins would not serve anything less 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.090
 that they added in brothers because if not 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.730
 you know the pumpkins and you put them in the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.069
 head as an armor because it scares the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.220
 well that makes the brothers do not 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.320
 attack if they see you in the eye ok 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.790
 so good as you saw here in 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.040
 this picture pumpkins and pie 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.490
 pumpkin in the following image we have 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.600
 what is plantations now of 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.670
 carrots and potatoes 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.230
 I also loved that a lot because 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.600
 now we are going to have more ways to 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.580
 feed us I do not know if they remember the 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.930
 that will follow me on twitter of that 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.150
 image that twitter that said no to the 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.190
 animal slaughter eats bread cookies and 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.720
 I do not know how good because according to the animals 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.500
 they also suffer was just an image like that 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.090
 for it is a joke no and they told me 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.820
 two in they fought for us in nine 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.200
 craft and it is difficult then just to eat 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.780
 that is not animal things there are only 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.950
 bread and apples I think and I do not know what else 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.840
 but good as you can see now 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.670
 see a lot more things and then we're going to 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.190
 can take advantage of them to preserve 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.660
 Italians in you do not have to give here these 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.630
 images that are usually now are a 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.520
 little older as you can see there is 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.790
 is that the trunks will now be able to 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.980
 flip good nothing new nothing nothing very 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.020
 interesting but good we can not be 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.760
 help for the decoration that the 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.410
 next image is that now you will see 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.030
 3d clouds as you can see here in the 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.920
 image and 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.680
 Well, this does not fit much better 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.530
 and well you can see well how can 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.750
 see in the sheep ahead of the sheep and 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.670
 shadow and behind her on the back not 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.440
 there is so much shadow that is something that also 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.850
 they added that they are shadows now that 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.650
 now they see more detail how they are going to 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.400
 see in this image 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.900
 Oh sorry in this image you can see a 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.400
 little more detailed what are the 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.010
 shadows on the animals as you can see 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.680
 from the right side of the pig's pp 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.239
 of his things of let's say that if I am 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.400
 steve climbing the pig on my side 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.500
 right you see the shadow and it 's your 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.209
 head and in the back it looks more 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.370
 shinny that I guess out there is where 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.170
 is the sun and good finally this 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.780
 image or good as if the latter 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.420
 image that as you can see then now in 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.299
 the water will also look better from 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.539
 up is going to be more visible let's say it 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.340
 well and this well that's also good 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.160
 because it's not going to be that hard to do 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.870
 Well things in the water I do not lack 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.340

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.080
 jb which is also demonstrated in the 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.090
 shadows but good here as you can see 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.850
 and there are the shadows and because these are 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.500

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.709
 that incredible and then now the 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:07.779
 minecraft was going to be super full 

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:10.869
 only the only thing that we would lack would be 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:12.969
 the roes I believe and so in fact 

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:15.459
 comment that they want you to miss 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:16.509
 minecraft and already to be excellent 

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:18.610
 that is the comment that I want 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.959
 let's see what each one thinks and then 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.399
