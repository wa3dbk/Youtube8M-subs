 well guys and welcome to my channel 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.480
 in this special for the thousand members 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.069
 We're nobody's guys 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.830
 finally, I thank the subscribers 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.460
 very much because or to touch a year 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.910
 ago about 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.490
 and just from scratch because he was nobody 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.580
 in the end I didn't know anyone in 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.539
 this sector and we have grown we are the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.980
 fucking militants we are 1000 1000 verses 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.490
 1250 in fact I apologize a little bit in 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.050
 late and you guys keep it up 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.690
 sign up and I hope the goods here 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.880
 I like them in my children anyway 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.530
 or received in the guides of 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.210
 computer science etc. 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.790
 I apologize for the delay as already mentioned 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.510
 because as mentioned in the video of 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.090
 minecraft of which I leave the link 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.710
 this video is on my new gaming pc it is 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.030
 the smallest fact you send does not exist 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.640
 I had it so I couldn't 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.190
 invent them I wanted to show me mine 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.649
 configuration also because maybe 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.180
 someone has doubts or maybe he is not tactical 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.890
 me sector can get an idea 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.199
 let's say that even a video route up 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.630
 tips for buying the line of 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.720
 leave immediately with the kate which is a cooler 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:16.979
 master cm690 3 black then the black one 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.830
 we have these panels in front of us 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.560
 square disassemble for the 12 of readers 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.189
 of tabs the power button is more 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.000
 above and here this whole panel 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:32.579
 we have usb 3.0 we go 22 jack 2 usb 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.829
 2.0 the power button the button 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.670
 reset and of course the led when the 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.780
 pc turned on very comfortable this hi 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.180
 this space for usb sticks 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.360
 we are naturally for water and and 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.790
 connect them product 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.580
 around behind married we find ourselves the 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.900
 panel that does not have outside but the panel 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.970
 pierced and what we raised afterwards 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.610
 that we show it by passing behind 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:02.920
 struggling Motherboard 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:05.710
 we have two p2 principals for tasks yesterday 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:13.060
 but old use let's say a hold 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:15.670
 of v a vga a hdmi a 2 usb 2.0 4 well 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.590
 four usb 3.0 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.730
 the connector for the LAN cable and between the jack 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.310
 back to hell 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.070
 we can see in the bottom a 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:35.650
 power supply always from master gee cooler 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:39.040
 750m by 750 watts an asus z motherboard 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:43.209
 97 indent k with possibility of 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:50.110
 overclock and the processor that is an inter 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:52.750
 core i7 47 90 kg sun quad core but with 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:58.420
 hyper threading to get to 8 cores 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:01.660
 virtual 4.0 gb but up to 4.4 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.150
 because there is the turbo boost and 8 megs of 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.660
 level 3 cache memory a processor 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.440
 very fast we say on the gamma touch two 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.160
 banks of ram 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.489
 then I mounted 4GB each 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.769
 speed of 2,400 megahertz eyes eyes 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.390
 they seem a bit disproportionate let's say a 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.370
 Despite to the video card processor 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.620
 which I will show you but it is simply 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.230
 version of time very soon I will assemble 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.489
 two other equal banks so it seems 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.549
 2,400 mag 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.880
 I will get 16 gigabytes of ram moving more 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.970
 low vote 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.790
 how to see the video card that is the 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:43.670
 strong piece according to mario of this of 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:47.090
 this pc is a safire r 92 93 hicks 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.400
 then the basic model ed. 92 90 with 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.160
 safire cooling system that is 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.020
 composed of these iron sheets for 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.490
 dissipate from these three fans than after 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.330
 the maximum I will show you why I am 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:04.250
 under 4GB of dedicated memory 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:07.360
 of course ddr5 and it really is one 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.210
 video card such beast I 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:15.040
 opened the pc was done 64 graphics over 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:18.400
 but as a segment that is a type package 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.100
 ok now to move to the hard disk 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:28.400
 then he mounted a 1 hard drive 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:30.050
 gigabytes that mike was sorry about 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.680
 which is installed west and operational 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.530
 etc 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.770
 the old old hard disk also a 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.630
 couple of years of 500 gigabytes on 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.460
 handcuffs of videos to convert the 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.560
 starlets here 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:47.060
 later I will mount a solid disc a 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.470
 ssd of the samsung to 250 gigabytes because 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.450
 I really saw you recommend it is 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:56.150
 really fast a via system bomb 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:59.030
 operating in tenth really of of 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.320
 compared to the normal disk and you have to do 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:07.520
 see now took them in the dark 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:14.090
 in fact the r 92 90 has two entrances two 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:15.290
 outputs of a nappi is a befall 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.620
 naturally then behind we find the 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.720
 power off button I would do 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.729
 see the panel that is the 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:30.889
 side panel we had to have 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:34.729
 it is worth to open the pc this is ok here 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:37.610
 effect is another thing to do this pc 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.620
 meanwhile there is very little plastic 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.479
 so heat is really good 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:46.370
 we have a 200 mm fan here 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.259
 already immediately on the processor area 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:53.499
 pil card and therefore it is very much 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:56.089
 functional below we have another 

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:58.129
 another fan this time however with 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:59.809
 in fact these are the dust filter 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.699
 nibs here serve a reality of the pci la 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:04.360
 ground but where can aspire vendola 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:07.309
 to this thread party that can be taken off 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.020
 it can be cleaned and really something 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:11.240
 useful in fact concerns the dust remains 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.949
 especially useful here attached 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.779
 because we know very well that in 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:18.409
 fans always remains a lot of 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:21.499
 dust that here is what we are after 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:23.419
 after precisely slowing down there is no favors 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:24.979
 the dissipation I show to this 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:28.430
 point of the three fans of my 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:30.800
 safire that if you take it up, advice 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.870
 very large English because they are 31 cm 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.490
 of video card and I have to admit that 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.330
 but these three yellow and black fans 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:41.330
 year we also go aesthetics not not 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.039
 and kids that for that 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.520
 video is everything before doing tests 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:49.149
 carli 9 the pug of the hard disk 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.050
 hard disk notches because I don't have a 

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:54.229
 classic hard drives that go to the sites in 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:58.300
 this way here but they are side with a 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:07:03.319
 yes, with all the carts they come off 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:07.089
 supports 5 karieva 2.5 inches then ad 

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:11.029
 example of solid hard drives and so on and 

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:13.399
 three 3.5 hard drives I also show 

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:15.229
 that you do not need a victim just open it e 

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:18.319
 then close it and then we can 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:21.439
 simply of century entered therefore not 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:23.770
 they don't even need you guys 

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:26.400
 This video is all about 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.870
 liked commented sign up 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.280
 configurations you have, etc. 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:33.360
 I recommend sign up for the next one 

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.360
 video hi guys
