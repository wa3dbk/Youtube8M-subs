 the coca cola formula stored at seven 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.200
 keys but surveys indicate that some 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.890
 substances of the polenta drink is to provoke 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.900
 cancer 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.599
 furthermore, failures in the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.949
 may have caused damage to the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.940
 irreversible in those who consumed the drink 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.990
 13 years ago 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.570
 walking is difficult to work impossible to 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.390
 Poison poisoning from rat leaves 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.380
 definitive sequelae the muscles of 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.329
 Wilson suffers in spasms at all times 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.250
 I have involuntary movements not 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.190
 I know the time I fall forward or 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:44.610
 behind what happened already having several 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:47.280
 Sometimes on the street some he tries to hold 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.910
 is excited about talking about the moment in 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.309
 who had esophagus mouth and stomach 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:57.899
 burned for putting on glue 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:02.100
 through the help of three friends four 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.930
 Colleagues, I'm not going to cry, I'm not going, and mine. 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.840
 lawyer who did not abandon me 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.020
 wilson bought a six-pack x 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.760
 he could not take a sip of 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.390
 so corrosive it was just coming down 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.820
 half the gulp the other half the spit and already 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.500
 feels a taste of blood in here 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.330
 I communicated with the company the company did not 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.189
 gave me medical help I looked for a 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.320
 doctor and gave me the diagnosis that I 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.659
 I had that moment 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.579
 an exogenous intoxication 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.770
 the following day an employee of the 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.810
 Coca-Cola was at his house and took 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.119
 two bottles that the company says 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.579
 others were destroyed 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.750
 sent to justice but he kept 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.860
 here is the most shocking proof of 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.920
 contamination 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.329
 here inside this bottle he keeps 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.689
 very carefully even with padlock 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:57.390
 here is a mouse table 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.030
 thick hair appears soon after 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.570
 At first glance it is difficult to identify the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.840
 volume but just turn the packaging 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.110
 and the outline becomes clear ears and 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.080
 the possibility of a violation of the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.610
 packaging has been discarded by 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.210
 the report of the research institute 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.460
 technology leaves no doubt sealing 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.220
 industrial intact 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.620
 Wilson says he has never received support from 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:32.880
 company wants mitu collar in 1st place 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:36.810
 the action is not, it's not what's for 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.510
 do to the self I was never a citizen who 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.620
 be billionaire I want my life 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.900
 return 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.630
 the public prosecutor tried to close the 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.550
 where the bottles will leave but the 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.070
 Justice did not accept 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.680
 already the wilson process against coca 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.500
 cola has no decision yet 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.540
 the failures in the industrial process 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.570
 as much as the effects of 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.980
 of the beverage was detected a quantity 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:08.730
 exaggerated caramel dye in the unit 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.640
 4 methylbenzophenone which is the remedy that 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.150
 the support that gives color and also gives flavor 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.459
 for drinks 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.989
 this product more quantity has already been 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.900
 has already been considered as 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.700
 potentially carcinogenic or caramel 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.040
 for example used to give this 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.680
 coloration related to cancer of 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.080
 esophageal lung and blood 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.269
 we Brazilians have one more reason 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.260
 for concern is that the same 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:40.769
 soda sold here has 67 times 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.989
 more caramel 4 the coke sold in the 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.000
 california in the united states 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.430
 there reduction of the carcinogenic substance 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.980
 was imposed by law 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.959
 consequence of the center's research by the 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.810
 science of public interest 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.269
 director michael jackson explains that the 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.670
 dye should be removed by the 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:03.600
 theft as it represents an important 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.630
 threat to health that the troikas hideraldo 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.700
 better here the little letters 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.910
 the presence of the substance in the 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.110
 formula 1 but lack information 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.790
 important for the consumer 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.790
 should at least be informed to the 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.370
 the amount of caramel 4 and 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.580
 is some kind of alert regarding the 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.610
 risk to the health of someone developing 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.389
 loop if the amount is exceeding the 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.669
 limit but it sure is if out there 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:35.150
 there are products with less quantity 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.680
 here in brazil it should be is produced 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.650
 in smaller quantity also 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.710
 coca cola from brazil reported that the use 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.870
 of caramel dye 4 follows criteria 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.639
 defined by the national agency anvisa 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.520
 health surveillance and that the 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.469
 quantity does not indicate a health risk 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.750
 the case of the consumer Wilson 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:55.639
 company says it respects the deadlines 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.340
 determined by justice and that the 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.900
 manufacturing process follows strict 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.900
 quality standard procedures
