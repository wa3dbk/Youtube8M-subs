00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
that that ballet so beautiful and the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.030 
that that ballet so beautiful and the
story<00:02:28.040> is

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
story is

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.390 
story is
it's<00:02:30.489> very<00:02:30.700> touching<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.709> romantic

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
it's very touching and it's a romantic

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.140 
it's very touching and it's a romantic
Valley<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.209> guess<00:02:34.629> I<00:02:34.840> would<00:02:36.090> kind<00:02:37.090> of

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
Valley and I guess I would kind of

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.449 
Valley and I guess I would kind of
classify<00:02:37.659> myself<00:02:37.870> as<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.200> romantic<00:02:38.769> dancer<00:02:39.220> I

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
classify myself as a romantic dancer I

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.699 
classify myself as a romantic dancer I
really<00:02:39.970> don't<00:02:40.209> like<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.659> word<00:02:40.840> perfect<00:02:41.439> or

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
really don't like the word perfect or

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.809 
really don't like the word perfect or
perfection<00:02:42.510> because<00:02:44.189> I've<00:02:45.189> always<00:02:45.730> been

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
perfection because I've always been

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.860 
perfection because I've always been
coached<00:02:46.269> with<00:02:46.709> doing<00:02:47.709> things<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.629> people

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
coached with doing things and and people

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.360

perfect<00:02:51.849> but<00:02:52.120> truly<00:02:52.840> perfection<00:02:53.620> is<00:02:53.860> death<00:02:54.159> of

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
perfect but truly perfection is death of

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.860 
perfect but truly perfection is death of
a<00:02:54.640> dancer<00:02:55.060> because<00:02:55.180> if<00:02:55.360> you're<00:02:55.510> perfect

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870
