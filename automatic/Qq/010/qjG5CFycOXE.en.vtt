00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.520
 Hi, guys, I'm going to talk a little 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.160
 of the ultimate team market and a little 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.680
 some tips for trade hoop on 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.330
 what to buy and more 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.280
 the first good thing to tell you that I have 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.280
 had very very bad luck in the envelopes 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.860
 and the best that touched me but afellay 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.560
 so nothing the truth that I could not 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.450
 take out a lot of money either the gifts 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.890
 of the day they have given me money only in one 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.780
 account that sends a thousand coins and what 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.550
 other mini silver envelopes of these 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.430
 four items that a player had and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.050
 also bad so nothing could get out 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.210
 very little money but good is going to try 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.559
 give you some tips from my 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.180
 humble experience that does not mean 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.840
 that is the best but good if they serve you 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.560
 so go ahead first if you have a 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.360
 pretty good player that you think that 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.010
 now it is undervalued with respect to the year 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.950
 happened especially if it has more or less 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.600
 the same statistics and so on 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.489
 sure it's going to go up and go 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.430
 stabilize last year's price at 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.680
 so if you think you can get him 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.719
 enough money I recommend you wait 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.729
 at least until the season 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.530
 ticket that comes out tomorrow that already when 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.720
 people start to make their teams 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.119
 the market price will go up Be 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.890
 note that now everyone is 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.500
 is selling very cheap to get 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.890
 coins are practically giving away 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.299
 some players that are going to be 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:26.360
 quite expensive so more than selling you 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.820
 I recommend buying 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.300
 especially as I say these players that 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.700
 can be for 300 coins 350 are 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.900
 practically given and then 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.570
 many of them are going to go up a lot 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.050
 so nothing then that if you have some 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.570
 good player look to see what makes up for you 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.870
 If you want good, you can sell it if you already 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.840
 it is a more or less good price but not 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.360
 if you do not mind losing coins some 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.930
 coins to buy other players and 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.820
 but if it is normal to go to 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.410
 pretty much raise the price so good 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.330
 I recommend that you wait a bit 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.190
 at least tomorrow or the days 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.700
 following or even the game's exit 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.800
 if he 's a pretty good player for 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.210
 to really take everything out all the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.470
 possible benefit on that player 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.420
 It's good as I tell you I have not had 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.190
 good luck the envelopes then no 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.350
 accumulate many coins but good with 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.970
 what with what I just understand 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.040
 some players and then I have discarded 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.470
 Some of these that you say are not 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.330
 I'm going to sell neither of coÃ±a so I 've 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.830
 fact has been buying some and I'm going 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.280
 to put some purchase options that 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.200
 I have done and personally I think that 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.200
 Well, I'll be able to get you a little 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.880
 profit in the future especially I 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.440
 bought silver as you see there that is not 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.460
 that is sold that in many cases 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.080
 they sell better than the others 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.690
 and well, some of the players 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.470
 who buy are these this campbell from 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.480
 the bbva league of betis and one extreme 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.760
 left that good has enough pace 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.930
 I think it's going to be expensive I bought it 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.780
 for nothing for 600 coins I think that 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.750
 less than two thousand and one will not cost 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.960
 and later 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.150
 this is from 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.250
 of the league forward I think if of the league 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.950
 go ahead and it is specifically the 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.260
 fastest forward in the league in front 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.080
 so well look forward with 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.940
 I looked at the rhythms and saw that this 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.980
 It was the fast bar and I bought him the shot 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.630
 because eyes this is another one that is going to be 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.890
 expensive for people who want to do 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:38.750
 a team in this league 850 coins and 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.750
 well, it's going to go up, I think it's pretty 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.940
 talking about forwards I also have in 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.280
 baku is a front of the series by 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.860
 I think it's also the fastest so 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.300
 less silver but I think gold 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.790
 there's also no insurance for quick of the 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.190
 b series are minor leagues I know but 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.010
 there are always enough people who also 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.910
 you make teams from these leagues 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.040
 so if you want 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.900
 if you want to become a team in this league 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.290
 They are going to buy the fastest forward 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.600
 and then, in this case, this was fulfilled 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.950
 by 900 and it's clearly going to come up with that 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.340
 rhythm 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.070
 another forward is ezequiel and it is in this 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.870
 case is the fastest of the police no longer 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.530
 It exists because here you have the 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.260
 pace 91 although he has better shot but the 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.410
 pace now the fastest is this with 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:35.130
 rhythm 92 and well I bought it too 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:38.580
 baratillo for a thousand coins and then also 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:42.210
 I hope I can take advantage of another 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.540
 player of the bbv league to that perhaps the 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.790
 last year this player was on the 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.220
 four thousand five thousand coins more than 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.830
 nothing because it has enough pace and good 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.010
 defense to have a midfielder and 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.570
 Well now down a little rhythm 82 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.889
 but still it's still pretty good 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.930
 the statistics as you see are very 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.380
 close to 70 all 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:08.280
 so it 's training four new 12 you 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.849
 bought for 800 coins and I think of 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.610
 3000 this player will not go down 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.860
 and then with a classic brazil watch 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.709
 central defender also this year not 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.409
 I was not the one who was another of the 

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:24.679
 central classics of brazil so 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:29.370
 for Brazilian teams you see this 

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:32.220
 player goes tab to the fixed defense 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.570
 rhythm 80 as you see defense 72 has more 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.180
 and more or less the same statistics 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.330
 That the last year 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.729
 I bought it for 1200 and this is going to go 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.610
 going to go expensive is also worth at least three 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:47.639
 a thousand easy coins plus it 's a good 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.919
 defense for the for templates 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.770
 the league pro league is one of the fastest 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:55.440
 also so well I think it's a 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.150
 good investment and then well as 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.639
 I also had teams last year 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.789
 of the ml s the fifa 12 because I have caught 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:05.699
 to this one evans that before it was bronze now 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:08.880
 it's silver but hey it's a 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:13.650
 midfielder with very good rhythm 77 good 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:16.349
 defense decent shot 200 coins and 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:19.039
 This is going to rise too, I think because 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:22.050
 there are not many midfielders like that in the ms 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:24.030
 so nothing these are some of the 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.270
 players who buy but good are 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:30.060
 examples what good is also I have 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.699
 more players in my other account what 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.409
 I've done that, then, go to the same leagues 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.659
 not so well known 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:38.099
 and try to sign the same 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:41.029
 fastest defenses the midfielders 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:47.039
 faster the fastest forwards 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:50.249
 you can search for example the league bbva 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:54.300
 in the league forward there is also a lot 

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:56.339
 chicha to sign there because if I eat 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.919
 I say if someone is going to do about equipment 

00:06:56.339 --> 00:07:00.749
 of output what you are going to do is go to 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:03.059
 look for the defenses with greater pace or 

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:05.939
 the forwards with greater pace then 

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:08.849
 yes, good if you have them then 

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:11.189
 you can put expensive those those people 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:13.499
 have that kind of players 

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:16.200
 logically they will know what it has 

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:18.600
 and its price will go up 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.050
 so nothing is a piece of advice that I give you 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.919
 I believe that 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:26.889
 that can serve you and well I hope 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:29.259
 that is doing well in these jobs 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:31.509
 although the thing is difficult now as 

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:35.470
 I say I recommend you buy more than 

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:37.319
 sell and a little wait to see the ones that 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.509
 raise prices and others will follow later 

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:42.250
 you will think about selling do not have no 

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:44.830
 have a great hurry because total now 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.900
 not good if you have the season ticket 

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.639
 and tomorrow you will be able to be playing 

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.979
 ultimate team but good also tomorrow 

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:52.680
 prices are going to go up quite a bit so 

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:54.900
 good 

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.539
 nothing else is my advice guys I hope that 

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.949
 It's good to put things on 

00:07:57.539 --> 00:08:01.800
 comments from some players that 

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:03.509
 you have signed if you have signed bands 

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.570
 or whatever if you have now view 

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:10.460
 brought good benefits and nothing else 

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.460
 we see in following videos until later
