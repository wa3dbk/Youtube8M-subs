00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.060 

that's<00:01:43.820> basically<00:01:44.390> like<00:01:44.780> basically<00:01:45.770> that's

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
that's basically like basically that's

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.570

the<00:01:50.060> triggers<00:01:50.480> are<00:01:50.690> extremely<00:01:51.320> sensitive

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
the triggers are extremely sensitive

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.470 
the triggers are extremely sensitive
it's<00:01:51.920> just<00:01:52.070> like<00:01:52.190> you<00:01:52.310> barely<00:01:52.580> hit<00:01:52.970> that<00:01:53.210> and

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
it's just like you barely hit that and

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.000 
it's just like you barely hit that and
then<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:53.690> just<00:01:53.840> pull<00:01:54.110> down<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:54.290> little<00:01:54.860> bit

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
then you just pull down a little bit

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.220 
then you just pull down a little bit
more<00:01:55.220> and<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:55.670> start<00:01:55.850> shooting<00:01:56.300> so<00:01:56.570> instead

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
more and you start shooting so instead

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.040 
more and you start shooting so instead
of<00:01:57.350> shooting<00:01:57.710> down<00:01:57.950> here<00:01:58.580> you're<00:01:59.570> shooting

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
of shooting down here you're shooting

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.570 
of shooting down here you're shooting
like<00:02:00.320> right<00:02:00.800> here<00:02:01.160> so<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:01.430> can<00:02:01.460> just

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
like right here so you can just

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.050 
like right here so you can just
instantly<00:02:02.510> go<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:03.260> lot<00:02:03.470> faster<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:04.070> it<00:02:04.520> helps

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
instantly go a lot faster and it helps

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.859 
instantly go a lot faster and it helps
out<00:02:05.210> with<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.420> rapid-fire<00:02:05.930> capabilities

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
out with the rapid-fire capabilities

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.120 
out with the rapid-fire capabilities
since<00:02:08.869> this<00:02:09.050> controller<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.590> pretty<00:02:09.860> standard

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
since this controller is pretty standard

with sticks and buttons I'm not gonna

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.990 
with sticks and buttons I'm not gonna
really<00:02:11.990> be<00:02:12.140> focusing<00:02:12.560> on<00:02:12.710> that<00:02:12.920> what<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:13.610> really

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
really be focusing on that what I really

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.820 
really be focusing on that what I really
want<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.360> focus<00:02:14.480> on<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.170> triggers<00:02:15.530> and

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
want to focus on is the triggers and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.910 
want to focus on is the triggers and
their<00:02:16.550> rapid<00:02:16.910> fire<00:02:17.090> potential<00:02:17.680> as<00:02:18.680> you<00:02:18.770> can

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
their rapid fire potential as you can

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.070 
their rapid fire potential as you can
see<00:02:19.130> firing<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.640> pistol<00:02:19.820> and<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.330> mark<00:02:20.540> 14

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080

there's<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:22.040> lot<00:02:22.400> of<00:02:22.550> inconsistencies<00:02:22.910> and

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
there's a lot of inconsistencies and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.290 
there's a lot of inconsistencies and
it's<00:02:23.900> great<00:02:24.230> using<00:02:24.530> automatic<00:02:24.980> weapons<00:02:25.400> but

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
it's great using automatic weapons but

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.560 
it's great using automatic weapons but
most<00:02:26.870> of<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.110> time<00:02:27.350> your<00:02:27.620> single<00:02:27.980> shotguns

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
most of the time your single shotguns

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.700 
most of the time your single shotguns
won't<00:02:29.570> really<00:02:29.810> see<00:02:30.080> much<00:02:30.200> of<00:02:30.260> an<00:02:30.440> improvement

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
won't really see much of an improvement

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.860 
won't really see much of an improvement

burst<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.420> works<00:03:27.690> pretty<00:03:28.020> good<00:03:28.110> with<00:03:28.380> rapid

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
burst in it works pretty good with rapid

fire<00:03:28.830> I<00:03:29.510> will<00:03:30.510> definitely<00:03:30.990> say<00:03:31.230> this<00:03:31.440> that<00:03:31.709> the

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
fire I will definitely say this that the

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.699 
fire I will definitely say this that the
FPS<00:03:32.670> poachers<00:03:33.300> are<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.540> big<00:03:33.870> improvement<00:03:34.200> it's

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
FPS poachers are a big improvement it's

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:58.110 
FPS poachers are a big improvement it's
not<00:03:35.070> just<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.370> placebo

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.240 

the<00:03:59.120> man<00:03:59.330> cats<00:03:59.659> FPS<00:04:00.140> Pro<00:04:00.500> is<00:04:00.709> a<00:04:00.739> real<00:04:01.069> surprise

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
the man cats FPS Pro is a real surprise

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.089 
the man cats FPS Pro is a real surprise
it<00:04:02.150> may<00:04:02.390> be<00:04:02.450> a<00:04:02.569> $40<00:04:03.049> controller<00:04:03.560> but<00:04:03.860> it's<00:04:04.040> a

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
it may be a $40 controller but it's a

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.179 
it may be a $40 controller but it's a
very<00:04:04.340> great<00:04:04.730> design<00:04:05.120> controller<00:04:05.890> yeah<00:04:06.890> the

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
very great design controller yeah the

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:08.920 
very great design controller yeah the
view<00:04:07.340> map<00:04:07.610> opal<00:04:07.879> buttons<00:04:08.180> are<00:04:08.480> a<00:04:08.510> little<00:04:08.810> low

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
view map opal buttons are a little low

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.210 
view map opal buttons are a little low
profile<00:04:09.439> for<00:04:09.650> my<00:04:09.709> taste

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
profile for my taste

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.720 
profile for my taste
I<00:04:10.510> honestly<00:04:11.510> never<00:04:11.629> use<00:04:12.079> them<00:04:12.430> but<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.610> best

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
I honestly never use them but the best

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.270 
I honestly never use them but the best
part<00:04:14.000> is<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.329> hyper<00:04:14.629> sensitive<00:04:15.230> triggers<00:04:15.680> and

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
part is the hyper sensitive triggers and

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.949 
part is the hyper sensitive triggers and
it's<00:04:16.729> just<00:04:16.940> incredible<00:04:17.419> for<00:04:17.630> rapid<00:04:17.930> fire

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
it's just incredible for rapid fire

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.229 
it's just incredible for rapid fire
though<00:04:18.829> I<00:04:18.859> think<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.370> best<00:04:19.579> game<00:04:19.880> for<00:04:20.150> this

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
though I think the best game for this

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.719 
though I think the best game for this
controller<00:04:20.630> is<00:04:20.720> Ghost<00:04:21.169> Recon<00:04:21.289> it<00:04:22.250> gives<00:04:22.550> me

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
controller is Ghost Recon it gives me

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.850 
controller is Ghost Recon it gives me
the<00:04:22.850> perfect<00:04:23.120> trigger<00:04:23.479> control<00:04:23.750> and<00:04:24.260> it<00:04:24.680> lets

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
the perfect trigger control and it lets

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.460 
the perfect trigger control and it lets
me<00:04:25.010> fire<00:04:25.280> in<00:04:25.580> any<00:04:26.090> round<00:04:26.479> bursts<00:04:26.960> with<00:04:27.260> ease

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
me fire in any round bursts with ease

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.279 
me fire in any round bursts with ease
and<00:04:28.250> for<00:04:28.789> those<00:04:28.970> triggers<00:04:29.300> it's<00:04:29.510> really<00:04:29.990> great

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
and for those triggers it's really great

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:31.840 
and for those triggers it's really great
on<00:04:30.440> value<00:04:30.860> compared<00:04:31.310> to<00:04:31.370> a<00:04:31.550> regular

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
on value compared to a regular

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.029 
on value compared to a regular
controller<00:04:32.389> it's<00:04:33.260> not<00:04:33.440> like<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.710> old<00:04:33.860> days

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
controller it's not like the old days

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.070 
controller it's not like the old days
when<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.550> third-party<00:04:35.120> controller<00:04:35.570> is<00:04:35.780> crap

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
when the third-party controller is crap

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.040
