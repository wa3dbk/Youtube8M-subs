00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:24.739
 slightly turned APA 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.849

 Cadiroglu did not want to stand there and he tries it from a distance 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.260
 Kortmann would probably have had no chance 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.410
 Two minutes later it was time Pascal Kamolz leaves Bamberg goalkeeper 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.960

 Whit Monday offered Markus Fischer a goal in the 64th minute 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.430
 Sam Beierlein not really happy from Red and suddenly 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.260
 gives the so far one-sided game 69 minutes of play the equalizer 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.259

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.259

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.300
 Frank Lerch serves 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.630
 the FC now completely off the roll 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.140

 then Schweinfurt again in forward gear flank Conrad Gallus city 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:13.360

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.609
 but Kamolz header too weak 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:17.469
 another ten minutes 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:21.659
 who was waiting for annoying vile was disappointed the relief attack of the 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:22.540
 Bamberger 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.469
 Bäuerlein can defuse the first shot 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.639
 But he is also beaten 3 to 4 the final decision in the 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.639
 Championship race 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:34.950
 not yet 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.330
 because the FC struck back again Gallen Sterr with the 14 4 in the 89 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.330
 minute 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:45.639
 the injury time 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.709
 Schweinfurt was once again ahead 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.229
 but the ball 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:53.720
 passes the post 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.870
 it remains the 4 2 4 the direct resurgence missed 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.780
