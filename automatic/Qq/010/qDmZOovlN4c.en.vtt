thirdly<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.399> makes<00:01:59.700> breathing<00:01:59.939> much<00:02:00.270> easier

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
thirdly it makes breathing much easier

an important error to state would be

an important error to state would be
that<00:02:35.040> Daniels<00:02:35.400> breathing<00:02:35.790> technique<00:02:36.209> is

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
that Daniels breathing technique is

a simple error such as this causes a

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.979 
a simple error such as this causes a
massive<00:02:41.340> increase<00:02:41.519> in<00:02:41.760> resistance<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.750> slows

massive increase in resistance and slows

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.250 
massive increase in resistance and slows
him<00:02:43.230> down<00:02:43.260> greatly<00:02:43.769> as<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:45.090> can<00:02:45.239> see<00:02:45.450> his<00:02:46.019> head

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
him down greatly as you can see his head

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.199 
him down greatly as you can see his head
pops<00:02:46.560> up<00:02:46.739> slightly<00:02:47.069> just<00:02:47.400> before<00:02:47.760> he<00:02:47.910> breathes

pops up slightly just before he breathes
and<00:02:48.540> this<00:02:49.109> causes<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.769> rest<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.130> his<00:02:50.250> body<00:02:50.459> to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
and this causes the rest of his body to

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.210

here<00:02:55.620> forces<00:02:56.579> his<00:02:56.760> body<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.239> swim<00:02:57.480> in<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.720> way<00:02:57.870> of

this<00:03:01.500> is<00:03:01.650> evident<00:03:02.010> when<00:03:02.130> his<00:03:02.340> legs<00:03:02.609> and<00:03:02.849> hips

this is evident when his legs and hips
drop<00:03:03.569> below<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.989> water<00:03:04.200> every<00:03:04.620> time<00:03:04.799> he
