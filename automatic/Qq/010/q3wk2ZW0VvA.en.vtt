00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
this one it's got a long future to it I

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.190 
this one it's got a long future to it I
would<00:01:29.070> put<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.060> down<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.540> your<00:01:30.570> cellar<00:01:30.960> for

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
would put this down in your cellar for

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.469 
would put this down in your cellar for
at<00:01:31.259> least<00:01:31.500> five<00:01:31.890> years<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.790> maroney's<00:01:33.270> known

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
at least five years and maroney's known

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.440 
at least five years and maroney's known
for<00:01:33.750> its<00:01:33.900> great<00:01:34.110> aging<00:01:34.680> capacity<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.240> think

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
for its great aging capacity so I think
