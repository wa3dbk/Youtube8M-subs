00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:03.140
 for example the 400 meters and so 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.590
 the big favorite following the militias 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.459
 the entrance estimated balance m in the heart who had eyeshadow with 54 points 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.459
 but blame the sounds of a second place of this chrono 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.189
 as for the previous one so the elaboration of the alliance list is 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:19.980
 the biggest father 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.000
 but it was still Olympic champion either but in principle when 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.600
 even to the cidadela that 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.980
 I think she showed us to hall number 5 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.939
 what to bring in the united states gold medal but be careful because 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.750
 you're right with the Jamaican but it's level 40 but there 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.320
 it still misses benchmarks up to 10 people between their number 6 ago 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.930
 always danger 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.420
 in the American note so close to the goal and amassed 2 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.120
 Highway 117 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.910
 exactly like 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.910
 other government casting official 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.130
 the ailing wallowed as a whole 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.120
 in Switzerland the fnac 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.210
 Friday at the end of the session down always together 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.300
 assaf ramon old players on the outside with his riffs the 10th and 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.770
 primary 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.770
 ahmed al-sharif the a9 the party 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.700
 oracle beat a closet 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 speech at the last stage 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.400
 she prepared well and made me lie because I did not see 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.000
 that I did not see this level bédié 52 60 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.470
 world's best performance 6 that had shed the blood of the clau 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.460
 she had left at 54 points behind it's far 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.020
 I do not see how self-evident 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.270
 this is going to dance dancing but the grind that is really still there 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.159
 in major events with 50 95 52 42 personal record boats 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.069
 this weekend the alliance 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.199
 it's the tenth year 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.559
 which is far from being a stab 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:25.099
 Switzerland if this 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.159
 it's simple 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.659
 it was played a little bit between 9 and 10 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.459
 are you going to attack pretty much better but the routers that 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.969
 the week its tenth year and then inevitably after on the dish this is the 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.419
 release the obstacle course debt all given we could 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:39.319
 learn to count 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.169
 launching his stride is called to be vigilant
