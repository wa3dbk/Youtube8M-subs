00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.540
 so 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.690
 the next morning screed threshold 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.250
 clipped almost on the inner plane 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.950
 plane doorway 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.490
 there will be an expansion joint too 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.029
 will be thick so let it be 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:26.730
 so cleared the screed on the beacons then 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.279
 T-shirts tore and cleared shoals further 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.210
 which appeared I will tell just a little 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.460
 skin then here was such an attack 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.770
 the solution pressed down the damper tape and 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.260
 practically began to rest against the wall I 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.500
 along the slit cut through to the damper 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.710
 ribbons that is saved here too 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.870
 the expansion joint here was an attack to 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.270
 but the screed did not crush the information 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.460
 the tape here 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.140
 brush off either liquid 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.270
 foam don't know what it is 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.699
 took one canister on trial either 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.410
 foam then cut off at 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.410
 netting on tile adhesive 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:11.100
 such udary also foaming such 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:15.090
 foams are such and such, too, for 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.340
 penis and all four corners ok here 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.140
 here are these level 2 those two corners on 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.890
 millimeter lifted i.e. limits 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.380
 norms more than here sag chic 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.070
 if you apply a two-meter meter 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.680
 deflection rule whose millimeter is in the middle 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:36.079
 here the largest deflection is 5 millimeters 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.060
 that is what I am about in preparation 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.549
 I suspected that it happened 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.979
 somewhere either emptiness was either sand 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.530
 spree was put more final here 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.780
 lighthouses were built on the edge of the sheet can 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.329
 be this leaf edge hung in general 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.610
 It turned out that the middle of May to 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:58.130
 bent me half a mile to the floor 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:01.860
 a centimeter by 5 millimeters let's say 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.719
 predictable cant I'm calm absolutely 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.520
 it's all fixed 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.330
 I even assumed that something 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.349
 but it will be there is a cant 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.360
 associated with the method with the method of this 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:19.599
 pouring this screed it sweat 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:24.190
 correct and in connection with this conclusions 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:27.970
 the following is still necessary in order to 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:31.989
 do cool if this room is still 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.360
 tolerantly correct cant one can if 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.360
 there will be a big room then such jambs 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.160
 maybe not one and I think that everything 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.799
 for the future 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.920
 it is necessary to do a coupler in two stages first 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:48.250
 stage roughing screed about six 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:53.950
 centimeters and the second stage finishing 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:56.079
 screed about two centimeters but it 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.260
 will be at work 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.680
 double payment for the spirit of 200 Ashka 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.629
 do all this we built lighthouses there 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.060
 overrun about a bag of cement for two 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.860
 three square meters since the layer 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.040
 increases and overruns 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.730
 on the contact layer the contact layer on 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.370
 latex 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.739
 so there will be some overrun 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.120
 materials it say such a method 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.500
 which I see with current experience 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.069
 such a method in which you can 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.569
 really done the first time 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.480
 perfect that is without any alterations 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.310
 then roughing and then finishing 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.079
 screed 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.120
 but it actually turns out fair 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:40.930
 screed and then fix just 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.970
 Tile glue do not like and thin 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.000
 layers of tile glue used to be completely flat 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.459
 but now with the current state of quality 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.680
 glue is not the best option either to take 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.630
 very expensive glue and then it will 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.019
 less than just a thin layer of glue 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.650
 leveling layer 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.389
 he dries him will not gain strength 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.340
 if the tile is small, it is necessary to equal 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:07.930
 if large format can be on stage 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:11.019
 laying align mounted wires 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.610
 underfloor heating in regulator 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.980
 the regulator will be from the outside 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.470
 here made such a good hole for 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.799
 that there was a place to hide 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.799
 wires 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:28.550
 the sensor took out and thrust back everything 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.400
 changing the end of the corrugation of the sensor 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.390
 Here it is convenient to keep hand cram 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.570
 wire when installing the regulator 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.270
 this this corrugation like this 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.760
 go deep and here it is 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:49.000
 extra space will be like 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:52.280
 this is all right 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.650
 cycle video pies 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.260
 warm electric floor on the ground 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.280
 I finish thanks for your attention 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:04.000
 criticize until new meetings with you was 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.000
 chased bye
