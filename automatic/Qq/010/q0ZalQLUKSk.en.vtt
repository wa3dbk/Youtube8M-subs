thing about HAARP is it really is a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.229 
thing about HAARP is it really is a

deniability is it sure yeah and whether

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.600 
deniability is it sure yeah and whether
you're<00:00:48.719> you're<00:00:49.050> steering<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.649> hurricane<00:00:50.129> or

it's really difficult to point the
finger<00:00:58.710> at<00:00:59.010> anybody<00:00:59.370> because<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.359> sounds<00:01:00.960> so

can<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.020> point<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.760> to<00:01:14.760> let's<00:01:15.030> say<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
can you point that to let's say the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.570 
can you point that to let's say the
caldera<00:01:15.689> at<00:01:15.930> Yellowstone<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.710> create

of the state to the other I don't think

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.380 
of the state to the other I don't think
I<00:02:43.170> can<00:02:43.349> find<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.709> single<00:02:43.980> American<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:45.090> feels

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
I can find a single American it feels

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.530 
I can find a single American it feels

having disaster drills a day before the
earthquake<00:03:15.299> isn't<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.810> interesting<00:03:16.260> yeah<00:03:17.040> i

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
earthquake isn't that interesting yeah i

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.099 
earthquake isn't that interesting yeah i
love<00:03:17.549> these<00:03:17.760> coincidences<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.079> course

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
love these coincidences and of course

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.280 
love these coincidences and of course
you<00:03:19.709> know<00:03:20.430> after<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:21.090> investigation<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:22.079> that

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
you know after the investigation is that

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.050 
you know after the investigation is that
we're<00:03:22.500> going<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.769> learn<00:03:22.920> all<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.489> truth<00:03:23.760> right

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
we're going to learn all the truth right

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.440 
we're going to learn all the truth right
the<00:03:24.810> moon<00:03:25.049> is<00:03:25.380> made<00:03:25.590> primarily<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.880> titanium

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
the moon is made primarily of titanium

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.890 
the moon is made primarily of titanium
and<00:03:27.810> aluminum<00:03:28.349> and<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.889> earth<00:03:28.980> is<00:03:29.250> made<00:03:29.519> of

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
and aluminum and the earth is made of

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.589 
and aluminum and the earth is made of
iron<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.170> nickel<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:32.099> they<00:03:33.090> couldn't<00:03:33.359> have

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
iron and nickel so they couldn't have

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.720 
iron and nickel so they couldn't have
come<00:03:33.840> from<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.079> same<00:03:34.349> neighborhood<00:03:34.889> there<00:03:35.519> is

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
come from the same neighborhood there is

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.319 
come from the same neighborhood there is
a<00:03:36.090> tremendous<00:03:37.040> awareness<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.790> hollow<00:03:39.060> earth

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
a tremendous awareness of a hollow earth

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.509 
a tremendous awareness of a hollow earth
on<00:03:39.690> this<00:03:39.930> planet<00:03:40.200> or<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:40.889> then<00:03:41.130> there<00:03:41.310> was<00:03:41.489> a

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
on this planet or so then there was a

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.190 
on this planet or so then there was a
new<00:03:41.910> earth<00:03:42.060> before<00:03:42.510> we<00:03:42.900> came<00:03:43.139> out<00:03:43.380> right<00:03:44.310> so

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
new earth before we came out right so

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.050 
new earth before we came out right so
the<00:03:46.200> idea<00:03:46.380> is<00:03:46.769> that<00:03:46.980> if<00:03:47.250> we<00:03:47.280> create<00:03:47.849> this

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
the idea is that if we create this

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.680 
the idea is that if we create this
consciousness<00:03:48.750> key<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.739> opened<00:03:50.280> this<00:03:50.489> gate

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
consciousness key that opened this gate

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.000 
consciousness key that opened this gate
they<00:03:51.690> will<00:03:52.440> come<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.919> us

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
they will come to us

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.520 
they will come to us
and<00:03:54.189> we'll<00:03:54.400> get<00:03:54.580> it<00:03:54.700> on<00:03:54.849> film<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.390> that<00:03:56.290> is

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
and we'll get it on film and that is

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.470 
and we'll get it on film and that is
going<00:03:56.709> to<00:03:56.769> be<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.129> event<00:03:57.489> that<00:03:57.790> changes

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
going to be the event that changes

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.780 
going to be the event that changes
everything<00:03:58.810> in<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.799> interior<00:04:00.220> of<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.760> earth

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
everything in the interior of the earth

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
everything in the interior of the earth
it's<00:04:01.209> all<00:04:01.659> air<00:04:02.250> so<00:04:03.250> we<00:04:03.760> have<00:04:04.000> an<00:04:04.150> eight<00:04:04.360> or<00:04:04.390> nine

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
it's all air so we have an eight or nine

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.740 
it's all air so we have an eight or nine
hundred<00:04:05.200> mile<00:04:05.379> thick<00:04:05.739> crust<00:04:06.040> you've<00:04:07.030> got<00:04:07.269> open

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
hundred mile thick crust you've got open

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.960 
hundred mile thick crust you've got open
air<00:04:07.959> base<00:04:08.170> and<00:04:08.470> you've<00:04:08.709> got<00:04:08.920> this<00:04:09.129> dense<00:04:09.579> iron

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
air base and you've got this dense iron

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.500 
air base and you've got this dense iron
core<00:04:10.659> we<00:04:11.530> may<00:04:11.829> be<00:04:11.860> talking<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.760> navigable

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.760 
means here on the surface of our planet
we<00:04:21.190> have<00:04:21.370> about<00:04:21.609> three<00:04:22.600> miles<00:04:22.840> or<00:04:23.199> four<00:04:23.500> miles

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
we have about three miles or four miles

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.340 
we have about three miles or four miles
of<00:04:24.160> navigable<00:04:24.850> air<00:04:25.150> above<00:04:25.870> that<00:04:26.110> you're

of navigable air above that you're

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.960 
of navigable air above that you're
definitely<00:04:26.560> gonna<00:04:26.860> need<00:04:26.979> oxygen<00:04:27.310> I've<00:04:27.789> been

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
definitely gonna need oxygen I've been

that<00:04:44.800> just<00:04:45.699> brings<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.470> expression<00:04:47.470> as<00:04:47.919> above

that just brings the expression as above
so<00:04:49.000> below<00:04:49.660> earth<00:04:50.590> is<00:04:50.949> now<00:04:51.250> being<00:04:51.520> bombarded<00:04:51.850> by
