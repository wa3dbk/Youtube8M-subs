00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.810 
that that is one of the symptoms that
comes<00:02:27.230> with<00:02:27.410> that<00:02:27.440> right<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.160> I<00:02:28.460> did<00:02:28.640> notice

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
comes with that right and I did notice

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.360 
comes with that right and I did notice
at<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.150> Klein<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.970> started<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:33.370> my

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
at the Klein so and I started to my

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.070 
at the Klein so and I started to my
assimilation<00:02:35.030> of<00:02:35.150> nutrients<00:02:35.630> started<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.960> get

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
assimilation of nutrients started to get

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.330 
assimilation of nutrients started to get
worse<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.470> worse<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.830> worse

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
worse and worse and worse

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.160 
worse and worse and worse
and<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:39.350> natural<00:02:39.770> path<00:02:39.950> had<00:02:40.190> me<00:02:40.340> on<00:02:40.490> like

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
and the natural path had me on like

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.660 
and the natural path had me on like
therapeutic<00:02:42.170> doses<00:02:42.440> of<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.890> few<00:02:43.100> things<00:02:43.340> that

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
therapeutic doses of a few things that

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.540 
therapeutic doses of a few things that
needs<00:02:43.880> them<00:02:44.000> being<00:02:44.210> one<00:02:45.340> just<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:46.430> my

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
needs them being one just so my

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.060 
needs them being one just so my
digestion<00:02:46.910> would<00:02:47.090> work<00:02:47.270> even<00:02:47.420> better<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:48.110> it

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
digestion would work even better and it

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.190 
digestion would work even better and it
just<00:02:49.130> showed<00:02:49.490> that<00:02:49.520> I<00:02:49.850> was<00:02:50.150> assimilating<00:02:50.780> you

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
just showed that I was assimilating you

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.810 
just showed that I was assimilating you
know<00:02:51.290> nutrients<00:02:51.740> right<00:02:52.100> always<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.430> hard<00:02:52.640> time

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
know nutrients right always a hard time

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.880
