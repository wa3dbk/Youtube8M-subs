00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.830
 according to the logic of things, this car 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.000
 the day was not supposed to be born this 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.940
 if you use that logic of things when 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.899
 customs clearance words sentence glory 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:13.199
 premium and segment should not stand next 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.029
 but they will take place two thousand and six 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.359
 after here and this car 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.169
 spoiled the engineers and marketers will get 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:22.829
 the whole raspberry having formed itself 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.629
 the minister premium segment is therefore already in 

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:29.040
 In 2007, engineers started an audit in the role of 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.969
 catch up with yourself 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:32.560
 noon 1 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.560
 our athlete 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.450
 n 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.570
 where visited 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.350
 he is perhaps the most driverless 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.060
 cars from the entire line of cars 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.640
 audit because under such a small 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.200
 hood managed to place only 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.770
 highly 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.040
 small volume motors 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.550
 death of tens of meters either 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.640
 equip four tenths of liters both 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.869
 power units 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.719
 and equipped with a turbine to her system series 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:13.650
 play off with a pair 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.160
 percentage distributed 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.100
 fuel injection which 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.770
 performed at a pressure of 150 bar this 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.680
 allows you to shoot with small volumes 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.329
 motor 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:24.240
 enough 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.780
 high torque is enough for her 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.320
 a lot of horsepower 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.310
 even their smallest motor 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.310
 eighty 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.119
 progress not sustained in corporate style 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.300
 and in affairs 1 she 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.670
 cheat your expectations profitably 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.650
 get behind the wheel of this car 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.240
 expect to see everything here the same thing 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.150
 the identification in audi a4 a 6 that sergey senkin 5 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.380
 but probably excluding audit is because 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.280
 almost all cars and have a week 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.620
 they discussed 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.960
 will look but not the same but very 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.499
 look alike 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:13.009
 I am surprised to find out 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:14.460
 semi final 1 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.450
 This is the place where the designer gave 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.320
 roam and then the technologists did everything 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.520
 practically from scratch to this in the small in 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.029
 common to compact and nobody in the world 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:27.589
 besides auditing standards available 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:30.109
 car generally interesting east 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.919
 Volodin they say that they do where 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.839
 expensive and cheap they make gay rights 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.839
 small they literally 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.039
 we have 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:58.809
 because if a car with 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:01.209
 engine volumes by as much as four tenths 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.939
 vitratiti website 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.479
 and maybe 122 horsepower is 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.989
 the most charged power unit for 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.209
 House was in civilian clothes 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.269
 why i say so because it appeared 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.209
 already get years 1 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.649
 one that is pumped by motor 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:21.019
 power 185 horsepower but I you 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:21.690
 I assure 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.080
 even the very powertrain 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.710
 one point four liters 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.609
 turbines 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.119
 You'll get 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:30.459
 a lot of pleasure from managing this 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.270
 small 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.010
 that is, it does not apply 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.569
 on the radiator hanger I already have these feelings 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.569
 received but the more you like 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.209
 the main trump card is frequent 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.419
 take out the suspension 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:09.439
 really would not those who went to the plugin 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.519
 cooper know how much is a female car 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.379
 There is no compromise in this case, although 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:19.629
 Audi engineers tried to find him 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:22.409
 they are in the hall platform 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:26.139
 Volkswagen Polo im guys from the network and 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.199
 corporate store in which 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.680
 can take 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.110
 suspension elements they chose the most 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.830
 tough all the most combat of what 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.250
 offered for civilian cars 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.220
 have turned out 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.420
 the toughest shock absorbers 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.830
 the toughest springs and the thickest 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.219
 stick 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:48.439
 stabilizer 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:51.069
 what you got 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:53.629
 plus they are very good 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:56.629
 speculated on the lecture tables and in the end 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.590
 turned cleaning driver died 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.280
 in the week and comfort they are here more 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.030
 balanced in june on this car is not 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.139
 you risk health soon don't call 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.189
 yourself so on 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:18.139
 speaker money 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.139
 Further 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.460
 Automatic transmission 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.199
 when it became known about the deal begins with 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:32.949
 of the issue 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.379
 one point four liter but it is not 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:38.059
 pure automatic 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:40.189
 preselective transmission which 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:41.889
 Volkswagen is called where they lived 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.900
 ohh here it is called ex-throne 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.770
 two times friend of child and clutch 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.279
 dry clutches and 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.839
 the nature of the work of this robot 

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:55.799
 he will give odds but many automatic 

00:05:55.799 --> 00:05:57.050
 transmissions 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.289
 including the sale of the machine will reconnoiter 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.280
 transformer which is applied 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.139
 on mini cooper 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.279
 this expert assessment they say that 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:12.519
 at noon 1 the chasm turns more cheerful for 

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:15.249
 an account of the fact that the machine has a bit sharper 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:18.249
 a little faster 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:32.979
 how does the start stop system work 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.789
 from the mysterious catch stopped Wednesday 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.599
 west back 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:38.999
 motor stalled 

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:41.119
 so he ran pine I got 

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:41.919
 of questions 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:45.150
 let go that went to the abyss 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.129
 then all these tricks 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:49.809
 and then 105 point three liters 

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:51.020
 urban cycle 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.310
 premium engine volume by as many as four 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.470
 tenths tape they have two weaknesses 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.039
 power records 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:06:59.319
 in the corridors 

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:02.319
 the truth is very unusual when engineering 

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:14.610
 ntt 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.460
 here
