and fives okay exactly then let's start

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.040 
and fives okay exactly then let's start
with<00:00:28.320> echo<00:00:30.050> echo<00:00:31.050> has<00:00:31.700> this<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.120> clone<00:00:33.750> army

with echo echo has this to clone army
customs<00:00:35.210> DC<00:00:36.210> fifth<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.660> Rex<00:00:36.980> weapons<00:00:37.980> or

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
pistols I think this weapons of clone

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.209 
pistols I think this weapons of clone
and<00:00:42.480> customs<00:00:43.020> are<00:00:43.170> much<00:00:43.350> better<00:00:43.590> than<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.010> one

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and customs are much better than the one
