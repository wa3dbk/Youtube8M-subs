00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
into some of those yeah the principle of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.999 
into some of those yeah the principle of
under<00:01:21.570> armour<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:21.990> terms<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.530> almost<00:01:22.830> an

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
under armour in terms of like almost an

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.380 
under armour in terms of like almost an
ethos<00:01:23.460> design<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.390> fit<00:01:24.659> right<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.220> what<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.180> did

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
ethos design is fit right so what we did

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.510 
ethos design is fit right so what we did
in<00:01:27.570> terms<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:27.990> shoe<00:01:28.229> what<00:01:28.829> you'll<00:01:29.009> see<00:01:29.250> is

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
in terms of this shoe what you'll see is

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.880 
in terms of this shoe what you'll see is
a<00:01:29.579> whole<00:01:30.030> area<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> forefoot<00:01:31.049> which<00:01:31.650> is

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
all one piece right not only takes upon

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.620 
all one piece right not only takes upon
the<00:01:34.799> abrasion<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.400> toe<00:01:35.640> but<00:01:36.240> also<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.600> I

with your foot so you know in terms of
fit<00:02:01.880> that's<00:02:02.299> that's<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.200> huge<00:02:03.470> element<00:02:03.770> for<00:02:04.070> us

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
fit that's that's a huge element for us

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.410 
fit that's that's a huge element for us
and<00:02:05.060> also<00:02:05.439> were<00:02:06.439> one-on-one<00:02:07.399> and<00:02:07.640> hands-on<00:02:08.149> in

come<00:02:20.269> up<00:02:20.420> some<00:02:20.660> great<00:02:20.959> ideas<00:02:21.290> also<00:02:21.500> so<00:02:22.459> what

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
come up some great ideas also so what

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.850 
come up some great ideas also so what
you're<00:02:23.390> seeing<00:02:23.599> all<00:02:23.870> throw<00:02:24.170> out<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.470> mid-foot

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
you're seeing all throw out the mid-foot

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.040 
you're seeing all throw out the mid-foot
area<00:02:25.280> all<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.550> way<00:02:25.760> up<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.090> heel<00:02:26.390> is<00:02:26.750> what

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
area all the way up to the heel is what

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.460 
area all the way up to the heel is what
we<00:02:27.170> call<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.470> zoned<00:02:27.980> matrix<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.870> zone<00:02:30.080> matrix

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
we call a zoned matrix the zone matrix

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.960 
we call a zoned matrix the zone matrix
is<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.739> understanding<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.670> can<00:02:31.850> get

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
is the understanding that you can get

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.150 
is the understanding that you can get
something<00:02:32.180> really<00:02:32.480> thin<00:02:32.989> and<00:02:33.019> packaged<00:02:33.590> and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
something really thin and packaged and

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.430 
something really thin and packaged and
focus<00:02:34.580> it<00:02:34.730> directly<00:02:35.180> upon<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.810> areas<00:02:36.200> where

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
focus it directly upon the areas where

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.630 
focus it directly upon the areas where
we<00:02:36.590> need<00:02:36.769> for<00:02:37.360> flexibility<00:02:38.410> elasticity<00:02:39.640> and

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
we need for flexibility elasticity and

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.900 
we need for flexibility elasticity and
security<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.920> that's<00:02:43.310> really<00:02:43.519> what<00:02:43.730> this

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
security and that's really what this

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.270 
security and that's really what this
whole<00:02:44.120> area<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.600> about<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:45.709> if<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.010> look<00:02:46.160> at

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
whole area is about so if you look at

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.250 
whole area is about so if you look at
this<00:02:46.370> component<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:47.299> know<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.420> singular<00:02:47.930> right

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
this component you know a singular right

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.140 
this component you know a singular right
it's<00:02:48.560> pretty<00:02:49.310> much<00:02:49.459> less<00:02:49.670> than<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:49.880> millimeter

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
it's pretty much less than a millimeter

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.509 
it's pretty much less than a millimeter
but<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.560> areas<00:02:51.920> on<00:02:52.069> what<00:02:52.160> you're<00:02:52.310> able<00:02:52.400> to

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
but the areas on what you're able to

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.440 
but the areas on what you're able to
feel<00:02:52.819> is<00:02:53.780> quite<00:02:54.140> different<00:02:54.700> 52<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.940> have<00:02:56.120> Alec

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450
