00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.040

 that we all know is now an old 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.540
 retired and very lonely without counting 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.000
 the company of his old friends to the pp 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.520
 neither world james gordon and lucius fox anymore 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.740
 that these have died apart from that 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.570
 for some reason batman has cut everything 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.910
 type of ties with the league of justice 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.770
 and with your old colleagues like Robin 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.410
 and bad girl has forbidden them to go back to 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.240
 use their respective mantles however 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.490
 the protagonist of this story is a 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.500
 17 year old teenager named terry 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.540
 maginnis which one day he meets 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.280
 the old bruce and by accident discovers 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.110
 the batcave to see this 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.030
 rus lashes out at him throwing the 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.740
 more remedy of his property but that 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.810
 same night terri's father is 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.460
 killed and that's when terry 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.440
 go back to wayne mansion to ask 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.000
 batman support himself without 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.280
 However, it does not receive any kind of help 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.200
 in front of this the boy manages 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.700
 to steal the last batman costume the 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.950
 which was gifted an incredible 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.310
 technology counting on innovations 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.600
 like other teachers night vision 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.660
 camouflage and audio receivers in the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.520
 fingers among many other things more 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.740
 with the theory disguise he is ready to take 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.420
 revenge on the murderers of his father but 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.910
 you see problems when you do not know how to use 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.350
 all the costume and if it was little bruce 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.600
 he has realized that he has been robbed 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.460
 the disguise so apart from fighting with 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.440
 the murderers of your dad sees you and you see 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.780
 forced to argue over intercom 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.190
 with a very angry bruce wayne until 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.380
 finally they reach an agreement 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.960
 forming a powerful alliance that will 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.960
 would give life to the legendary batman of the future 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.310
 in my opinion I consider that this is one 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.739
 of the best jobs by the 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.780
 already boldini geniuses and bruce team 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.459
 showing us an alternate story about 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.830
 perfectly believable batman e 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.840
 impeccably argued in addition to 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.420
 have pretty acceptable animation 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.129
 and very talented dubbing actors 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.080
 at least those who worked for the 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.670
 Spanish-speaking version which are 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.950
 the same ones who will participate in the dubbing 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.810
 of batman the animated series and superman the 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.299
 series animated by all this and more than 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.680
 then already batman of the future a 10 over 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.769
 10 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.769
 Y 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.689
 Y 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.370
 A few years ago, a 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:07.560
 project to make the live action series 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.939
 of batman of the future however the 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.799
 project never saw the light 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:13.340
 imagining incredible that it would have been 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.340
 this series 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.120
 the last time the character of terry 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.980
 imagine using an animation with the 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.590
 chapter the league of limited justice 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.700
 called an epilogue where they tell us a lot 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.700
 about the future of batman 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.760
 the creators of batman of the future is 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.350
 say paul dini and bruce team are also 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.900
 the creators of batman the animated series 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.040
 superman the animated series the league of the 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.230
 justice the league of justice 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.880
 unlimited and of course they are the 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.920
 creators of our beloved harley quinn 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.510
 I look forward to someday returning 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.590
 to bring up one of your 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.590
 impeccable works 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.139
 yes 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.680
 alerts updates but in reality 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.720
 terry mcginnis is a cloned bruce son 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.790
 wayne it seems that amanda waller is 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.100
 he realized that batman was becoming more and more 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.050
 old and convinced that batman was 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.490
 indispensable for the future graft 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.500
 bruce wayne genes in the parents of 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.090
 terry before he was born clear and 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.920
 when he was eight years old he would send 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.510
 murder his parents however the 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.490
 person who matches the contract to 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.000
 such work relented at the last 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.000
 moment 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.800
 and as a last curiosity or better said 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.540
 a personal opinion I tell you that the 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.220
 batman movie of the future is one of 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.320
 the best animated movies that I've 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.940
