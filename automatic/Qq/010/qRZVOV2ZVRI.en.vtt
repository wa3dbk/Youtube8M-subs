 and then there is a weekly ritual 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.480
 a girl says 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.860

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.950

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.550
 murder 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.890
 The moon and the stars are old sins with Turkish history

 I am also allowed to attend lessons 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.640

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.840
 Hello 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.280
 I did not think about it 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.530

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.910

 that's too clever Verbeek's because there are a few letters we put in 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.740
 For example, our country does not forbid 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.520
 1c with the stroke 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.800

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.240
 and one is with a dash under it 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:15.180

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.469
 gives 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:34.290
 Turkish is great language because you can put a whole sentence into a single one 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:36.169
 Word packed 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.879

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.879

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.129
 Oku is here 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.799
 that means 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:12.860

 School are yours in it 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.589
 because German in the right order 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:32.499

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:36.439

 School yours in it are a whole sentence 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.589
 in a single word, the seats are built quite differently in Turkish 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:49.589
 The first German championship titles could not be found in Turkish 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:51.769
