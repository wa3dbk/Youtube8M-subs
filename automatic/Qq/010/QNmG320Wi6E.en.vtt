00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:12.540
 I've also been concerned with 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:18.619
 video building and my first violin is now 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.670
 ready and show it with pride 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.460
 I started very late with 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.150
 playing the violin so I'm not kidding 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.640
 child 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.250
 learned time so I played about a year or so 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.420
 ten to most so comes and angry as me 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.219
 It could 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:39.480
 already violin and we got no band I got 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:41.520
 to release against my old violin he 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.980
 sounds great he is just trying 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.440
 by an experienced violinist and and 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.170
 it was also rolled over when it was still 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.300
 was not colored and at least deleted 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.010
 done until he was good 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.989
 He balanced all strings equally hard 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.620
 sounding good 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.570
 that there is no wolf in it 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.750
 I also did not know that it was possible but the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.400
 is a wolf in him in a video on the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.110
 most violinists just play over it 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.090
 and make their choice that they just don't hear 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.750
 but that is what you get when you get it 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.060
 drops well and I am at a nevian blue 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.310
 in school 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.820
 in makkum in friesland so an hour or so 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.250
 two reason for me and then there is one 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.350
 man who gives a lesson there at least me 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.619
 guide you in building the violin 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.090
 and make the choice of the wood so am 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.820
 you're not handy then it just takes 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.939
 long but if you are handy one 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.130
 it just takes less time and then 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.659
 then you are guaranteed to get a good one 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.270
 violin 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.170
 that man has had it for about ten years 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.750
 that is dirk jacob hamon and already has one 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.090
 year or 10 that school and that man who 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.790
 that violinist could go along and claiming year 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.899
 then go try out the violins and 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.899
 he was told last ten years and and 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:09.149
 that in the beginning when violins were low there 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.579
 one or so was the good 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:16.260
 and the rest was less and less good 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:19.140
 but now now this year but mine fell 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.579
 also under where they were all good and 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.340
 not one less 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.659
 they were all good so the process 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.030
 of teaching 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.370
 has made its progress and the have 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.269
 I benefited for around I enjoy 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.769
 now from my violin 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.400
 instead of that old video of mine 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.530
 but still gave 1100 in advance and me 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.980
 now have a fell that i just have 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:46.620

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.590
