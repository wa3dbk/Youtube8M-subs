00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.699 
damage but I know it would get taken out
really<00:03:42.660> quickly<00:03:42.900> anyway<00:03:43.320> because<00:03:43.470> it's<00:03:43.650> a

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
really quickly anyway because it's a

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.340 
really quickly anyway because it's a
grass<00:03:43.950> site<00:03:44.250> against<00:03:44.910> an<00:03:45.000> ice<00:03:45.180> mono<00:03:45.480> so<00:03:46.320> I

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
grass site against an ice mono so I

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.740 
grass site against an ice mono so I
can't<00:03:46.620> emphasize<00:03:46.769> enough<00:03:47.130> how<00:03:47.459> how<00:03:48.120> difficult

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
figure you know might as well try to

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.940 
figure you know might as well try to
really<00:05:10.130> raise<00:05:10.370> them<00:05:10.550> attack<00:05:10.850> high<00:05:11.380> and<00:05:12.380> I<00:05:12.680> kind

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
really raise them attack high and I kind

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.950 
really raise them attack high and I kind
of<00:05:13.010> regret<00:05:13.160> not<00:05:13.460> doing<00:05:13.520> it<00:05:13.910> one<00:05:14.180> more<00:05:14.360> time<00:05:14.630> I

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
of regret not doing it one more time I

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.860 
of regret not doing it one more time I
think<00:05:15.500> had<00:05:15.620> a<00:05:15.650> gun<00:05:15.830> more<00:05:16.190> time<00:05:16.780> would<00:05:17.780> have

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
think had a gun more time would have

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.210 
think had a gun more time would have
made<00:05:17.990> all<00:05:18.080> the<00:05:18.200> difference<00:05:18.410> in<00:05:18.710> this<00:05:18.800> battle

made all the difference in this battle
and<00:05:19.340> I<00:05:19.460> actually<00:05:19.610> would<00:05:20.000> have<00:05:20.120> I<00:05:20.390> think<00:05:20.960> swept

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
and I actually would have I think swept
