Southern Alps divide pretty much the

Southern Alps divide pretty much the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
when I got unto BASE jumping which is

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
and dangerous it's a marginal site it

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.330 
and dangerous it's a marginal site it
was<00:02:07.510> 45<00:02:07.780> degrees<00:02:08.320> and<00:02:08.860> we<00:02:09.009> just<00:02:09.190> had<00:02:09.310> a

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
was 45 degrees and we just had a

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.070 
was 45 degrees and we just had a
snowfall<00:02:09.790> the<00:02:09.910> night<00:02:10.090> before<00:02:10.240> so<00:02:10.780> it's<00:02:10.929> pretty

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
snowfall the night before so it's pretty

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.900 
snowfall the night before so it's pretty
slippery<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.770> didn't<00:02:12.250> have<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.400> problem<00:02:12.610> putting

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
slippery I didn't have a problem putting

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.030 
slippery I didn't have a problem putting
the<00:02:13.030> chuck<00:02:13.300> out<00:02:13.480> is<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.780> professional<00:02:14.440> guide

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
the chuck out is a professional guide

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.400 
the chuck out is a professional guide
himself<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.360> mountain<00:02:16.750> so<00:02:16.960> he's<00:02:17.140> very

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
himself and the mountain so he's very

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.680 
himself and the mountain so he's very
aware<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.710> of<00:02:18.370> those<00:02:18.610> sort<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:18.940> conditions<00:02:19.420> I

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
aware of of those sort of conditions I

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.330 
aware of of those sort of conditions I
just<00:02:20.170> have<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.380> put<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.560> helicopter<00:02:21.100> very

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
just have to put the helicopter very

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.699 
just have to put the helicopter very
steadily<00:02:21.610> on<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.750> position<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.320> that<00:02:23.350> he<00:02:23.560> can

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
steadily on to a position so that he can

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.410 
steadily on to a position so that he can
get<00:02:23.830> out<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.220> he<00:02:24.490> does<00:02:24.670> stuff<00:02:24.910> he<00:02:25.060> can<00:02:25.090> still

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
get out and he does stuff he can still

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.540 
get out and he does stuff he can still
grab<00:02:25.600> hold<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:26.050> skid<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.680> balance<00:02:27.400> himself

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
grab hold of a skid to balance himself

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.730 
grab hold of a skid to balance himself
again<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.690> certainly<00:02:29.080> didn't<00:02:29.320> want<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.590> much

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
again it certainly didn't want it much

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.680 
again it certainly didn't want it much
steeper<00:02:30.010> because<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:30.820> know<00:02:30.940> contacting<00:02:31.570> with

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
steeper because you know contacting with

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.230 
steeper because you know contacting with
the<00:02:31.780> blades<00:02:32.020> we<00:02:32.290> had<00:02:32.380> sort<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.770> few<00:02:32.950> feet

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
the blades we had sort of a few feet

blade separation from the rocks and

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.670 
blade separation from the rocks and
there<00:02:38.470> is<00:02:38.590> something<00:02:38.980> really<00:02:39.250> special<00:02:40.680> we

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
there is something really special we

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.290 
there is something really special we
knew<00:02:41.890> are<00:02:42.100> stepping<00:02:42.760> off<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:42.880> edge<00:02:43.090> of<00:02:43.180> a

knew are stepping off the edge of a

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.010 
knew are stepping off the edge of a
cliff<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.600> you're<00:02:43.720> putting<00:02:43.870> yourself

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
cliff and you're putting yourself

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.900 
cliff and you're putting yourself
completely<00:02:44.470> out<00:02:44.890> then<00:02:45.130> you've<00:02:45.310> stepped<00:02:45.730> away

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
completely out then you've stepped away
