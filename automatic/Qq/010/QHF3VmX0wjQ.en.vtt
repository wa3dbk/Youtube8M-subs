00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.940
 then we start with the ingredients 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.760
 first of all you will need to 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.750
 raspberry orange lemonade and 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.400
 ice cubes 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.630
 I use a miss anjar who comes from 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.160
 houses of the world but you can 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.500
 also do this recipe in 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.150
 any pretty green are added 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.110
 raspberries personally I put them 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.150
 about 5 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.310
 the choice of quantity is yours 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:02.460
 to add one or two slices 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:03.989
 of orange and finish with the ice cubes I 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.470
 I chose a little heart because 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.470
 this is so cute 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.890
 with a wooden spoon you crush 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:20.180
 the mixture and you only have 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.180
 add lemonade 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.450
 you cut a thin slice of orange 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.370
 that you are going to put a decoration on 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.370
 the edge of the verb you 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:55.460
 put the straw back and your drink is 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:57.320
 ready for the sequel you need to 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.740
 vanilla ice cream with small pearls 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:05.690
 decorative one-to-page of your choice and 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.000
 of biscuits you make a little ball 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.860
 of ice with a spoon or a ball 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.960
 to ice but as it should not 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.870
 too big I advise you when 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.000
 even to do it with the spoon you the 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.770
 put between the two cookies and 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.520
 wanted to roll in the little beads 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.520
 decorative 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.820
 then you take your topping that 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.290
 you just put everything around your 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.290
 plate in decoration 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.409
 and voila 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.269
