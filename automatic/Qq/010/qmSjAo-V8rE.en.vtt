00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
a successor to the Titan one with the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.460 
a successor to the Titan one with the
improved<00:00:29.519> specs<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.210> believe<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.840> versus<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
improved specs I believe it versus a

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.229 
improved specs I believe it versus a
quad-core<00:00:31.890> processor<00:00:32.130> instead<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.149> a

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
quad-core processor instead of a

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.060 
quad-core processor instead of a
dual-core<00:00:34.130> has<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:35.489> gig<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.880> ram<00:00:36.739> so<00:00:37.739> let's

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
dual-core has one gig of ram so let's

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.240 
dual-core has one gig of ram so let's

shooter<00:02:17.630> so<00:02:18.170> that's<00:02:18.350> really<00:02:18.709> interesting<00:02:18.950> and

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
shooter so that's really interesting and

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.280 
shooter so that's really interesting and
also<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:20.000> believe<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.420> front-facing<00:02:20.720> camera

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
also I believe the front-facing camera

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.680 
also I believe the front-facing camera
is<00:02:21.319> a<00:02:21.440> 5<00:02:21.770> megapixel<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:22.610> haven't<00:02:23.240> seen<00:02:23.420> such<00:02:23.660> a

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
is a 5 megapixel I haven't seen such a

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.440 
is a 5 megapixel I haven't seen such a
high<00:02:24.080> megapixel<00:02:24.380> camera<00:02:25.040> for<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.580> front<00:02:25.940> man<00:02:26.120> so

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
high megapixel camera for a front man so

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.559 
high megapixel camera for a front man so
that's<00:02:26.630> interesting<00:02:27.130> so<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.160> let<00:02:28.640> us<00:02:28.790> open<00:02:29.270> up

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
that's interesting so and let us open up

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.420 
that's interesting so and let us open up
the<00:02:29.720> back<00:02:29.900> cover<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.890> looks<00:02:31.130> exactly

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
the back cover and it looks exactly

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.120 
the back cover and it looks exactly
similar<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.300> note<00:02:33.200> 2<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:36.080> we<00:02:36.680> also<00:02:36.860> have

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
similar to the note 2 and we also have

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.330 
similar to the note 2 and we also have
that<00:02:37.250> wicked<00:02:37.730> little<00:02:37.940> logo<00:02:38.480> at<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:39.140> back<00:02:39.380> so

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
that wicked little logo at the back so

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.670 
that wicked little logo at the back so
again<00:02:40.580> it's<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.820> dual<00:02:41.000> SIM<00:02:41.239> onesimus<00:02:41.870> 3g<00:02:42.260> second

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
again it's a dual SIM onesimus 3g second

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.860 
again it's a dual SIM onesimus 3g second
is<00:02:42.769> 2g<00:02:43.100> enabled<00:02:43.550> and<00:02:43.760> we<00:02:44.239> can<00:02:44.390> also<00:02:44.630> add<00:02:44.780> a

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
is 2g enabled and we can also add a

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.080 
is 2g enabled and we can also add a
microSD<00:02:45.560> card<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:46.100> won't<00:02:46.459> do<00:02:46.640> that<00:02:46.790> right<00:02:46.850> now

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
microSD card I won't do that right now

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.580 
microSD card I won't do that right now

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
pixels and we have the onion actually

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.620 
pixels and we have the onion actually
put<00:03:18.230> it<00:03:18.350> very<00:03:18.739> fast<00:03:19.130> if<00:03:19.670> you<00:03:19.820> see<00:03:20.090> let's

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
sufficiently bright let us just go to

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.199 
sufficiently bright let us just go to
the<00:03:25.640> settings<00:03:27.190> about<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.549> phone

and<00:03:29.299> as<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:29.989> can<00:03:30.079> see<00:03:30.260> it<00:03:30.350> comes<00:03:30.560> with<00:03:30.799> Android

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
and as you can see it comes with Android

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.400 
and as you can see it comes with Android
version<00:03:31.519> 4.1.2<00:03:32.360> that's<00:03:32.570> jellybean<00:03:33.079> so<00:03:33.260> that's

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
version 4.1.2 that's jellybean so that's

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.920 
version 4.1.2 that's jellybean so that's
interesting<00:03:34.120> let's<00:03:35.120> also<00:03:35.390> look<00:03:35.540> at<00:03:35.810> the

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
interesting let's also look at the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.330 
interesting let's also look at the
display<00:03:38.230> let's<00:03:39.230> go<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.739> brightness<00:03:39.950> and

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
display let's go to the brightness and

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.039 
display let's go to the brightness and
yes<00:03:40.609> it<00:03:40.790> does<00:03:40.970> have<00:03:41.209> auto<00:03:41.420> brightness<00:03:41.690> so

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
yes it does have auto brightness so

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.650 
yes it does have auto brightness so
that's<00:03:42.230> interesting

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
that's interesting

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.500 
that's interesting
and<00:03:45.519> let's<00:03:46.519> also<00:03:46.730> quickly<00:03:47.209> look<00:03:47.359> at<00:03:47.450> the

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
and let's also quickly look at the

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.150 
and let's also quickly look at the
storage<00:03:48.019> provided<00:03:48.440> we<00:03:48.680> did<00:03:48.829> not<00:03:48.950> add<00:03:49.130> any

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
storage provided we did not add any

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.690 
storage provided we did not add any
micro<00:03:49.609> SD<00:03:49.850> card<00:03:50.060> as<00:03:50.239> of<00:03:50.390> now<00:03:50.600> and<00:03:51.400> it's<00:03:52.400> divided

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
micro SD card as of now and it's divided

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.750 
micro SD card as of now and it's divided
into<00:03:52.940> two<00:03:53.060> parts<00:03:53.859> one<00:03:54.859> point<00:03:55.070> for<00:03:55.310> 4gb

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
into two parts one point for 4gb

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.940 
into two parts one point for 4gb
internal<00:03:56.060> storage<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:56.870> phone<00:03:57.410> store<00:03:57.709> it<00:03:57.829> is

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
internal storage and phone store it is

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.789 
internal storage and phone store it is
1.2<00:03:58.579> 6gp<00:03:59.060> but<00:03:59.600> we<00:03:59.720> can<00:03:59.840> also<00:03:59.989> add<00:04:00.200> a<00:04:00.230> micro<00:04:00.590> SD

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
1.2 6gp but we can also add a micro SD

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.940 
1.2 6gp but we can also add a micro SD
card<00:04:00.980> as<00:04:01.070> I<00:04:01.190> said<00:04:01.690> so<00:04:02.690> story<00:04:03.200> should<00:04:03.290> be<00:04:03.440> ok<00:04:03.920> I

let's<00:04:11.870> look<00:04:12.079> at<00:04:12.290> some<00:04:12.500> of<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.709> apps<00:04:12.890> that<00:04:13.070> are

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
let's look at some of the apps that are

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.270 
let's look at some of the apps that are
pre-loaded<00:04:14.500> actually<00:04:15.500> it<00:04:15.620> looks<00:04:15.859> nuts

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
pre-loaded actually it looks nuts

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.920

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.839 
actually it's a good thing they did not
load<00:04:18.169> a<00:04:18.200> lot<00:04:18.440> of<00:04:18.590> preloaded<00:04:19.340> apps<00:04:19.430> they<00:04:19.669> have

good let's look at the 8 megapixel
camera<00:04:55.450> that<00:04:55.660> we<00:04:55.840> get<00:04:56.080> let's<00:04:56.560> take<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.220> picture

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
camera that we get let's take a picture

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.740 
camera that we get let's take a picture
of<00:04:57.730> this<00:04:58.240> box<00:04:58.540> itself<00:04:59.400> here<00:05:00.400> is<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.730> camera

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.530 

and<00:05:04.750> we<00:05:04.930> get<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.200> tap<00:05:05.470> to<00:05:05.650> focus<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:07.150> equity

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
and we get the tap to focus and equity

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.260 
and we get the tap to focus and equity
to<00:05:07.630> the<00:05:07.860> photograph<00:05:08.860> actually<00:05:09.040> let's<00:05:09.730> try<00:05:10.030> it

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
to the photograph actually let's try it

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.420 
to the photograph actually let's try it
without<00:05:10.510> the<00:05:10.720> flash<00:05:11.050> now<00:05:11.350> this<00:05:12.040> is<00:05:12.160> without

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
without the flash now this is without

without the flash now this is without
the<00:05:12.580> flash<00:05:13.890> actually<00:05:14.890> it<00:05:15.250> takes<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:15.580> snaps

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
the flash actually it takes the snaps

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.510 
the flash actually it takes the snaps
pretty<00:05:16.120> quickly<00:05:16.390> and<00:05:17.350> this<00:05:18.010> is<00:05:18.070> the<00:05:18.280> stamp

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
pretty quickly and this is the stamp

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.430 
pretty quickly and this is the stamp
that<00:05:18.610> a<00:05:18.730> meter<00:05:19.240> this<00:05:19.690> is<00:05:19.750> without<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.230> flash

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
that a meter this is without the flash

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.220 
that a meter this is without the flash
and<00:05:20.800> this<00:05:21.400> one<00:05:21.580> was<00:05:21.790> with<00:05:22.000> flash<00:05:22.270> so<00:05:23.110> the

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
and this one was with flash so the

let's also look at some of the settings
of<00:05:32.440> the<00:05:32.560> camera<00:05:32.970> and<00:05:34.260> this<00:05:35.260> is<00:05:35.320> interesting<00:05:35.710> it

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
of the camera and this is interesting it

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.580 
of the camera and this is interesting it
says<00:05:36.250> that<00:05:36.520> I<00:05:36.550> can<00:05:37.150> take<00:05:37.180> continuous<00:05:37.960> shots<00:05:38.260> up

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.810 
says that I can take continuous shots up
to<00:05:38.800> 40<00:05:39.490> and<00:05:40.560> picture<00:05:41.560> size<00:05:41.980> actually<00:05:42.520> can<00:05:42.700> go

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
to 40 and picture size actually can go

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.190 
to 40 and picture size actually can go
up<00:05:42.940> to<00:05:43.060> 12<00:05:43.330> megapixels<00:05:43.480> so<00:05:44.020> that's

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
up to 12 megapixels so that's

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.930 
up to 12 megapixels so that's
interesting<00:05:44.650> but<00:05:44.740> we<00:05:44.890> keep<00:05:45.070> it<00:05:45.220> at<00:05:45.340> 8<00:05:45.670> and

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
we took 28 pictures so let's look at

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.630 
we took 28 pictures so let's look at
them<00:05:58.240> how<00:05:58.690> is<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:58.960> quality<00:05:59.560> it's<00:06:00.310> a<00:06:00.400> little

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
them how is the quality it's a little

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.200 
them how is the quality it's a little
bit<00:06:00.760> blurry<00:06:01.000> as<00:06:01.740> you<00:06:02.740> can<00:06:02.920> see<00:06:03.210> but

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
bit blurry as you can see but

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.120 
bit blurry as you can see but
nevertheless<00:06:04.840> we<00:06:05.230> have<00:06:05.500> the<00:06:05.680> option<00:06:05.980> of

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
nevertheless we have the option of

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.610 
nevertheless we have the option of
taking<00:06:06.400> both<00:06:06.820> shots<00:06:07.120> like<00:06:07.330> this<00:06:07.630> so<00:06:08.350> I'll<00:06:08.470> be

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
taking both shots like this so I'll be

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.710 
taking both shots like this so I'll be
testing<00:06:08.800> the<00:06:09.070> camera<00:06:09.370> a<00:06:09.460> lot<00:06:09.730> more<00:06:10.000> in<00:06:10.150> my<00:06:10.270> full

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
testing the camera a lot more in my full

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.890 
testing the camera a lot more in my full
review<00:06:11.230> I<00:06:11.820> also<00:06:12.820> connect<00:06:13.210> it<00:06:13.300> to<00:06:13.420> my<00:06:13.450> Wi-Fi

let's<00:06:18.700> try<00:06:18.940> to<00:06:19.060> go<00:06:19.300> to<00:06:19.360> our<00:06:19.690> website<00:06:20.020> that's

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
let's try to go to our website that's

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.250 
let's try to go to our website that's
take<00:06:20.620> 2<00:06:20.770> bus<00:06:20.950> and<00:06:21.480> the<00:06:22.480> keyboard<00:06:22.900> is<00:06:22.960> again

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
take 2 bus and the keyboard is again

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:29.570 
take 2 bus and the keyboard is again
very<00:06:23.290> stock<00:06:26.910> to<00:06:27.910> us

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
very stock to us

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.420 
very stock to us
and<00:06:30.000> the<00:06:30.689> pinch-to-zoom<00:06:31.110> is<00:06:31.470> fairly<00:06:31.770> smooth<00:06:32.280> I

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
and the pinch-to-zoom is fairly smooth I

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:38.119 
and the pinch-to-zoom is fairly smooth I
would<00:06:32.580> say<00:06:35.750> and<00:06:36.750> again<00:06:36.930> if<00:06:37.080> we<00:06:37.110> noticed<00:06:37.530> it's

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:38.129 
would say and again if we noticed it's

pinch<00:07:25.949> to<00:07:26.099> zoom<00:07:26.129> gesture<00:07:26.490> is<00:07:26.969> good<00:07:27.479> enough

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:27.719 
pinch to zoom gesture is good enough

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:29.839 
pinch to zoom gesture is good enough
again<00:07:28.500> as<00:07:28.650> the<00:07:28.770> phone<00:07:28.949> has<00:07:29.099> one<00:07:29.370> gig<00:07:29.580> of<00:07:29.699> ram

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:36.740 
and I believe if you hold this button
you<00:07:34.289> get<00:07:34.500> to<00:07:34.650> the<00:07:34.740> multitasking<00:07:35.400> tray<00:07:35.789> so

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:36.750
