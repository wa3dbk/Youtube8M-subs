transport cockpit it is easily a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.529 
transport cockpit it is easily a
generation<00:00:26.490> beyond<00:00:26.789> even<00:00:27.150> seventy<00:00:27.480> and

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
generation beyond even seventy and

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.410 
generation beyond even seventy and
seventh<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:28.260> course<00:00:28.789> you<00:00:29.789> know<00:00:29.880> as<00:00:30.029> fast<00:00:30.210> as

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420

seventh of course you know as fast as
the<00:00:30.510> technology<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.260> base<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.679> moving

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
the technology in this base is moving

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.530 
the technology in this base is moving
whoever's<00:00:32.399> got<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.579> most<00:00:32.700> modern<00:00:33.210> one<00:00:33.329> is

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
whoever's got the most modern one is

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.330 
whoever's got the most modern one is
he's<00:00:34.410> always<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.160> next

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
he's always going to have that next

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.700 
he's always going to have that next
generation<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> cockpit<00:00:37.680> that

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
generation so so this is a cockpit that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.330 
generation so so this is a cockpit that
is<00:00:38.010> based<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.940> collins<00:00:39.390> proline<00:00:39.719> fusion

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
is based on the collins proline fusion

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.360 
is based on the collins proline fusion
phenomenal<00:00:41.340> technology<00:00:42.260> this<00:00:43.260> technology<00:00:43.620> is

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
phenomenal technology this technology is

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.510 
phenomenal technology this technology is
really<00:00:44.399> only<00:00:45.180> previously<00:00:45.690> seen<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.559> 50

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
really only previously seen on the 50

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.850

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
command backup obviously you can see

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.789 
command backup obviously you can see
what<00:01:09.510> you'll<00:01:09.689> watch<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.960> autocratic<00:01:10.409> move

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
what you'll watch the autocratic move

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.590 
what you'll watch the autocratic move
that<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.130> apply<00:01:11.610> long<00:01:11.880> obviously<00:01:12.330> one<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
that you apply long obviously one of the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.249 
that you apply long obviously one of the
criticisms<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.290> Airbus<00:01:13.860> probably<00:01:15.259> also

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
criticisms and Airbus probably also

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.160 
criticisms and Airbus probably also
fully<00:01:17.009> integrated<00:01:17.520> heads-up<00:01:17.820> displays<00:01:18.210> so

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
fully integrated heads-up displays so

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.630 
fully integrated heads-up displays so
the<00:01:19.259> heads-up<00:01:19.470> displays<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.460> same

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the heads-up displays and the same

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.899 
the heads-up displays and the same
symbology<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> PFD<00:01:22.340> full<00:01:23.340> systems<00:01:23.759> in

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
system which uses phase of flight so

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.770 
system which uses phase of flight so
basically<00:01:30.500> departure<00:01:31.500> cruise<00:01:32.780> departure

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
climb cruise destination of arrival so

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.990 
climb cruise destination of arrival so
very<00:01:36.060> intuitive<00:01:36.600> very<00:01:36.689> easy<00:01:37.430> because<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.700> the
