00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
make everything as tough as possible

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.240 
make everything as tough as possible
because<00:01:14.840> it's<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.560> biggest<00:01:15.710> event<00:01:16.070> every

four<00:01:16.430> years<00:01:16.670> with<00:01:16.970> you<00:01:17.210> regardless<00:01:17.570> there's<00:01:17.840> a

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
four years with you regardless there's a

four years with you regardless there's a
true<00:01:18.080> test<00:01:18.350> of<00:01:18.470> horse<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:18.830> rider<00:01:19.040> this<00:01:19.940> I

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
true test of horse and rider this I

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.789 
true test of horse and rider this I
reckon<00:01:20.600> is<00:01:20.720> as<00:01:20.840> tough<00:01:21.080> of<00:01:21.260> course<00:01:21.470> as<00:01:21.650> I've

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
reckon is as tough of course as I've

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.250 
reckon is as tough of course as I've
seen<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.369> for<00:01:22.490> sheer<00:01:22.760> size<00:01:23.240> it's<00:01:23.780> not<00:01:23.930> so

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
seen and for sheer size it's not so

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.000 
seen and for sheer size it's not so
technical<00:01:24.890> but<00:01:25.070> it<00:01:25.159> is<00:01:25.340> enormous<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:27.010> direct

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
technical but it is enormous the direct

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.490 
technical but it is enormous the direct
routes<00:01:28.280> will<00:01:28.549> require<00:01:29.030> a<00:01:29.060> very<00:01:29.659> very<00:01:30.200> talented

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500

yep<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.490> then<00:01:46.729> they'll<00:01:46.970> have<00:01:47.060> to<00:01:47.180> pull<00:01:47.360> right

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
yep and then they'll have to pull right

to<00:01:50.420> get<00:01:50.540> over<00:01:50.750> that<00:01:50.900> great<00:01:51.229> big<00:01:51.439> ditch<00:01:51.650> onto

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
to get over that great big ditch onto

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.499 
to get over that great big ditch onto
that<00:01:52.070> Bank<00:01:52.369> that's<00:01:52.700> gonna<00:01:52.850> take<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.119> lot<00:01:53.360> longer

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
that Bank that's gonna take a lot longer

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.149 
that Bank that's gonna take a lot longer
to<00:01:53.720> come<00:01:53.900> around<00:01:54.020> here<00:01:54.170> obviously<00:01:54.409> well

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
to come around here obviously well

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.560 
to come around here obviously well
that's<00:01:55.400> it<00:01:55.580> but<00:01:55.729> this<00:01:55.850> is<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.150> way<00:01:56.299> that's

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
that's it but this is the way that's

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.100 
that's it but this is the way that's
been<00:01:57.070> specially<00:01:58.070> built<00:01:58.729> for<00:01:58.970> those<00:01:59.299> people

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
been specially built for those people

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.929 
been specially built for those people
that<00:02:00.140> aren't<00:02:00.320> just<00:02:00.650> quite<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.400> competent

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
that aren't just quite so competent

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.940 
that aren't just quite so competent
there's<00:02:02.509> a<00:02:02.630> very<00:02:02.840> wide<00:02:03.079> divergence<00:02:03.799> of

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
there's a very wide divergence of

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.890 
there's a very wide divergence of
standards<00:02:04.700> in<00:02:04.820> an<00:02:04.909> Olympic<00:02:05.150> Games<00:02:05.509> from<00:02:05.810> the

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
standards in an Olympic Games from the

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.660 
standards in an Olympic Games from the
very<00:02:06.079> top<00:02:06.290> to<00:02:06.500> bottom<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.400> they'll<00:02:07.549> come

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
very top to bottom so they'll come

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.639 
very top to bottom so they'll come
through<00:02:07.729> here<00:02:08.239> because<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.989> competent

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
through here because the competent

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.350 
through here because the competent
riders<00:02:09.950> have<00:02:10.069> already<00:02:10.489> got<00:02:10.640> motocross<00:02:11.090> here

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
riders have already got motocross here

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.420 
riders have already got motocross here
yeah<00:02:11.690> it's<00:02:12.110> quite<00:02:12.349> a<00:02:12.380> big<00:02:12.560> crowd<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.130> be<00:02:13.160> down

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
yeah it's quite a big crowd to be down

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.080 
yeah it's quite a big crowd to be down
here

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
here

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.910 
here
these<00:02:14.510> stones<00:02:14.840> would<00:02:15.140> all<00:02:15.230> be<00:02:15.379> leveled<00:02:15.769> so

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
these stones would all be leveled so

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.690 
these stones would all be leveled so
there's<00:02:16.069> no<00:02:16.160> problem<00:02:16.550> there<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.489> hope

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
there's no problem there this is I hope

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.699 
there's no problem there this is I hope
the<00:02:19.879> tractor<00:02:20.360> will<00:02:20.840> be<00:02:20.989> shoved<00:02:21.230> out<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.560> way

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
the tractor will be shoved out the way

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.229 
the tractor will be shoved out the way
because<00:02:22.040> we're<00:02:22.400> still<00:02:22.640> trying<00:02:22.879> to<00:02:22.910> finish

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
because we're still trying to finish

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.030 
because we're still trying to finish
building<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.690> course<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.080> know<00:02:24.230> Spain's<00:02:24.800> bit

turnaround<00:02:26.810> here<00:02:27.110> now<00:02:27.379> it's<00:02:27.680> not<00:02:27.920> such<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.190> big

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
turnaround here now it's not such a big

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.780 
turnaround here now it's not such a big
jump<00:02:28.730> this<00:02:29.000> but<00:02:29.750> how<00:02:30.140> often<00:02:30.620> do<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:30.860> teach<00:02:31.580> a

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
jump this but how often do you teach a

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.789 
jump this but how often do you teach a
horse<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.090> jump<00:02:32.269> into<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.810> house<00:02:33.080> not<00:02:33.500> very

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
horse to jump into a house not very

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.860 
horse to jump into a house not very
often<00:02:34.250> so<00:02:34.430> they<00:02:35.060> could<00:02:35.209> easily<00:02:35.330> stop<00:02:35.720> they

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
often so they could easily stop they

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.809 
often so they could easily stop they
even<00:02:36.110> small<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:36.890> so-called<00:02:37.069> easier<00:02:37.610> route

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
even small and so-called easier route

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.420 
even small and so-called easier route
takes<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.599> long<00:02:38.780> time<00:02:38.810> because<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:40.280> other

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
takes a long time because the other

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.100 
takes a long time because the other
horses<00:02:40.760> are<00:02:40.970> actually<00:02:41.269> jumping<00:02:41.629> across<00:02:41.840> the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
horses are actually jumping across the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.570 
horses are actually jumping across the
top<00:02:42.319> the<00:02:42.470> ones<00:02:42.650> again<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.980> direct<00:02:43.340> route<00:02:43.519> and

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
top the ones again the direct route and

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.000 
top the ones again the direct route and
we're<00:02:43.879> going<00:02:44.120> all<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.330> way<00:02:44.569> underneath<00:02:45.010> here

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
we're going all the way underneath here

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.770 
we're going all the way underneath here
almost<00:02:46.760> where<00:02:47.180> we<00:02:47.299> came<00:02:47.450> from

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
almost where we came from

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.690 
almost where we came from
almost<00:02:48.560> factors<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.099> say<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.340> where<00:02:49.549> we

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
almost factors you say to where we

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.479 
almost factors you say to where we
started<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.840> there<00:02:51.200> finally<00:02:51.860> is<00:02:52.069> the

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
started and there finally is the

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.130 
started and there finally is the
surprise<00:02:52.880> which<00:02:53.239> is<00:02:53.390> jump<00:02:53.870> into<00:02:54.019> water<00:02:56.049> but<00:02:57.049> of

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
surprise which is jump into water but of

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.850 
surprise which is jump into water but of
course<00:02:57.380> if<00:02:58.340> you've<00:02:59.200> got<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.349> really<00:03:00.500> brave

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
course if you've got the really brave

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.410 
course if you've got the really brave
horse<00:03:01.129> and<00:03:01.340> you're<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.459> brave<00:03:01.730> writer<00:03:02.030> you've

horse and you're a brave writer you've

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.789 
horse and you're a brave writer you've
come<00:03:02.629> onto<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:02.930> roof<00:03:03.110> of<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.319> house<00:03:03.620> you've

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
come onto the roof of that house you've

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.350 
come onto the roof of that house you've
just<00:03:03.950> been<00:03:04.099> through<00:03:04.160> down<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:04.940> big

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
just been through down a big

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.360 
just been through down a big
five-foot-six<00:03:06.049> job<00:03:06.379> a<00:03:06.410> very<00:03:06.560> short<00:03:07.220> little

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
five-foot-six job a very short little

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.339 
five-foot-six job a very short little
stride<00:03:07.760> which<00:03:08.269> in<00:03:08.420> itself<00:03:08.750> will<00:03:08.989> make<00:03:09.019> you

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
stride which in itself will make you

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.800 
stride which in itself will make you
being<00:03:09.890> kind<00:03:10.099> to<00:03:10.250> hit<00:03:10.489> that<00:03:10.700> fence<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.390> then

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
being kind to hit that fence and then

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.680 
being kind to hit that fence and then
and<00:03:12.680> down<00:03:12.860> into<00:03:13.099> what<00:03:13.220> will<00:03:13.370> be<00:03:13.610> probably<00:03:14.000> 40

and 15 inches of water
this<00:03:16.549> is<00:03:16.700> spent<00:03:16.940> 16<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:17.840> it's<00:03:18.109> about<00:03:18.470> halfway

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
this is spent 16 and it's about halfway

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.569 
this is spent 16 and it's about halfway
around<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.370> course<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:21.769> biggest<00:03:22.130> problem

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
around the course the biggest problem

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:23.920 
around the course the biggest problem
initially<00:03:22.880> is<00:03:23.150> that<00:03:23.329> as<00:03:23.420> you<00:03:23.480> come<00:03:23.600> up<00:03:23.780> the

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
initially is that as you come up the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.930 
initially is that as you come up the
horse<00:03:24.079> can<00:03:24.260> only<00:03:24.380> see<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:25.370> trees<00:03:25.639> in<00:03:25.850> the

horse can only see the trees in the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.270 
horse can only see the trees in the
valley<00:03:26.200> he<00:03:27.200> comes<00:03:27.440> up<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:27.829> bank<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.160> he's

valley he comes up to the bank and he's

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.800 
valley he comes up to the bank and he's
just<00:03:28.430> about<00:03:28.639> to<00:03:28.790> take<00:03:28.970> off<00:03:29.090> he<00:03:29.329> suddenly<00:03:29.510> sees

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
just about to take off he suddenly sees

all<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.349> water<00:03:30.680> down<00:03:30.980> there<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.519> my<00:03:32.269> fear<00:03:32.690> is

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
all the water down there and my fear is

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.379 
all the water down there and my fear is
that<00:03:33.319> they're<00:03:33.440> going<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.769> take<00:03:34.010> off<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.519> drop

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
that they're going to take off and drop

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.030 
that they're going to take off and drop
a<00:03:35.420> leg<00:03:35.660> this<00:03:35.840> side<00:03:36.109> as<00:03:36.290> I<00:03:36.380> say<00:03:36.530> busy<00:03:36.769> looking<00:03:36.980> at

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
is the first of three fences very close

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.409 
is the first of three fences very close
together<00:04:06.859> that's<00:04:07.489> not<00:04:07.669> so<00:04:07.940> difficult<00:04:08.120> but

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
together that's not so difficult but

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.690 
together that's not so difficult but
looking<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:09.019> second<00:04:09.410> of<00:04:09.500> these<00:04:09.590> three<00:04:09.889> is

looking to the second of these three is

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
a small hole in a big hedge and I don't

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.580 
a small hole in a big hedge and I don't
know<00:04:14.389> if<00:04:14.540> horses<00:04:14.840> are<00:04:14.930> going<00:04:15.049> to<00:04:15.109> understand

know if horses are going to understand

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.810 
know if horses are going to understand
that<00:04:15.680> it's<00:04:15.829> possible<00:04:16.130> to<00:04:16.250> jump<00:04:16.430> through<00:04:16.700> it

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
that it's possible to jump through it

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.779 
that it's possible to jump through it
they<00:04:17.570> get<00:04:17.690> through<00:04:17.959> the<00:04:18.049> first<00:04:18.229> one<00:04:18.579> I'd<00:04:19.579> be

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
they get through the first one I'd be

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.940 
they get through the first one I'd be
pretty<00:04:20.120> confident<00:04:20.599> they'd<00:04:20.870> get<00:04:21.590> through<00:04:21.829> the

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
pretty confident they'd get through the

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.339 
pretty confident they'd get through the
second<00:04:22.280> one<00:04:22.310> number<00:04:22.669> 28<00:04:23.120> but<00:04:23.960> we're<00:04:24.080> getting

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
second one number 28 but we're getting

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.959 
second one number 28 but we're getting
so<00:04:24.950> close<00:04:25.130> to<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.340> end<00:04:25.490> of<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.669> course<00:04:25.880> that

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:25.969 
so close to the end of the course that

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:27.610 
so close to the end of the course that
I'm<00:04:26.210> frightened<00:04:26.599> they'll<00:04:26.719> be<00:04:26.810> tired

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
I'm frightened they'll be tired

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.280 
I'm frightened they'll be tired
and<00:04:27.710> it's<00:04:28.400> possible<00:04:28.880> that<00:04:29.600> they'll<00:04:29.780> opt<00:04:30.020> for

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
and it's possible that they'll opt for

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.070 
and it's possible that they'll opt for
the<00:04:30.380> long<00:04:31.280> but<00:04:31.669> easier<00:04:32.060> option<00:04:32.240> which<00:04:32.720> avoids

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
the long but easier option which avoids

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.189 
the long but easier option which avoids
these<00:04:33.410> two<00:04:33.620> holes<00:04:33.830> in<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:34.100> hedges<00:04:34.280> altogether

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
these two holes in the hedges altogether

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.420 
these two holes in the hedges altogether
stapling<00:04:36.199> facilities<00:04:36.770> for<00:04:37.040> some<00:04:37.190> of<00:04:37.340> the

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
teams are a little makeshift but the

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.780 
teams are a little makeshift but the
Australians<00:04:39.919> are<00:04:40.040> more<00:04:40.190> comfortable<00:04:40.490> than
