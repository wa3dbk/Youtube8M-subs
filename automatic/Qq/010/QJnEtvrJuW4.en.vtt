00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.889
 looks this week from the world's health animation to the most are with a letter that 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.160
 Many people have actually worried about a possible connection between the use of 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.070
 cell and the appearance of brain tumors rely on one of the largest 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.570
 The world's specialists for you get sick do not fall short if you have to say 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.220
 about whether you think you're still looking for the full service for you 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.220
 cell phone 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.640
 we are surrounded by radiation 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.349
 and could not 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.429
 I like to see 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.440
 most of it's a show 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.590
 radio antennas as 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.070
 victim of assault 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.100
 just like tv 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.240
 he said more 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.899
 wireless transmission networks 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.870
 cordless phones 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.180
 one of the devices of our day-to-day to emit some kind of radiation in this 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.580
 a group of experts linked to the world health organization 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.620
 decided to analyze all the studies already done on radiation 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.920
 issued from its side 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.910
 for the first time, scientists admit that there is a possibility that the 100 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.570
 dollars that may increase the risk of the appearance of some types of cancer 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.420
 the phone for more than half an hour a day over at least 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.070
 three years 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.120
 next to them is the biome 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.510
 the malignant tumor in the other brain is the minister loved the cancer in the membrane that 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.190
 involves the brain 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.580
 and the acoustic neuroma that forms inside the ear is not malignant but may 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.180
 cause deafness 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.390
 not what I could do is what science knows huh 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.110
 is in favor of nuclear technology 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.480
 this variation can kill and certainly cause cancer 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.070
 but it can also be used to attack cancer through radiotherapy or to 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.030
 take medical examinations 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.650
 this is not the same radiation from cell phones that use waves 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.710
 electromagnetic 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.750
 take cuspia radiation therapy usama de action irony people the cell phone 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.410
 was not even going to be a manager 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.640
 understand the difference 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.540
 still in this sense have high frequency accounts that reach up to 4-4 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.420
 in the formation of all tissues, said structure 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.220
 leading to the formation of cancer, and the rest is low 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.269
 we know that it produces heat but does not change matter 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.629
 the World Health Organization now wants more studies to understand 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.059
 better the harmful effects of the human body 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:34.169
 in chicago in the united states the reporter flávio fachel reverberated the 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.760
 subject with some of the greatest cancer experts on the planet. 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.829
 to better understand the significance of this study 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.250
 World Health Organization 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.140
 who made alerts regarding cell phone use, we came to 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.520
 chicago where one of the most important congresses in the world is taking place 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.619
 on the study of cancer 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:03:00.709
 thirty thousand doctors and researchers from all over the world discussing all kinds 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.209
 of cancer that exist that their carts 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.599
 at least here 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.940
 no one left to use the device as always only because of the alerts given 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.419
 of the world health organization 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:15.229
 If someone comes to the doctor's office, can I use the cell phone? 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:16.349
 example 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.099
 can and will not stop using the suspension period only a signal 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.909
 very important internal terms 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.709
 the conduct is not going to change this continues the communication with the 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.379
 Announcement I'll keep giving passes with content year this question 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:30.709
 already arrived 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.079
 in five minutes the doctor asked for an agreement and that he was one of the researchers 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.909
 who participated in the study 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.919
 and he clarifies at no time the research stated that the use of mobile 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.980
 what happened is that the radiation from the cell phones was 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.160
 rated at ders level b 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.049
 on a risk scale that exceeds 1/4 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.970
 with four indicates no risk my level 2b there is no evidence of 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:58.809
 but also can not rule out the risk beyond radiation 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:01.829
 of cell phones coffee is also in this category 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.739
 where smoke is present and asbestos is used for example 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.579
 proven to cause the Barueri disease in 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.539
 paulo case of the cell phones of the class with friends explains where the 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:18.409
 Oms concern it shows 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:23.059
 to use the apparatus near the ear the cells of this region of the head received 

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:28.229
 bombardment of high frequency electromagnetic waves very much like 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.599
 those emitted by domestic microwave appliances 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:36.199
 the problem says the doctor is that if this radiation actually causes cancer 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.860
 we still have no idea how this happens that the cut has had 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.090
 very 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.740
 I think the warning is the need for new studies to be done not 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.180
 this is a closed topic 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.349
 there is no formal proof 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.270
 simply an idea that you can go through an increased risk, I think 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.860
 this has not been proven 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.140
 for at least the next 10 years 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.290
 scientists will have to work hard to reach a 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.760
 the consequences of cell phone use on people's health 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.039
 here in brazil doctor gláucio siqueira wave specialist 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.300
 electromagnetic radiation explains that the amount of radiation from 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.119
 regulated by law and is too low to cause damages between concessions to 

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:22.580
 do some tests with various devices 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.259
 two days later the advice as if he were heard the remoteness 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:28.360
 already earlier 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.680
 that you can imagine us walking with him by the ticket is that the 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.960
 level of electric energy at the time of enumerating one or two thousandths 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.569
 but if you cheer it's a game to see if you show up here to talk about the challenge to 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:43.949
 side of the screen and do an MPs update 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.529
 they do not see 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:53.459
 but gave to 600 and 900 thousand 400 working hard now passing a 

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:55.139
 a little 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.550
 it has already been operated and does not intend to adopt we will not see this distance 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.819
 what 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:03.279
 this phone 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:08.259
 here is very low so sr 45 are investigating the case 4 lt and ltz 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:13.089
 martiniano sex strike until that little gadget appeared when the people 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:18.520
 presents and also marks the same thing with which it will be the 3 406 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.520
 this distance of 40 cents that the same distance 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.319
 if you re-form government 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:27.539
 practically living nowadays 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:33.050
 so attention most holders comes with headset today study 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.849
 of influence on panel decision of scientists 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:40.139
 but so that the electromagnetic field of the cellular increase of electrical activity 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:45.429
 of the brain and also taking the local temperature to 

00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:46.449
 would 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:49.740
 perfect lefts is a thing as well 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:56.539
 among the wounded as some states are made a delay delay after the 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:58.379
 complaint 

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:01.379
 children have more skull in the informal sector 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:04.240
 the fighter of mma deeper 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.639
 hence the need to be more careful with it 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:11.399
 Let's have your squad be taken according to the experts 

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:15.899
 avoid using cell phones for children do not let yours in the case of the pillow 

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:20.749
 - and as an alarm clock so your body does not receive radiation during sleep 

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:25.419
 avoid loading the phone one-by-one by the belt cover you go 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:33.099
 retire and when you can land text messages it is cheaper what you think 

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:35.610
 the phone to write the script 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:36.409
 bernanke 

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:40.809
 all this is precaution so far the only use of the cell phone that 

00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:45.960
 health is in traffic 

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:51.710
 even reading text messages increases by four times the chance 

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:52.569
 to cause the accident
