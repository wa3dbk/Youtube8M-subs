00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.470 

so<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> great<00:00:19.260> day<00:00:20.270> we've<00:00:21.270> been

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
so this is a great day we've been

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.750 
so this is a great day we've been
working<00:00:21.750> very<00:00:21.990> hard<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.740> get<00:00:22.950> this<00:00:23.190> car<00:00:23.490> in

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
working very hard to get this car in

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.910 
working very hard to get this car in
this<00:00:23.880> shape<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.540> now<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> first<00:00:25.619> time<00:00:25.800> I

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
this shape and now it's the first time I

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.670 
this shape and now it's the first time I
drive<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.160> car<00:00:26.570> truly<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.779> out-of-the-box

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
drive this car truly in out-of-the-box

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.030 
drive this car truly in out-of-the-box
drive<00:00:29.040> for<00:00:29.279> me<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:30.080> have<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.230> say<00:00:31.410> also<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
drive for me and have to say also the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.479 
drive for me and have to say also the
already<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.970> first<00:00:33.300> few<00:00:33.510> meters<00:00:33.870> told<00:00:34.140> me

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
already the first few meters told me

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.360 
already the first few meters told me
that<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.730> car<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.150> exactly<00:00:36.920> what<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:38.070> wanted

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
that this car is exactly what we wanted

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.500 
that this car is exactly what we wanted
to<00:00:38.610> be<00:00:39.030> I'm<00:00:39.320> feeling<00:00:40.320> home<00:00:41.220> immediately<00:00:41.910> after

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
to be I'm feeling home immediately after

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.420 
to be I'm feeling home immediately after
stepping<00:00:42.989> into<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.710> vehicle<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.400> first

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
stepping into that vehicle the first

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.020 
stepping into that vehicle the first
time<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:45.830> actually<00:00:46.830> that<00:00:47.100> feeling<00:00:47.520> home<00:00:47.730> is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
time and actually that feeling home is

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.290 
time and actually that feeling home is
triggered<00:00:48.540> by<00:00:48.830> just<00:00:49.830> the<00:00:50.269> harmony<00:00:51.269> between

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
triggered by just the harmony between

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.509 
triggered by just the harmony between
the<00:00:51.960> different<00:00:52.379> attributes<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.220> is<00:00:53.370> not

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
the different attributes and that is not

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.850 
the different attributes and that is not
only<00:00:53.850> between<00:00:53.970> the<00:00:54.479> attributes<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.199> the

although<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.689> coffee<00:01:19.930> is<00:01:20.170> very<00:01:20.409> agile<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
although the coffee is very agile the

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.709 
although the coffee is very agile the
comfort<00:01:22.750> level<00:01:22.899> is<00:01:23.399> it's<00:01:24.399> really<00:01:24.759> good<00:01:25.060> it's

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
comfort level is it's really good it's

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.969 
comfort level is it's really good it's
not<00:01:25.899> not<00:01:26.439> harsh<00:01:26.770> it's<00:01:27.189> very<00:01:28.119> controlled<00:01:28.979> so

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
not not harsh it's very controlled so

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.399 
not not harsh it's very controlled so
first<00:01:30.369> time<00:01:30.700> driving<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.570> vehicle<00:01:31.990> gives<00:01:32.289> a

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
first time driving the vehicle gives a

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.700 
first time driving the vehicle gives a
fairly<00:01:32.740> solid<00:01:32.979> impression<00:01:33.689> which<00:01:34.710> confirms

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
fairly solid impression which confirms

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.679 
fairly solid impression which confirms
that<00:01:35.920> our<00:01:36.420> structural<00:01:37.420> stiffness

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
that our structural stiffness

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.929 
that our structural stiffness
measurements<00:01:39.000> already<00:01:40.000> indicated<00:01:40.659> that<00:01:41.229> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
measurements already indicated that the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.149 
measurements already indicated that the
structure<00:01:42.939> itself<00:01:43.030> is<00:01:43.630> stiffer<00:01:44.380> than<00:01:44.770> what<00:01:45.009> we

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
structure itself is stiffer than what we

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.639 
structure itself is stiffer than what we
had<00:01:45.340> used<00:01:45.640> in<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.179> Indian<00:01:47.079> one<00:01:47.259> prototype

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
had used in the Indian one prototype

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:54.470 
had used in the Indian one prototype
base

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.680 

yeah<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.290> car<00:01:55.620> is<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> real<00:01:56.250> fault<00:01:56.640> because<00:01:57.180> of

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
yeah this car is a real fault because of

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.160 
yeah this car is a real fault because of
the<00:01:57.930> agility<00:01:58.470> and<00:01:59.090> at<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.780> same<00:02:00.960> time

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the agility and at the same time

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.420 
the agility and at the same time
providing<00:02:01.650> a<00:02:01.980> feeling<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:03.260> refinement<00:02:04.430> so

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
providing a feeling of refinement so

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.540 
providing a feeling of refinement so
it's<00:02:05.880> not<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.360> sports<00:02:07.200> car<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.830> is<00:02:07.980> demanding

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
it's not a sports car that is demanding

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.190 
it's not a sports car that is demanding
to<00:02:08.580> drive<00:02:09.140> but<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.740> a<00:02:11.010> jerk<00:02:11.670> HR<00:02:12.270> car<00:02:12.540> which

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
to drive but it's a a jerk HR car which

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.010 
to drive but it's a a jerk HR car which
is<00:02:13.440> easy<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.800> drive<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.550> feels<00:02:15.540> refined

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
is easy to drive and feels refined

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.470 
is easy to drive and feels refined
that's<00:02:16.830> exactly<00:02:17.220> what<00:02:17.700> we<00:02:18.060> want<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.360> achieve

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
that's exactly what we want to achieve

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:30.340 
that's exactly what we want to achieve
in<00:02:18.780> our<00:02:18.900> vehicles

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.410
