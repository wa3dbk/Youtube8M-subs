card<00:03:57.250> we<00:03:57.400> can<00:03:57.580> see<00:03:57.850> very<00:03:58.209> clearly<00:03:58.540> this<00:03:58.780> is<00:03:58.959> a

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
card we can see very clearly this is a

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.440 
card we can see very clearly this is a
custom<00:03:59.440> PCB<00:03:59.800> it<00:04:00.100> is<00:04:00.190> a<00:04:00.220> very<00:04:00.580> very<00:04:00.790> very<00:04:01.000> custom

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
custom PCB it is a very very very custom

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.420 
custom PCB it is a very very very custom
and<00:04:01.570> is<00:04:01.630> much<00:04:01.959> longer<00:04:02.170> than<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.590> standard<00:04:02.650> gtx

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
and is much longer than the standard gtx

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.650 
and is much longer than the standard gtx
680<00:04:03.790> PCB<00:04:04.360> it<00:04:04.750> also<00:04:04.930> has<00:04:05.230> dual<00:04:05.950> 6<00:04:06.820> PR<00:04:07.060> 8<00:04:07.420> pin

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
680 PCB it also has dual 6 PR 8 pin

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.750 
680 PCB it also has dual 6 PR 8 pin
power<00:04:07.900> connectors<00:04:08.470> so<00:04:09.010> it<00:04:09.220> is<00:04:09.340> designed

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
power connectors so it is designed

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.330 
power connectors so it is designed
presumably<00:04:10.480> with<00:04:10.780> beefier<00:04:11.440> vrm<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.100> you<00:04:12.160> can

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
presumably with beefier vrm and you can

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.070 
presumably with beefier vrm and you can
even<00:04:12.519> see<00:04:12.760> that<00:04:12.790> there's<00:04:13.090> a<00:04:13.150> lot<00:04:13.450> more<00:04:13.480> built

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
even see that there's a lot more built

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.800 
even see that there's a lot more built
onto<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.500> card<00:04:14.739> then<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.760> stock<00:04:16.090> card<00:04:16.390> it

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
onto the card then the stock card it

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.470 
onto the card then the stock card it
also<00:04:17.079> has<00:04:17.560> a<00:04:17.799> much<00:04:18.370> more<00:04:18.670> substantial<00:04:18.880> cooler

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
also has a much more substantial cooler

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.800 
also has a much more substantial cooler
so<00:04:19.720> this<00:04:19.840> is<00:04:19.989> triple

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
so this is triple

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.020 
so this is triple
ninety-two<00:04:21.560> millimeter<00:04:21.950> cooling<00:04:22.310> fans<00:04:22.550> on<00:04:22.850> an

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
ninety-two millimeter cooling fans on an

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.270 
ninety-two millimeter cooling fans on an
impressive<00:04:23.600> I<00:04:24.110> mean<00:04:24.410> this<00:04:24.530> thing<00:04:24.740> is<00:04:24.770> really

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
impressive I mean this thing is really

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.860 
impressive I mean this thing is really
heavy<00:04:25.610> this<00:04:25.760> is<00:04:25.940> a<00:04:26.060> heavy<00:04:26.330> card<00:04:26.630> on<00:04:26.750> an

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
heavy this is a heavy card on an

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.920 
heavy this is a heavy card on an
impressive<00:04:27.520> copper<00:04:28.520> with<00:04:28.880> five<00:04:29.419> heat<00:04:29.690> pipes

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
impressive copper with five heat pipes

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.290 
impressive copper with five heat pipes
and<00:04:30.169> then<00:04:30.290> aluminum<00:04:30.830> fin<00:04:31.160> array<00:04:31.850> that<00:04:32.120> goes

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
and then aluminum fin array that goes

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.050 
and then aluminum fin array that goes
the<00:04:32.840> entire<00:04:33.320> length<00:04:33.590> of<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.889> card<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.340> then

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
the entire length of the card and then

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.210 
the entire length of the card and then
some<00:04:35.419> so<00:04:35.630> you<00:04:35.720> can<00:04:35.900> see<00:04:36.110> here<00:04:36.410> where<00:04:36.919> all<00:04:36.950> the

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
some so you can see here where all the

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.980 
some so you can see here where all the
heat<00:04:37.340> pipes<00:04:37.610> are<00:04:37.820> running<00:04:38.090> -<00:04:38.270> this<00:04:38.480> is<00:04:38.660> uh<00:04:38.690> oh

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
heat pipes are running - this is uh oh

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.730 
heat pipes are running - this is uh oh
okay<00:04:39.350> so<00:04:39.950> this<00:04:40.100> is<00:04:40.310> a<00:04:41.139> plastic<00:04:42.139> or<00:04:42.530> than<00:04:42.650> if

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
okay so this is a plastic or than if

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.909 
okay so this is a plastic or than if
it's<00:04:42.919> a<00:04:42.950> plastic<00:04:43.130> shroud<00:04:43.580> but<00:04:44.360> here<00:04:45.080> we<00:04:45.169> go

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
it's a plastic shroud but here we go

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.100 
it's a plastic shroud but here we go
so<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.430> GPU<00:04:46.760> is<00:04:46.820> right<00:04:46.970> about<00:04:47.120> there<00:04:47.389> right<00:04:47.600> in

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
so the GPU is right about there right in

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.570 
so the GPU is right about there right in
between<00:04:48.410> these<00:04:48.500> two<00:04:48.740> fans<00:04:48.950> these<00:04:49.130> fans<00:04:49.400> are

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
between these two fans these fans are

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.010 
between these two fans these fans are
covering<00:04:49.820> almost<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.150> entire<00:04:50.510> surface<00:04:50.750> area

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
covering almost the entire surface area

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.000 
covering almost the entire surface area
of<00:04:51.169> the<00:04:51.290> card<00:04:51.500> as<00:04:51.620> well

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
of the card as well

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.159 
of the card as well
blowing<00:04:52.460> down<00:04:52.610> not<00:04:53.030> only<00:04:53.389> on<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:53.600> GPU<00:04:53.930> in<00:04:54.080> the

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
blowing down not only on the GPU in the

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.260 
blowing down not only on the GPU in the
memory<00:04:54.440> itself<00:04:54.590> but<00:04:55.340> also<00:04:55.610> on<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.240> other

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
memory itself but also on the other

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.760 
memory itself but also on the other
components<00:04:56.900> so<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.080> memories<00:04:57.380> covered<00:04:57.680> in

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
components so the memories covered in

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.260 
components so the memories covered in
heat<00:04:57.979> spreader<00:04:58.280> and<00:04:58.490> you<00:04:58.760> can<00:04:58.910> see<00:04:59.120> where

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
heat spreader and you can see where

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.730 
heat spreader and you can see where
these<00:04:59.450> heat<00:04:59.630> pipes<00:04:59.840> are<00:04:59.990> heading<00:05:00.229> off<00:05:00.320> to<00:05:00.560> so<00:05:00.710> a

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
these heat pipes are heading off to so a

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.620 
these heat pipes are heading off to so a
couple<00:05:01.010> of<00:05:01.130> them<00:05:01.250> go<00:05:01.370> pretty<00:05:01.610> close<00:05:01.850> and<00:05:02.120> then

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
couple of them go pretty close and then

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.810 
couple of them go pretty close and then
the<00:05:03.020> farthest<00:05:03.710> out<00:05:03.830> one<00:05:04.040> carries<00:05:04.520> heat<00:05:04.700> over

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
the farthest out one carries heat over

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.790 
the farthest out one carries heat over
here<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.630> next<00:05:05.930> farthest<00:05:06.290> out<00:05:06.380> one<00:05:06.530> carries

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
here the next farthest out one carries

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.650 
here the next farthest out one carries
heat<00:05:07.010> here<00:05:07.310> and<00:05:07.490> the<00:05:08.060> furthest<00:05:08.389> out<00:05:08.479> one<00:05:08.630> on

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
heat here and the furthest out one on

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.150 
heat here and the furthest out one on
this<00:05:08.840> side<00:05:08.990> carries<00:05:09.350> heat<00:05:09.530> right<00:05:09.800> to<00:05:09.919> the<00:05:10.040> end

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
this side carries heat right to the end

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.070 
this side carries heat right to the end
there<00:05:10.340> so<00:05:10.370> if<00:05:10.970> we<00:05:11.270> look<00:05:11.450> at<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.660> positioning

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
there so if we look at the positioning

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.110 
there so if we look at the positioning
of<00:05:12.200> the<00:05:12.260> heat<00:05:12.410> pipes<00:05:12.590> and<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:12.860> fans<00:05:13.130> each<00:05:13.760> fan

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
of the heat pipes and the fans each fan

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.810 
of the heat pipes and the fans each fan
is<00:05:14.360> blowing<00:05:14.570> down<00:05:14.960> directly<00:05:15.680> onto<00:05:15.889> fins<00:05:16.310> that

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
is blowing down directly onto fins that

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.100 
is blowing down directly onto fins that
are<00:05:16.940> right<00:05:17.090> near<00:05:17.240> heat<00:05:17.479> pipes<00:05:17.690> so<00:05:17.840> we<00:05:17.960> should

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
are right near heat pipes so we should

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.900 
are right near heat pipes so we should
have<00:05:18.229> heat<00:05:18.470> being<00:05:18.650> directly<00:05:19.130> delivered<00:05:19.610> it's

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
have heat being directly delivered it's

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:20.980 
have heat being directly delivered it's
too<00:05:20.000> bad<00:05:20.090> they<00:05:20.240> weren't<00:05:20.419> able<00:05:20.479> to<00:05:20.630> put<00:05:20.750> in<00:05:20.840> one

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
too bad they weren't able to put in one

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.330 
too bad they weren't able to put in one
more<00:05:21.020> heat<00:05:21.320> pipe<00:05:21.500> right<00:05:21.710> here<00:05:21.740> but<00:05:22.100> I<00:05:22.130> guess

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
more heat pipe right here but I guess

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.340 
more heat pipe right here but I guess
you<00:05:22.490> can't<00:05:22.729> really<00:05:22.880> ask<00:05:22.940> for<00:05:23.210> too<00:05:23.900> much<00:05:23.930> in

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
you can't really ask for too much in

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.140 
you can't really ask for too much in
terms<00:05:24.680> of<00:05:24.890> outputs<00:05:25.250> oh<00:05:25.400> this<00:05:25.789> is<00:05:25.910> interesting

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
terms of outputs oh this is interesting

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.930 
terms of outputs oh this is interesting
okay<00:05:26.510> so<00:05:26.750> we've<00:05:26.990> got<00:05:27.020> DisplayPort<00:05:27.919> and<00:05:28.100> three

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
okay so we've got DisplayPort and three

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.980 
okay so we've got DisplayPort and three
mini<00:05:29.210> HDMI<00:05:30.340> that<00:05:31.340> is<00:05:31.520> a<00:05:31.640> very<00:05:31.940> strange<00:05:32.419> output

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
mini HDMI that is a very strange output

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.890 
mini HDMI that is a very strange output
configuration<00:05:33.740> I<00:05:34.270> wonder<00:05:35.270> why<00:05:35.390> they<00:05:35.600> did<00:05:35.780> that

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.270 

um<00:05:41.020> okay<00:05:42.020> well<00:05:42.260> I<00:05:42.320> guess<00:05:42.560> I'd<00:05:42.710> probably<00:05:43.130> opt

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
um okay well I guess I'd probably opt

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.710 
um okay well I guess I'd probably opt
for<00:05:43.460> a<00:05:43.490> DisplayPort<00:05:44.000> out<00:05:44.090> of<00:05:44.210> the<00:05:44.300> three

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
for a DisplayPort out of the three

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.159 
for a DisplayPort out of the three
just<00:05:45.169> because<00:05:45.470> mini<00:05:45.710> HDMI<00:05:46.310> is<00:05:46.370> not<00:05:47.020> not<00:05:48.020> the

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
just because mini HDMI is not not the

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:49.930 
just because mini HDMI is not not the
best<00:05:48.350> thing<00:05:48.560> in<00:05:48.680> the<00:05:48.770> world<00:05:48.800> for<00:05:49.130> outputting

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
best thing in the world for outputting

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.870 
best thing in the world for outputting
at<00:05:50.530> 120<00:05:51.530> Hertz<00:05:51.740> at<00:05:51.950> 1080p<00:05:52.340> for<00:05:52.789> 3d<00:05:53.150> so<00:05:54.789> hold<00:05:55.789> on

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
at 120 Hertz at 1080p for 3d so hold on

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.210 
at 120 Hertz at 1080p for 3d so hold on
just<00:05:55.970> a<00:05:56.090> minute<00:05:56.180> guys

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
just a minute guys

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.070 
just a minute guys
well<00:05:58.220> galaxy<00:05:59.030> does<00:05:59.240> whatever<00:05:59.630> they<00:05:59.780> please

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
well galaxy does whatever they please

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.110 
well galaxy does whatever they please
when<00:06:00.320> it<00:06:00.440> comes<00:06:00.650> to<00:06:00.950> outputs<00:06:01.580> it<00:06:01.729> turns<00:06:01.910> out<00:06:02.090> I

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
when it comes to outputs it turns out I

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.700 
when it comes to outputs it turns out I
mean<00:06:02.330> they're<00:06:02.450> MDT<00:06:02.960> cards<00:06:03.289> from<00:06:03.410> the<00:06:03.530> last

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
mean they're MDT cards from the last

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.110 
mean they're MDT cards from the last
generation<00:06:03.860> we're<00:06:04.340> a<00:06:04.370> great<00:06:04.580> example<00:06:04.850> of<00:06:05.060> that

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
generation we're a great example of that

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.029 
generation we're a great example of that
where<00:06:05.240> they<00:06:05.510> were<00:06:05.539> like<00:06:05.810> oh<00:06:06.020> and<00:06:06.650> video<00:06:06.830> says

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
where they were like oh and video says

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.620 
where they were like oh and video says
we<00:06:07.220> can<00:06:07.340> only<00:06:07.460> do<00:06:07.639> two<00:06:07.880> displays<00:06:08.240> at<00:06:08.389> a<00:06:08.450> time

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
we can only do two displays at a time

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.770 
we can only do two displays at a time
well<00:06:08.960> we<00:06:09.260> can<00:06:09.410> do<00:06:09.470> three<00:06:09.650> haha<00:06:10.360> so<00:06:11.360> there<00:06:11.690> you

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
well we can do three haha so there you

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.240 
well we can do three haha so there you
go<00:06:11.960> they've<00:06:12.229> gone<00:06:12.380> with<00:06:12.530> DisplayPort<00:06:13.130> and

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
go they've gone with DisplayPort and

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.779 
go they've gone with DisplayPort and
three<00:06:13.850> mini<00:06:14.060> HDMI<00:06:14.660> connections<00:06:15.610> you've<00:06:16.610> also

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
three mini HDMI connections you've also

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:20.290 
three mini HDMI connections you've also
got<00:06:17.150> an<00:06:17.419> open<00:06:17.930> sort<00:06:18.889> of<00:06:19.010> second<00:06:19.550> PCI<00:06:19.850> bracket

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
got an open sort of second PCI bracket

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.879 
got an open sort of second PCI bracket
so<00:06:20.419> what<00:06:20.539> that<00:06:20.630> means<00:06:20.840> is<00:06:20.990> this<00:06:21.110> is<00:06:21.169> very<00:06:21.680> much

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889 
so what that means is this is very much

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.250 
so what that means is this is very much
an<00:06:22.160> internal<00:06:23.000> airflow<00:06:23.419> card<00:06:23.750> so<00:06:23.990> you're<00:06:24.139> gonna

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
an internal airflow card so you're gonna

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.600 
an internal airflow card so you're gonna
exhaust<00:06:24.560> a<00:06:24.740> little<00:06:24.770> bit<00:06:25.070> out<00:06:25.130> the<00:06:25.250> back<00:06:25.370> of<00:06:25.400> the

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
exhaust a little bit out the back of the

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.190 
exhaust a little bit out the back of the
case<00:06:25.789> but<00:06:26.120> you<00:06:26.330> better<00:06:26.690> make<00:06:26.810> sure<00:06:26.870> you<00:06:27.080> have<00:06:27.169> a

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
case but you better make sure you have a

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.690 
case but you better make sure you have a
case<00:06:27.410> with<00:06:27.560> good<00:06:27.740> airflow<00:06:27.919> which<00:06:28.310> I<00:06:28.430> hope<00:06:28.580> if

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
case with good airflow which I hope if

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.040 
case with good airflow which I hope if
you're<00:06:28.820> buying<00:06:28.970> a<00:06:29.090> GTX<00:06:29.510> 680

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
you're buying a GTX 680

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.249 
you're buying a GTX 680
sort<00:06:30.800> of<00:06:30.889> figured<00:06:31.430> out<00:06:31.520> now<00:06:31.940> of<00:06:32.240> no<00:06:32.539> is<00:06:32.840> the

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:33.259 
sort of figured out now of no is the

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.439 
sort of figured out now of no is the
fact<00:06:33.500> that<00:06:33.710> okay<00:06:34.099> so<00:06:34.159> two<00:06:34.490> things<00:06:34.669> I've<00:06:35.060> note

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:35.449 
fact that okay so two things I've note

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:37.059 
fact that okay so two things I've note
is<00:06:35.690> the<00:06:35.870> fact<00:06:35.990> that<00:06:36.139> you<00:06:36.289> see<00:06:36.440> how<00:06:36.560> easy<00:06:36.800> it<00:06:36.979> is

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:37.069 
is the fact that you see how easy it is

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:38.740 
is the fact that you see how easy it is
to<00:06:37.340> access<00:06:37.490> the<00:06:37.849> screws<00:06:38.150> that<00:06:38.330> hold<00:06:38.569> these

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
to access the screws that hold these

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.379 
to access the screws that hold these
fans<00:06:39.080> on<00:06:39.289> can<00:06:39.530> you<00:06:39.590> see<00:06:39.740> that<00:06:40.150> that's<00:06:41.150> really

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:41.389 
fans on can you see that that's really

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:43.480 
fans on can you see that that's really
cool<00:06:41.599> take<00:06:42.080> out<00:06:42.199> three<00:06:42.409> screws<00:06:42.680> pop<00:06:43.190> the<00:06:43.310> fan

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
cool take out three screws pop the fan

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.339 
cool take out three screws pop the fan
off<00:06:43.669> you<00:06:43.879> can<00:06:44.060> easily<00:06:44.360> clean<00:06:44.990> out<00:06:45.169> your

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:45.349 
off you can easily clean out your

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:46.990 
off you can easily clean out your
graphics<00:06:45.740> card<00:06:45.949> get<00:06:46.190> all<00:06:46.280> the<00:06:46.400> dust<00:06:46.580> out<00:06:46.729> of<00:06:46.789> it

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
graphics card get all the dust out of it

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.390 
graphics card get all the dust out of it
completely<00:06:47.690> having<00:06:48.500> removed<00:06:48.710> the<00:06:48.919> fans<00:06:49.129> from

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 
completely having removed the fans from

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.430 
completely having removed the fans from
it<00:06:49.520> and<00:06:49.669> I<00:06:49.699> think<00:06:50.690> that's<00:06:51.020> a<00:06:51.110> very<00:06:51.289> cool

opposed<00:07:14.900> to<00:07:15.050> like<00:07:15.440> yellow<00:07:16.159> white<00:07:16.460> so<00:07:16.940> an

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.150 
opposed to like yellow white so an

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.790 
opposed to like yellow white so an
example<00:07:17.659> of<00:07:17.810> a<00:07:17.900> build<00:07:18.110> that<00:07:18.199> this<00:07:18.469> would<00:07:18.650> look

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 
example of a build that this would look

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.939 
example of a build that this would look
absolutely<00:07:19.659> fantastic<00:07:20.659> in<00:07:20.810> is<00:07:21.229> one<00:07:21.500> like<00:07:21.710> this

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:21.949 
absolutely fantastic in is one like this

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:25.330 
absolutely fantastic in is one like this
where<00:07:22.610> the<00:07:22.879> inner<00:07:23.180> guts<00:07:23.750> are<00:07:24.340> predominantly

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:25.340 
where the inner guts are predominantly

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.520 
where the inner guts are predominantly
black<00:07:25.580> and<00:07:26.000> white<00:07:26.479> so<00:07:26.810> I<00:07:26.840> would<00:07:26.990> love<00:07:27.289> to

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:27.530 
black and white so I would love to

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.249 
black and white so I would love to
replace<00:07:27.800> the<00:07:28.520> Radeon<00:07:29.090> graphics<00:07:29.150> card<00:07:29.780> in<00:07:29.900> here

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:30.259 
replace the Radeon graphics card in here

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:34.689

with<00:07:30.680> a<00:07:32.379> suitably<00:07:33.379> white<00:07:33.710> the<00:07:34.130> GeForce

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:34.699 
with a suitably white the GeForce

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:38.010

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.020 
graphics card so check this out see

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.540 
graphics card so check this out see
white<00:07:39.020> and<00:07:39.169> black<00:07:39.319> theme<00:07:39.620> you<00:07:40.130> go<00:07:40.279> ahead<00:07:40.400> you

throw<00:07:40.969> one<00:07:41.120> of<00:07:41.210> these<00:07:41.360> in<00:07:41.539> there<00:07:41.770> how<00:07:42.770> beast

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:43.550 
throw one of these in there how beast

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.510 
throw one of these in there how beast
would<00:07:44.060> that<00:07:44.300> look<00:07:44.569> would<00:07:45.560> barely<00:07:45.979> even<00:07:46.099> fit<00:07:46.490> to

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520 
would that look would barely even fit to

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.129 
would that look would barely even fit to
even<00:07:46.940> though<00:07:47.029> this<00:07:47.090> is<00:07:47.240> an<00:07:47.360> arc<00:07:47.569> media<00:07:47.900> this<00:07:47.990> is

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:48.139 
even though this is an arc media this is

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:51.430 
even though this is an arc media this is
a<00:07:48.169> long<00:07:48.699> graphics<00:07:49.699> card<00:07:49.969> you<00:07:50.259> know<00:07:51.259> what<00:07:51.409> I

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 
a long graphics card you know what I

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.749 
a long graphics card you know what I
think<00:07:51.529> I<00:07:51.740> have<00:07:51.860> a<00:07:51.919> tape<00:07:52.099> measure<00:07:52.130> here<00:07:52.580> yeah

00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:52.759 
think I have a tape measure here yeah

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:54.309 
think I have a tape measure here yeah
let's<00:07:53.029> measure<00:07:53.240> how<00:07:53.449> long<00:07:53.690> it<00:07:53.840> is<00:07:53.930> because

00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 
let's measure how long it is because

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:57.540 
let's measure how long it is because
this<00:07:54.500> must<00:07:54.800> be<00:07:54.979> close<00:07:55.340> to<00:07:55.370> the<00:07:55.669> 12<00:07:56.090> inches

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:57.550 
this must be close to the 12 inches

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.420 
this must be close to the 12 inches
alright<00:07:58.629> so<00:07:59.629> from<00:07:59.810> the<00:08:00.020> back<00:08:00.139> of<00:08:00.469> the<00:08:00.800> there<00:08:01.219> so

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:01.430 
alright so from the back of the there so

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.519 
alright so from the back of the there so
11<00:08:01.909> and<00:08:02.090> 1/2<00:08:02.150> inches<00:08:02.750> so<00:08:02.930> make<00:08:03.110> sure<00:08:03.259> you<00:08:03.379> have

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:03.529 
11 and 1/2 inches so make sure you have

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:06.339 
11 and 1/2 inches so make sure you have
a<00:08:03.560> case<00:08:03.860> that<00:08:04.550> is<00:08:04.699> capable<00:08:05.270> of<00:08:05.360> housing<00:08:05.599> an<00:08:05.960> 11

00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:06.349 
a case that is capable of housing an 11

00:08:06.349 --> 00:08:07.930 
a case that is capable of housing an 11
and<00:08:06.409> a<00:08:06.500> half<00:08:06.529> inch<00:08:06.919> graphics<00:08:07.370> card<00:08:07.580> before<00:08:07.849> you

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:07.940 
and a half inch graphics card before you

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.339 
and a half inch graphics card before you
go<00:08:08.029> ahead<00:08:08.150> and<00:08:08.270> install<00:08:08.449> one<00:08:08.629> of<00:08:08.690> these<00:08:08.840> so

00:08:09.339 --> 00:08:09.349 
go ahead and install one of these so
