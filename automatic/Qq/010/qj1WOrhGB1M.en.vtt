fruit tree need to be pollinated if they

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.140 
fruit tree need to be pollinated if they
are<00:00:11.139> to<00:00:11.260> become<00:00:11.380> fruit<00:00:11.920> and<00:00:12.639> this<00:00:12.790> is<00:00:12.940> usually

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
are to become fruit and this is usually

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.710 
are to become fruit and this is usually
done<00:00:13.509> by<00:00:13.570> flying<00:00:14.110> insects<00:00:15.150> some<00:00:16.150> fruit<00:00:16.449> trees
