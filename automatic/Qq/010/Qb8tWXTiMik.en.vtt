00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hi guys, how are you? I'm fine today. 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.609
 characterized on Sunday day when 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.049
 show you some of the things 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.849
 What does it look like in my kitchen? 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.769
 because you ask me why I 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.719
 I took in my diet what I'm doing 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.580
 so today I'll show you 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.250
 shouted the last tank with me some 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.080
 explanations connect this video a video 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.570
 that I had done a course on how 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.060
 I make a good girl, come on let's go 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.920
 starting with water I usually take water 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.279
 that is the bottle of a 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.420
 grape juice and it's green and here 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.579
 inside there is something I took from my 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.100
 filter we put the waters of these 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.239
 green bottles put in the sun for 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.950
 a whole day 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.030
 then we take it and put it on top of it. 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.110
 table waiting to stand at room temperature 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.090
 and dep 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.950
 we believe that the analyzed waters 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.629
 has more energy than ordinary water is a 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.070
 water as well as more vitality and 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.140
 ends up taking the habit and now it 's 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.730
 Doing this always, so this takes this 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.170
 sonorized line drawing like any other 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.149
 work that take normal goal 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.070
 here's a gelatin I ate one 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.680
 little snack in the morning she does not 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.180
 It's sugar in here, there are eggs I 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.949
 I also bought because when you take a 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.680
 protein chicken I usually eat an egg 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.119
 cooked and when a very light day does not 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.920
 how they acted just like the clear 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.570
 now let's look at my refrigerator 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.240
 here we have cheese but I do not know 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.340
 How is it that every day here has my 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.840
 little brother looks sliced I usually eat 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.470
 every day very little 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.299
 here we have this garlic here that 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.790
 I usually season my chickens 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.770
 with that my chicken is very light 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.810
 here we have a coke but it is not 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.670
 exactly our people buy here 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.320
 because my father had a heart attack time 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.360
 when his friends come to visit him 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.009
 so we offer coke to 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.740
 pretend we're normal people 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.110
 here we have a lettuce is that I 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.210
 I usually eat there every day, there's a 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.890
 tomato I love tomato cabbage I 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.869
 I usually do in steam also raises the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.890
 I work here but what I like the half 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.700
 night when I feel like eating 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.729
 candy 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.909
 Look, we have pupils and here we have 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.590
 I think that Agustin I cress like 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.750
 every day is a Madrid 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.380
 I'm a rabbit people you do not 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.880
 to note that we have coconut water that 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.680
 We always find in the hortifruti 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.689
 But I'd rather buy coconut. 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.259
 here we have a chicken then from time to time 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.400
 When I get this chicken, it says fiuk and I do it. 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.040
 fritinho 9 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.959
 without oil and as a salad here we 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.189
 we have my beloved and loved flyer that 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.409
 makes delicious meats and chips in pinion 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.750
 amy our people yams and cassava chips 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:27.450
 here it seems that both the chip know 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.930
 one that can and yes this is thin 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.760
 who have no other I usually use 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.650
 this milk in my food what 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.260
 you put the site in the south and from there 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.120
 in the bathroom after good here we have 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.069
 a cat but I can not eat a cat 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.620
 my diet only cares for him 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.959
 I disturb manholes and pawn it and close it 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.959
 it is very tasty is my baby 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.440
 here is the machine we use to 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.299
 make orange juice every day is 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.150
 professional staff are those 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.650
 bakeries and then I always take one one 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.510
 cup this here is a lot of people we are 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.489
 too much sugar, no matter how much you do not 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.139
 puts this in the orange juice already has the 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.060
 fructose then fruit sugar 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.340
 Please do not exaggerate with this 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.069
 here we put it thinks that 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.810
 I put a blade here and there himself 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.519
 Do what makes the cucumber very thin 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.560
 I also do this to make criticisms that 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.819
 I told you guys and it feels really good. 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.099
 and I do not want my kitchen full 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.730
 equipment, nor does it help much 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.129
 people 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.290
 note that the whole kitchen has a temptation 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.799
 When you live alone, for example, do you have 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.659
 fan bonmee panetone bread down there 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.099
 You also have a knife, so you mean? 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.480
 really have to be focused because I 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.549
 I do not live alone, I live with my faith. 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.290
 in it then my daughter is not told 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.989
 It's said, it's me who has to have focus. 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.099
 in the beginning of bullshit or I too 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.290
 I wanted to talk to you, one thing is 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.780
 guys always ask me if you take a 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.620
 remedy a thermogenic something to 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.530
 lose weight 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.540
 no I do not take anything else nothing nothing 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.819
 nothing even're 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.829
 these diets these physical but have a 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.319
 thing that I do that a lot of people do not 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.940
 does and so in my vision it interferes 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.479
 A little bit because it's disruptive to me. 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.849
 little what is to eat rice noodles 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:08.370
 potato, these things I do not eat rice 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.220
 neither brown nor brown rice 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.359
 nothing is like me vegetables vegetables and 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.970
 a protein 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.709
 When I think it happens when I'm with 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.320
 will I know that makes this risk later 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.539
 I like a potato that as 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.850
 I had barbaric to me as 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.060
 fried potatoes but the 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.720
 I count very few things 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.030
 There are 5 little sweet potatoes 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.930
 It's going to get easier every day. 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.300
 Has as 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.610
 Okay, so what I usually do 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.040
 not as naked as flour like dog 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.170
 I drink anything with sugar or coffee. 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.050
 chocolate cappuccino is not the milk already 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.700
 I do not drink anything at all with this, I taste it 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.160
 I also am not in salt in the food and 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.080
 shelter you can see everything taking 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.300
 All my love so nobody ever said it is 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.440
 Easy, I also wanted to talk to you. 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.840
 that I 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.190
 besides having eaten the world they have fattened 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.930
 Because of this I also have 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.310
 tendency to gain weight because it is obvious that 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.640
 You and I know the people who 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.200
 they commit pigs and they do not get fat then 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.480
 I tend to fatten someone in the 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.460
 My fat family did not come to reward the 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.860
 My, I'm going to say that I've been in line 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.420
 genetic inheritance everyone because it is not 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.310
 The good news is that I got the good things and 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.500
 things are not helping us but 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.060
 bad if it improves things good taste is 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.220
 So people, I hope you have 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.500
