00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.379
 very good and as we are again very 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.810
 clear to bring you a new parameter 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.550
 1.7 points called magic classes or glasses 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.770
 magical and said this because it's all 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.020
 said let's see the way to start 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.060
 we have the ius he is now the order 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.189
 useless that in turn will give us the 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.539
 useless block this is the biggest thing that 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.670
 I have seen in a very long time in 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.529
 minecraft and good seeing this I'm going to 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.780
 take away this and this we're going to see for 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.059
 what is it apart from being useless in 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.820
 first place the now useless is going to 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.650
 to give it a useless ingot and burn it 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.510
 put it together like this because it's not going to give 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.510
 the useless block but we can also 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.989
 do with this on the useless sticks 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.159
 then with two useless helicopters 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.199
 we get four for the useless 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.119
 ok and now with three sticks if you do not have 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.190
 plus two glass panels we get 

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:59.229
 the glasses if not useful if the glasses 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.540
 useless we will simply have them here 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:05.950
 they are useless for nothing 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.690
 and that I'm going to leave I have it equipped not 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.760
 matter apart from that we can do 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.170
 also iron sticks simply because 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.060
 doing this we get four shovels 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.130
 of iron and from these sticks of 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.100
 iron and other materials that equal not 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.630
 they are iron, we will get the rest 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.630
 of the glasses some of the glasses 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.150
 they give special effects then we have 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.350
 the zoom stick voucher is created from this 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.720
 way simply three iron sticks 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.670
 and four gunpowder and from here 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.220
 we can do with this and two walls of 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.590
 glass the gleizes fans is worth then 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.290
 we already know, I'll leave it here 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.509
 then we have the wire that is cable 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.009
 ok then the cable is made of the 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.990
 next way with two iron sticks 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.369
 plus three eyes from in the next one 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.979
 way and when using them 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.470
 so we will get the wii of glass 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.440
 I'm going to take it from here too 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.900
 are you perfect and now let's see 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.340
 fret of the others is worth the mechanical 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.500
 classes would be as follows 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.479
 would be three iron sticks three of 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.450
 reston and two glass panels I the 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.010
 I'll catch here is the perfect 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.330
 Guaira has already taught the anchors 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.080
 they would be this way simply 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.520
 bone 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.970
 two black tinted glass panels 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.680
 plus three bags of black ink and I 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.570
 I'm going to put around here also after 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.610
 we have the English kirchners that are 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.110
 the hitler glasses would be this 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.780
 way three bones two pairs of glass 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.390
 normal plus three black ink I'm going to 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.670
 also put here the emeral classes 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.820
 that really look like a bra this 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.950
 it seems more person day bra but 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.320
 these also do not look like a bikini 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.550
 mavi then we see it here the one 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.340
 this would be as follows three 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.260
 of iron plus two emeralds and good 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.790
 three sticks of iron better said lasker 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.850
 Skeleton fan work must be put 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.100
 here would be like that 3 blake road 1 of 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.010
 good led eyes 4 left the in and two 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.709
 diamonds and the truth that is very now 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.790
 also teach the visors classes that 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.870
 He has already taught him that they are what I have 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.510
 put in the same one because they do not serve for 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.300
 nothing you already know the diamond that 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.100
 would create in this way and put 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.590
 also around here later we have the 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.690
 vinyl salts that would be this way 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.960
 three panels of magenta 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.800
 glass 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.660
 3 of black and then the 2 iron road that 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.340
 they are up and good once 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.350
 let's have this box let's see a little 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.940
 the effect they all have in 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.860
 first place let's put them vinyl 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.590
 you go out just to start by 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.020
 them and good as you see is going to add us 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.370
 several night vision defects 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.230
 strength regeneration and existence 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.140
 infinite guys that is in their new 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.970
 this has to be wonderful after 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.470
 we're going to put in the diamond 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.680
 to see if it has something it seems to me that 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.270
 not the diamond are simply 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.730
 aesthetic aspects then good more 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.340
 So aesthetic is not because they are very 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.470
 ugly but good, gentlemen, you have no 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.090
 measured the diamond I put those of hero 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.790
 brain and as you see I make myself invisible 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.980
 apart I also have night vision 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.530
 chopping fatigue strength regeneration 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.780
 distance to fire 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.520
 invisibility that I already counted and I think 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.990
 that with this we are almost immortal no 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.550
 I avoid this'll put in 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.980
 emerald that I think I do not know anything either 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.160
 not just having a bra on top 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.350
 and then we have hipster gleizes 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.760
 They do not do anything good if they give us 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.910
 choking fatigue 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.070
 and nothing else after we have the eels 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.810
 is that it gives us strength 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.630
 here you see her you do not know too much 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.440
 because my skin does not help this time either 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.750
 I should have changed my skin 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.300
 but it does not matter later we have the 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.280
 Class mechanics that gives us vision 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.340
 nightlife is pretty 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.979
 cool and finally we have the wireless 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.800
 bread is worth the wild gives us fatigue of itching 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.960
 and weakness, which is what it was that 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.240
 I remember very well, it does not matter how 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.180
 you see here we have and finally 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.030
 we have the fan glass is they are very very 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.770
 very very dodgy because it gives us slowness 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.810
 very much 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.720
 itching fatigue in this case without fatigue 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.240
 of itching is the bad it would be too 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.000
 super dodge damage by wilder too 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.360
 super nauseous nausea that is dizziness and 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.780
 good blindness you see that it is very much 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.729
 not then if we take off we take off 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.370
 good gives us about 20 more seconds or 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.870
 less of effect more apart after 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.550
 have taken us away but of course these 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.919
 twenty seconds we have died because it is 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.960
 impossible to survive with that I think that neither 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.080
 with a golden apple at night 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:28.770
 we could survive what causes us 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.650
 or my god is not those minutes worth it or 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.110
 believe me guys we are dead or with the 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.120
 works insiders we manage to survive 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.159
 so all we have left is to die 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.500
 and end this with this suffering 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:43.650
 once and for all so kill bar 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.139
 and the a response 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.360
 is that I had to leave him I had to leave 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.130
 this good way as you see we have already 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.300
 finished with the mold the layers themselves 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.520
 I do not have them because I was pretty 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.440
 away in the place where I had them like that 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.130
 that I liked drive x2 see you in 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.130
 the next video 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.030
 see you later
