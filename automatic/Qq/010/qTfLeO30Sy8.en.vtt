that's<00:02:34.500> what<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.459> is<00:02:35.489> so<00:02:35.879> there<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.480> have<00:02:36.510> it

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
that's what it is so there you have it

this<00:02:44.909> reduces<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.720> wheelbase<00:02:46.430> by<00:02:47.430> six<00:02:48.060> inches

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
this reduces the wheelbase by six inches
