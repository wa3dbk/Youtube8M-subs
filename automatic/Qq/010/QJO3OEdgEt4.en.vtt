hey what's going on guys this is a clip
from<00:00:01.800> 103<00:00:02.610> kill<00:00:02.939> non-lethal<00:00:03.570> gameplay<00:00:04.049> on<00:00:04.170> the

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
from 103 kill non-lethal gameplay on the

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.680 
from 103 kill non-lethal gameplay on the
map<00:00:04.410> meltdown<00:00:04.830> that's<00:00:05.040> 103<00:00:05.730> all<00:00:06.060> gun<00:00:06.420> kills

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
map meltdown that's 103 all gun kills

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.270 
map meltdown that's 103 all gun kills
and<00:00:07.170> I'm<00:00:07.230> actually<00:00:07.440> starting<00:00:07.859> it<00:00:08.040> at<00:00:08.160> this

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
and I'm actually starting it at this

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.549 
and I'm actually starting it at this
point<00:00:08.519> because<00:00:08.700> we<00:00:09.480> didn't<00:00:09.719> get<00:00:09.840> our<00:00:09.960> first<00:00:10.230> V

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
point because we didn't get our first V

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.039 
point because we didn't get our first V
set<00:00:10.830> up<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.370> air<00:00:11.490> until<00:00:11.730> 30<00:00:12.240> seconds<00:00:12.900> which

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
set up in the air until 30 seconds which

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.650 
set up in the air until 30 seconds which
just<00:00:13.259> leads<00:00:13.440> me<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.650> believe<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.299> I<00:00:15.299> need<00:00:15.450> to

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
just leads me to believe that I need to

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.210 
just leads me to believe that I need to
start<00:00:15.839> doing<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.289> more<00:00:16.500> often<00:00:16.680> I'm<00:00:16.949> pretty

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
start doing this more often I'm pretty

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.730 
start doing this more often I'm pretty
sure<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.760> could<00:00:18.000> get<00:00:18.240> if<00:00:18.869> not<00:00:19.170> break<00:00:19.529> at

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
sure that I could get if not break at

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.109 
sure that I could get if not break at
least<00:00:19.859> get<00:00:20.070> close<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> record<00:00:20.789> for

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
least get close to the record for

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.509 
least get close to the record for
non-lethal<00:00:21.420> kills<00:00:22.010> pretty<00:00:23.010> sure<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> record

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
non-lethal kills pretty sure the record

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.009 
non-lethal kills pretty sure the record
is<00:00:23.789> probably<00:00:24.210> up<00:00:24.359> there<00:00:24.390> somewhere<00:00:24.840> around

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
is probably up there somewhere around

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.099 
is probably up there somewhere around

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.030 
gunfights and have to coach at the same
time<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.090> when<00:01:54.930> we<00:01:55.020> finally<00:01:55.259> did<00:01:55.530> get<00:01:55.710> set<00:01:55.920> up

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
time so when we finally did get set up

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.190 
time so when we finally did get set up
this<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.310> what<00:01:56.430> happened<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.030> was<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:58.110> I

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
this is what happened it was a like I

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.560 
this is what happened it was a like I
said<00:01:58.380> 37<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:59.100> two<00:01:59.280> minutes<00:01:59.670> if<00:02:00.149> I'm<00:02:00.299> able<00:02:00.540> to

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
said 37 in two minutes if I'm able to

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.969 
said 37 in two minutes if I'm able to
keep<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.960> pace<00:02:01.200> that's<00:02:01.439> gonna<00:02:01.619> be<00:02:01.770> up<00:02:01.950> there

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
keep that pace that's gonna be up there

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.130 
keep that pace that's gonna be up there
around<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.460> hundred<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.850> 70<00:02:03.270> non-lethal<00:02:03.689> kills

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
around a hundred and 70 non-lethal kills

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.380 
around a hundred and 70 non-lethal kills
so<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:04.979> mean<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.670> find<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.969> right<00:02:06.090> Lobby

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
and believe me guys I've had the right

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.889 
and believe me guys I've had the right
Lobby<00:02:08.039> before<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.819> was<00:02:09.239> probably<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.750> right

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
Lobby before this was probably the right

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.930 
Lobby before this was probably the right
Lobby<00:02:10.200> but<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.679> just<00:02:11.009> took<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.430> long<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.819> get

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
Lobby but it just took so long to get

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.400 
Lobby but it just took so long to get
set<00:02:12.209> up<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.510> mean<00:02:12.660> like<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.870> said<00:02:13.050> we<00:02:13.140> didn't<00:02:13.290> even

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
set up I mean like I said we didn't even

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.960 
set up I mean like I said we didn't even
get<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
get the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.880 
get the
VSAT<00:02:14.330> up<00:02:14.510> until<00:02:14.780> 30<00:02:15.050> seconds<00:02:15.500> left<00:02:15.650> in<00:02:15.770> the

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
VSAT up until 30 seconds left in the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.150 
VSAT up until 30 seconds left in the
first<00:02:16.100> round<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.610> then<00:02:17.300> I<00:02:17.780> was<00:02:18.680> still<00:02:18.860> able<00:02:18.980> to

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
first round and then I was still able to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.310 
first round and then I was still able to
crank<00:02:19.460> out<00:02:19.580> 47<00:02:20.300> gun<00:02:20.570> kills<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.050> first

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
crank out 47 gun kills in the first

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.410 
crank out 47 gun kills in the first
round<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.980> don't<00:02:22.940> know<00:02:23.030> guys<00:02:23.180> I'm<00:02:23.390> thinking

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
round so I don't know guys I'm thinking

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.810 
round so I don't know guys I'm thinking
I<00:02:23.990> thinking<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.650> might<00:02:24.860> top<00:02:25.190> out<00:02:25.430> somewhere

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
I thinking I might top out somewhere

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.820 
I thinking I might top out somewhere
around<00:02:25.850> like<00:02:26.120> 150<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:26.810> mean<00:02:27.050> it's<00:02:27.230> pretty<00:02:27.560> damn

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
around like 150 I mean it's pretty damn

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.070 
around like 150 I mean it's pretty damn
hard<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:28.220> get<00:02:28.340> 150<00:02:29.090> gun<00:02:29.240> kills<00:02:29.510> no<00:02:29.690> matter<00:02:29.840> what

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
hard to get 150 gun kills no matter what

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.810 
hard to get 150 gun kills no matter what
you<00:02:30.230> run<00:02:30.410> even<00:02:30.590> if<00:02:30.770> you're<00:02:30.890> using<00:02:31.100> tech<00:02:31.460> insert

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
you run even if you're using tech insert

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.390 
you run even if you're using tech insert
and<00:02:32.000> stay<00:02:32.120> by<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.360> spawn<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:33.740> enemies<00:02:34.160> have

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
and stay by the spawn the enemies have

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.690 
and stay by the spawn the enemies have
to<00:02:34.580> really<00:02:35.030> really<00:02:35.450> be<00:02:35.690> contained<00:02:36.170> tightly<00:02:36.800> in

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
to really really be contained tightly in

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.340 
to really really be contained tightly in
ground<00:02:38.180> war<00:02:38.450> for<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:38.990> be<00:02:39.110> able<00:02:39.200> to

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
ground war for you to be able to

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.780 
ground war for you to be able to
accomplish<00:02:39.620> that<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.280> think<00:02:40.490> it's<00:02:40.610> pretty

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
accomplish that and I think it's pretty

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.400 
accomplish that and I think it's pretty
entertaining<00:02:41.090> watching<00:02:41.570> you<00:02:42.050> know<00:02:42.170> players

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
entertaining watching you know players

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.740 
entertaining watching you know players
