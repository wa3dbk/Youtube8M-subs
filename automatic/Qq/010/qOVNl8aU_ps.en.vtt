00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
here is that we just need to untangle

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.569 
here is that we just need to untangle
the<00:00:44.540> top<00:00:44.780> section<00:00:45.769> I've<00:00:46.070> already<00:00:46.309> done<00:00:46.460> a

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
the top section I've already done a

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:47.469 
the top section I've already done a
little<00:00:46.610> bit<00:00:46.850> of<00:00:46.970> it<00:00:47.059> already

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:47.479 
little bit of it already

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:49.660 
little bit of it already
so<00:00:47.930> that<00:00:48.110> it<00:00:48.320> opens<00:00:48.649> up<00:00:48.829> so<00:00:49.159> you<00:00:49.219> don't<00:00:49.519> need<00:00:49.610> a

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
so that it opens up so you don't need a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.399 
so that it opens up so you don't need a
wire<00:00:49.909> cutters<00:00:50.239> anything<00:00:50.629> and<00:00:50.809> then<00:00:50.989> we<00:00:51.140> start

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
wire cutters anything and then we start

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.179 
wire cutters anything and then we start
bending<00:00:51.680> this<00:00:51.949> into<00:00:52.489> a<00:00:52.519> circle<00:00:53.739> so<00:00:54.739> I'm<00:00:54.979> gonna

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:55.189 
bending this into a circle so I'm gonna

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:56.410 
bending this into a circle so I'm gonna
pretend<00:00:55.549> that<00:00:55.610> I've<00:00:55.790> just<00:00:55.939> done<00:00:56.150> that<00:00:56.180> because

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
pretend that I've just done that because

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.939 
pretend that I've just done that because
I<00:00:56.600> don't<00:00:56.750> want<00:00:56.869> to<00:00:56.930> waste<00:00:57.049> your<00:00:57.170> time<00:00:57.259> so

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.770 
I don't want to waste your time so
you've<00:00:58.070> been<00:00:58.159> into<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:58.790> most<00:00:59.000> perfect<00:00:59.269> circle

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
you've been into the most perfect circle

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.630 
you've been into the most perfect circle
but<00:00:59.900> you<00:01:00.019> can<00:01:00.199> possibly<00:01:00.589> get<00:01:00.799> and<00:01:01.070> because

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
but you can possibly get and because

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.520 
but you can possibly get and because
it's<00:01:02.059> you're<00:01:02.390> not<00:01:02.540> gonna<00:01:02.659> see<00:01:02.900> the<00:01:03.019> wire<00:01:03.199> if

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
it's you're not gonna see the wire if

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.079 
it's you're not gonna see the wire if
it's<00:01:03.710> not<00:01:03.890> totally<00:01:04.369> perfect

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
it's not totally perfect

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.630 
it's not totally perfect
whatever<00:01:05.509> whatever<00:01:05.810> it's<00:01:06.170> not<00:01:06.350> a<00:01:06.380> big<00:01:06.590> deal<00:01:06.829> so

and<00:01:47.000> crafting<00:01:47.570> glue<00:01:47.690> gun<00:01:47.870> this<00:01:47.990> would<00:01:48.140> be

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
and crafting glue gun this would be

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.800 
and crafting glue gun this would be
perfect<00:01:48.650> and<00:01:48.890> you<00:01:48.950> see<00:01:49.760> these<00:01:49.909> little<00:01:50.270> knobs

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
perfect and you see these little knobs

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.840 
perfect and you see these little knobs
that<00:01:51.020> are<00:01:51.080> in<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.320> top<00:01:51.530> well<00:01:52.040> these<00:01:52.520> have<00:01:52.790> a

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
that are in the top well these have a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.219 
that are in the top well these have a
lot<00:01:53.060> of<00:01:53.090> pressure<00:01:53.420> because<00:01:53.869> they're<00:01:54.080> being

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
lot of pressure because they're being

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.530 
lot of pressure because they're being
fastened<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.340> wire<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.150> what<00:01:56.299> we<00:01:56.360> need<00:01:56.510> to

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
fastened to the wire so what we need to

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.210 
fastened to the wire so what we need to
do<00:01:56.720> before<00:01:56.869> you<00:01:57.170> put<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:57.440> on<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.799> wire<00:01:57.979> you

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
do before you put it on to the wire you

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.240 
do before you put it on to the wire you
have<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.670> glue<00:01:58.940> in<00:01:59.210> around<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.560> top<00:02:00.799> section

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
have to glue in around the top section

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.160 
have to glue in around the top section
there<00:02:01.400> so<00:02:01.880> that<00:02:02.090> these<00:02:02.270> things<00:02:02.330> don't<00:02:02.750> pop<00:02:02.990> off

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
there so that these things don't pop off

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.960 
there so that these things don't pop off
and<00:02:03.530> again<00:02:03.979> these<00:02:04.130> are<00:02:04.310> just<00:02:04.340> plastic<00:02:04.760> balls

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
and again these are just plastic balls

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.699 
and again these are just plastic balls
the<00:02:07.970> next<00:02:08.209> step<00:02:08.360> what<00:02:08.539> we<00:02:08.689> need<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:08.959> do<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.319> now

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
the next step what we need to do is now

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.800 
the next step what we need to do is now
that<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:09.979> got<00:02:10.159> the<00:02:10.310> glue<00:02:10.519> on<00:02:10.759> is<00:02:11.000> that<00:02:11.510> now<00:02:11.750> you

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
that you got the glue on is that now you

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.899 
that you got the glue on is that now you
were<00:02:12.200> just<00:02:12.230> going<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.650> be<00:02:12.799> putting<00:02:13.430> these<00:02:13.670> on

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
were just going to be putting these on

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.830 
were just going to be putting these on
top<00:02:14.409> onto<00:02:15.409> the<00:02:15.439> actual<00:02:16.129> ring<00:02:16.480> just<00:02:17.480> like<00:02:17.629> so

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
top onto the actual ring just like so

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.630 
top onto the actual ring just like so
and<00:02:18.200> they're<00:02:18.890> gonna<00:02:18.980> fall<00:02:19.250> where<00:02:19.459> they<00:02:19.610> may

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
and they're gonna fall where they may

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.789 
and they're gonna fall where they may
and<00:02:20.030> so<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.840> thing<00:02:21.049> about<00:02:21.080> these<00:02:21.439> things<00:02:21.650> is

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
and so the thing about these things is

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:22.270 
and so the thing about these things is
that<00:02:21.830> you

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
that you

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.770 
that you
make<00:02:22.490> it<00:02:22.640> three-dimensional<00:02:22.940> so<00:02:23.570> you're

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
make it three-dimensional so you're

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.600 
make it three-dimensional so you're
gonna<00:02:23.900> need<00:02:23.990> a<00:02:24.260> lot<00:02:24.470> of<00:02:24.530> balls<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:25.160> order<00:02:25.370> to

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
gonna need a lot of balls in order to

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.040 
gonna need a lot of balls in order to
create<00:02:25.970> because<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:26.330> has<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.630> go<00:02:26.660> all<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.020> way

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
create because it has to go all the way

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.450 
create because it has to go all the way
around<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.500> ring<00:02:27.680> that's<00:02:27.920> why<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.100> need<00:02:28.280> so

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
around the ring that's why you need so

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.770 
around the ring that's why you need so
many<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.760> them<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.930> once<00:02:30.380> we<00:02:30.740> get<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.010> done

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
many of them so once we get that done

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.940 
many of them so once we get that done
you're<00:02:32.780> gonna<00:02:32.900> really<00:02:33.140> have<00:02:33.380> you'll<00:02:33.680> find

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
you're gonna really have you'll find

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.560 
you're gonna really have you'll find
yourself<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.340> justing<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:34.850> would<00:02:35.000> lift<00:02:35.240> up<00:02:35.360> on

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
yourself to justing I would lift up on

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.300 
yourself to justing I would lift up on
top<00:02:35.990> when<00:02:36.260> you're<00:02:36.380> lying<00:02:36.680> this<00:02:36.830> down<00:02:37.040> and

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
top when you're lying this down and

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.130 
top when you're lying this down and
feeding<00:02:37.910> them<00:02:38.120> on<00:02:38.240> I<00:02:38.420> would<00:02:38.570> flip<00:02:38.810> them<00:02:38.990> down

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
feeding them on I would flip them down

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.900 
feeding them on I would flip them down
on<00:02:39.350> a<00:02:39.380> towel<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:39.980> don't<00:02:40.310> scratch<00:02:40.640> these

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
on a towel so you don't scratch these

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.460 
on a towel so you don't scratch these
balls<00:02:41.180> because<00:02:41.360> they<00:02:41.600> are<00:02:41.690> plastic<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.350> if

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
balls because they are plastic and if

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.750 
balls because they are plastic and if
you're<00:02:42.590> gonna<00:02:42.709> use<00:02:42.890> glass<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:43.430> want<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.670> be

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
you can fasten the top shut and when I

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.020 
you can fasten the top shut and when I
mean<00:02:57.230> by<00:02:57.260> fast<00:02:57.650> in<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:57.920> top<00:02:58.130> what<00:02:58.340> I<00:02:58.550> did<00:02:58.790> I

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
mean by fast in the top what I did I

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.880 
mean by fast in the top what I did I
just<00:02:59.420> went<00:02:59.810> like<00:02:59.840> this<00:03:00.080> I<00:03:00.230> just<00:03:00.470> bent<00:03:00.680> this

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
just went like this I just bent this

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.199 
just went like this I just bent this
down<00:03:03.790> okay

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
down okay

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.600 
down okay
I<00:03:05.239> bet<00:03:05.930> this<00:03:06.110> down<00:03:06.320> and<00:03:06.620> I<00:03:06.920> just<00:03:07.130> linked<00:03:07.489> it

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
I bet this down and I just linked it

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.350 
I bet this down and I just linked it
that's<00:03:08.209> what<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:08.450> did<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:13.820> next<00:03:14.060> step<00:03:14.239> you're

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
that's what I did the next step you're

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.330 
that's what I did the next step you're
gonna<00:03:14.510> have<00:03:14.780> is<00:03:15.080> that<00:03:15.680> you're<00:03:15.950> gonna<00:03:16.070> see<00:03:16.310> a

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
gonna have is that you're gonna see a

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.010 
gonna have is that you're gonna see a
lot<00:03:16.550> of<00:03:16.670> gaps<00:03:16.880> in<00:03:17.150> between<00:03:17.239> all<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.840> balls

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
lot of gaps in between all the balls

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.710 
lot of gaps in between all the balls
because<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.500> balls<00:03:18.680> are<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:18.920> same<00:03:19.160> size

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
because the balls are the same size

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.210 
because the balls are the same size
you're<00:03:20.720> gonna<00:03:20.840> see<00:03:21.080> 2-minute<00:03:21.590> gaps<00:03:21.770> and<00:03:22.100> it's

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
you're gonna see 2-minute gaps and it's

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.650 
you're gonna see 2-minute gaps and it's
not<00:03:22.400> gonna<00:03:22.550> be<00:03:22.640> put<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.150> can<00:03:23.300> still<00:03:23.510> see

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
not gonna be put and you can still see

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.600 
not gonna be put and you can still see
the<00:03:23.780> water<00:03:23.810> so<00:03:24.560> I<00:03:24.590> went<00:03:25.070> to<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.220> Christmas

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
the water so I went to the Christmas

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.650 
the water so I went to the Christmas
store<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:25.910> I<00:03:25.940> thought<00:03:26.060> well<00:03:26.209> what<00:03:26.360> am<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:26.510> gonna

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
store and I thought well what am I gonna

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.280 
store and I thought well what am I gonna
do<00:03:26.840> about<00:03:26.870> it

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
do about it

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.050 
do about it
so<00:03:27.590> what<00:03:27.860> I<00:03:27.890> realized<00:03:28.160> is<00:03:28.549> that<00:03:28.580> some<00:03:28.910> of<00:03:29.000> the

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
so what I realized is that some of the

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.060 
so what I realized is that some of the
cheap<00:03:29.239> house<00:03:29.420> decorations<00:03:30.110> they're<00:03:30.470> shoving

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
cheap house decorations they're shoving

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.100 
cheap house decorations they're shoving
tinsel<00:03:31.549> in<00:03:31.700> between<00:03:32.030> gaps<00:03:32.299> just<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:32.840> kind<00:03:33.080> of

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
tinsel in between gaps just to kind of

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.440 
tinsel in between gaps just to kind of
give<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:33.410> it's<00:03:34.190> really<00:03:34.519> just<00:03:34.640> a<00:03:34.790> filler<00:03:35.030> effect

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
give it it's really just a filler effect

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.340 
give it it's really just a filler effect
even<00:03:35.690> though<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:35.840> think<00:03:36.140> it's<00:03:36.260> all

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
even though you think it's all

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.770 
even though you think it's all
Christmassy<00:03:36.830> it's<00:03:37.010> just<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.310> filler<00:03:37.519> so<00:03:38.330> what<00:03:38.570> I

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
Christmassy it's just a filler so what I

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.170 
Christmassy it's just a filler so what I
suggest<00:03:39.440> that<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:39.739> do<00:03:39.980> is<00:03:40.580> that<00:03:40.610> you<00:03:40.850> run<00:03:41.030> out

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
suggest that you do is that you run out

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.789 
suggest that you do is that you run out
and<00:03:41.360> go<00:03:41.570> buy<00:03:41.690> yourself<00:03:41.720> some<00:03:42.170> tinsel<00:03:42.410> in<00:03:42.650> this

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
and go buy yourself some tinsel in this

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.970 
and go buy yourself some tinsel in this
case<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.190> chose<00:03:43.549> a<00:03:43.580> really<00:03:43.970> thick<00:03:44.769> tinsel<00:03:45.769> that

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
case I chose a really thick tinsel that

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.000 
case I chose a really thick tinsel that
was<00:03:46.160> a<00:03:46.459> dollar<00:03:46.670> ninety-nine<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.890> what<00:03:48.890> you

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
was a dollar ninety-nine and what you

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.310 
was a dollar ninety-nine and what you
see<00:03:49.220> here<00:03:49.549> is<00:03:50.120> what<00:03:50.360> all<00:03:50.600> you<00:03:50.720> need<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:50.989> do<00:03:51.110> is

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
see here is what all you need to do is

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.440 
see here is what all you need to do is
grab<00:03:51.470> your<00:03:51.560> tinsel<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:52.310> just<00:03:52.579> start<00:03:52.880> in<00:03:53.120> just

grab your tinsel and just start in just

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.479 
grab your tinsel and just start in just

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
because this is just one side right the

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:56.860 
because this is just one side right the
other<00:03:55.579> side<00:03:55.850> doesn't<00:03:56.090> have<00:03:56.239> all<00:03:56.600> of<00:03:56.750> this

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
other side doesn't have all of this

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.870 
other side doesn't have all of this
tinsel<00:03:57.140> that<00:03:57.440> you<00:03:57.530> can't<00:03:57.769> see<00:03:57.950> so<00:03:58.549> what<00:03:58.730> you

tinsel that you can't see so what you
just<00:03:59.030> do<00:03:59.209> is<00:03:59.239> you<00:03:59.570> just<00:03:59.600> tucking<00:04:00.200> your<00:04:00.320> tinsel

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
just do is you just tucking your tinsel

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.220 
just do is you just tucking your tinsel
in<00:04:00.950> underneath<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:02.120> by<00:04:02.570> doing<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:02.989> it

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
in underneath and by doing that it

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.080 
in underneath and by doing that it
causes<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.829> balls<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:04.250> really<00:04:04.519> compress<00:04:04.790> our

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
causes the balls to really compress our

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.050 
causes the balls to really compress our
word<00:04:05.299> and<00:04:05.540> really<00:04:06.380> be<00:04:06.650> looking<00:04:07.040> full<00:04:07.340> so<00:04:07.970> are

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
I've just wire with plastic pink beads

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.310 
I've just wire with plastic pink beads
and<00:04:44.740> this<00:04:45.310> was<00:04:45.490> one<00:04:45.760> big<00:04:45.790> long<00:04:46.300> wire<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.870> what

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
and this was one big long wire and what

and this was one big long wire and what
we<00:04:47.440> did<00:04:47.620> was<00:04:48.010> we<00:04:48.280> just<00:04:48.370> weaved<00:04:48.820> it<00:04:49.090> and<00:04:49.360> pushed

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
we did was we just weaved it and pushed

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.710 
we did was we just weaved it and pushed
the<00:04:50.170> the<00:04:50.500> wire<00:04:50.650> in<00:04:50.950> so<00:04:51.790> and<00:04:51.910> then<00:04:52.180> all<00:04:52.570> the

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
the the wire in so and then all the

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.810 
the the wire in so and then all the
extra<00:04:52.990> pieces<00:04:53.230> that<00:04:53.530> are<00:04:53.650> out<00:04:53.950> there<00:04:54.700> actually

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
extra pieces that are out there actually

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.030 
extra pieces that are out there actually
sticking<00:04:55.270> out<00:04:55.570> so<00:04:55.900> it<00:04:56.620> gives<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:56.950> a

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
sticking out so it gives it a

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.140 
sticking out so it gives it a
three-dimensional<00:04:57.370> look

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
three-dimensional look

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.240 
three-dimensional look
and<00:04:58.900> again<00:04:59.200> that's<00:04:59.320> still<00:04:59.560> missing<00:04:59.890> something

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
and again that's still missing something

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.100 
and again that's still missing something
and<00:05:00.400> realizing<00:05:01.330> that<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:01.600> balls<00:05:01.810> because

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
and realizing that the balls because

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.480 
and realizing that the balls because
they're<00:05:02.410> all<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:02.620> same<00:05:02.650> size<00:05:03.040> it<00:05:03.310> doesn't

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
they're all the same size it doesn't

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.730 
they're all the same size it doesn't
look<00:05:03.760> as<00:05:03.940> great<00:05:04.270> so<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:05.020> next<00:05:05.200> step<00:05:05.410> that<00:05:05.440> we

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
look as great so the next step that we

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.170 
look as great so the next step that we
did<00:05:05.950> is<00:05:06.130> that<00:05:06.310> we<00:05:06.370> went<00:05:06.610> out<00:05:06.700> and<00:05:06.880> got<00:05:06.970> these

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
did is that we went out and got these

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.630 
did is that we went out and got these
small<00:05:07.510> balls<00:05:07.750> and<00:05:08.530> there<00:05:08.680> were<00:05:08.770> 24<00:05:09.280> them<00:05:09.430> for

to push it upside down and then we're

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.170 
to push it upside down and then we're
these<00:05:23.170> are<00:05:23.380> all<00:05:23.590> glued<00:05:23.950> to<00:05:24.430> a<00:05:24.460> big<00:05:24.790> ball<00:05:25.000> that's
