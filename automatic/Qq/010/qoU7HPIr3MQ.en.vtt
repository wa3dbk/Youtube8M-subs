00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.600
 hello my love i am here now 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.160
 just in bad vilbel to the small 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.960
 waldst체ck and am looking for 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.170
 herbs and I already have a lot 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.820
 found and once the b채rlauch 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.610
 the hole falls what you also behind 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.220
 You'll see that 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.190
 he just smells socially of garlic 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.870
 and tastes and a friend of mine 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.010
 I also link theirs to them 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.110
 facebook-page that's what makes 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.670
 herbal walks that told me 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.140
 that then you recognize it as well 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.360
 difference from lily of the valley that the 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.430
 bottom as you see here completely dull 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.520
 is the happy one is probably too 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.680
 shiny the bottom and that comes 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.300
 with a stalk out of the ground and 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.500
 Lily-of-the-valley com with two leaves 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.270
 out on a stalk 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.300
 so it's best to wait a bit 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.520
 it's a bit bigger and 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.909
 Generally , when you collect things 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.800
 please somehow hold me such a whole 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.050
 call empty or plant out whole 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.130
 calls always take place here and there 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.810
 single sheet 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.690
 so if you are here for example 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.950
 this giant field has of this 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.440
 Riesenfeld I have here then such a 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.030
 half bag collected so that too 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.800
 when other people get and that 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.660
 is what next year just her 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.930
 was still there and not 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.130
 suddenly everything is counted yes and 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.350
 I have one here too 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.710
 that's what you had 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.930
 You can also see it in organic terms 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.040
 confused with that had written 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:01.970
 with something hare and that is it 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.920
 that at the box herb the bottom is not 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.890
 so I have the bottom is smooth 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.229
 and also the style is bald and at 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.629
 something is racing with dementia 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.580
 can confuse hagen krauth therefore 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.080
 the bottom and the style haired and 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.629
 then there are the leaves very much 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.530
 shiny here are also a rather so 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.530
 a bit dull 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.390
 what you everywhere grows like sand on the sea 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.489
 and what you please do not succeed and not 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.400
 only because it is poisonous are these 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.620
 anemones and yes unfortunately because the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.500
 has everywhere but just now 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.150
 because they are poisonous and that 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.860
 animals do not chew, I think 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.150
 times 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.980
 yes, and if you had such a small one 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.260
 of bear's garlic, for example, see here 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.510
 where here really only these two 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.180
 small spots are then let him on 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.709
 best rest and then there can 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.599
 maybe in the next one two 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.720
 three years beautiful falls out of it 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.720
 become 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.290
 yes and here at the point I'm real 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:05.459
 arrived in the b채rlauch paradise 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:09.290
 that's all b채rlauch and there you can 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.290
 Then pick a little something 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.120
 a correct info still to 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.280
 Scablock herb collects it 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.560
 please only it was not here yet 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.150
 stupid because when it first blooms is in 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.190
 These yellow flowers have been seen before 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.560
 then it will be slightly toxic and in 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.989
 larger quantities then stop annoying 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.519
 only around venomous therefore best here 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.130
 so collect when it is still very young 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.000
 So as the end of March beginning of April is the 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.000
 the best time for it 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.560
 yes I hope the video has you now 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.000
 fell a bit and I do 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.850
 now a little break from the herbs 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.350
 I look for and have it here in a who 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.720
 but falls comfortably on one 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.880
 stump it now my hour the 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.520
 I smeared myself with a vegan 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.300
 mortadella and to sit with me 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.640
 Peppermint tea and definitely goes 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.840
 also often out again looks up 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.570
 every case a little bit too 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.190
 herbs and if you have someone there you 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.350
 could ask who knows 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.510
 Of course super otherwise, there is also 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.820
 quite a lot of great videos on youtube 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.650

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.390
 really such a herbalism course 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.940
 maybe just from the dear sabrina 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:59.260
