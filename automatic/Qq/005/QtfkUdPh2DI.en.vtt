they are my name is Lucas and today we

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.200 
they are my name is Lucas and today we
want<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.070> talk<00:00:02.250> about<00:00:02.310> how<00:00:02.669> we<00:00:02.730> can<00:00:02.909> very

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
want to talk about how we can very

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.260 
want to talk about how we can very
cheaply<00:00:03.680> use<00:00:04.680> an<00:00:04.980> HDMI<00:00:05.160> monitor<00:00:05.640> together

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
cheaply use an HDMI monitor together

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.089 
cheaply use an HDMI monitor together
with<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.779> Blackmagic<00:00:07.200> Cinema<00:00:07.230> Camera<00:00:13.099> what

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
with the Blackmagic Cinema Camera what

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.680 
with the Blackmagic Cinema Camera what
we<00:00:14.219> basically<00:00:14.400> need<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.849> hide<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.210> cables<00:00:15.540> is

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
we basically need to hide the cables is

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.080 
we basically need to hide the cables is
this<00:00:16.170> little<00:00:16.410> converter<00:00:16.710> box<00:00:16.949> which<00:00:17.609> converts

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
this little converter box which converts

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.870 
this little converter box which converts
SDI<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.720> HDMI<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.770> costs<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.279> incredible<00:00:20.760> low

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
SDI to HDMI and costs the incredible low

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.599 
SDI to HDMI and costs the incredible low
price<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.410> $37<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.859> device<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.160> actually

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
price of $37 so this device is actually

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.230 
price of $37 so this device is actually
pretty<00:00:23.820> simple

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
pretty simple

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.070 
pretty simple
we<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.109> an<00:00:25.230> SDI<00:00:25.560> input<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:27.060> an<00:00:27.269> HDMI

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
we have an SDI input we have an HDMI

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.980 
we have an SDI input we have an HDMI
output<00:00:28.160> we<00:00:29.160> have<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.340> little<00:00:29.670> power<00:00:30.449> connector

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
output we have a little power connector

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.190 
output we have a little power connector
in<00:00:31.560> USB<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.279> we<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> little<00:00:33.690> on/off

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
in USB and we have a little on/off

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.080 
in USB and we have a little on/off
switch<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.890> other<00:00:35.010> side<00:00:35.280> when<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.700> receive

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
switch on the other side when I receive

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.970 
switch on the other side when I receive
this<00:00:36.239> unit<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.690> get<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> little<00:00:37.350> manual<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:37.950> I

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
this unit I get a little manual but I

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.830 
this unit I get a little manual but I
think<00:00:38.219> it's<00:00:38.340> very<00:00:38.430> self-explanatory<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
think it's very self-explanatory the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.660 
think it's very self-explanatory the
most<00:00:40.020> thing<00:00:40.320> we<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.950> worry<00:00:41.100> about<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
most thing we have to worry about is the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.160 
most thing we have to worry about is the
little<00:00:41.850> power<00:00:42.000> connector<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.600> actually<00:00:42.899> don't

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
little power connector I actually don't

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.840 
little power connector I actually don't
worry<00:00:43.440> about<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.829> too<00:00:43.980> much<00:00:44.100> because<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.670> use

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
worry about this too much because I use

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.790 
worry about this too much because I use
my<00:00:45.030> little<00:00:45.239> external<00:00:45.750> battery<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.110> showed<00:00:46.649> in

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
my little external battery I showed in

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.670 
my little external battery I showed in
another<00:00:46.890> review<00:00:47.489> which<00:00:48.059> has<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> simple<00:00:49.050> pipe

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
another review which has a simple pipe

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.950 
another review which has a simple pipe
will<00:00:49.890> output<00:00:50.280> over<00:00:50.489> USB<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:51.390> simply<00:00:51.750> use

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
will output over USB so I can simply use

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.260 
will output over USB so I can simply use
any<00:00:52.289> USB<00:00:52.620> cable<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> want<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:54.180> are

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
any USB cable I want but there are

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.290 
any USB cable I want but there are
several<00:00:54.539> other<00:00:55.129> external<00:00:56.129> little<00:00:56.579> charging

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
several other external little charging

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.599 
several other external little charging
devices<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:57.989> cell<00:00:58.320> phones<00:00:58.559> these<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.399> should

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
devices for cell phones these one should

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.209 
devices for cell phones these one should
work<00:00:59.789> -<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.300> would<00:01:01.109> just<00:01:01.140> suggest<00:01:01.469> if<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.070> don't

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
work - I would just suggest if you don't

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.130 
work - I would just suggest if you don't
want<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.550> buy<00:01:02.820> such<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> battery<00:01:03.480> what<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.960> can

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
want to buy such a battery what you can

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.310 
want to buy such a battery what you can
do<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.979> powering<00:01:05.610> usb<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.360> not<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> big<00:01:07.080> deal

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
do but powering usb is not a big deal

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.500 
do but powering usb is not a big deal
and<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.830> very<00:01:07.950> easy<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.310> do<00:01:08.460> these<00:01:08.670> days<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.390> we

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
and is very easy to do these days so we

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.750 
and is very easy to do these days so we
have<00:01:09.600> hooked<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.900> up<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.350> power<00:01:11.340> already

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
have hooked it up to the power already

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.700 
have hooked it up to the power already
so<00:01:12.240> what<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.570> want<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> do<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.170> connect<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
so what we want to do is connect the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.730 
so what we want to do is connect the
HDMI<00:01:14.189> cable<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.640> course<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.960> then<00:01:16.200> we<00:01:16.500> want<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
HDMI cable of course so then we want to

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.999 
HDMI cable of course so then we want to
use<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.159> HD<00:01:17.520> SDI<00:01:17.790> cable<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:19.170> problem<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.619> many

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
use the HD SDI cable the problem is many

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.280 
use the HD SDI cable the problem is many
HD<00:01:20.460> SDI<00:01:20.670> cables<00:01:21.119> are<00:01:21.240> really<00:01:21.630> expensive<00:01:21.990> when

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
HD SDI cables are really expensive when

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.800 
HD SDI cables are really expensive when
you<00:01:22.350> buy<00:01:22.560> them<00:01:22.740> natively<00:01:23.090> however<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.630> can

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you buy them natively however you can

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.550 
you buy them natively however you can
simply<00:01:25.170> get<00:01:25.290> any<00:01:25.470> rg59<00:01:26.460> BNC<00:01:27.420> cable<00:01:27.810> with<00:01:27.960> 75

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
simply get any rg59 BNC cable with 75

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.670 
simply get any rg59 BNC cable with 75
ohms<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> standard<00:01:29.970> 4<00:01:30.240> HD<00:01:30.659> SDI<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.530> it

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
ohms this is the standard 4 HD SDI so it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.410 
ohms this is the standard 4 HD SDI so it
overdressed<00:01:32.070> working<00:01:32.460> fine<00:01:32.640> these<00:01:32.939> are<00:01:33.119> very

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
overdressed working fine these are very

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.719 
overdressed working fine these are very

just<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:50.100> bit<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.850> delay<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:52.049> think<00:01:52.470> it's

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
just a bit of a delay it's I think it's

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.510 
just a bit of a delay it's I think it's
half<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.159> second<00:01:53.549> maybe<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:56.399> me

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
half a second maybe but it is for me

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.280 
half a second maybe but it is for me
