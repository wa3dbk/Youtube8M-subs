to three to five times and your money
will<00:03:54.799> sometimes<00:03:55.799> double<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.639> triple<00:03:57.409> what<00:03:58.409> you

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590

put<00:03:58.919> in<00:03:59.099> there<00:03:59.310> so<00:03:59.669> if<00:03:59.879> you<00:04:00.030> put<00:04:00.239> in<00:04:00.449> 20<00:04:00.989> million

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
put in there so if you put in 20 million

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.430 
put in there so if you put in 20 million
dollars<00:04:01.919> you<00:04:02.579> will<00:04:02.790> gain<00:04:03.060> anywhere<00:04:03.840> from<00:04:04.019> 10

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
dollars you will gain anywhere from 10

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.469 
dollars you will gain anywhere from 10
to<00:04:05.159> 13<00:04:05.879> million<00:04:06.449> dollars<00:04:07.139> within<00:04:07.739> eight<00:04:08.190> hours

United or the Los Santos air force base

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.750 
United or the Los Santos air force base
to<00:04:42.170> be<00:04:42.380> believed<00:04:43.040> where<00:04:43.700> the<00:04:44.480> jetpack<00:04:45.050> is

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
to be believed where the jetpack is

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.740 
to be believed where the jetpack is
we're<00:04:46.760> probably<00:04:47.000> going<00:04:47.210> to<00:04:47.300> get<00:04:47.420> shot<00:04:47.720> down

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
we're probably going to get shot down

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.280 
we're probably going to get shot down
here<00:04:48.500> for<00:04:48.740> because<00:04:48.980> we're<00:04:49.130> flying<00:04:49.430> too<00:04:49.670> high

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
here for because we're flying too high

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.610 
here for because we're flying too high
but<00:04:51.290> believe<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:52.510> jetpack<00:04:53.510> is<00:04:53.540> somewhere<00:04:54.320> in

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
but believe the jetpack is somewhere in

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.140 
but believe the jetpack is somewhere in
there<00:04:55.450> if<00:04:56.450> you<00:04:56.510> can<00:04:57.110> get<00:04:57.770> in<00:04:58.040> there<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:58.340> get
