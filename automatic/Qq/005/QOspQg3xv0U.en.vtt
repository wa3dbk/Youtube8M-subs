any video game pinball game it's not
real<00:02:28.209> pinball<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.109> flippers<00:02:29.469> aren't

terribly responsive there's obviously no
analog<00:02:32.799> controls<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:33.459> it's<00:02:33.609> all<00:02:33.730> or<00:02:33.879> nothing

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
analog controls so it's all or nothing

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.080 
analog controls so it's all or nothing
and<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:35.170> makes<00:02:35.470> aiming<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:36.069> bit<00:02:36.579> awkward<00:02:36.760> if

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
and that makes aiming a bit awkward if

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:45.770 
and that makes aiming a bit awkward if
you're<00:02:37.239> used<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.629> real<00:02:38.019> pinball<00:02:38.290> machines

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.390 

they're<00:02:46.780> also<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:47.139> little<00:02:47.409> slow<00:02:47.859> on<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.159> flip

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
they're also a little slow on the flip

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.610 
they're also a little slow on the flip
but<00:02:48.670> aside<00:02:48.969> from<00:02:49.030> that<00:02:49.269> it's<00:02:49.629> a<00:02:49.750> great<00:02:50.200> video

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
but aside from that it's a great video

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.860
