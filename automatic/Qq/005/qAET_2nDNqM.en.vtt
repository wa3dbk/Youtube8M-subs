these blocks they're going to fall at
the<00:01:08.230> run<00:01:08.440> on<00:01:08.590> them<00:01:08.770> but<00:01:09.430> if<00:01:09.550> I<00:01:09.670> cry<00:01:09.910> I<00:01:09.940> can<00:01:10.360> run

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
think you can jump on that koopa if you

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.450 
think you can jump on that koopa if you
want<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.730> bounce<00:01:27.730> up<00:01:28.000> here<00:01:28.240> but<00:01:28.450> I<00:01:29.310> didn't<00:01:30.310> feel

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
want to bounce up here but I didn't feel

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.680 
want to bounce up here but I didn't feel
like<00:01:30.520> doing<00:01:30.760> that<00:01:31.000> that<00:01:31.210> would<00:01:31.300> take<00:01:31.450> too<00:01:31.570> much

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
like doing that that would take too much

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.450 
like doing that that would take too much
effort<00:01:31.750> it's<00:01:32.590> a<00:01:32.650> whole<00:01:32.800> lot<00:01:32.950> easier<00:01:33.100> just<00:01:33.370> to

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
effort it's a whole lot easier just to

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.430 
effort it's a whole lot easier just to
fly<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.820> slide<00:01:37.090> down<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.390> hill<00:01:37.540> and<00:01:37.750> Portugal

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
detour to go into time but really i

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.520
