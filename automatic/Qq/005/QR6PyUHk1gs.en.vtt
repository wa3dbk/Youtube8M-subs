00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.360
 you missed some of the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.420
 important events of this 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.119
 week congratulations because he will be able to 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.880
 see them below in our blessed 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.800
 I saw you after the comments from 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.560
 president about work habits 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.680
 of the Uruguayans what these did 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.900
 two workers was not a good sign and 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.900
 we go to here until 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.300
 the accesses of Montevideo and is moved 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.760
 the morning earlier we were doing a 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.100
 little bit and circulation within all 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.780
 quite warm but it starts to 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.089
 get closer in peak science hours 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.979
 in everything quite fluid but 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.409
 begins to approach their waste 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:51.780
 begin to circulate please boy 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.790
 We have worked out seriously in search engines 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.339
 Javier García was invited to speak 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.479
 about abortion and ended up keeping 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:02.190
 a talk with Roman somewhat 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:04.739
 embarrassing and statistic when you 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.720
 puts arguments where the figures that 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.930
 you drive it drives with violence not 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.860
 they are true figures 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.830
 throughout this episode all this 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.370
 discussion towards Uruguay there are 33 thousand 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.550
 abortions per 1,000 births per 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.860
 year and in Uruguay to 42 thousand 43,000 no 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.390
 reaches 45,000 has fallen now it turns out 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.490
 that the law that establishes that there is a 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.350
 record that I see in one more record 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.540
 late stress me public has hidden 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.740
 special tapes for now not 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.740
 it's terrible 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.160
 the deputy said that he lies 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.810
 or that in this ministry to hide 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.970
 figures what hides figure is that there 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.040
 a boat order, that's not the case 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.200
 and his secretary explained it in 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.020
 several opportunities once you're 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.410
 figures are collected systematized 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.410
 they are going to provide 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.800
 how the 3,000 are handled in the 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.800
 mistake 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:36.770
 The order of the order there is no decision 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.180
 somehow 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.290
 Thank you 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.389
 antonini cecilia i like to give 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.810
 tribute to the name of the program and by 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:10.810
 that's what they spend throwing themselves several bombs 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:22.900
 a combination of an old sleeve 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.900
 abuse 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.469
 feline 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.820
 I 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.720
 I did not stay with a concern 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.220
 simple because in a moment 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.080
 determined when you said big 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.720
 animals and you saw like this and you looked for here 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.280
 and here for toni and not for the 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.000
 marabino said 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.000
 a specimen 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.079
 in chile the presidential candidate 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.290
 michele bachelet was visiting the 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.230
 city ​​of arica and received an aggression 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:30.320
 just when a man was leaving the act 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.230
 He was arrested in Chile after spitting at the 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.840
 former president and precandidate michelle 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.320
 bachelet square May 1 when it happened 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.320
 the incident 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.460
 he snuck in among his supporters and launched 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.460
 a spit to the presidential candidate 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.420
 i 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.460
 the catarrito Carlos Núñez was 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.190
 invited in without limit and showed that 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.640
 besides the player cassette has the 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.530
 journalist my family is a family 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.120
 humble that I appreciate everything he did 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.120
 for me and good 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.890
 because he asked me a lot of request 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.890
 and for me it's like my house 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.690
 because not only respect for the club 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.690
 but with my companions 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:34.400
 this is my house 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.240
 because there is a therapy that does not exist 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.310
 he never says nor did they do it to me 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.500
 for some sports journalists 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.250
 verify the information they throw at 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.230
 air should be religious remember that 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.120
 it was said that cavani is going to be invited to 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.220
 visit the pope together with the president 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.160
 Uruguayan josé mujica lo de mujica with 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:02.040
 cavani did not pass the incredible 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.810
 Alberto had only argued about 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.540
 there are few players that are known 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.880
 that religious faith like cavani that always 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.070
 he has written books of respect and it turns out 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.210
 then injured you can ask him to go 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:17.550
 to see the dad I think about it that 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.130
 life is not just football and cavani without 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:30.890
 pay two samples of being a believer of 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:33.960
 those who are for that but I think that 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.580
 the letter does not give more motivation to 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.060
 those but I think to finish and it's 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.060
 a distinction 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.930
 we have the pp 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:55.860
 there are 500 or more horrible that we have the 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.860
 dad to the pp that is the pp 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:07:02.919
 and after 2 minutes they all come out 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:05.919
 a message but decides is that the 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:09.569
 religion that professes just evangelina 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:09.569
 although he does not know 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:18.350
 cavani is an evangelist they do not recognize the 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:20.870
 dad as the most authority is a subject 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.370
 the fact that it's good that it's not 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.120
 Catholic this I have always said that 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.120
 that Christian 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.940
 that is, retirement 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.970
 do not
