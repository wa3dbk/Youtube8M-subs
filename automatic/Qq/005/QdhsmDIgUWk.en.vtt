00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello people welcome today i will 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:12.320
 show you how to make the biggest bank 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:17.130
 at erna super masri can handle and 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:20.430
 Although this one dives after one 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.070
 certain date simply nintendo 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.660
 decided something on the new 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.070
 super mario bros wii cd to change and 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.730
 that's why it does not work 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.920
 more so flawless because I yes 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.920
 Of course, that wants as many in 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.190
 the enjoyment of this hack comes today 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.989
 instruction for the people who after the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.440
 green screen just one more 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.129
 can see black screen and 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.770
 Although I have my sd card here and 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.539
 here is a file to the file we come 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.649
 but later these are the only two 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.170
 things that he needs you should 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.700
 now yes the color scheme was changed 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.130
 really great you should be very interesting 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.770
 Everything I did in mine 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.180
 tutorial on how to install in 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.490
 homebrew channel and can play six 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.439
 then you have already described 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.869
 ready 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.439
 otherwise I ask you on this link 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.860
 to click the just appeared 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:31.770
 and to do it all first 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.890
 for all the people then this pal 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.479
 version 2 disc have come five more 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.600
 minutes of work so nothing 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.259
 bad I have here my sd card 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.990
 and that should be like me 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.259
 look is not so important the two 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.890
 the only folder you need 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.479
 erna and revolution 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.600
 but that should be in any case 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.820
 For the rest, I'm not at first 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.040
 look so sure if you ask 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.740
 have the best again in the other 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:10.200
 video and you click on revolution 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.390
 and here we have the xml file 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.569
 Dimensions 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.390
 This opens her please with the best 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.110
 editor and then we come to this 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.810
 nice file down here is one 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.430
 incredible bills pay yes is you 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.580
 You do not have to know what that is 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.280
 means I do not know either 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.890
 and what is the problem 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.550
 the problem is this memory of set 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:42.590
 these are also the last ones on the line 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:45.410
 best complete to the back we do it 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.010
 right here is the end 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:53.180
 ok so this memory of set exists 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.769
 completely out of this case and afterwards 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.120
 Save and close 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.380
 why why must there be something inside 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.230
 and why do not I need that 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.830
 the question is easy to answer 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.290
 namely in the programming of 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:13.250
 water super mario bros wii was there 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:17.120
 small problem probably with the mitwelt 2 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.850
 and closed it and with it 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.170
 No problems occur here 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.470
 a few things few information 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.459
 you are writing in , you are asking 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.940
 of course , rightly so 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:33.700
 what happens to me now when I do that 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:36.670
 whole house national 2 at the end 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.510
 example will be quite likely 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.480
 completely crash 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.519
 and since we do not want to say that 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.530
 have that now extinguished important as 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:50.360
 I wiped that out for you and with patch 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:53.780
 not and then saved now 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.829
 So no longer there and so you this 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.780
 problem we did not do the following 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.209
 An alternative version is this, 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.860
 just never to play the lock 2 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.470
 there are more possibilities 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.049
 but we want to skip that 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:14.140
 make it complete so we go into the 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:16.780
 folder and go here to state 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.410
 and here are all the nice stage 's 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:24.580
 I can play in there 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:27.280
 a bit big and then you can 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.340
 we see this here so that's what you do 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.550
 and then you take this nice file 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.500
 this file you can at the link 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.630
 I'm going to download the description 1 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.510
 I did the upload 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.540
 and you can download them 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:47.110
 So only a few mb takes as 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.390
 this file and just paste it here 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.270
 So move to stage and 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.660
 replace afterwards 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:59.169
 that means you replaced this lock 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.880
 what already exists here with 224 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.060
 another version 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.460
 with the new that means that 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:10.810
 Joined you a very minimal 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.280
 piece different but however not 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.050
 much as far as i have read i have 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:19.300
 me about the bug a bit 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:23.860
 informed and then this should be 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:26.380
 problem to fix are very nice 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.870
 So you did that then everything 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.700
 just like me in my life 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.610
 have described tutorial and then 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:37.690
 should you be able to do our super 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:40.750
 something should like to play over yet 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.270
 I would show you problems 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.140
 first time ask you to look again if 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:50.320
 you all really point by point 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.979
 have followed and it is on it 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.860
 to point 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:56.530
 this help is mainly for the 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:00.220
 people watching the green screens 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.710
 but have not seen it afterwards 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.460
 have progressed 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.690
 in other problems with the problems 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.380
 installing homebrew channel and 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.700
 this method does not help 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.350
 is really just about this 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:20.140
 special tail to play so for the 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.000
