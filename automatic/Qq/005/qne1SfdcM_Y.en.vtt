00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:08.530
 today it was day of 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:12.129
 two days after competition and before 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:15.309
 eve of the second match so that's 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:20.470
 always a day a little tricky 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:22.720
 two days later there are fatigue 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.910
 efforts are made are made 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.500
 feel 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.950
 so we have to manage then today he 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.290
 there was a workout that was 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:37.180
 collective getting started and then more 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:39.220
 of the game of the game where we made we limited 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.720
 the number of ball keys for 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.050
 give life to balloons rather than 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.290
 to have players run with the 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.360
 ball 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.730
 that's why the limitation of 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.440
 key does not allow to drive 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.110
 the balloon but to pass it on 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.489
 and that's what we were looking for next 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.260
 band split what had less 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.540
 played those who did not play 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.190
 - play or not play did a job 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:05.860
 for setting up and finishing the 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.850
 purpose the others started to put themselves 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.460
 in front of the goal 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.490
 simply do some recovery work 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.340
 and the session ended with this 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.439
 direction there to rebalance a small 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.090
 little the states of form of some of the 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.310
 other 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.200
 so this session which had no 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.759
 injury problem anything 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.369
 everyone and is operational all 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.770
 the world and is ready and ready to play 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.380
 so the band is complete we have 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.289
 besides worked with the 23 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.090
 players 5 m someone aside because of 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.310
