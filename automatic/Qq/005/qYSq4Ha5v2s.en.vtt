pulling<00:02:27.299> off<00:02:27.420> sit-ups<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:27.930> hard<00:02:28.109> enough<00:02:28.230> since

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
pulling off sit-ups is hard enough since

the mosan rarely registers but catching
the<00:02:31.469> ball<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:31.920> does<00:02:32.129> not<00:02:32.370> work<00:02:34.879> jumping<00:02:35.879> rope

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
the ball just does not work jumping rope

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.550 
the ball just does not work jumping rope
requires<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.719> to<00:02:36.750> complete<00:02:36.989> a<00:02:37.230> narrow
