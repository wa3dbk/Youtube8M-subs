00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:05.959
 kanobu.ru represents 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.110
 not all familiar San charged 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.850
 such is the fate of exclusives even less 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.950
 people saw the first part and 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.960
 no wonder that the most 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.449
 funny rumors when sony announced 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.870
 developing ancharted a golden abyss for 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.239
 vice 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.340
 for example, many still think that 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.340
 this is a reissue of the original drives for 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.800
 yon only for pocket console though 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.110
 bend studio is preparing a background for us 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.080
 the show's other misconception we decided 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.729
 disprove the easiest way 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.660
 persistently occupied a retinue stand and two 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.410
 times taken off 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.690
 passing level one and the most 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.840
 pleasant impression incredible 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.039
 similarity with the big want to say 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.740
 full uncharted series 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.840
 filing stories the same appear new 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.450
 heroes arise branded ridiculous 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.399
 situations in the pocket reminder 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.700
 the nature of things remained funny 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:32.250
 special effects in particular explosions although water 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.259
 and the steam looks great we would not 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.900
 paid attention to such little things but 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.820
 The plot in Dima levels hidden extremely 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.100
 carefully all we had left 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.380
 ruins tours and check 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.450
 control course the authors could not 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.430
 load mind with giant levels 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.580
 therefore, the right decision was 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.200
 stretching terrain heights in principle 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.369
 such a trick worked in all 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.290
 drake's adventures 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.540
 us later the developers showed another 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.299
 scene with fire unreliable pipes 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.270
 fragile parquet and other damage 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.270
 and the ruins were rather approximate labyrinths 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.119
 demonstration of acrobatics and weapons think 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.489
 everything just we intercepted the mission colleagues 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.040
 journalist and spent a few minutes 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.579
 only to determine which way 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.579
 go 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.430
 the same thing happens with management for 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.120
 secure in the most responsible 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.349
 moment on the screen hint is highlighted 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.730
 suspect extra signs all the same 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.829
 can turn off 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.930
 half the tricks anyway 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.629
 duplicated on the buttons specifically for 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.760
 those who hate progress probably we 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.609
 did not reveal all the secret movements 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.700
 although tried on crossed stupidly shake 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:45.530
 unless not to think a microphone and almost all 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.719
 of the above worked 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.909
 especially nice to push enemies into 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:51.909
 Gap easy poke in the back and 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.889
 some ideas would have taken root and 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.870
 and in the third ancharted console turn 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:02.480
 helps Nathan to jump in the right direction 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.060
 in narrow uncomfortable places rely on 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.549
 stick is already dangerous if you are big 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.400
 gyro lover can activate 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.290
 in the menu the sniper mode is visible for those 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.629
 who doesn't like console shooters 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.209
 that is, the enemy will have to target all 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:21.949
 corpus view and they are old fashioned like this 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:25.220
 we make on video uncharted golden 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:27.199
 abyss will be released later 3 parts therefore not 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.359
 it's worth considering its appearance as 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.870
 intermediate stage or distracting 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.930
 maneuver 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.470
 by the way the Japanese will get the game first 17 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.359
 December 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.239
 then the network in person information about 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:41.090
 mysterious companion drake all levels 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.699
 and to all that you are not at all interested in 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.889
 in drake Europe peek with the first 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:49.840
 batches of consoles if not in transit 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.840
 nothing terrible will happen 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
 but
