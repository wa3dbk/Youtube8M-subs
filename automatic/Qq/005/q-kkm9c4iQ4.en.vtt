00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.260 
toe you'll notice that the traditional
gorilla<00:01:54.750> made<00:01:54.990> toe<00:01:55.290> cap<00:01:55.530> bump<00:01:55.860> out<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.219> gone<00:01:56.430> so

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
gorilla made toe cap bump out is gone so

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.209 
gorilla made toe cap bump out is gone so
the<00:01:57.390> toe<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.780> now<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> lot<00:01:58.290> more<00:01:58.320> flat<00:01:58.829> than<00:01:59.100> it

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the toe is now a lot more flat than it

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.429 
the toe is now a lot more flat than it

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.420 
used for overdrive blades in the past is
now<00:02:08.429> gone<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:09.479> addition<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.800> area<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.280> not

really<00:02:13.680> minimize<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.340> cowling<00:02:14.790> here<00:02:15.150> and

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
really minimize the cowling here and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.070 
really minimize the cowling here and
this<00:02:16.230> allows<00:02:16.580> these<00:02:17.580> cowling<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.630> 30%

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
this allows these cowling to have a 30%

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.950 
this allows these cowling to have a 30%
weight<00:02:19.710> reduction<00:02:20.460> and<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:21.180> also<00:02:21.330> allows<00:02:21.750> the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
weight reduction and it also allows the

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.750 
weight reduction and it also allows the
cowling<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.440> be<00:02:22.560> tipped<00:02:22.860> farther<00:02:23.250> towards<00:02:23.640> the
