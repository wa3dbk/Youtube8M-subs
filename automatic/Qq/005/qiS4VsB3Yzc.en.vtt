00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
I'm not hungry at all so I pigged out

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.240 
I'm not hungry at all so I pigged out
this<00:01:43.420> weekend<00:01:43.840> not<00:01:44.080> a<00:01:44.110> ton<00:01:44.380> just<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:44.830> little<00:01:45.100> bit

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
this weekend not a ton just a little bit

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.520 
this weekend not a ton just a little bit
and<00:01:45.490> so<00:01:46.270> I<00:01:46.330> guess<00:01:46.479> that's<00:01:46.690> not<00:01:46.810> picking<00:01:47.200> up<00:01:47.289> but

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
and so I guess that's not picking up but

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.169 
and so I guess that's not picking up but
whatever<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.220> so<00:01:48.399> I<00:01:48.429> thought<00:01:48.700> you<00:01:48.759> know<00:01:48.910> what

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
whatever and so I thought you know what

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:50.760 
whatever and so I thought you know what
it's<00:01:49.360> going<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.569> be<00:01:49.720> a<00:01:49.750> load<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.229> I<00:01:50.410> didn't

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
it's going to be a load and I didn't

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.889 
it's going to be a load and I didn't
think<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:51.130> Tom<00:01:51.369> because<00:01:51.910> who<00:01:52.300> thinks<00:01:52.600> it<00:01:52.720> Tom

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
think of Tom because who thinks it Tom

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.950 
think of Tom because who thinks it Tom
right<00:01:53.789> so<00:01:54.789> anyway<00:01:54.880> and<00:01:55.210> then<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.330> saw<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.660> video

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
right so anyway and then I saw the video

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.490 
right so anyway and then I saw the video
from<00:01:56.319> last<00:01:56.860> one<00:01:57.520> pound<00:01:57.789> hey<00:01:58.090> baby<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.690> so<00:01:59.319> good

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
Eileen know and I'm doing it I started

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.230 
Eileen know and I'm doing it I started
off<00:02:08.440> at<00:02:09.119> 139<00:02:10.119> 140<00:02:10.959> and<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:12.069> was<00:02:12.280> on<00:02:12.550> Sunday

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
off at 139 140 and that was on Sunday

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.020 
off at 139 140 and that was on Sunday
and<00:02:13.540> then<00:02:14.200> I've<00:02:14.590> been<00:02:14.650> actually<00:02:15.490> sticking<00:02:15.790> to

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
and then I've been actually sticking to

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.660 
and then I've been actually sticking to
the<00:02:16.150> HCG<00:02:16.780> i<00:02:16.810> weighed<00:02:17.140> myself<00:02:17.350> today<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.190> i<00:02:18.459> was

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
the HCG i weighed myself today and i was

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.430 
the HCG i weighed myself today and i was
130<00:02:20.940> 6.2<00:02:21.940> or<00:02:22.450> something<00:02:22.870> like<00:02:22.990> that<00:02:23.050> it<00:02:23.230> was

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
130 6.2 or something like that it was

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.070 
130 6.2 or something like that it was
fantastic<00:02:23.680> because<00:02:24.580> HCG<00:02:25.300> definitely<00:02:25.840> works

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
fantastic because HCG definitely works

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.870 
fantastic because HCG definitely works
for<00:02:26.350> me<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.740> made<00:02:27.069> me<00:02:27.100> not<00:02:27.280> hungry<00:02:27.580> then

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
for me and it made me not hungry then

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.180 
for me and it made me not hungry then
this<00:02:28.660> morning<00:02:28.870> Tom<00:02:29.260> came<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.830> I<00:02:29.890> know<00:02:29.950> I'm<00:02:30.130> not

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
this morning Tom came and I know I'm not

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.580 
this morning Tom came and I know I'm not
allowed<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.580> do<00:02:30.790> h2go<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.450> tongues<00:02:31.660> here<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:32.560> I

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
allowed to do h2go and tongues here so I

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.980 
allowed to do h2go and tongues here so I
won't<00:02:32.830> do<00:02:33.010> that<00:02:33.040> but<00:02:33.550> I'm<00:02:33.819> hoping<00:02:34.600> but<00:02:34.900> i'm

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
won't do that but I'm hoping but i'm

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.380 
won't do that but I'm hoping but i'm
probably<00:02:35.230> going<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.709> get<00:02:35.830> on<00:02:35.950> HCG<00:02:36.459> two<00:02:37.240> days

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
probably going to get on HCG two days

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.449 
probably going to get on HCG two days
before<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:38.140> he's<00:02:38.500> supposed<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:38.860> leave<00:02:39.160> so

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
before and he's supposed to leave so

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.699 
before and he's supposed to leave so
that<00:02:39.490> it's<00:02:39.760> in<00:02:39.880> my<00:02:40.060> system<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:41.200> i'm<00:02:41.290> hoping<00:02:41.440> to

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
that it's in my system so i'm hoping to

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.770 
that it's in my system so i'm hoping to
stick<00:02:41.890> with<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.069> what<00:02:42.580> made<00:02:43.060> me<00:02:43.209> do<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.390> is<00:02:43.630> i

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
stick with it what made me do it is i

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.210 
stick with it what made me do it is i
actually

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220
