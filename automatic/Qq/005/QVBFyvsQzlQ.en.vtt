00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.529
 colloquial English and those 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.380
 simple methods that can be 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.689
 colloquial 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.939
 get and did you come across such 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.220
 problem when you occupy language 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.119

 engaged in self- dating 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.850
 such a problem when there is a lot of information about 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.440
 practice is very familiar to very many 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.230
 I think at the time I am with this too 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.660
 faced because I looked very 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.940
 a lot of movies listened to a lot of audio 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.460
 I read a lot of books and 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.440
 all the time there was such a desire to know here 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.210
 as if to tell someone to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.219
 try to practice because 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.870
 a lot of words but what that phrase 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.329
 interesting then you might even be in 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.489
 tetradochku currently recording well here 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.640
 want to use in real life 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.170
 but where to take this real practice yes 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.229
 what is the practice let's 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:13.790
 let's do the writing exercise 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:16.439
 this practice read aloud this practice 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.360
 what else can be called something in 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.250
 our usual understanding is 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.340
 practice actually practice it 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.520
 speaking directly out loud to live 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.500
 environment with the carrier in fact it is 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.960

 start chatting there it's real 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.100

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.200
 border somewhere and yes 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.900
 Ensure this practice is enough 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.730
 practice or actually 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.510
 a little bit every day but how does 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.880
 the question of course there are such ways 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.300
 simple i tell my students about 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.570
 I mentioned them at the conference about how 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.420
 in itself do basicity on 5 simple 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.180
 fictional friend matters yes and with him 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.730

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.890
 and so on and so forth turn on the fantasy 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.230

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.750
 head vladivostok what to say out loud 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.300
 You should be how do you practice if 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.250
 you do not pronounce the words and this 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.480
 the problem is open your mouth and say it out loud 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.830
 real problem and how I came here to 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.440
 this simple simulator 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.370
 he called the phone call first 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.860
 it was all just imitation 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.810
 because i was talking to myself 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.660
 when i needed it imitated 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.370
 phone call it firstly help 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.010
 relax don't pay attention to something 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.989
 what people will say is just putting 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.150
 phone talk represented what 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:03:00.430
 you are asked and absolutely loud 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.989
 calmly answer for example you sit 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.720
 somewhere on the bench for example 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.310
 beautiful weather sit on the bench 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.540
 dial as if the phone or as 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.540
 like someone called you 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:31.989
 paid vat and wine mask 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:37.769
 voy a sea villa rental here content here 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.769
 antigen or huskies 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:54.440
 experts amount of linsi one in which and now 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.210
 on i don't find that no matter yes everyone 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.490
 just getting completely different talk 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.260
 but all sorts of new buzzwords pop up 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.120
 which you want to somehow screw in 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.650
 context I get it 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.900
 came across so my students 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.630
 few can overcome this barrier 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.550
 for myself and I came up with such a simple 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:15.070
 the way I call the phone call 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.080
 This is a simple entry to normal. 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.700
 carrier up to which you can afford 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.580
 phone download 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.460
 even such a simple cheap phone yes 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.430
 you can download it 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.650
 and just clicking on the play bring to your ear and 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.420
 I will ask you simple questions 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.160
 you know me, that is, this is not some 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:39.380
 Iâ€™m asking a stranger there first 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:45.170
 introduce i ask simple questions like 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:47.980
 your name is a and a and we have papers on here 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.250
 and at the same time I will make such big ones 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.730
 pauses 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.540
 so you can answer as if 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.100
 you really will and speak colloquial 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.200
 no conspiracy on wao phone conversation 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.510
 it works great for me 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.910
 checked and I really want you 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.120
 also tried it the fact is that it 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.670
 helps to really overcome this 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.370
 barrier and quietly quietly on 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.500
 simple simple questions develop your 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.750
 speaking out loud directly 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.030
 practice this skill spontaneously at all 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.430
 not that there is such a spontaneous communication you 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.500
 hear the question and instantly quickly 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.200
 learn to answer it because in 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.250
 real life you won't have time 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.560
 to think 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.360
 all there match and so on you 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.870
 you need to quickly learn how to respond and how 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.450
 of this 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.820
 already the simulator correctly the same as 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.850
 you learn to drive a car there 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.370
 learn how to do it felt it 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.710
 understand it all at the level of sensations but for now 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.650
 you do not sit behind the wheel and on, and you know if 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.080
 you are a driver one thing when you are taught all 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.390
 shows explains you are watching a video 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.550
 how is it done and listen to audio like 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.610
 do it read books about how it is 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:01.100
 do not do in the end do not get 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.720
 but in the end very often unfortunately so 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.630
 It turns out that you learn English at 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.550
 future this fact teach him to us 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.220
 better try talking now on 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.110
 The level at which you are very 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.090
 it is important that this simulator can 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.940
 use no matter what level 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.070
 which you now own and if you already 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.930
 know how to connect two words to say how are you 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.670
 name you already can basically 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.290
 use the simulator why 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:30.740
 that first you will answer these 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:32.780
 questions half an hour you will have 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.680
 confusion of some sort but gradually you 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:38.570
 teach yourself to think and every time you are already 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.310
 will be on the same questions seemed 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.890
 would answer more complete more 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.050
 deployed to and while you 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.330
 watch something you read did 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.700
 vocabulary your answers 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.500
 will improve all the time and you will 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.140
 getting the most important motivation on 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.180
 success you yourself will like what you 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.490
 have this result and easy 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.290
 fix them easy to see each 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.230
 once the questions will be different they will 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.700
 gradually change their shape they are you 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.740
 become a little harder somewhere 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.560
 a bit more spontaneous somewhere funny 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.470
 somewhere unexpected to you a little bit 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.360
 train well in general in a nutshell i 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:17.390
 I think not explained what it is yes 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.520
