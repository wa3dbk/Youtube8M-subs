00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 very good girls how about us 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.620
 we found in the following map 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.899
 multiplayer of the new dlc to stores 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.870
 that I'm going to show you in the climent channel 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.400
 see how nice the loading screen 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.230
 and also how do I have the colors in the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.940
 Real game that looks super cool and 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.260
 the map more of the same thing really that I 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.090
 has surprised a lot because it is 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.920
 multiplayer game playing and entertainment 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.590
 how nice it is here you see how that 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.420
 everything revolves around a central area and 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.230
 around then we have a path that 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.480
 surrounds the entire map 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.160
 we choose high and we are going to give us a 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.960
 come back to see if you like the map 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.059
 ostia I forgot to remove the bots 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.040
 ok perfect boy solved ya haywood 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.719
 if you have the magic of editing in 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.370
 first place general map of the map here 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.379
 we have it quite simple, look at that 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.360
 the two remains of the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.340
 two teams here we are with the team 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.800
 of atlases and on the opposite side that 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.930
 it looks pretty easy right down then 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.309
 would be born the sentinel team so 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.010
 nothing is very simple or basically 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.140
 we can go to the central zone and the map 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.820
 is circular or is all the way the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.890
 the only road there is around the map and 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.829
 then we have the central area there 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.530
 Well, four places where we can 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.420
 enter two are in each respawn and then 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.979
 I can is by the sides 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.479
 the case let's start to surround it and 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.490
 then we get to the central area is 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.040
 a map that I liked a lot 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.960
 the theme of colors that has this 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.369
 brown he cited is orange and now as 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.470
 I have the game with the colors these 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.630
 so showy really that is 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.340
 very cool there is water everywhere 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.259
 river that is the dynamic element this 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.940
 map pulls more per dynamic element in 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.039
 time for the hidden streak if you look 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.600
 they throw it by hidden streak or by element 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.280
 dynamic look here this waterfall what 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.830
 cool is really cool the truth 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.810
 mitation I liked it a lot and then 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.490
 we have here these species of series of 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.039
 ramps looks like skate tracks 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.409
 you seem to see are solar panels now 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.600
 that I realized giants so that it 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.369
 ate and cleaned and they also arrived here 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.929
 you take the energy and such and basically 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.940
 Well, if we go here, we go back to 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.100
 respawn so we're not going to peek at 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.450
 the central zone here then down 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.979
 we can go to the river we have to 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.979
 duck to get into these areas 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.220
 and since I'm starting to hear the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.810
 friend element maybe but good here in 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.399
 half we have the tower is quite 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.899
 big here with the hook that you had 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.030
 to guti because you get up there like 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.649
 it's beautiful then I'll upload a gameplay 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.140
 explain the anus ex skill everything to 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.400
 detail and is very very cool shot the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.290
 I liked the map a lot 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.090
 gameplay is great he plays a 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.310
 domain name and as you see then by 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.200
 any area there are four sites we can 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.970
 enter what is being in the area 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.620
 central so nothing we will wait for the 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.970
 dynamic element that is this river that is 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.360
 poisons 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.950
 eye eye I'm already hearing there's something eye a 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.360
 game that is happening here to see that is 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.120
 what breaks not the panels these 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.920
 they do something strange tourism had kid 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.270
 to see how the river changes color 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.400
 Look, look, look how it gets infected 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.790
 mother I saw the fish that have gone to the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.160
 shit 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.730
 wait, keep jumping not 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.730
 forget is dying 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.290
 that and this is and now if we get 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.150
 we die suddenly but as you see 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.590
 we have a little bit of damage there that we 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.080
 he is fucking life to see how much 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.430
 It took us a long time to die 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.410
 well I quite like the time they have 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.600
 put and as of guys then another map 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.130
 medium very easy to learn and ya 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.570
 I say that the gameplay is great the 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.370
 very cool atmosphere and colors 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.620
 also and this is the dynamic element 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.870
 it's the river that gets poisoned and kills us there 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.890
 so nothing will move to the next 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.810
 multiplayer I hope you have 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.560
 delighted this video and see you in the 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.560
 next goodbye
