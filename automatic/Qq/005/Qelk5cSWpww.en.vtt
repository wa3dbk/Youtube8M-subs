00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.160

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.170
 koi farm that comes to the netherlands 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.780
 invitation from resin people he is coming 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.610
 just for us 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.700
 comes here comes here just in the 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.340
 work in the store but go in addition 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.700
 we have a very cool reading three times 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.850
 to hold 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.190
 He will explain how things work out 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.230
 she sails at his nursery and next to it 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.120
 takes that very high quality toos 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.890
 with which for sale 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.500
 but what is perhaps even more beautiful 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.280
 he also takes more photos of photographs 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.820
 and video of its highest quality dead 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.309
 and those who sell them 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.320
 in you trade with him it goes in teasing 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.370
 I calculate how much it is for you 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.440
 but it and deal with the breeder and you 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.080
 then buy a fish that is still in japan 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.600
 and the price of that fish also includes it 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.860
 the asuka which means azukari costs 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.690
 skin care 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.220
 someone that someone else fishes for you 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.860
 so take care in this case 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.680
 sick yoshi and they make sure that 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.380
 fish in the mudpond goes there 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.680
 becomes and thus grows into a beautiful and 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.170
 insiders a biennial fish that after one 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.240
 you can get an example from the previous one 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.119
 year or last year was a fish 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.610
 they were about 19 centimeters 19 half 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.210
 centimeters some 20 centimeters and that 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.439
 they are all around 46 47 now 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.520
 centimeters 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.409
 so it's really a very nice result 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.520
 and they are also whole 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.799
 good in color and build the pattern and 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.020
 when we get the fish out of the 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.939
 get mudpond then we have contact and 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.830
 Then you can choose to have that fish yet 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.570
 leave points in the coin once 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.100
 are therefore another year away 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.260
 we have that ourselves with a number 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.909
 done fishing 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.630
 of which there 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:10.220
 large number have now been sitting for 3 years 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.590
 and now the 8085 and even 87 centimeters 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.530
 tap so that is really very beautiful 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.349
 result and is one and an advantageous 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.290
 way to really get a jumbo koi 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.360
 do you want to be there because it is 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.560
 limited we can't do that with 100 people 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.400
 we do not want we want it intimate 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.950
 to hold 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.580
 so we have a maximum space for 60 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.360

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:39.709
