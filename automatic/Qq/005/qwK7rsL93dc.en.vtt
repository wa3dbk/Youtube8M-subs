00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.600
 hello and welcome to the salon vision 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.969
 of the future 2014 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.980
 we are here on the handling pole 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.660
 so or behind me you have the range 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.759
 front loaders and also 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.869
 also telescopic loaders 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.000
 a whole range of materials 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.460
 intended for the mutation of different 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.989
 agricultural products so today we 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.899
 let's introduce the two range of chargers 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:31.480
 front series 900 series to 900 series 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:33.100
 and we also present a whole 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.570
 series of joystick disputes for the 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.320
 therefore control front loaders 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.520
 the particularity of these joystick and that 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.320
 you can control the front loader 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.330
 but also that we can control 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.460
 tractor transmission forward 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.660
 reverse is also the climb 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.340
 or the descent of the reports of the 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.620
 transmission so all functions 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.090
 loader and tractor 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.650
 tractor transmission can be 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.090
 control on the joystick of the hand 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.800
 right and left hand remains 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.590
 completely available for the steering wheel 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.820
 of the tractor then to vision of the future we 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.479
 also present the range 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.250
 and even 9.8 telescopic loaders 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.290
 or the customers who are here well can 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.880

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.430

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.900

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.660

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.130

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.740
