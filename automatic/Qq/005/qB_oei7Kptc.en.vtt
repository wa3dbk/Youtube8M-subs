that<00:01:34.290> didn't<00:01:34.770> actually<00:01:35.310> melt<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.820> any<00:01:36.299> cocoa

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
that didn't actually melt and any cocoa

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.420 
that didn't actually melt and any cocoa
powder<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.049> might<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.350> clumped<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.829> gets

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
powder that might have clumped up gets

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.840 
powder that might have clumped up gets
strained<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:39.799> so<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.890> want<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.040> nice<00:01:41.250> smooth

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
strained out so you want a nice smooth

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.670 
strained out so you want a nice smooth
sauce<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.899> that's<00:01:43.020> pretty<00:01:43.259> much<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.590> a

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
sauce and that's pretty much it it's a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.010 
sauce and that's pretty much it it's a
very<00:01:44.009> easy<00:01:44.310> recipe<00:01:44.670> makes<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.149> very<00:01:45.600> dark

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
very easy recipe makes a very dark

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.920 
very easy recipe makes a very dark
chocolate<00:01:46.470> sauce<00:01:47.509> sometimes<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.570> like<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.720> use

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
chocolate sauce sometimes I like to use

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.270 
chocolate sauce sometimes I like to use
ganache<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.470> said<00:01:49.590> chocolate<00:01:49.920> sauce<00:01:50.070> but

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
ganache that said chocolate sauce but

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.710 
ganache that said chocolate sauce but
this<00:01:50.399> sauce<00:01:50.579> works<00:01:50.909> very<00:01:51.119> well<00:01:51.210> too<00:01:51.570> with

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
this sauce works very well too with

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.389 
this sauce works very well too with
plated<00:01:52.049> desserts<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.040> I'm<00:01:53.130> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.310> go

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
plated desserts and so I'm going to go

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.219 
plated desserts and so I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.000> chill<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.869> then<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.020> cool

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
ahead and chill this and then I cool

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.679 
ahead and chill this and then I cool
down<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.500> room<00:01:55.530> temperature<00:01:55.920> basically<00:01:56.689> until

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
down to room temperature basically until

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.420 
down to room temperature basically until
it's<00:01:57.840> ready<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.049> use<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.439> it'll<00:01:58.920> thicken<00:01:59.130> as

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
it's ready to use and it'll thicken as

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.880 
it's ready to use and it'll thicken as
it<00:01:59.460> cools<00:01:59.610> I<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:00.840> our<00:02:01.229> chocolate<00:02:01.469> sauce<00:02:01.710> and

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.209 
our caramel sauce in little sauce
bottles<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.500> don't<00:02:04.649> want<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.860> store<00:02:05.040> them

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
bottles so you don't want to store them

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.649 
bottles so you don't want to store them
like<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.549> because<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:05.969> can't<00:02:06.180> microwave

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
like this because you can't microwave

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.600 
like this because you can't microwave
them<00:02:06.840> because<00:02:07.049> these<00:02:07.200> bottles<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.710> melt<00:02:08.069> so

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
them because these bottles just melt so

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.650 
them because these bottles just melt so
when<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.819> store<00:02:09.030> them<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.300> want<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.479> keep

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
when you store them you want to keep

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.360 
when you store them you want to keep
them<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:09.899> some<00:02:10.140> kind<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.349> microwavable<00:02:11.190> Bowl

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
them in some kind of microwavable Bowl

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.890 
them in some kind of microwavable Bowl
or<00:02:11.550> something<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:11.970> then<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.450> can<00:02:12.599> pour

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
or something like that then you can pour

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.670 
or something like that then you can pour
the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.729 
the
wormed<00:02:14.659> fluid<00:02:15.659> of<00:02:15.870> warm<00:02:16.109> caramel<00:02:16.439> weren't

wormed fluid of warm caramel weren't
chocolate<00:02:17.040> sauce<00:02:17.189> into<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.549> bottle<00:02:17.849> using<00:02:17.969> a

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
chocolate sauce into the bottle using a

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.929 
chocolate sauce into the bottle using a
funnel<00:02:19.040> but<00:02:20.040> we're<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:20.370> going<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.700> do<00:02:20.819> what

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
funnel but we're just going to do what

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:26.679 
funnel but we're just going to do what
we're<00:02:21.060> going<00:02:21.329> to<00:02:21.359> do<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.659> just<00:02:21.810> pipe<00:02:22.019> some<00:02:22.230> dots

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.599 

and<00:02:27.689> when<00:02:27.780> you're<00:02:27.900> piping<00:02:28.079> the<00:02:28.349> dots<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.920> want

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
and when you're piping the dots you want

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.059 
and when you're piping the dots you want
to<00:02:29.700> squeeze<00:02:30.000> without<00:02:30.989> moving<00:02:31.379> around<00:02:31.650> and

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
to squeeze without moving around and

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:43.900 
to squeeze without moving around and
then<00:02:32.430> I'll<00:02:32.519> give<00:02:32.639> you<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.760> nice<00:02:33.000> smooth<00:02:33.540> dot

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.930 

and<00:02:44.000> then<00:02:44.630> you<00:02:44.810> can<00:02:44.960> create<00:02:45.380> a<00:02:45.650> row<00:02:46.520> of<00:02:46.730> dots

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
and then you can create a row of dots

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.570 
and then you can create a row of dots
using<00:02:47.780> different<00:02:48.110> sizes<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:49.160> that<00:02:49.310> way<00:02:49.460> it

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
using different sizes so that way it

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.580 
using different sizes so that way it
gives<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:49.910> nice<00:02:50.030> different<00:02:50.930> look<00:02:51.320> to<00:02:51.560> it

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
gives it a nice different look to it

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.440 
gives it a nice different look to it
right<00:02:52.130> another<00:02:52.400> style<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:52.790> can<00:02:53.030> do<00:02:53.180> is<00:02:53.330> you

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
right another style you can do is you

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.990 
right another style you can do is you
can<00:02:53.540> line<00:02:53.720> up<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.930> row<00:02:54.080> of<00:02:54.230> dots<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.770> then<00:02:55.730> just

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
can line up a row of dots and then just

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.140 
can line up a row of dots and then just
drag<00:02:56.240> your<00:02:56.450> toothpick<00:02:56.900> through<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.850> then

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
drag your toothpick through it and then

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.730 
drag your toothpick through it and then
I'll<00:02:59.270> create<00:03:01.330> almost<00:03:02.330> like<00:03:02.570> hearts<00:03:05.740> through

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
I'll create almost like hearts through

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.280 
I'll create almost like hearts through
them<00:03:06.890> by<00:03:07.310> using<00:03:07.490> a<00:03:07.610> toothpick<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.300> could<00:03:09.200> of

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
them by using a toothpick you could of

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.340 
them by using a toothpick you could of
course<00:03:09.350> just<00:03:09.920> draw<00:03:10.900> squiggles<00:03:11.900> on<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.140> plate

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
course just draw squiggles on the plate

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.710 
course just draw squiggles on the plate
if<00:03:12.530> you<00:03:12.620> want<00:03:13.270> just<00:03:14.270> like<00:03:14.450> that<00:03:16.480> alright<00:03:17.480> and

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
if you want just like that alright and

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.140 
if you want just like that alright and
with<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.840> really<00:03:18.170> dry<00:03:18.560> desert<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:19.370> kind<00:03:20.000> of<00:03:20.030> like

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
with a really dry desert a kind of like

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.690 
with a really dry desert a kind of like
Linzer<00:03:20.770> or<00:03:21.770> you<00:03:21.950> can<00:03:22.100> for<00:03:22.340> this<00:03:22.430> case<00:03:22.580> you

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
Linzer or you can for this case you

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.040 
Linzer or you can for this case you
consider<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.150> dry<00:03:23.360> desert<00:03:23.420> because<00:03:23.810> there's<00:03:23.960> no

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
consider a dry desert because there's no

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.260 
consider a dry desert because there's no
icing<00:03:24.440> on<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:25.340> want<00:03:25.520> to<00:03:25.580> flood<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:26.000> plate

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
icing on it you want to flood the plate

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.140 
icing on it you want to flood the plate
so<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.660> way<00:03:26.750> there's<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:26.960> lot<00:03:27.200> of<00:03:27.730> sauce<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:29.030> go

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
so that way there's a lot of sauce to go

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.910 
so that way there's a lot of sauce to go
with<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.360> dry<00:03:29.600> desert<00:03:29.660> now<00:03:30.560> there's<00:03:30.710> a<00:03:30.770> couple

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
with the dry desert now there's a couple

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.350 
with the dry desert now there's a couple
things<00:03:31.070> you<00:03:31.340> can<00:03:31.370> do<00:03:31.610> with<00:03:31.760> this<00:03:31.880> you<00:03:32.090> can<00:03:32.210> do

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
things you can do with this you can do
