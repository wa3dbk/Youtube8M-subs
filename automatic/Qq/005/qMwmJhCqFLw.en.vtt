First we will grate Masoor dal (Red Lentil)  and Prawns in mixer. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.246
Lets grate dal first.

00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:12.878
Add little bit of water.

00:01:20.261 --> 00:01:23.280
Dal batter is done.

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:38.569
Now grate the prawns.

00:01:47.672 --> 00:01:55.662
Prawns should be mildly grated.

00:01:56.529 --> 00:02:02.511
Now mix all the ingredients.

00:02:04.064 --> 00:02:05.107

Now add egg. I will add only half egg here. 

00:03:46.345 --> 00:03:51.530
Batter is ready. Now I will fry them in oil.

00:03:55.992 --> 00:04:03.956
Prawn sometimes bursts in oil. So keep a lid nearby to cover your pan if needed.

00:04:06.276 --> 00:04:18.764
After frying one side for 5 mins, 
turn them to fry the other side for 5 more mins.

00:04:24.075 --> 00:04:28.793
Keep oven at low and cover the pan.
.

00:04:32.256 --> 00:04:36.495
Check if its cooked  or not.

00:04:38.515 --> 00:04:45.798
I think its done, but you can fry it bit more if you want.

00:04:50.084 --> 00:04:52.789
Prawns Fritter is complete. 

00:05:00.841 --> 00:05:11.178
It is a very good evening snack. Enjoy it with bread and sauce.
