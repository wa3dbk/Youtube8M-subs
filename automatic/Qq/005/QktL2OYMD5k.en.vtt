 double welcome back to me 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.759
 channel now I bring you a review and a 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.310
 housing that was sent to me by urban 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.990
 armor kill let's see them first of all 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.210
 I want to thank the company 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.850
 urban tree king for sending me these 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.800
 carcasas as we can see one is for the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.099
 iPhone 5 and the other one is for the Galaxy S3 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.500
 both very similar the price is 34 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.420
 dollars with 95 cents on both models 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.640
 in the bottom of the box we can 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.160
 see what it says for iphone 5 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.469
 next to bring what they are guaje that is the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.210
 kirk marble curve vibration and in the 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.610
 back we find the ones that are 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.559
 a little bit of the specifications we can 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.469
 see that holds falls brings a protector 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.210
 of screen and we can also see that 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.760
 it is very easy to access what they are 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.320
 the buttons also the galaxy 3 includes 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.899
 the same and in the back of the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.480
 box is also the same we will start by 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.210
 take out what is iphone 5 and then 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.799
 we'll start with the galaxy s3 so that 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.540
 you can give an idea that 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.120
 this company does 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.920
 the carcasses equal simple and 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.540
 simply the only thing that changes is that 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.640
 one is for the iphone and the other is for 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.770
 the galaxy and one is white and the other 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.510
 it's black too, like I said to the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.030
 principle and I do not know if to the box that we 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.560
 it brought what is a screen saver 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.240
 the truth that's good because it does not 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.040
 all companies add what is a 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.170
 screen saver also brings us 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.970
 what is the wipe to be able to clean 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.400
 our screen before putting our 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.070
 protector and the indications like 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.620
 we can notice it is very solid and at the same time 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.440
 it's very flexible we can also notice 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.420
 that both have a military design 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.030
 and we can also see that they have 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.220
 included as screws and you look that 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.479
 be assembled by those screws but 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.670
 it is not like that 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.310
 both cakes as I said and I repeat 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.170
 they are very similar, the only thing that changes is 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.240
 the model and the color now let's 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.060
 try to put them so that you see 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.590
 how easy it is to put on and how can 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.869
 see what you have to do is just a little bit 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.509
 pressure side to that for 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.190
 the phone between correctly always 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.080
 it is advisable to first put the part 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.550
 where the buttons are, it looks pretty 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.700
 well how can you see the space of the 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.950
 camera is 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.569
 perfect has a good space which 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.640
 It's good when it comes to taking pictures 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.500
 as we can see the buttons on the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.780
 are a little volume solids which 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.980
 is the margin of the case and that helps us 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.989
 that when at the time of pressing 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.280
 respond much faster too 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.650
 we can see that we have a space 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.319
 quite visible at the time of for 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.450
 put what is the tone and lower it to 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.160
 vibration mode we also see that in 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.349
 the bottom part the cuts are very 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.660
 good what is the speaker and the input 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.730
 for our hearing aids in the part of 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.590
 payment button is that of the same also 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.110
 we can see what he has with one hand is 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.790
 very easy since it does not make it very big 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.950
 that is the phone many people what 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.930
 What we are looking for is that it protects us 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.849
 the phone but at the same time feel 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.069
 very well in our hand as well 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.200
 we see in the galaxy s3 there is also what 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.540
 which are the buttons that came from either the 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.370
 payment and of the gold the volume here is 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.110
 can appreciate a little better is not 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.450
 too much what is left or the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.190
 edge but that helps when 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.319
 press will be much easier in the 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.390
 hand feels pretty good feels 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.459
 comfortable is a galaxy s3 power or is a 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.620
 bit harder since it's bigger and 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.200
 handle it with only one good hand friends 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.549
 and if they want to buy this one 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.040
 perhaps they want to check what colors there are 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.260
 I invite you to go to urban assemble the 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.900
 There they can look for the model 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.469
 that you have galaxy s3 galaxy s 4 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.150
 5 or cases 4 cases iPhone 4s 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:35.859
 They choose the color they like the most 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.750
 the prices are very good the link is 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.829
 I leave them in the description and so we 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.829
 we see in the next video
