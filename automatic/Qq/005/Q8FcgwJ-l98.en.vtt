00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
that drop attack right there because

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.420 
that drop attack right there because
that<00:04:14.890> roof<00:04:15.430> has<00:04:15.700> rebar<00:04:16.150> on<00:04:16.359> it<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:17.680> might<00:04:18.280> be

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
that roof has rebar on it I might be

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.759 
that roof has rebar on it I might be
able<00:04:18.640> to<00:04:18.760> get<00:04:19.239> up<00:04:19.390> on<00:04:19.540> this<00:04:19.780> fence<00:04:20.140> though<00:04:20.470> and

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
able to get up on this fence though and

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.450 
able to get up on this fence though and
show<00:04:21.400> you<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.730> drop<00:04:21.940> attack<00:04:22.360> and<00:04:23.400> I<00:04:24.400> don't

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
show you the drop attack and I don't

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.010 
show you the drop attack and I don't
think<00:04:24.790> it's<00:04:24.940> going<00:04:25.060> to<00:04:25.150> let<00:04:25.270> me<00:04:25.450> do<00:04:25.600> that<00:04:25.780> so

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
think it's going to let me do that so

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.180 
think it's going to let me do that so
what<00:04:26.410> I'm<00:04:26.500> going<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.680> do<00:04:26.830> is<00:04:26.950> I'm<00:04:27.040> going<00:04:27.130> to

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190

that real quick only take a minute

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.230 
that real quick only take a minute
the<00:04:44.050> only<00:04:44.200> bad<00:04:44.530> thing<00:04:44.560> about<00:04:45.070> this<00:04:45.460> weapon<00:04:45.760> it

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
the only bad thing about this weapon it

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.120 
the only bad thing about this weapon it
has<00:04:46.540> a<00:04:46.570> slightly<00:04:47.169> slower<00:04:47.710> swing<00:04:48.490> speed<00:04:49.000> than<00:04:49.690> a

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
has a slightly slower swing speed than a

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.320 
has a slightly slower swing speed than a
khopesh<00:04:51.130> or<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.970> short<00:04:52.630> short<00:04:52.900> short<00:04:53.200> short<00:04:54.330> but

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
khopesh or a short short short short but

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.870 
khopesh or a short short short short but
that's<00:04:55.930> kind<00:04:56.229> of<00:04:56.260> personal<00:04:56.530> preference

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
that's kind of personal preference

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.300 
that's kind of personal preference
personally<00:04:58.540> I<00:04:58.600> think<00:04:58.930> with<00:04:59.140> that<00:04:59.310> 134

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
personally I think with that 134

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.390 
personally I think with that 134
handling<00:05:00.880> it's<00:05:01.120> got<00:05:01.360> a<00:05:01.600> fast<00:05:02.140> enough<00:05:02.400> swing

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
handling it's got a fast enough swing

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.360 
handling it's got a fast enough swing
speed<00:05:03.669> for<00:05:04.000> me<00:05:04.120> I<00:05:04.560> also<00:05:05.560> like<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:06.010> longer

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
speed for me I also like the longer

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.010 
speed for me I also like the longer
blade<00:05:06.550> on<00:05:06.970> it<00:05:07.000> because<00:05:07.419> it<00:05:07.540> has<00:05:07.660> a<00:05:07.690> longer

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
blade on it because it has a longer

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.469 
blade on it because it has a longer
reach<00:05:08.380> and<00:05:09.130> like<00:05:09.310> I<00:05:09.430> said<00:05:09.490> earlier<00:05:09.669> all<00:05:10.270> you

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
reach and like I said earlier all you

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.900 
reach and like I said earlier all you
need<00:05:10.660> to<00:05:10.810> do<00:05:10.960> is<00:05:11.290> touch<00:05:11.800> a<00:05:11.830> zombie<00:05:12.370> with<00:05:12.640> the

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
need to do is touch a zombie with the

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.270 
need to do is touch a zombie with the
tip<00:05:13.330> of<00:05:13.570> the<00:05:13.720> weapon<00:05:14.110> and<00:05:14.350> it's<00:05:14.770> enough<00:05:15.130> to

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
tip of the weapon and it's enough to

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.230 
tip of the weapon and it's enough to
kill<00:05:15.490> them<00:05:15.700> so<00:05:17.070> just<00:05:18.070> really<00:05:18.370> quickly<00:05:18.790> going

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
kill them so just really quickly going

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.190 
kill them so just really quickly going
to<00:05:19.330> come<00:05:19.540> here<00:05:20.080> and<00:05:20.290> wait<00:05:20.530> till<00:05:20.770> night<00:05:21.040> and

sadly he's running away from me um it's
not<00:05:52.220> the<00:05:52.430> best<00:05:52.730> thing<00:05:53.000> to<00:05:53.060> be<00:05:53.330> out<00:05:53.540> at<00:05:53.840> night

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.010 
not the best thing to be out at night
yep<00:05:55.010> there's<00:05:55.340> one<00:05:55.610> right<00:05:56.240> there<00:05:56.300> in<00:05:56.690> front<00:05:56.900> of

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020

yep there's one right there in front of
me

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
me

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.140 
me
so<00:05:58.360> one<00:05:59.360> hit<00:05:59.630> and<00:05:59.870> he's<00:05:59.950> dead<00:06:00.950> you<00:06:01.580> also<00:06:01.790> have

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
so one hit and he's dead you also have

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.110 
so one hit and he's dead you also have
the<00:06:02.330> charge<00:06:02.660> attack<00:06:03.280> where<00:06:04.280> you<00:06:04.610> can<00:06:04.820> hold

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
the charge attack where you can hold

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.510 
the charge attack where you can hold
Artie<00:06:05.750> since<00:06:06.170> it's<00:06:06.350> a<00:06:06.410> single<00:06:06.620> hand<00:06:07.010> weapon

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
Artie since it's a single hand weapon

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.140 
Artie since it's a single hand weapon
and<00:06:07.760> then<00:06:08.330> release<00:06:08.750> it<00:06:08.780> for<00:06:09.350> a<00:06:09.650> much<00:06:10.640> stronger

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
and then release it for a much stronger

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.950 
and then release it for a much stronger
damaging<00:06:12.020> attack<00:06:12.460> which<00:06:13.460> is<00:06:13.490> one<00:06:14.360> way<00:06:14.570> that

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
damaging attack which is one way that

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.310 
damaging attack which is one way that
you<00:06:15.530> know<00:06:15.650> you<00:06:15.710> do<00:06:16.280> it<00:06:16.310> and<00:06:16.700> you<00:06:17.510> can<00:06:17.720> kill<00:06:17.990> even

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
you know you do it and you can kill even

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.370 
you know you do it and you can kill even
a<00:06:18.560> higher<00:06:18.830> damaged<00:06:19.490> monster<00:06:20.180> you<00:06:20.990> have<00:06:21.080> to<00:06:21.290> be

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
a higher damaged monster you have to be

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.320 
a higher damaged monster you have to be
a<00:06:21.410> little<00:06:21.860> bit<00:06:22.130> careful<00:06:22.610> with<00:06:22.760> these<00:06:23.060> guys

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
a little bit careful with these guys

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.050 
a little bit careful with these guys
only<00:06:24.050> because<00:06:24.380> they<00:06:24.560> do<00:06:24.830> so<00:06:25.190> much<00:06:25.220> damage<00:06:25.820> to

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
only because they do so much damage to

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.680 
only because they do so much damage to
you<00:06:26.680> that<00:06:27.680> if<00:06:28.280> you<00:06:28.520> get<00:06:28.700> surrounded<00:06:29.240> like<00:06:29.300> that

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.690 
you that if you get surrounded like that

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.840

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
they can kill you but as far as the

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.330 
they can kill you but as far as the
power<00:06:32.030> of<00:06:32.450> the<00:06:32.750> sword<00:06:33.050> the<00:06:33.440> sword<00:06:33.860> is
