were<00:02:21.450> actually<00:02:21.840> taken<00:02:22.409> so<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.040> can't<00:02:23.489> go

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
were actually taken so you can't go

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.589 
were actually taken so you can't go
further<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.920> be<00:02:25.920> specific<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:26.849> terms<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.299> what

further and be specific in terms of what

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.119 
further and be specific in terms of what
would<00:02:27.810> they<00:02:28.079> appear<00:02:28.409> in<00:02:28.590> because<00:02:29.040> it

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
would they appear in because it

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.640 
would they appear in because it
automatically<00:02:29.640> puts<00:02:29.879> them<00:02:30.030> in<00:02:30.329> order<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.110> when

automatically puts them in order of when

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.250 
automatically puts them in order of when
they<00:02:31.769> were<00:02:31.829> taken<00:02:32.370> not<00:02:32.849> by<00:02:33.120> image<00:02:33.720> name<00:02:33.989> or

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
they were taken not by image name or

they were taken not by image name or
anything<00:02:34.440> like<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.190> if<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.340> wanted<00:02:35.579> to

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
anything like that so if you wanted to

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.130 
anything like that so if you wanted to
change<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.030> image<00:02:36.180> names<00:02:36.540> for<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.900> matter

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
change the image names for that matter

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.860 
change the image names for that matter
you<00:02:37.739> can<00:02:37.769> try<00:02:38.159> but<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.519> won't<00:02:38.879> allow<00:02:39.599> you<00:02:39.659> to

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
you can try but it won't allow you to

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.860 
you can try but it won't allow you to
organize<00:02:40.200> them<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:41.069> order<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.640> name<00:02:42.420> because

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
organize them in order of name because

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.710 
organize them in order of name because
it<00:02:42.989> organizes<00:02:43.799> them<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:44.099> order<00:02:44.909> of<00:02:45.120> when<00:02:45.540> they

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
it organizes them in order of when they

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.349 
it organizes them in order of when they
were<00:02:45.780> taken<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:46.409> date<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.890> time<00:02:47.129> so<00:02:48.000> if<00:02:48.060> we<00:02:48.180> go

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
were taken so date and time so if we go

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.099 
were taken so date and time so if we go
back<00:02:48.390> one<00:02:50.299> again<00:02:51.299> you've<00:02:51.480> got<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.720> thumbnail

phone you just need to have the my files
File<00:04:11.430> Explorer<00:04:11.879> that<00:04:12.090> came<00:04:12.329> with<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.569> device

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
File Explorer that came with the device

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.370 
File Explorer that came with the device
so<00:04:13.440> if<00:04:13.530> you<00:04:13.620> go<00:04:13.769> to<00:04:13.829> there<00:04:14.389> and<00:04:15.389> then<00:04:15.810> navigate

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
so if you go to there and then navigate

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.479 
so if you go to there and then navigate
to<00:04:16.409> the<00:04:17.269> DCIM<00:04:18.269> folder<00:04:18.709> you<00:04:19.709> should<00:04:19.739> appear

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
to the DCIM folder you should appear

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.480 
to the DCIM folder you should appear
under<00:04:20.970> one<00:04:21.510> of<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.719> folders<00:04:22.200> here<00:04:22.380> we<00:04:22.500> go<00:04:22.620> DCIM

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
under one of the folders here we go DCIM

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.210 
under one of the folders here we go DCIM
that

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
that

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.010 
that
essentially<00:04:24.700> where<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.030> camera<00:04:25.360> puts<00:04:25.630> all<00:04:25.840> of

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
essentially where the camera puts all of

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.080 
essentially where the camera puts all of
its<00:04:26.140> files<00:04:26.410> and<00:04:27.040> then<00:04:27.160> if<00:04:27.280> you<00:04:27.340> go<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.490> camera

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
its files and then if you go to camera

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.110 
its files and then if you go to camera
you<00:04:29.050> can<00:04:29.230> then<00:04:29.350> see<00:04:29.530> all<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.770> imagery<00:04:30.280> that<00:04:30.610> is

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
you can then see all the imagery that is

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.230 
you can then see all the imagery that is
there<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:31.780> hence<00:04:32.620> all<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.490> trees<00:04:33.760> I<00:04:33.790> have

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
there and hence all the trees I have

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.870 
there and hence all the trees I have
there<00:04:34.540> as<00:04:34.720> well<00:04:34.900> so<00:04:35.400> what<00:04:36.400> we're<00:04:36.550> going<00:04:36.640> to<00:04:36.730> be

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
there as well so what we're going to be

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.000 
there as well so what we're going to be
doing<00:04:37.060> is<00:04:37.360> organizing<00:04:37.600> about<00:04:38.440> four<00:04:38.740> or<00:04:38.800> five

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
doing is organizing about four or five

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.340 
doing is organizing about four or five
of<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.790> images<00:04:40.180> from<00:04:40.420> here<00:04:40.750> into<00:04:40.960> a<00:04:40.990> separate

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
of the images from here into a separate

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.910 
of the images from here into a separate
folder<00:04:41.590> called<00:04:42.040> trees<00:04:42.430> now<00:04:43.360> four<00:04:43.630> go<00:04:43.900> to<00:04:43.960> menu

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
folder called trees now four go to menu

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.630 
folder called trees now four go to menu
and<00:04:45.070> then<00:04:46.060> move<00:04:46.780> it<00:04:47.560> then<00:04:47.680> put<00:04:47.890> stick<00:04:48.160> boxes

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
and then move it then put stick boxes

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.970 
and then move it then put stick boxes
next<00:04:48.880> to<00:04:49.150> everything<00:04:49.500> within<00:04:50.500> here<00:04:50.710> just<00:04:50.920> to

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
next to everything within here just to

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.440 
next to everything within here just to
make<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:51.160> a<00:04:51.310> little<00:04:51.460> bit<00:04:51.610> easier<00:04:52.000> so<00:04:52.060> I'm<00:04:52.270> going

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
make it a little bit easier so I'm going

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.110 
make it a little bit easier so I'm going
to<00:04:52.510> select<00:04:52.920> say<00:04:54.750> that<00:04:55.750> one<00:04:55.960> that<00:04:56.470> one<00:04:57.120> and

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
to select say that one that one and

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:05.200 
to select say that one that one and
we'll<00:04:58.360> do

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.879 

there<00:05:05.810> we<00:05:05.930> go<00:05:06.050> we'll<00:05:06.199> do<00:05:06.320> it<00:05:06.380> up<00:05:06.470> to<00:05:06.620> there<00:05:06.800> up

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
there we go we'll do it up to there up

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.610 
there we go we'll do it up to there up
to<00:05:06.919> danger<00:05:07.580> deep-water<00:05:08.330> and<00:05:09.050> then<00:05:09.410> what<00:05:09.530> we'll

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
to danger deep-water and then what we'll

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.310 
to danger deep-water and then what we'll
do<00:05:09.770> is<00:05:09.830> we'll<00:05:10.039> hit<00:05:10.220> move<00:05:10.570> and<00:05:11.570> then<00:05:12.080> it<00:05:12.110> says

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
do is we'll hit move and then it says
