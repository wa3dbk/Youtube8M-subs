00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.629 

there's<00:00:07.049> one<00:00:07.230> other<00:00:07.350> thing<00:00:07.470> that<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.460> I

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
there's one other thing that that I

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.000 
there's one other thing that that I
think<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:09.210> really<00:00:09.420> important<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.410> has

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
think is really important and that has

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.830 
think is really important and that has
to<00:00:11.160> do<00:00:11.309> with<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.550> whole<00:00:11.700> idea<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.090> when

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
to do with the whole idea that when

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.340 
to do with the whole idea that when
we're<00:00:12.990> aiming<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.469> gun<00:00:13.820> the<00:00:14.820> sights<00:00:15.210> help<00:00:16.109> us

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
we're aiming the gun the sights help us

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.460 
we're aiming the gun the sights help us
to<00:00:17.250> verify<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.960> alignment<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.109> gun<00:00:19.289> on<00:00:19.439> a

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
to verify the alignment of the gun on a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.300 
to verify the alignment of the gun on a
target<00:00:20.100> but<00:00:21.109> essentially<00:00:22.109> aiming<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.890> body

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
target but essentially aiming is a body

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.359 
target but essentially aiming is a body
index<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:24.060> body<00:00:24.449> index<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.439> kind<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.890> thing<00:00:26.130> it's

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
index a body index in kind of thing it's

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.339 
index a body index in kind of thing it's
a<00:00:26.460> body<00:00:26.699> feel<00:00:27.170> and<00:00:28.460> so<00:00:29.869> one<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.080> things

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
a body feel and so one of the things

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.770 
a body feel and so one of the things
that's<00:00:31.590> really<00:00:31.650> important<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.579> understand<00:00:33.570> is

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
that's really important to understand is

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.319 
that's really important to understand is
that<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.680> way<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.309> grip<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.640> gun<00:00:36.059> is

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that the way that you grip the gun is

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.479 
that the way that you grip the gun is
going<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.840> affect<00:00:37.230> your<00:00:37.530> accuracy<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.309> your

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
going to affect your accuracy and your

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.020 
going to affect your accuracy and your
consistency<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.570> your<00:00:39.719> shooting<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:41.030> your

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
consistency and your shooting and your

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.760 
consistency and your shooting and your
this<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.600> something<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.140> everybody<00:00:43.350> has<00:00:43.590> to

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
this is something that everybody has to

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.180 
this is something that everybody has to
feel<00:00:44.250> through<00:00:44.760> as<00:00:45.120> as<00:00:45.840> they<00:00:46.440> shoot<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:46.950> you

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
feel through as as they shoot as you

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.310 
feel through as as they shoot as you
will<00:00:47.730> discover<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.629> know<00:00:48.719> shooting<00:00:49.020> is

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
will discover you know shooting is

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.500 
will discover you know shooting is
simple<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.070> not<00:00:50.129> necessarily<00:00:50.789> easy<00:00:50.969> it

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
simple but it's not necessarily easy it

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.479 
simple but it's not necessarily easy it
takes<00:00:51.750> practice<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.500> lot<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.100> times<00:00:53.309> what's

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
takes practice a lot of times what's

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.040 
takes practice a lot of times what's
gonna<00:00:53.640> happen<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.300> you're<00:00:54.420> going<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.899> to

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
gonna happen is you're going to have to

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.830 
gonna happen is you're going to have to
figure<00:00:55.440> out<00:00:55.469> what<00:00:56.219> grip<00:00:56.579> actually<00:00:57.210> works<00:00:57.539> best

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
figure out what grip actually works best

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.049 
figure out what grip actually works best
for<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.199> because<00:00:58.350> what<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.280> don't<00:00:59.550> want<00:00:59.730> to

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
for you because what you don't want to

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.090 
for you because what you don't want to

people that are doing this and they
shoot<00:01:19.080> banging<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.220> they<00:01:20.670> adjust<00:01:21.090> their<00:01:21.270> grip

shoot banging and they adjust their grip
they're<00:01:21.810> trying<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.619> each<00:01:22.830> adjustment

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
they're trying and each adjustment

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.940 
they're trying and each adjustment
throws<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.240> gun<00:01:24.420> off<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.750> alignment<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.740> for

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
throws the gun off of alignment so for

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.039 
throws the gun off of alignment so for
consistency<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.700> shot<00:01:27.000> placement<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.869> want<00:01:27.990> a

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
consistency of shot placement you want a

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.410 
consistency of shot placement you want a
consistent<00:01:28.380> grip<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.009> what<00:01:29.490> helps<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
consistent grip and what helps that and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.260 
consistent grip and what helps that and
this<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.750> my<00:01:30.780> main<00:01:31.140> point<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.740> how<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.759> wrap

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
this is my main point is how you wrap

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.690 
this is my main point is how you wrap
the<00:01:33.600> two<00:01:33.840> hands<00:01:34.110> together<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.340> good<00:01:35.579> idea

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the two hands together and a good idea

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.929 
the two hands together and a good idea
to<00:01:36.420> think<00:01:36.780> about<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> idea<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.820> know

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
to think about is the idea that you know

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.620 
to think about is the idea that you know
you're<00:01:39.299> going<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.930> as<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.799> bring<00:01:41.159> your<00:01:41.970> other

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
you're going to as you bring your other

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.980 
you're going to as you bring your other
strong<00:01:43.229> hand

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
strong hand

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.969 
strong hand
or<00:01:44.229> support<00:01:45.009> him<00:01:45.280> in<00:01:45.729> to<00:01:46.180> support<00:01:46.659> your<00:01:47.380> master

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
or support him in to support your master

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.190 
or support him in to support your master
rep<00:01:48.220> you<00:01:48.820> want<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.180> have<00:01:49.299> your<00:01:49.420> knuckles<00:01:49.930> meet

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
rep you want to have your knuckles meet

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.370 
rep you want to have your knuckles meet
and<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.850> you<00:01:51.909> have<00:01:52.180> a<00:01:52.210> master<00:01:52.780> break<00:01:53.020> this<00:01:53.229> is

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
and so you have a master break this is

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.080 
and so you have a master break this is
the<00:01:53.500> master<00:01:53.950> drift<00:01:54.100> with<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.310> dominant<00:01:54.880> hand

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
the master drift with the dominant hand

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.690 
the master drift with the dominant hand
and<00:01:55.450> as<00:01:55.899> you<00:01:56.110> as<00:01:56.290> you<00:01:56.710> have<00:01:56.890> all<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.280> gun<00:01:57.490> you

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
and as you as you have all the gun you

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.719 
and as you as you have all the gun you
notice<00:01:58.060> that<00:01:58.659> there<00:01:59.289> are<00:01:59.590> two<00:02:00.250> sets<00:02:00.580> of

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
notice that there are two sets of

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.760
