videos of going through using palm mutes
we're<00:00:06.899> going<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.080> now<00:00:07.500> we're<00:00:07.620> going<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.799> focus

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
we're going to now we're going to focus

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.560 
we're going to now we're going to focus
on<00:00:08.220> palm<00:00:08.429> muting<00:00:08.730> with<00:00:08.820> singled<00:00:09.179> strings

on palm muting with singled strings
single<00:00:10.200> notes<00:00:12.230> pretty<00:00:13.230> much<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.469> same

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
single notes pretty much the same

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.959 
single notes pretty much the same
principle<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.429> you're<00:00:14.549> going<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.730> apply<00:00:14.849> to

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
principle that you're going to apply to

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.790 
principle that you're going to apply to
do<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:15.480> or<00:00:16.020> just<00:00:16.080> your<00:00:16.320> right<00:00:16.500> hand<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.770> going

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
do that or just your right hand is going

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.250 
do that or just your right hand is going
to<00:00:16.949> operate<00:00:16.980> slightly<00:00:17.940> differently<00:00:18.359> it's<00:00:19.050> one

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
to operate slightly differently it's one

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.750 
to operate slightly differently it's one
of<00:00:19.350> those<00:00:19.439> things<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:19.890> it's<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.580> better

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
of those things that you it's you better

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.550 
of those things that you it's you better
off<00:00:20.880> just<00:00:21.029> trying<00:00:21.449> then<00:00:21.779> try<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.170> me<00:00:22.380> trying

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
off just trying then try and me trying

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.890 
off just trying then try and me trying
to<00:00:22.680> explain<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.220> because<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.670> just<00:00:24.090> trial<00:00:24.750> and

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
to explain it because you just trial and

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.870 
to explain it because you just trial and
error<00:00:25.109> you'll<00:00:25.350> figure<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.160> out<00:00:26.279> pretty<00:00:26.580> quick

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
error you'll figure it out pretty quick

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.359 
error you'll figure it out pretty quick
but<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.689> good<00:00:27.869> way<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.050> get<00:00:28.500> started<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:29.130> going

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
but a good way to get started is going

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.060 
but a good way to get started is going
through<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> few<00:00:29.699> exercises<00:00:30.320> I<00:00:31.320> have<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.890> video

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
through a few exercises I have a video

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.340 
through a few exercises I have a video
up<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.550> my<00:00:33.030> channel<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.690> goes<00:00:34.110> through<00:00:34.320> a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
up on my channel that goes through a

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.950 
up on my channel that goes through a
finger<00:00:34.680> dexterity<00:00:34.890> exercise<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.840> use

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
finger dexterity exercise so you can use

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.389 
finger dexterity exercise so you can use
that<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.469> you're<00:00:37.710> just<00:00:37.800> getting<00:00:38.040> four<00:00:38.219> notes

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
that so you're just getting four notes

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.130 
that so you're just getting four notes
per<00:00:38.579> string<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.059> working<00:00:39.840> through<00:00:39.870> all<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
per string and working through all the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.740 
per string and working through all the
streams<00:00:40.379> with<00:00:40.590> upon<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.300> for<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.390> one<00:00:42.600> will

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
streams with upon you for this one will

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.119 
streams with upon you for this one will
go<00:00:42.780> will<00:00:43.110> start<00:00:43.320> at<00:00:43.379> five<00:00:43.590> with<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.860> first

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
go will start at five with the first

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.630 
go will start at five with the first
finger<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.820> E<00:00:44.850> string<00:00:45.920> then<00:00:46.920> fret<00:00:47.309> six

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
finger on the E string then fret six

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
finger and we're going to do that from

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.209 
finger and we're going to do that from
the<00:00:53.430> E<00:00:53.550> string<00:00:53.940> then<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> ad<00:00:54.899> GBE<00:00:55.620> all<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the E string then to the ad GBE all the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.160 
the E string then to the ad GBE all the
way<00:00:56.280> down<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> strings<00:00:56.850> alright<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.050> we're

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
way down the strings alright so we're

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:07.130 
way down the strings alright so we're
going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.590> with<00:00:58.710> Paul<00:00:58.890> mutes

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.749 

and<00:01:08.140> work<00:01:08.619> your<00:01:08.770> way<00:01:08.830> forward<00:01:08.950> and<00:01:09.400> backwards

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
and work your way forward and backwards

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.980 
and work your way forward and backwards
with<00:01:09.909> that<00:01:11.820> first<00:01:12.820> try<00:01:13.119> it<00:01:13.180> just<00:01:13.299> down<00:01:13.570> picking

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
with that first try it just down picking

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.469 
with that first try it just down picking
if<00:01:14.140> you're<00:01:14.259> just<00:01:14.380> starting<00:01:14.470> out<00:01:15.000> then<00:01:16.000> after

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
if you're just starting out then after

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.270 
if you're just starting out then after
you<00:01:16.570> get<00:01:16.689> used<00:01:16.899> to<00:01:17.020> that<00:01:17.200> try<00:01:17.740> what's<00:01:18.100> called

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
you get used to that try what's called

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.649 
you get used to that try what's called
alternate<00:01:18.670> picking<00:01:18.850> where<00:01:19.119> we're<00:01:19.240> going<00:01:19.420> down

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
alternate picking where we're going down

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.190 
alternate picking where we're going down
up<00:01:19.990> down<00:01:20.320> up<00:01:20.860> down<00:01:21.009> I<00:01:21.880> think<00:01:22.390> that<00:01:22.450> time<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:22.840> did

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
up down up down I think that time I did

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.990 
up down up down I think that time I did
all<00:01:23.350> alternate<00:01:24.039> picking<00:01:24.190> but<00:01:24.520> first<00:01:24.729> start

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
all alternate picking but first start

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.279 
all alternate picking but first start
out<00:01:25.090> just<00:01:25.270> down<00:01:25.600> picking<00:01:27.840> I'm<00:01:28.840> always<00:01:29.049> moving

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
out just down picking I'm always moving

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.790 
out just down picking I'm always moving
my<00:01:29.590> pic<00:01:29.770> downwards

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.370 

now<00:01:35.580> I'm<00:01:35.670> going<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:35.970> up<00:01:36.210> down<00:01:36.510> or<00:01:36.930> down<00:01:37.140> up

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
now I'm going to go up down or down up

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.560 
now I'm going to go up down or down up
sorry<00:01:37.650> down<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.280> down<00:01:38.460> up<00:01:38.610> every<00:01:39.180> single<00:01:39.300> no

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
sorry down up down up every single no

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.770 
sorry down up down up every single no
that's<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> alternate<00:01:44.300> and<00:01:45.300> just<00:01:45.600> work

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
that's going to alternate and just work

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.910 
that's going to alternate and just work
through<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.140> way<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.380> you're<00:01:46.590> starting<00:01:46.860> to

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
through that way so you're starting to

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.080 
through that way so you're starting to
get<00:01:46.980> the<00:01:47.100> ultimate<00:01:47.250> picking<00:01:47.700> down<00:01:47.820> at<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
get the ultimate picking down at the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.610 
get the ultimate picking down at the
same<00:01:48.270> time<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.630> way<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.840> fear<00:01:49.080> if<00:01:49.290> you're<00:01:49.500> due

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
same time this way to fear if you're due

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.710 
same time this way to fear if you're due
to<00:01:49.650> that<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.640> also<00:01:50.790> just<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.300> way<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.510> palm

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
to that but also just the way the palm

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.150 
to that but also just the way the palm
is<00:01:51.900> going<00:01:52.080> to<00:01:52.140> work<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.590> feels<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.070> little

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
is going to work it feels a little

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.040 
is going to work it feels a little
different<00:01:53.370> down<00:01:53.730> picking<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.360> alternate

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
different down picking and alternate

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.620 
different down picking and alternate
picking<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:56.460> could<00:01:56.640> also<00:01:56.790> try<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.450> up

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
picking you could also try just up

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.890 
picking you could also try just up
picking<00:02:02.240> looks<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.360> i'm<00:02:03.510> still<00:02:03.690> down

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
picking looks like i'm still down

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.450 
picking looks like i'm still down
picking<00:02:04.260> but<00:02:04.380> i'll<00:02:04.470> go<00:02:04.590> real<00:02:04.770> slow<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.370> can

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
picking but i'll go real slow so you can

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.310 
picking but i'll go real slow so you can
see<00:02:05.760> and<00:02:06.030> I'll<00:02:06.180> exaggerate<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> movement<00:02:07.290> a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
see and I'll exaggerate the movement a

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.210 
see and I'll exaggerate the movement a
little<00:02:07.350> bit

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.589 

you

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.630 

that's<00:02:15.599> all<00:02:15.780> there<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.079> that<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:17.040> if<00:02:17.459> you

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
that's all there is to that so if you

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.580 
that's all there is to that so if you
have<00:02:17.760> scales<00:02:18.120> down<00:02:18.390> by<00:02:18.599> now<00:02:18.750> if<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.230> learn<00:02:19.379> any

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
have scales down by now if you learn any

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.349 
have scales down by now if you learn any
scales<00:02:19.920> whether<00:02:20.250> it's<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.549> major<00:02:20.730> scale<00:02:20.969> or

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
scales whether it's the major scale or

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.949 
scales whether it's the major scale or
the<00:02:21.540> minor<00:02:22.230> pentatonic<00:02:22.439> scale<00:02:23.689> you<00:02:24.689> can<00:02:24.810> just

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
the minor pentatonic scale you can just

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.449 
the minor pentatonic scale you can just
give<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.319> try<00:02:25.530> with<00:02:25.709> scales<00:02:25.980> that's<00:02:26.340> gonna

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
give it a try with scales that's gonna

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.949 
give it a try with scales that's gonna
be<00:02:26.579> a<00:02:26.609> more<00:02:26.790> realistic<00:02:27.180> way<00:02:27.569> you're<00:02:27.810> going<00:02:27.930> to

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
be a more realistic way you're going to

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.830 
be a more realistic way you're going to
actually<00:02:28.019> use<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.579> this<00:02:29.579> exercise<00:02:30.150> here<00:02:32.840> it's

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
actually use it this exercise here it's

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.140 
actually use it this exercise here it's

it's<00:02:43.680> just<00:02:43.709> an<00:02:43.950> exercise<00:02:44.329> if<00:02:45.329> we<00:02:45.569> start<00:02:45.750> using

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
it's just an exercise if we start using

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.289 
it's just an exercise if we start using
with<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.349> scale<00:02:46.680> will<00:02:46.920> take<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.250> my<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.909> minor

that<00:02:50.159> in<00:02:50.310> another<00:02:50.489> video<00:02:50.760> if<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.269> don't

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
that in another video if you don't

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.970 
that in another video if you don't
already<00:02:51.599> know<00:02:51.720> how<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.019> play<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.349> but<00:02:52.500> just<00:02:52.709> as

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
already know how to play it but just as

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.470 
already know how to play it but just as
an<00:02:53.129> example<00:02:53.250> I'm<00:02:53.760> going<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:53.939> take<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.090> scale

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
an example I'm going to take that scale

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:05.650 
an example I'm going to take that scale
and<00:02:54.510> use<00:02:54.840> some<00:02:55.019> palm<00:02:55.200> use

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.020 

you

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
you

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.750 
you
and<00:03:07.200> start<00:03:08.200> blending<00:03:08.500> it<00:03:08.860> with<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.280> normal

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
and start blending it with the normal

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.870 
and start blending it with the normal
pic<00:03:09.940> notes<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.480> palm<00:03:10.660> unit<00:03:10.990> notes<00:03:11.170> so<00:03:11.980> good

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
pic notes and palm unit notes so good

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.970 
pic notes and palm unit notes so good
just<00:03:13.330> an<00:03:13.480> example<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:14.170> how<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.350> just<00:03:14.650> apply

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
just an example of how to just apply

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.770 
just an example of how to just apply
that<00:03:15.280> I'm<00:03:16.120> going<00:03:16.270> to<00:03:16.330> go<00:03:16.450> through<00:03:16.630> the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
that I'm going to go through the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.199 
that I'm going to go through the
pentatonic<00:03:17.200> scale<00:03:17.590> now<00:03:18.370> i'm<00:03:18.430> going<00:03:18.580> to<00:03:18.640> every

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
pentatonic scale now i'm going to every

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.210 
pentatonic scale now i'm going to every
time<00:03:19.390> switch<00:03:19.750> on<00:03:19.990> the<00:03:20.020> strings<00:03:20.380> e-string<00:03:21.010> I'll

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
time switch on the strings e-string I'll

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.660 
time switch on the strings e-string I'll
mute<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.790> string<00:03:22.300> will<00:03:22.480> leave<00:03:22.840> open<00:03:22.990> D<00:03:23.470> mu<00:03:23.800> G

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
mute a string will leave open D mu G

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:33.210 
mute a string will leave open D mu G
open<00:03:25.150> be<00:03:25.510> you<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.989> hopefully<00:03:32.650> hit<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.069> right

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
note on the last now next time I go

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.840 
note on the last now next time I go
through<00:03:35.050> that<00:03:35.170> but<00:03:35.350> uh<00:03:35.380> yeah<00:03:36.340> that's<00:03:36.550> just<00:03:36.760> a

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
through that but uh yeah that's just a

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.430 
through that but uh yeah that's just a
quick<00:03:37.209> example<00:03:37.690> of<00:03:37.840> how<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.020> throw<00:03:38.290> that

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
quick example of how to throw that

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.340 
quick example of how to throw that
together<00:03:38.620> to<00:03:38.920> start<00:03:39.130> using<00:03:39.310> palm<00:03:39.670> utes

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
together to start using palm utes

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.490 
together to start using palm utes
effectively<00:03:41.350> from<00:03:42.160> there<00:03:43.230> you'll<00:03:44.230> pretty

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
effectively from there you'll pretty

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.500 
effectively from there you'll pretty
much<00:03:44.590> start<00:03:45.370> developing<00:03:45.820> your<00:03:45.880> own<00:03:46.000> technique

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
much start developing your own technique

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.090 
much start developing your own technique
everyone's<00:03:46.900> kind<00:03:47.140> of<00:03:47.200> got<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:47.620> little<00:03:47.709> bit

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
everyone's kind of got a little bit

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.860 
everyone's kind of got a little bit
slightly<00:03:48.340> different<00:03:48.730> technique<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.570> how<00:03:49.630> they

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
slightly different technique of how they

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.590 
slightly different technique of how they
like<00:03:50.080> to<00:03:50.489> just<00:03:51.489> relax<00:03:51.790> their<00:03:52.090> right<00:03:52.300> hand

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
like to just relax their right hand

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.809 
like to just relax their right hand
follow<00:03:53.350> these<00:03:53.560> guidelines<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:54.370> then<00:03:54.519> kind<00:03:54.700> of

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
follow these guidelines and then kind of

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.250 
follow these guidelines and then kind of
build<00:03:55.090> your<00:03:55.300> own<00:03:55.330> technique<00:03:55.780> from<00:03:55.870> there<00:03:56.110> if

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
build your own technique from there if

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.500 
build your own technique from there if
you<00:03:56.380> want<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.590> change<00:03:56.769> anything<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:57.510> that's

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
you want to change anything and that's

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.210 
you want to change anything and that's
about<00:03:58.660> it<00:03:58.780> for<00:03:58.930> now<00:03:59.110> I<00:03:59.410> guess<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.769> next<00:03:59.890> video

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
about it for now I guess the next video

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.009
