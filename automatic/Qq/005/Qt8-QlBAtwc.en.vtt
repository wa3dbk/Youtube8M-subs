00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.470
 Pedro Luis Flores again with 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.109
 we pedro 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.480
 that's how it is or in the pending because 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.070
 are very close to the moment of the 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.840
 demolition of car wrecks already 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.330
 they moved already mobilized the vehicles 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.770
 what were and were there if you can 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.779
 remember just a few minutes ago in the 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.849
 previous contact that we made live and 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.439
 live four vehicles already moved 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.419
 three each are only vehicles 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.159
 officers on board of whom it has been 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.079
 displaced technical staff 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.669
 specialized in the placement of 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.220
 explosives and they already moved 30 vehicles 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:33.260
 that to a single vehicle and we still see 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.260
 some people who belong to the area 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.179
 of cabin 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.670
 this allows us to assume that every time 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:41.949
 It is closer to the time demolition 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.079
 there were four white vehicles 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.719
 officers I repeat official vehicles and 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.879
 already retired three and at this time 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.430
 as you can pick up on the signal that 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.649
 we have here the technical staff that 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.969
 is very close to the remains of 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.850
 autonomous already begins to address this 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.100
 vehicle to leave and after 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.589
 that after this last revision of 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.710
 security will be given the order for the 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.869
 explosion 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.220
 good degenerate into the demolition of 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.290
 this structure 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.549
 the studies are very pending because it is 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.549
 very close to the moment of the explosion 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.830
 televiewer friend of globovision 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.680
 we continue broadcasting live and in 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.010
 direct just the explosion of 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.800
 the remains of the viaduct did not and did not fall 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.260
 complete the structure as they finish it 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.000
 see you as they are watching 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.700
 simultaneously at the time of occurrence in 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.470
 our live and live signal from the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.510
 operation that mounted the ministry of 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.300
 infrastructures supported technicians 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.520
 decadent did not fall completely on 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.870
 the remains of viaduct 1 of the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.180
 caracas-la guaira highway is already 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.710
 it clears the cloud of dust we have it and in 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.200
 live and live through the signal 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.970
 of globevision and it did not fall 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.590
 completely the structure of the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.030
 caracas water expressway we are already 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.320
 transmitting live and direct you 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.459
 they were through the action of 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.400
 globovision 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.140
 the complete transmission of the operation 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.980
 just as we announced when only 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.010
 minutes were missing 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.379
 and it fell only parts and it cracked to a 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.730
 little more certainly in their union with 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.700
 land claims but did not fall for 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.170
 completed the structure of viaduct 1 the 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.519
 caracas-la guaira highway 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.760
 competing live and direct with the 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.760
 random 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.050
 down what managed to be demolished 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.180
 effect it has had on the other party 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.730
 from the rest of the viaduct we will wait 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.290
 the report of the authorities of the 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.569
 specialists experts 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.250
 He was well warned Minister 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.210
 infrastructure there well 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.210
 this the explosion 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.930
 this just happened moments ago 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.269
 you saw it by globovision 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.510
 the demolition of what remains of the 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.220
 viaduct 1 of the caracas-la highway 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.910
 guaira 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.860
 we said then what 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.830
 had contemplated the possibility of 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.950
 perform some other explosion of being 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.200
 we will wait for the report on 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.560
 I assess what the authorities will do 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.300
 was what 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.190
 it came down 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:50.950
 after the explosion the explosives 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.690
 calculated 580 kilos distributed the 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.690
 pilaster caracas 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.830
 we keep placing in you in the 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.750
 lower box 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.650
 the moment of the explosion 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.670
 and you have on your screen in the 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.030
 box sent 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.100
 what he managed to fall 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.739
 of the viaduct of what remains of the 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.940
 viaduct 1 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.800
 active this has had an effect on this 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.020
 explosion again for you that 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.380
 instant is a 14 minute we record 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.840
 in our watches is the 117 minutes 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.870
 now after just 3 minutes 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.340
 after the detonation this has had 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.880
 according to the calculations made by the 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:43.750
 experts a radius of action of about 500 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:47.830
 meters in you from the experts 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:52.060
 attentive watching in this instant 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:55.220
 you notice a larger bill with respect to 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.110
 what already the contact with earth 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:03.040
 they will see in what conditions they have 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:05.590
 the pilasters are 9 and 10 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.540
 and also the pilaster Caracas 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.020
 they are doing now the 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.419
 analysis 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.789
 we said then as to the destination 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.020
 from the rubble the minister of this 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.789
 structure has said that the money 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.669
 Hydraulic advisers of the ministers 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.349
 Ministry of the environment officials 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:24.500
 have been evaluating any possible 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:27.590
 alteration of the fluvial dynamics of the 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:31.280
 Broken water tank by the presence 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.360
 waste of concrete to stay 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.220
 with us because in any 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.220
 instantly we go back together 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.610
 Y
