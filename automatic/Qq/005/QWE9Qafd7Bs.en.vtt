00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.700
 I decided this year! 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.360
 Join the Tour de France 2015! 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.840
 I bought a great bike for the race (course)! 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.900
 After that only practice. 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.520
 It's still a few months old. 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.000
 First of all, how should I go to France .... 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.540
 Hello 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.960
 Which direction is France? 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.800
 It is not funny, this person! 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.760
 It looks like you don't know. 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.860
 Come on, it is the start of the 10th San Patele! 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.920
 Tour de France is a bicycle race held every July. 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.660
 An old tournament. It started in 1903. 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.040
 200 players from around the world for three weeks 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.640
 Run 21 stages throughout France. 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.760
 Physically quite tight. 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.000
 Especially the mountain stage is very hard. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.660
 But Tour de France is a very popular event, 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.480
 Everyone will watch the race on live TV. 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.020
 The local town I did not know until then 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.520
 You can find it through the tournament. 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.240
 The most important event is 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.960
 When Tour de France comes to a small town. 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.080
 I came to my town! 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.700
 In a small village with only 5 houses! 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.440
 It was only a few seconds, 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.740
 It was a dream-like moment. 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.620
 Have you seen my bicycle? 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.900
 I was told this is not for racing 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.680
 The clerk said it was for the race (course). 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.180
 But it was my mistake! 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.980
 Not for the la course, 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.860
 It was for les courses (shopping)! 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.020
 This difference is large in French 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.080
 faire la course 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.580
 About position 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.680
 Preparation 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.700
 start! 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.000
 Unlike before 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.460
 Next is faire les courses 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.420
 Did you buy a tomato? 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.920
 Yup 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.580
 What is a pepper? 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.080
 OK OK 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.940
 so! Sports term if singular 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.740
 It is supermarket term when there are plural 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.140
 Related to Tour de France 

00:02:01.164 --> 00:02:02.704
 There is a recommended movie. 

00:02:02.704 --> 00:02:05.124
 "Belleville Landeveu" in Japanese. 

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:06.604
 A little while ago anime. 

00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:08.244
 It is the story of grandma and grandson. 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.000
 My grandson is going to Tour de France, 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.540
 I will be scolded during the tournament. 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.600
 And grandma will help him. 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.300
 Please find it at TSUTAYA. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.040
 please look! 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.920
 I bought a very good T-shirt! 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.380
 Now you are ready to compete in Tour de France! 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.380
 And my student, Yuko of Jiyugaoka school! 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.100
 Bicycle race specialist. 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.300
 He will advise you about Tour de France! 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.400
 Cécile, that's impossible. 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.054
 Is that so? 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.720
 Tour de France is already over. 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.760
 But October 25th, Tour de France will come to Saitama. 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.581
 In Saitama? 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.480
 Is Tour de France coming to Japan? 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.170
 Are there professional players? 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.894
 so. 

00:03:04.894 --> 00:03:06.522
 I'm interested! 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.620
 Have you ever participated? 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.160
 Yes. 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.300
 pleasant? 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.100
 It is fun. 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.220
 Is it Tour de France? 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.480
 Have you been there? 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.000
 Yes. 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.280
 I went three times. 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.380
 Three times! 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.880
 What year? 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.860
 2006, 2011 and 2013. 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.940
 great. 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.520
 Have you participated in the race? 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.380
 I participated twice. 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.120
 I have participated in an amateur race. 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.540
 You're an amateur. 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.500
 It's amazing. 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.500
 Very nice T-shirt! 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.560
 Is it Tour de France? 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.940
 There is L'ETAPPE DU JAPON 2011-2013. 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.560
 Lots of handwritten messages. 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.920
 This is a message from the French. 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.100
 The message you want. 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.900
 For example 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.680
 Good luck! And 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.240
 I'm thinking of you guys. 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.820
 Very nice. 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.100
 Are you going to Tour de France next year? 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.620
 Yes, I want to go. 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.760
 Are you studying French for that? 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.415
 so! 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.000
 That's wonderful! 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.700
 Come on, who goes to France, who is this month? 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.540
 Every month at Ecole Sampa 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.700
 There is a chance that the Paris Tokyo round trip ticket will be hit. 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.500
 Ready? 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.116
 Yeah! 

00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:19.040
 OK! Well, I will go! 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.660
 Pull me! Pull me! 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.380
 Oh! Female student! 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.100
 Good! 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.540
 Those who have attended school for 6 months or more 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.600
 Ginza's 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.235
 Sorry Yuko 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.580

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.720

 I got a ticket for Paris! 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.480
 Where would you recommend Ranko? 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.455
 Of course, Tour de France! 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.561
 With that? 

00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:47.901
 Tour de France! 

00:04:47.901 --> 00:04:48.401

00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:49.621
 Tour de France! 

00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:50.201
 Hi, I understand! 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.200
 Alex does not compete? 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.860
 I'm a bike, you a bike. 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.360
 you're kidding? 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.100
 Are you going to beat me on the bike? 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.500
 of course! Let's do it 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.720
 For training? 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.220
 so. 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.420
 OK, absolutely Muri! 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.800
 It is easy victory! 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.380
 Hmmm 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.080
 Cécile! 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.940
 What's wrong? 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.440
 Thanks to the super training. 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.360
 Now you are ready for Tour de France! 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.340
 Ask, keep it secret! Please! 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.520
 OK, I promise. 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.480
 It's a shame .... 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.700
 goodbye! San Patelle This is the end. See you!
