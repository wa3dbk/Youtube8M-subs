00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.859

focus was coming out of right here

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.190 
focus was coming out of right here
literally<00:00:30.869> just<00:00:31.019> puddling<00:00:31.740> out<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.960> we<00:00:33.960> looked

it<00:00:34.320> up<00:00:34.440> figured<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.370> was<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> clog<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.300> drain

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
it up figured it was a clog in the drain

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.860 
it up figured it was a clog in the drain
somewhere<00:00:36.950> didn't<00:00:37.950> realize<00:00:38.540> that<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.690> is

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
actual drain and this goes out to the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.020 
actual drain and this goes out to the
fire<00:00:42.870> through<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> firewall<00:00:43.940> outside<00:00:44.940> the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.590 
we ended up seeing that that line was
clogged<00:03:17.239> so<00:03:18.520> yeah<00:03:19.520> like<00:03:19.670> I<00:03:19.760> said<00:03:19.790> before<00:03:20.300> we're

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
clogged so yeah like I said before we're

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.760 
clogged so yeah like I said before we're
leaking<00:03:20.840> out<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:22.310> this<00:03:22.459> drain<00:03:23.290> we<00:03:24.290> cleaned<00:03:24.590> out

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
leaking out to this drain we cleaned out

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:25.960 
leaking out to this drain we cleaned out
there's<00:03:25.130> a<00:03:25.190> lot<00:03:25.310> of<00:03:25.430> gunk<00:03:25.610> in<00:03:25.730> there<00:03:25.850> unless

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970

not built it's not a not coming out from
this<00:03:46.880> one<00:03:47.060> no<00:03:47.150> more<00:03:47.330> you<00:03:47.510> know<00:03:47.660> what<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:47.810> mean

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.250 

yes<00:04:20.200> blowing

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.100 

all<00:04:23.590> right<00:04:24.300> so<00:04:25.300> if<00:04:25.390> you<00:04:25.420> guys<00:04:25.540> saw<00:04:25.720> that<00:04:25.750> water

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
all right so if you guys saw that water

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.750 
all right so if you guys saw that water
drop<00:04:26.410> before<00:04:27.250> that<00:04:27.670> wasn't<00:04:27.970> happening<00:04:29.670> it<00:04:30.670> was

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
drop before that wasn't happening it was

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.400 
drop before that wasn't happening it was
literally<00:04:31.120> just<00:04:31.210> backing<00:04:31.690> up<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:32.110> saw<00:04:32.290> those

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
literally just backing up you saw those

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.220 
literally just backing up you saw those
couple<00:04:32.800> drops<00:04:32.980> from<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.250> start<00:04:33.520> but<00:04:34.110> that<00:04:35.110> was

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
couple drops from the start but that was

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.290 
couple drops from the start but that was
I<00:04:35.440> think<00:04:35.650> just<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.890> last<00:04:36.070> a<00:04:36.190> little<00:04:36.400> bit<00:04:36.550> so

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
I think just the last a little bit so

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.670 
I think just the last a little bit so
that<00:04:37.330> you<00:04:37.480> can<00:04:37.660> see<00:04:39.000> nothing<00:04:40.000> no<00:04:40.120> more<00:04:40.680> a

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
that you can see nothing no more a

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.940 
that you can see nothing no more a
little<00:04:42.190> bit

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.260 

a<00:04:45.360> lot<00:04:46.360> better<00:04:46.570> those<00:04:46.780> not<00:04:47.020> flowing<00:04:47.320> up<00:04:48.270> here

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
a lot better those not flowing up here

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.780 
a lot better those not flowing up here
give<00:04:50.230> another<00:04:50.470> still<00:04:50.860> song<00:04:51.040> coming<00:04:51.310> out<00:04:51.460> I

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
give another still song coming out I

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:52.980 
give another still song coming out I
think<00:04:51.970> that<00:04:52.120> was<00:04:52.270> just<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.480> puddle<00:04:52.750> that<00:04:52.870> was

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
think that was just the puddle that was

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.630 
think that was just the puddle that was
still<00:04:53.140> there<00:04:54.510> drove<00:04:55.510> it<00:04:55.600> around<00:04:56.490> nothing<00:04:57.490> down

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
still there drove it around nothing down

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:03.540 
still there drove it around nothing down
there<00:04:59.130> call<00:05:00.130> that<00:05:00.310> a<00:05:00.550> job<00:05:01.300> done
