this NB C which is the first one you see

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
in the major hub of the world he'll

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.850 
in the major hub of the world he'll
provide<00:01:42.390> some<00:01:42.750> direction<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.320> where<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.680> go

but<00:01:44.340> other<00:01:44.549> than<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.270> make<00:01:45.390> sure<00:01:45.540> you

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
but other than that just make sure you

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.950 
but other than that just make sure you
explore<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.649> if<00:01:46.860> an<00:01:46.979> area<00:01:47.430> seems

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
explore and if an area seems

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.420 
explore and if an area seems
unreasonably<00:01:48.960> hard<00:01:49.380> you're<00:01:49.860> probably<00:01:50.130> going

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
unreasonably hard you're probably going

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.300 
unreasonably hard you're probably going
the<00:01:50.610> wrong<00:01:50.759> way<00:01:50.960> reading<00:01:51.960> item<00:01:52.590> descriptions

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
the wrong way reading item descriptions

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.460 
the wrong way reading item descriptions
can<00:01:53.610> also<00:01:53.790> provide<00:01:54.270> some<00:01:54.479> great<00:01:54.780> insight<00:01:55.290> on

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
can also provide some great insight on

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.499 
can also provide some great insight on
where<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.950> go<00:01:56.130> as<00:01:56.399> well<00:01:56.759> as<00:01:56.969> some<00:01:57.149> story

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
where to go as well as some story

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.149 
where to go as well as some story
elements<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.170> make<00:01:58.409> sure<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.680> read<00:01:58.890> those

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
elements so make sure you read those

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.880 
elements so make sure you read those
now<00:02:00.729> let's<00:02:00.939> talk<00:02:01.119> stats<00:02:01.659> now<00:02:02.020> this<00:02:02.439> game<00:02:02.649> has

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
now let's talk stats now this game has

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.190 
now let's talk stats now this game has
lost<00:02:03.159> standard<00:02:03.670> stats<00:02:04.000> like<00:02:04.270> defense<00:02:04.869> you

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
lost standard stats like defense you

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.139 
lost standard stats like defense you
know<00:02:05.320> fire<00:02:05.649> resistance<00:02:06.460> that<00:02:06.670> sort<00:02:06.969> of<00:02:07.000> thing

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
know fire resistance that sort of thing

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.509 
know fire resistance that sort of thing
but<00:02:07.420> one<00:02:08.080> step<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:08.649> most<00:02:08.860> players<00:02:09.099> aren't

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
but one step that most players aren't

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.520 
but one step that most players aren't
going<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.729> recognize<00:02:10.239> is<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.720> poise<00:02:11.050> stat

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
going to recognize is the poise stat

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.220 
going to recognize is the poise stat
this<00:02:12.190> determines<00:02:12.760> how<00:02:13.000> easy<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.690> is<00:02:13.840> for<00:02:13.870> an

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
this determines how easy it is for an

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.410 
this determines how easy it is for an
enemy<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.890> knock<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.370> off<00:02:15.400> balance<00:02:15.610> by

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
enemy to knock you off balance by

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.449 
enemy to knock you off balance by
hitting<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:16.989> so<00:02:17.500> if<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:17.830> have<00:02:17.950> very<00:02:17.980> low

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
hitting you so if you have very low

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.339 
hitting you so if you have very low
poison<00:02:19.090> you're<00:02:19.300> in<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.690> middle<00:02:19.989> of<00:02:20.140> an<00:02:20.260> attack

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
poison you're in the middle of an attack

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.470 
poison you're in the middle of an attack
and<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.980> enemy<00:02:21.310> hits<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.819> they<00:02:22.300> will

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
and the enemy hits you they will

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.660 
and the enemy hits you they will
interrupt<00:02:22.900> your<00:02:23.380> attack<00:02:23.739> if<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.370> have<00:02:24.459> very

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
interrupt your attack if you have very

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.690 
interrupt your attack if you have very
high<00:02:24.730> poise<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.599> can<00:02:25.870> take<00:02:26.170> heavier<00:02:27.040> hits<00:02:27.430> and

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
high poise you can take heavier hits and

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.240 
high poise you can take heavier hits and
not<00:02:27.940> be<00:02:28.150> interrupted<00:02:28.750> so<00:02:29.019> you're<00:02:29.650> more<00:02:29.920> likely

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
not be interrupted so you're more likely

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.070 
not be interrupted so you're more likely
to<00:02:30.459> carry<00:02:30.970> through<00:02:31.269> with<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.540> attack<00:02:31.840> and

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
to carry through with the attack and

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.979 
to carry through with the attack and
still<00:02:32.319> do<00:02:32.560> damage<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:33.190> them<00:02:33.569> let's<00:02:34.569> touch<00:02:34.810> on

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
still do damage to them let's touch on

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.140 
still do damage to them let's touch on
the<00:02:35.230> role<00:02:35.650> mechanic<00:02:36.340> as<00:02:36.489> well<00:02:36.760> because<00:02:37.030> this

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
the role mechanic as well because this

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.570 
the role mechanic as well because this
is<00:02:37.330> pretty<00:02:37.569> unique<00:02:38.049> to<00:02:38.080> Dark<00:02:38.590> Souls<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:39.310> it

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
is pretty unique to Dark Souls and it

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.910 
is pretty unique to Dark Souls and it
adds<00:02:39.819> a<00:02:39.970> lot<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.150> value<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:41.230> light<00:02:41.560> armor

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
adds a lot of value to the light armor

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.339 
adds a lot of value to the light armor
play<00:02:42.130> style<00:02:42.519> obviously<00:02:43.450> heavier<00:02:43.900> armors

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
play style obviously heavier armors

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.470 
play style obviously heavier armors
provide<00:02:44.680> more<00:02:45.040> poise<00:02:45.340> more<00:02:45.790> defense<00:02:46.239> that

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
provide more poise more defense that

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.640 
provide more poise more defense that
sort<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.750> thing<00:02:46.870> but<00:02:46.989> they<00:02:47.110> also<00:02:47.230> slow<00:02:47.590> you

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
sort of thing but they also slow you

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.490 
sort of thing but they also slow you
down<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.310> there<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.519> a<00:02:48.549> cost<00:02:48.819> of<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.500> first

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
down and there is a cost of that first

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.229 
down and there is a cost of that first
it's<00:02:50.739> important<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.370> understand<00:02:52.030> what

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
it's important to understand what

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.020 
it's important to understand what

these frames take place right at the
start<00:03:04.510> of<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.840> role<00:03:05.079> so<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.950> way<00:03:06.100> you<00:03:06.160> actually

want to dodge attacks with a roll is to

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.580 
want to dodge attacks with a roll is to
dodge<00:03:09.489> just<00:03:10.180> when<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> attack<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:11.079> about<00:03:11.200> to

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
dodge just when the attack is about to

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.920 
dodge just when the attack is about to
connect<00:03:12.160> with<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.549> you'll<00:03:13.390> roll<00:03:13.630> right

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
connect with you you'll roll right

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.150 
connect with you you'll roll right
through<00:03:13.989> their<00:03:14.319> attack<00:03:14.620> even<00:03:14.829> though<00:03:15.010> it

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
through their attack even though it

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.590 
through their attack even though it
looks<00:03:15.489> like<00:03:15.700> they<00:03:15.819> probably<00:03:16.090> should<00:03:16.450> be

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
looks like they probably should be

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.039 
looks like they probably should be
hitting<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:17.079> under<00:03:17.859> 25%<00:03:18.549> weight<00:03:19.420> burden<00:03:19.870> you

hitting you under 25% weight burden you

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.870

lastly<00:06:46.680> I'll<00:06:46.980> explain<00:06:47.340> weapon<00:06:47.910> scaling<00:06:48.480> now

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
lastly I'll explain weapon scaling now

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.810 
lastly I'll explain weapon scaling now
not<00:06:49.140> all<00:06:49.170> weapons<00:06:49.740> scale<00:06:50.310> and<00:06:50.640> through

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
not all weapons scale and through

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.060 
not all weapons scale and through
certain<00:06:51.120> upgrade<00:06:51.510> paths<00:06:51.840> it's<00:06:52.170> possible<00:06:52.830> to

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.070 
certain upgrade paths it's possible to

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.610 
certain upgrade paths it's possible to
remove<00:06:53.340> scaling<00:06:54.090> in<00:06:54.210> favour<00:06:54.480> of<00:06:54.780> other<00:06:55.170> types

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
remove scaling in favour of other types

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.640 
remove scaling in favour of other types
of<00:06:55.800> damage<00:06:56.280> but<00:06:57.240> basically<00:06:57.840> this<00:06:58.020> works<00:06:58.320> on<00:06:58.620> a

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
of damage but basically this works on a

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.460 
of damage but basically this works on a
grading<00:06:59.310> system<00:06:59.520> of<00:06:59.940> you<00:07:00.090> through<00:07:00.330> a<00:07:00.360> so<00:07:00.660> if<00:07:01.290> a

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 
grading system of you through a so if a

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.340 
grading system of you through a so if a
weapon<00:07:01.800> has<00:07:02.010> a<00:07:02.220> grade<00:07:02.820> strength<00:07:03.300> scaling<00:07:03.930> that

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
weapon has a grade strength scaling that

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
means for every point of strength you

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.180
