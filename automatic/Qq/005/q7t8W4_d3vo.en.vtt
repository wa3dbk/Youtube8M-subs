daughter<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.940> he<00:00:45.030> obviously<00:00:45.059> put<00:00:45.629> her<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870

daughter and he obviously put her up to
it<00:00:46.020> but<00:00:46.680> other<00:00:46.860> than<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.460> perfectly

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
it but other than that it's a perfectly

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.520
