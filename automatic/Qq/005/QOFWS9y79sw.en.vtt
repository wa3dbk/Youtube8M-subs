00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.440
 click on the stiko freedom in 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.390
 stuttgart we are here with her fresh 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.160
 baked european champion julia meadow 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.980
 is very nice 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.690
 So they say I actually knew even 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.720
 not really believe he is beautiful 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.400
 hard I have not imagined and 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.910
 is very very good i would say so 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.070
 really 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.600
 Today we have the concept what we have 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.489
 we really could have planned 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.180
 that's why I'm good at it 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.790
 really strong 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.079
 you have five rounds through your opponent 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.180
 the ring is driven that one 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.350
 I am the fighting animal of the delict actually 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.820
 rather someone who is so in reverse 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.220
 reason but that's what we said 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.600
 okay great thing we want the title 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.600
 we were still showing we want to see 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.740
 and therefore 3 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.880
 you had already stopped over 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.070
 thought and then came a call from 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.750
 Ladens deko what has convinced you 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.990
 again to climb the ring 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.990
 he is very convincing, I invite the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.570
 An old one I have to say it was like that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.410
 I back then even if wanted was 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.840
 I am very disappointed 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.450
 the olympia qualification unfortunately 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.920
 missed and then still have to 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.660
 thanks to the two or three days not to 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.040
 had thought that had thought 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.439
 you are still very nice here 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.930
 martial dependent and yet there is just 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.369
 come at the right time and gave 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.860
 you are new suggestions now 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.299
 load and at the cost he is on 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.189
 in any case as it now what 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.840
 others have a lot of means to fight 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.729
 but this is the other style 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.259
 again something else synonymous now 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.090
 without fighting shoes that was it 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.590
 not used so the first time he has 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.670
 came the ring I look 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.470
 the cowboy is really enough after that 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.149
 had huge bruises and not at all 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.560
 could run properly and now 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.790
 meanwhile I get used to it but 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.190
 in the beginning was a very nice 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.220
 Change the team ad aisch describes 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.160
 the training with you as very loud and 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:20.040
 turned up how is the training with 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.120
 christine calm and reserved we 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.280
 I think both have a relative 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.989
 big mouth and have a lot of fun 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.850
 applications and especially with each other 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.520
 that's why wessling is me too 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.410
 louder and louder 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.440
 yes things are also in Austria 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.570
 under load and me three are good 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.220
 been 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.830
 you would like to have fought for the goal 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.990
 when she was still with the sticks he was her 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.870
 Of course, she is a great fighter 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.670
 big opponent bet and then 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.440
 Of course because you want to be natural 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.360
 fighter fight the world and it was 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.430
 they were the real help 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.390
 police officers who invaded her 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.270
 Of course, not always friends 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.100
 which I choose outlooks yes 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.800
 partly also very embarrassed 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.320
 so me but a run and you can 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.850
 even with the choice this time yes it is 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.110
 Always say goodbye 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.480
 with you beforehand on the whole time with 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.980
 There are changing rooms and there just people around 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.050
 to know someone and who knows 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.840
 to bring support even as 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.670
 do you associate the profi training and the 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.010
 work as a police officer so I am 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.320

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.240
 I was often very good at designing 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.670
 main job I train and when will come 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.170
