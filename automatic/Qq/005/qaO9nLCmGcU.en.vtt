00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.960 
like for example in a doorway on the ek
zone<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.650> apply<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> similar<00:01:41.520> particle

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
zone you can apply a similar particle

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.760 
zone you can apply a similar particle
barrier<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.390> one<00:01:42.570> ally<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.439> build<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.710> I

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
barrier to one ally in the build that I

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.020 
barrier to one ally in the build that I
played<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.189> was<00:01:44.280> possible<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.850> both

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
played it was possible to have both

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.490 
played it was possible to have both
shields<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.540> at<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.720> same<00:01:45.899> time<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.439> they

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
shields up at the same time and they

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.840 
shields up at the same time and they
have<00:01:46.649> separate<00:01:47.009> cooldowns<00:01:47.340> from<00:01:47.549> each<00:01:47.640> other

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
have separate cooldowns from each other

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.580 
have separate cooldowns from each other
so<00:01:48.600> although<00:01:48.720> these<00:01:48.960> shields<00:01:49.229> are<00:01:49.439> only

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
