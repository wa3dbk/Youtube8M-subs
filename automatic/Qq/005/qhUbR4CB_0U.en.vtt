balls<00:04:31.500> from<00:04:31.920> hitting<00:04:31.980> him<00:04:32.370> so<00:04:32.820> basically<00:04:33.360> if

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
balls from hitting him so basically if

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.590 
balls from hitting him so basically if
you<00:04:33.720> deploy<00:04:34.020> your<00:04:34.110> howitzers<00:04:35.070> on<00:04:35.400> behind<00:04:36.060> high

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
you deploy your howitzers on behind high

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.840 
you deploy your howitzers on behind high
ground<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.500> cannons<00:04:37.950> cannot<00:04:38.370> hit<00:04:38.610> them

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
ground the cannons cannot hit them

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.100 
ground the cannons cannot hit them
because<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.150> Cannonball<00:04:39.540> so<00:04:39.750> fired<00:04:39.990> a

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
because the Cannonball so fired a

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.250 
because the Cannonball so fired a
straight<00:04:40.410> line<00:04:41.120> whereas<00:04:42.120> a<00:04:42.360> howitzer<00:04:42.870> shell

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
straight line whereas a howitzer shell

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.460 
straight line whereas a howitzer shell
arcs<00:04:43.710> its<00:04:44.220> arcs<00:04:44.910> over<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.510> the<00:04:45.600> over<00:04:46.140> terrain

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
arcs its arcs over to the over terrain

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.130 
arcs its arcs over to the over terrain
and<00:04:46.770> lands<00:04:47.160> on<00:04:47.280> top<00:04:48.060> of<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.360> enemy<00:04:48.660> so

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
and lands on top of the enemy so

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.080 
and lands on top of the enemy so
basically<00:04:49.710> that's<00:04:50.250> what<00:04:50.430> he's<00:04:50.670> trying<00:04:50.700> to<00:04:50.940> do

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
basically that's what he's trying to do

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.630 
basically that's what he's trying to do
anyway<00:04:51.720> I<00:04:51.780> basically<00:04:52.020> said<00:04:52.290> my<00:04:52.500> rifleman<00:04:53.490> now

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
anyway I basically said my rifleman now

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.660 
anyway I basically said my rifleman now
it's<00:04:53.850> like<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.000> firing<00:04:54.510> squad<00:04:54.690> to<00:04:55.050> kill<00:04:55.320> the

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
it's like a firing squad to kill the

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.800 
it's like a firing squad to kill the
remaining<00:04:56.670> artillery<00:04:57.240> Gunners<00:04:57.630> who<00:04:57.720> are

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
running away to see so that's basically

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.550

out of the way and there but he doesn't
take<00:06:01.200> his<00:06:01.460> original<00:06:02.460> household<00:06:02.910> covery<00:06:03.180> out

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
take his original household covery out

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.780 
take his original household covery out
of<00:06:03.600> the<00:06:03.690> way<00:06:03.900> so<00:06:04.140> I<00:06:04.530> then<00:06:04.800> charge<00:06:05.130> back<00:06:05.430> into

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
of the way so I then charge back into

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.030 
of the way so I then charge back into
them<00:06:05.940> with<00:06:06.090> all<00:06:06.210> my<00:06:06.240> four<00:06:06.720> units<00:06:07.110> of<00:06:07.200> cavalry

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
them with all my four units of cavalry

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.700 
them with all my four units of cavalry
again<00:06:08.370> so<00:06:09.210> I'm<00:06:09.420> guessing<00:06:09.660> that<00:06:09.840> I<00:06:10.110> guessed<00:06:10.560> at

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
again so I'm guessing that I guessed at

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.530 
again so I'm guessing that I guessed at
this<00:06:10.830> point<00:06:11.040> that<00:06:11.220> this<00:06:11.370> bloke<00:06:11.700> was<00:06:12.000> a<00:06:12.030> new<00:06:12.360> guy

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
this point that this bloke was a new guy

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.080 
this point that this bloke was a new guy
anyway<00:06:13.380> I've<00:06:14.040> had<00:06:14.250> to<00:06:14.370> edit<00:06:14.460> this<00:06:14.640> video<00:06:14.820> to

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
anyway I've had to edit this video to

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.000 
anyway I've had to edit this video to
two<00:06:15.240> parts<00:06:15.570> again<00:06:15.720> because<00:06:16.320> like<00:06:16.560> I<00:06:16.680> said<00:06:16.740> in

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
two parts again because like I said in

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.290 
two parts again because like I said in
my<00:06:17.040> other<00:06:17.250> videos<00:06:17.550> my<00:06:17.730> windows<00:06:18.000> movie<00:06:18.270> maker

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
my other videos my windows movie maker

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.690 
my other videos my windows movie maker
doesn't<00:06:18.900> like<00:06:19.170> me<00:06:19.410> editing<00:06:19.800> long<00:06:20.010> clips<00:06:20.310> and

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
doesn't like me editing long clips and

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.730 
doesn't like me editing long clips and
we<00:06:20.820> stay<00:06:21.000> tuned<00:06:21.240> for<00:06:21.420> part<00:06:21.570> two<00:06:21.840> for<00:06:22.080> the

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
we stay tuned for part two for the

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.330 
we stay tuned for part two for the
ending<00:06:23.190> of<00:06:23.400> the<00:06:23.730> clip
