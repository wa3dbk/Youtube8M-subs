can<00:00:41.370> be<00:00:41.430> kind<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.570> frustrating<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:44.210> mean<00:00:45.210> it's

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
can be kind of frustrating I mean it's

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.150 
can be kind of frustrating I mean it's
not<00:00:45.480> hard<00:00:45.809> or<00:00:45.960> anything<00:00:46.020> but<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.410> did<00:00:46.469> die<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> few

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
not hard or anything but I did die a few

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.779 
not hard or anything but I did die a few
times<00:00:47.370> kind<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.270> slowed<00:00:49.110> me<00:00:49.289> down<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.739> ended<00:00:50.670> up

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
times kind of slowed me down I ended up

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.220 
times kind of slowed me down I ended up
with<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> plate<00:00:51.539> time<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.199> i<00:00:53.629> believe<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:54.809> like

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
with a plate time of i believe it's like

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.150 
with a plate time of i believe it's like
eight<00:00:55.530> hours<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.039> 36<00:00:56.550> minutes<00:00:57.590> with<00:00:58.590> i<00:00:58.949> think

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
eight hours and 36 minutes with i think

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.220 
eight hours and 36 minutes with i think
an<00:00:59.280> average<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.640> 36<00:01:00.329> minutes<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.840> level<00:01:01.140> or

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
an average of 36 minutes a level or

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.319 
an average of 36 minutes a level or
something<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.760> nothing<00:01:02.760> real<00:01:03.000> great

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
something like that nothing real great

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.140 
something like that nothing real great
you<00:01:03.629> know<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.989> i<00:01:04.019> was<00:01:04.350> proud<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.850> but<00:01:05.850> that's

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
you know that i was proud of but that's

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.800 
you know that i was proud of but that's
just<00:01:06.330> how<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.720> goes<00:01:06.750> sometimes<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:08.670> my<00:01:09.570> goal<00:01:09.780> is

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
just how it goes sometimes so my goal is

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.520 
just how it goes sometimes so my goal is
I<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.220> hit<00:01:11.220> 20<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:12.270> wit<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.140> i<00:01:13.170> bought<00:01:13.380> my

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
I just hit 20 I wit and i bought my

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.830 
I just hit 20 I wit and i bought my
mount<00:01:13.880> got<00:01:14.880> all<00:01:15.000> my<00:01:15.119> new<00:01:15.240> skills<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
mount got all my new skills of the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.330 
mount got all my new skills of the
skills<00:01:16.200> that's<00:01:16.530> probably<00:01:16.830> why<00:01:17.040> i<00:01:17.070> was

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
skills that's probably why i was

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.249 
skills that's probably why i was
leveling<00:01:17.880> was<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> little<00:01:18.270> bit<00:01:18.360> slower<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.049> a

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
leveling was a little bit slower to is a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.770 
leveling was a little bit slower to is a
mage<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.189> really<00:01:20.490> sucks<00:01:20.820> when<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.540> don't<00:01:21.689> have

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
mage it really sucks when you don't have

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.380 
mage it really sucks when you don't have
your<00:01:22.110> next<00:01:23.100> level<00:01:23.250> fireball<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.030> all<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.360> I

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
your next level fireball and all that I

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.350 
your next level fireball and all that I
was<00:01:24.689> waiting<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.280> wind<00:01:26.280> got<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.580> skills<00:01:26.820> skills

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
was waiting I wind got the skills skills

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.929 
was waiting I wind got the skills skills
at<00:01:29.240> 16<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.479> then<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.290> did<00:01:31.470> 20<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.280> was<00:01:32.729> kind

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
at 16 and then just did 20 so I was kind

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.450 
at 16 and then just did 20 so I was kind
of<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.119> little<00:01:33.210> bit<00:01:33.360> behind<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.810> curve<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.259> that

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
of a little bit behind the curve on that

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.560 
of a little bit behind the curve on that
but<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.640> was<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:35.820> because<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.270> thought<00:01:36.420> it'd

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
but that was just because I thought it'd

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.990 
but that was just because I thought it'd
be<00:01:36.659> faster<00:01:36.930> but<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.650> think<00:01:38.430> next<00:01:38.579> time<00:01:38.820> I'll

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
be faster but I think next time I'll

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.450 
be faster but I think next time I'll
begin<00:01:39.180> my<00:01:39.360> scale<00:01:39.750> up<00:01:40.040> quicker<00:01:41.040> than<00:01:41.250> that

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
begin my scale up quicker than that

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.090 
begin my scale up quicker than that
because<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.540> know<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.840> noticed<00:01:43.320> how<00:01:43.470> bad<00:01:43.710> it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
because I you know I noticed how bad it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.880 
because I you know I noticed how bad it
sucked<00:01:44.520> not<00:01:45.270> having<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.290> next<00:01:46.470> up<00:01:46.710> I'm

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
sucked not having that so next up I'm

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.630 
sucked not having that so next up I'm
going<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.070> have<00:01:47.189> 20<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.759> 30<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.540> guys<00:01:48.750> and

going to have 20 to 30 for you guys and

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.600 
going to have 20 to 30 for you guys and
I'm<00:01:50.640> hoping<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:52.710> about<00:01:52.799> 30<00:01:53.189> minutes<00:01:53.520> a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
I'm hoping to do about 30 minutes a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.760 
I'm hoping to do about 30 minutes a
level<00:01:53.909> 20<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.630> 30<00:01:54.810> i<00:01:54.899> think<00:01:55.140> having<00:01:55.320> amounts

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
level 20 to 30 i think having amounts

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.069 
level 20 to 30 i think having amounts
going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.070> speed<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.430> up<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.759> lot<00:01:57.079> especially

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
going to speed that up a lot especially

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.200 
going to speed that up a lot especially
with<00:01:58.500> my<00:01:58.590> new<00:01:58.710> skills<00:01:59.070> too<00:01:59.369> i<00:01:59.549> don't<00:02:00.149> think

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
with my new skills too i don't think

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.850 
with my new skills too i don't think
