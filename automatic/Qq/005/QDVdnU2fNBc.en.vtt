previous<00:00:06.720> tutorial<00:00:06.839> I<00:00:07.319> told<00:00:07.500> you<00:00:07.649> that<00:00:07.770> you

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
previous tutorial I told you that you

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.589 
previous tutorial I told you that you
could<00:00:08.040> use<00:00:08.220> multi<00:00:08.639> crafts<00:00:08.910> or<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.210> could<00:00:09.330> post

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
could use multi crafts or you could post

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.419 
could use multi crafts or you could post
it<00:00:09.750> on<00:00:09.870> your<00:00:09.960> own<00:00:10.080> computer<00:00:10.200> but<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:11.040> strongly

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
it on your own computer but I strongly

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.879 
it on your own computer but I strongly
recommend<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:12.030> VPS<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.719> host<00:00:13.200> your<00:00:13.410> bungee<00:00:13.559> cord

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
recommend a VPS to host your bungee cord

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.430 
recommend a VPS to host your bungee cord
because<00:00:14.160> it's<00:00:14.340> basically<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.759> network<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.360> you

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
because it's basically a network and you

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.109 
because it's basically a network and you
don't<00:00:16.440> want<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.830> have<00:00:17.010> too<00:00:17.190> many<00:00:17.340> Cory's<00:00:17.910> on

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
don't want to have too many Cory's on

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.240 
don't want to have too many Cory's on
your<00:00:18.359> own<00:00:18.570> network<00:00:19.500> or<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.920> don't<00:00:20.070> want<00:00:20.189> to

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
your own network or you don't want to

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.859 
your own network or you don't want to
overflow<00:00:20.609> anything<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.150> let's<00:00:21.539> just<00:00:21.600> go<00:00:21.779> ahead

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
overflow anything so let's just go ahead

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.990 
overflow anything so let's just go ahead
and<00:00:22.140> get<00:00:22.529> right<00:00:22.650> into<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.519> when<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.880> buy

use<00:01:35.479> any<00:01:36.479> other<00:01:37.159> operating<00:01:38.159> system<00:01:38.579> it's<00:01:39.119> not

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
use any other operating system it's not

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.490 
use any other operating system it's not
too<00:01:39.570> hard

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
too hard

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.240 
too hard
yum<00:01:41.490> will<00:01:41.729> change<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.780> different<00:01:43.439> name<00:01:43.829> so

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
yum will change to a different name so

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.120 
yum will change to a different name so
like<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.720> know<00:01:46.020> what<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.470> CentOS<00:01:46.890> so

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
like I just know what it is on CentOS so

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.649 
like I just know what it is on CentOS so
I<00:01:47.159> don't<00:01:47.399> know<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.640> let's<00:01:48.000> say<00:01:48.210> you're<00:01:48.390> running

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
I don't know it let's say you're running

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.190 
I don't know it let's say you're running
a<00:01:49.369> fedora<00:01:50.369> or<00:01:50.759> you're<00:01:51.720> running<00:01:51.960> some<00:01:52.110> other

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
a fedora or you're running some other

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200 
a fedora or you're running some other
redhead<00:01:52.710> distribution<00:01:53.369> or<00:01:53.490> something<00:01:54.060> like

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
redhead distribution or something like

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.240 
redhead distribution or something like
that<00:01:54.390> you're<00:01:54.570> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.720> want<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.049> change<00:01:55.860> yum

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
that you're going to want to change yum

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.429 
that you're going to want to change yum
something<00:01:56.610> also<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.210> link<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:57.990> resources

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
something also have a link for resources

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.770 
something also have a link for resources
on<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.729> okay<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.329> now<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.630> I've

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
on for that okay so now that I've

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.780 
on for that okay so now that I've
installed<00:02:00.899> scream<00:02:01.549> screen

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
installed scream screen

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.910 
installed scream screen
not<00:02:03.090> scream<00:02:03.420> I'm<00:02:03.869> gonna<00:02:04.079> install<00:02:04.380> Java<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:04.860> I'm

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
not scream I'm gonna install Java so I'm

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.210 
not scream I'm gonna install Java so I'm
just<00:02:05.250> say<00:02:05.399> yum<00:02:05.729> install<00:02:06.030> Java<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:07.229> let<00:02:07.979> me<00:02:08.069> give

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
just say yum install Java so let me give

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.529 
just say yum install Java so let me give
you<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> rundown<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:08.700> what<00:02:08.879> you're<00:02:09.000> installing

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
you a rundown on what you're installing

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.820 
you a rundown on what you're installing
screen<00:02:10.379> allows<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.280> open<00:02:11.819> up<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.470> screen

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
screen allows you to open up a screen

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.970 
screen allows you to open up a screen
on<00:02:13.890> your<00:02:14.430> VPS<00:02:14.880> keep<00:02:15.540> in<00:02:15.630> mind<00:02:15.840> what<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.380> VPS<00:02:16.800> is

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
on your VPS keep in mind what a VPS is

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.280 
on your VPS keep in mind what a VPS is
is<00:02:17.280> basically<00:02:17.970> it's<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.360> machine<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:19.170> will

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
is basically it's a machine that will

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.960 
is basically it's a machine that will
run<00:02:19.590> whatever<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.130> wanted<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.490> run<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:20.940> you

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
run whatever you wanted to run and you

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.370 
run whatever you wanted to run and you
can<00:02:21.120> access<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.480> machine<00:02:21.930> through<00:02:22.350> a

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
can access that machine through a

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.200 
can access that machine through a
command<00:02:22.890> line<00:02:23.100> kind<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.850> what<00:02:23.940> I'm<00:02:24.030> using

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
command line kind of what I'm using

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.960 
command line kind of what I'm using
right<00:02:24.450> now<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:25.520> similarly<00:02:26.990> this<00:02:27.990> acts<00:02:28.350> as

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
right now and similarly this acts as

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.970 
right now and similarly this acts as
like<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.030> little<00:02:30.360> not<00:02:31.020> an<00:02:31.170> emulator<00:02:31.680> but<00:02:31.890> it

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
like a little not an emulator but it

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.280 
like a little not an emulator but it
acts<00:02:32.190> as<00:02:32.430> like<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.610> my<00:02:33.180> own<00:02:33.360> little<00:02:33.570> portal<00:02:34.050> to

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
acts as like a my own little portal to

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.400 
acts as like a my own little portal to
that<00:02:34.740> machine<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.600> when<00:02:36.600> I'm<00:02:36.720> done<00:02:36.990> with<00:02:37.200> what

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
that machine and when I'm done with what

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.340 
that machine and when I'm done with what
I'm<00:02:37.530> doing<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.340> close<00:02:38.640> putty<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.720> will

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
I'm doing and I close putty it will

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.660 
I'm doing and I close putty it will
close<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.740> on<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.890> virtual<00:02:41.160> machine<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.550> we

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
close it on the virtual machine and we

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.920 
close it on the virtual machine and we
don't<00:02:41.820> want<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.210> happen<00:02:42.240> because<00:02:42.660> if

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
don't want that to happen because if

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.930 
don't want that to happen because if
that<00:02:43.080> does<00:02:43.290> happen<00:02:43.340> then<00:02:44.340> it'll<00:02:44.610> shut<00:02:44.760> down

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
that does happen then it'll shut down

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.670 
that does happen then it'll shut down
Bungie<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.570> we<00:02:45.930> don't<00:02:46.140> want<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.560> happen

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
Bungie and we don't want that to happen

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.030 
Bungie and we don't want that to happen
to<00:02:46.830> Bungie<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:48.180> we<00:02:48.540> love<00:02:48.720> Bungie<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.890> that's

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
to Bungie so we love Bungie so that's

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.550 
to Bungie so we love Bungie so that's
basically<00:02:50.310> what<00:02:50.430> we're<00:02:50.610> installing<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.560> after

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
basically what we're installing so after

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.600 
basically what we're installing so after
you've<00:02:52.680> done<00:02:52.770> that<00:02:52.830> you<00:02:53.190> can<00:02:53.280> just<00:02:53.340> go<00:02:53.520> ahead

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
you've done that you can just go ahead

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.850 
you've done that you can just go ahead
and<00:02:53.730> say<00:02:53.910> screen<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:54.990> this<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.380> opening<00:02:55.680> up<00:02:55.770> a

jar bungee cord dot jar and that will

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.280 
jar bungee cord dot jar and that will
start<00:03:27.120> up<00:03:27.239> Bungie<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:27.780> let<00:03:27.930> me<00:03:27.989> just<00:03:28.140> show<00:03:28.260> you
