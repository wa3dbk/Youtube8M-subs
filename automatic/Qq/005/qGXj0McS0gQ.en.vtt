00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.160 

hi<00:00:04.980> guys<00:00:05.190> in<00:00:05.700> this<00:00:05.760> video<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.420> making<00:00:06.870> another

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
hi guys in this video of making another

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.890 
hi guys in this video of making another
base<00:00:07.439> time<00:00:08.090> so<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.240> chemical<00:00:09.690> we'll<00:00:09.780> be

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
base time so the chemical we'll be

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.799 
base time so the chemical we'll be
needing<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.349> led<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.370> nitrate<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.780> potassium

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
needing is led to nitrate and potassium

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.460 
needing is led to nitrate and potassium
iodide<00:00:13.879> so<00:00:14.879> the<00:00:14.999> first<00:00:15.269> step<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:16.100> measure<00:00:18.470> four

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
iodide so the first step is measure four

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.849 
iodide so the first step is measure four
grams<00:00:19.769> of<00:00:20.449> potassium<00:00:21.449> iodine<00:00:22.019> and<00:00:22.260> four<00:00:22.590> grams

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
grams of potassium iodine and four grams

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.380 
grams of potassium iodine and four grams
of<00:00:23.449> lead<00:00:24.449> nitrate<00:00:24.890> so<00:00:25.890> now<00:00:26.039> pouring<00:00:26.460> about<00:00:26.880> 20

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
of lead nitrate so now pouring about 20

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.700 
of lead nitrate so now pouring about 20
meters<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:28.070> each<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:30.320> each<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.560> those

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
meters of each and each of those

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.810 
meters of each and each of those
continues<00:00:32.490> that's<00:00:33.240> 20<00:00:33.660> million<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.670> Tony

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
continues that's 20 million and Tony

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.939 
continues that's 20 million and Tony
Marisa<00:00:36.690> maez<00:00:37.640> okay<00:00:40.879> now<00:00:42.620> you<00:00:43.620> can<00:00:43.649> actually

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
Marisa maez okay now you can actually

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.660 
Marisa maez okay now you can actually
see<00:00:44.989> potassium<00:00:45.989> iodide<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.410> very<00:00:46.699> soluble

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
see potassium iodide is very soluble

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.029 
see potassium iodide is very soluble
descoteaux<00:00:50.670> solved<00:00:51.239> already

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
descoteaux solved already

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:59.099 
descoteaux solved already
so<00:00:53.359> no<00:00:54.359> useful<00:00:54.629> my<00:00:55.019> Sharad

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.919 

now<00:00:59.739> with<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.129> left<00:01:00.519> pane<00:01:00.850> I<00:01:01.179> mean<00:01:01.749> with<00:01:01.899> a

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
now with the left pane I mean with a

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:10.060 
now with the left pane I mean with a
letter<00:01:02.829> based<00:01:03.129> chemical<00:01:03.940> letters<00:01:04.809> to<00:01:05.080> nitrate

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.980 

they're<00:01:10.640> naked<00:01:11.240> chemicals<00:01:11.720> are<00:01:11.780> very

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
they're naked chemicals are very

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.940 
they're naked chemicals are very
dangerous<00:01:12.340> just<00:01:13.340> there<00:01:13.730> are<00:01:13.850> carcinogen

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
dangerous just there are carcinogen

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.990 
dangerous just there are carcinogen
meaning<00:01:15.950> that<00:01:16.630> it<00:01:17.630> could<00:01:17.810> affect<00:01:18.170> your<00:01:18.320> heart

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
meaning that it could affect your heart

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.660 
meaning that it could affect your heart
so<00:01:20.000> just<00:01:20.240> with<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.570> stirrer<00:01:21.250> break<00:01:22.250> the

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
so just with the stirrer break the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:46.870 
so just with the stirrer break the
little<00:01:22.970> chunks<00:01:30.220> I<00:01:41.830> have<00:01:42.830> to<00:01:42.950> wash<00:01:43.130> this

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.320 

or<00:01:47.450> some<00:01:47.659> ti1<00:01:47.960> on<00:01:48.380> this<00:01:48.790> okay<00:01:51.370> now<00:01:52.370> the<00:01:53.120> next

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
or some ti1 on this okay now the next

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.360 
or some ti1 on this okay now the next
step<00:01:53.979> this<00:01:55.180> this<00:01:56.180> is<00:01:56.270> actually<00:01:56.390> optional<00:01:57.370> get

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
step this this is actually optional get

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:07.749 
step this this is actually optional get
two<00:01:58.850> test<00:01:59.180> tubes<00:01:59.300> and<00:02:03.040> pour<00:02:04.040> in<00:02:04.900> about<00:02:06.759> half

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
two test tubes and pour in about half

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:15.240 
two test tubes and pour in about half
the<00:02:08.090> test<00:02:08.780> tube<00:02:09.080> of<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.619> chemical

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:23.949 

what<00:02:15.880> is<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.120> body

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.300 

okay<00:02:25.239> so<00:02:26.239> this<00:02:26.390> is<00:02:26.569> lead<00:02:26.900> nitrate<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.650> just

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
okay so this is lead nitrate and just

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.380 
okay so this is lead nitrate and just
potassium<00:02:28.909> is<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:30.290> nitrate<00:02:30.769> alright<00:02:31.549> next

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
potassium is that nitrate alright next

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.309 
potassium is that nitrate alright next
step<00:02:32.689> thanks<00:02:33.500> to<00:02:33.739> yellow<00:02:34.370> paint<00:02:34.730> so<00:02:35.480> just<00:02:35.719> pour

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
step thanks to yellow paint so just pour

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.110 
step thanks to yellow paint so just pour
in<00:02:36.409> the<00:02:36.500> same<00:02:36.739> time<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.909> look<00:02:38.000> what<00:02:38.150> happens

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
in the same time and look what happens

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.559 
in the same time and look what happens
it's<00:02:41.120> paint<00:02:41.590> isn't<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.739> awesome

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
it's paint isn't that awesome

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.879 
it's paint isn't that awesome
that's<00:02:44.569> so<00:02:44.780> cool<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:46.459> just<00:02:47.139> pour<00:02:48.139> this<00:02:48.560> or

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
that's so cool you just pour this or

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:55.089 
that's so cool you just pour this or
your<00:02:49.040> split<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:49.700> they're<00:02:50.420> washing<00:02:50.840> bin<00:02:54.099> so

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
your split it and they're washing bin so

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.179 
your split it and they're washing bin so
this<00:02:55.790> is<00:02:55.909> little<00:02:56.239> paint<00:02:56.620> this<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:57.769> actually

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:58.189 
this is little paint this is actually

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:03.960 
this is little paint this is actually
lit<00:02:58.689> nitrate<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:01.400> is<00:03:01.489> pretty<00:03:01.669> cool<00:03:02.680> so

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
lit nitrate this is pretty cool so

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.680 
lit nitrate this is pretty cool so
please<00:03:04.970> rate<00:03:05.209> comment<00:03:05.629> subscribe<00:03:05.840> thanks
