side now here you see the step to get up

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.350 
side now here you see the step to get up
into<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.840> cab<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.369> then<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.820> cab<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.329> cab

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
into the cab and then the cab the cab

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.039 
into the cab and then the cab the cab
has<00:01:45.720> one<00:01:45.990> joystick<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:47.700> move<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.450> loader<00:01:48.630> arms

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
has one joystick to move the loader arms

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.880 
has one joystick to move the loader arms
and<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.530> curl<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.280> call<00:01:51.030> bucket<00:01:51.409> up<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.710> down

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
and to curl and call bucket up and down

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.190 
and to curl and call bucket up and down
or<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:54.000> know<00:01:54.119> whatever<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.659> want<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.869> call<00:01:55.020> it

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
or you know whatever you want to call it

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.350 
or you know whatever you want to call it
and<00:01:55.350> then<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.009> has<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.549> steering<00:01:57.000> wheel<00:01:57.149> to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
and then it has the steering wheel to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.330 
and then it has the steering wheel to
turn<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:58.250> here<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.840> articulation<00:02:01.189> you<00:02:02.189> can

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
turn it here is the articulation you can

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.950 
turn it here is the articulation you can
see<00:02:02.520> when<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.210> get<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> other<00:02:03.630> side<00:02:03.810> I'll

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
see when I get to the other side I'll

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.859 
see when I get to the other side I'll
show<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.200> but<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.530> machine<00:02:04.950> only<00:02:05.159> has<00:02:05.430> one

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
show you but this machine only has one

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.190 
show you but this machine only has one
cylinder<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.819> turn<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.030> machine<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.509> if<00:02:10.080> you

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
cylinder to turn the machine and if you

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.930 
cylinder to turn the machine and if you
look<00:02:10.410> that

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
look that

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.360 
look that
a<00:02:11.000> whole<00:02:11.570> joint<00:02:11.930> right<00:02:12.200> now<00:02:12.410> so<00:02:13.040> when<00:02:13.280> the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
a whole joint right now so when the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.310 
a whole joint right now so when the
machine<00:02:13.490> gets<00:02:13.970> off<00:02:14.150> balance<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.840> cylinder

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
interesting thing that I thought I would

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.960 
interesting thing that I thought I would
tell<00:04:32.550> you<00:04:32.610> people<00:04:33.060> is<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:34.560> turn<00:04:34.860> radius<00:04:35.130> so<00:04:35.700> if

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
tell you people is the turn radius so if

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.470 
tell you people is the turn radius so if
you<00:04:36.560> find<00:04:37.560> this<00:04:37.770> machine<00:04:38.160> all<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.490> way<00:04:38.820> to<00:04:39.330> the

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
you find this machine all the way to the

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.290 
you find this machine all the way to the
left<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:39.990> then<00:04:40.770> make<00:04:41.160> a<00:04:41.190> turn<00:04:41.520> it's<00:04:41.880> the

circle<00:04:42.780> for<00:04:43.230> it<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.380> turn<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:44.030> if<00:04:45.030> you<00:04:45.210> start

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
circle for it to turn and if you start

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.510 
circle for it to turn and if you start
here<00:04:46.260> and<00:04:46.380> then<00:04:46.500> make<00:04:46.770> your<00:04:46.860> way<00:04:46.920> there<00:04:47.280> is<00:04:47.490> a
