00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.600
 already mentioned can be followed only on unlocked devices 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.870
 baby rpa the same thing even if we say there are definitely - tv for now 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.220
 but much more complete, even more nice 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.200
 let's see how it works 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.370
 as you see just launched 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.790
 application cesar cremone in front of an interface 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.790
 which shows activate the installed pin nic 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.580
 we ride installed someone just for test 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.840
 for example 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.950
 let's open that install the one related to android 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.320
 we will be asked to apply 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.780
 the theme to confirm 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.710
 what you see is pretty much instantly it would have had immediately 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.630
 qualified 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.630
 forever - android style 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.630
 and as you can see 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.490
 There are 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.600
 several features all perfectly 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.750
 % 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.750
 studied precisely for the topic in question 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.680
 the use of multitasking remains native 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.920
 it's nice in this case we also have widgets 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.229
 that can be modified 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.420
 entering for example a time 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.130
 customized as a starting base weight which will then go 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.810
 to be updated from time to time 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.699
 take another example, buy mind by clicking on drin bordoni 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:19.839
 I will read training addressed to the page we have already seen before for 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.839
 climate selection 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.040
 for example and I show one really very interesting 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.139
 let's try installing mac os x snow leopard 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:38.089
 this very very very nice theme very very interesting here it is 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:41.199
 is a fully almeco spa style theme 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:43.960
 is that 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.960
 also continuous curtain 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.939
 and as you could see, this was installed in a few seconds 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.939
 thanks prof. learn to excuse baby 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:03:00.319
 we have access to a series of applications for practically all of them 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.229
 that already 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:03.329
 we have on 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.969
 on the normal aifon os 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:11.449
 egypt also see to a very neat interface in this case allows us 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:14.149
 for example, access the weather 

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:17.149
 differently than what happens 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.969
 normally 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:22.969
 calendar well there is between etc. 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.239
 same for the application on the phone 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.239
 and so on versilia 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.040
 also in this case 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.710
 for let's say 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.449
 return to the peace of child the green living barrel all the effects 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.969
 the main interface 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:44.489
 d 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.989
 of this stored theme manager 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.069
 I click on the icon 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.210
 and perfect new classes 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.210
 suction we can. to change 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.569
 I show this 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.509
 in style 

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:06.979
 blog report 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.289
 also interactive 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:12.289
 this is also very nice 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.039
 all menus are spent 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.699
 and now let's try to get others back on the stock market by 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.680
 here it is 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:46.979
 and if you want to reset the standard interface - just select this 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.080
 theme 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.080
 than the deposit and click on patty 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.210
 and we returned to the normal baked monster 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.990
 dreamboard is definitely a very very interesting program that 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.040
 dossier will be supported by the developers 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.930
 why program. dedicated themes could really become a viable one 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.849
 alternative if grandma blatter native in excellence for excellence to the most famous 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.249
 winterboard 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:21.180
 remember that not all the themes for winterboards that are immense are not 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.349
 they have no marando end now not all of these are compatible with breen 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.180
 there are very few borders, in addition to those we have laughed at 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.749
 that is, there will be two or three more 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:37.589
 all these issues could expose you ms of the experts from silvia agra free a little 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:38.789
 payment 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:44.339
 but we are sure that .net in the coming and next months there will be a puma of these 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:48.770
 guest the pines since as we have seen breen board really offers 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.770
 interesting possibilities also for teenagers 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.949
