just smoke it up a little create a

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.980 
just smoke it up a little create a
little<00:02:02.640> bit<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.030> V<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.420> corner<00:02:03.719> if

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
little bit of a V in the corner if

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.510 
little bit of a V in the corner if
you're<00:02:04.469> doing<00:02:04.619> eyes<00:02:04.920> which<00:02:05.219> are<00:02:05.369> slightly
