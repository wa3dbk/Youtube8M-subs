00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
pretty easy alright now this one's a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.680 
pretty easy alright now this one's a
little<00:02:16.080> bit<00:02:16.350> different<00:02:17.090> than<00:02:18.090> some<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.420> them

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
little bit different than some of them

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.440 
little bit different than some of them
it<00:02:18.840> does<00:02:18.990> have<00:02:19.230> GPS<00:02:19.650> navigation<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:21.209> I'm<00:02:21.360> gonna

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
it does have GPS navigation so I'm gonna

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.210 
it does have GPS navigation so I'm gonna
go<00:02:21.660> ahead<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.870> push<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.890> clock<00:02:23.160> here<00:02:24.350> now<00:02:25.350> it

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
go ahead and push the clock here now it

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.690 
go ahead and push the clock here now it
shows<00:02:27.209> us<00:02:27.510> on<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.900> GPS<00:02:28.380> clock<00:02:28.770> so<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.280> guess<00:02:29.490> it

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
shows us on the GPS clock so I guess it

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.360 
shows us on the GPS clock so I guess it
automatically<00:02:30.240> adjusts<00:02:30.870> based<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:31.980> GPS

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
automatically adjusts based on GPS

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.420 
automatically adjusts based on GPS
signal<00:02:32.910> now<00:02:33.570> if<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.680> like<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.860> change<00:02:35.130> that

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
signal now if you like to change that

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.920
