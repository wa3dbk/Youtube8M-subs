00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
amplification effect that we're looking

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.080 
amplification effect that we're looking
for<00:02:06.530> what<00:02:07.530> about<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.799> reading<00:02:07.920> from<00:02:08.160> run<00:02:08.369> 1994

for what about the reading from run 1994
Robertson<00:02:10.020> 18<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.590> them<00:02:11.090> Robertson<00:02:12.090> isn't

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
Robertson 18 on them Robertson isn't

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.600 
Robertson 18 on them Robertson isn't
qualified<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.380> interpret<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.980> data<00:02:14.130> even<00:02:14.459> if

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
qualified to interpret the data even if

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.820

he<00:02:14.700> gave<00:02:14.849> collected<00:02:15.390> all<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.750> I'm<00:02:16.440> thinking

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
he gave collected all of it I'm thinking

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.070 
he gave collected all of it I'm thinking
about<00:02:16.980> her<00:02:17.130> statistical<00:02:17.790> noise<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.330> think

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
about her statistical noise I think

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.479 
about her statistical noise I think
you're<00:02:19.200> being<00:02:19.319> too<00:02:19.470> quick<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.980> dismiss<00:02:20.280> the
