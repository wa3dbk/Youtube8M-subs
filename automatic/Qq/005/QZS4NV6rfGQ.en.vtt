00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
like this is going to step my game up

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.539 
like this is going to step my game up
dramatically<00:03:10.970> constant<00:03:11.970> aperture<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.360> f<00:03:12.540> 2.8

dramatically constant aperture of f 2.8

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.089 
dramatically constant aperture of f 2.8
the<00:03:14.549> manual<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.290> manual<00:03:16.290> focus<00:03:16.620> is<00:03:16.799> kind<00:03:17.010> of

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
the manual the manual focus is kind of

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.550 
the manual the manual focus is kind of
short<00:03:17.480> but<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.510> think<00:03:18.810> it's<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:18.989> same<00:03:19.260> length

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
short but I think it's the same length

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.479 
short but I think it's the same length
of<00:03:19.769> this<00:03:20.670> man<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.180> if<00:03:21.299> it<00:03:21.389> is<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.660> same<00:03:22.489> this

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
of this man so if it is the same this

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.270 
of this man so if it is the same this
one<00:03:23.639> got<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.760> little<00:03:23.910> bit<00:03:24.150> more<00:03:24.299> poor<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.280> you

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
one got a little bit more poor to it you

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.319 
one got a little bit more poor to it you
see<00:03:27.680> this<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:29.160> one<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.459> just<00:03:29.519> longer<00:03:30.000> a

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
see this this one is just longer a

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.550 
see this this one is just longer a
little<00:03:30.569> bit<00:03:30.690> longer<00:03:30.870> than<00:03:31.109> this<00:03:31.200> one<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:31.440> I'm

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
little bit longer than this one so I'm

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.349 
little bit longer than this one so I'm
already<00:03:31.709> used<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:32.040> focus<00:03:32.400> in<00:03:32.549> I<00:03:32.760> don't<00:03:32.940> be<00:03:33.209> mad

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359

because<00:03:38.099> I'm<00:03:38.579> super<00:03:38.910> steady<00:03:39.180> anyways<00:03:39.599> and<00:03:39.930> I'm

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
because I'm super steady anyways and I'm

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.520 
because I'm super steady anyways and I'm
soon<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.730> get<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:41.970> follow<00:03:42.269> focus<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.959> in<00:03:43.440> the

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
soon to get a follow focus and in the

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.280 
soon to get a follow focus and in the
upcoming<00:03:43.709> year<00:03:44.010> so<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.209> follow<00:03:45.450> focus<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:46.049> it

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
upcoming year so the follow focus is it

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.879 
upcoming year so the follow focus is it
allows<00:03:47.190> you<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.730> real<00:03:48.209> smoothly<00:03:49.049> as

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
allows you to real smoothly as

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.520 
allows you to real smoothly as
you<00:03:50.579> can<00:03:50.760> see<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.329> front<00:03:51.690> element<00:03:51.959> is<00:03:52.260> just

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
you can see the front element is just

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.080 
you can see the front element is just
fricking<00:03:52.889> ridiculous<00:03:52.919> thing<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:53.849> humongous

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
fricking ridiculous thing is humongous

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.890 
fricking ridiculous thing is humongous
and<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.870> friend<00:03:55.169> is<00:03:55.319> a<00:03:55.680> piece<00:03:55.829> now<00:03:58.790> whoo-hoo

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
and the friend is a piece now whoo-hoo

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.930 
and the friend is a piece now whoo-hoo
sorry<00:04:02.359> back<00:04:03.359> right<00:04:03.599> there<00:04:03.840> Oh

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.720 

so<00:04:07.540> unlike<00:04:07.930> that<00:04:08.140> I<00:04:08.440> heard<00:04:09.100> that<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.460> zoom

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
so unlike that I heard that the zoom

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.810 
so unlike that I heard that the zoom
isn't<00:04:10.210> audit<00:04:10.680> smooth<00:04:11.680> it's<00:04:12.100> kind<00:04:12.250> of<00:04:12.340> stiff<00:04:12.610> it

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
isn't audit smooth it's kind of stiff it

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.370 
isn't audit smooth it's kind of stiff it
is<00:04:12.910> kind<00:04:13.150> of<00:04:13.180> stiff<00:04:13.420> especially<00:04:14.020> once<00:04:14.170> you<00:04:14.200> get

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
is kind of stiff especially once you get

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.070 
is kind of stiff especially once you get
up<00:04:14.620> to<00:04:14.800> 50<00:04:15.190> but<00:04:15.850> once<00:04:15.970> you<00:04:16.060> zoom<00:04:16.090> in<00:04:16.480> front<00:04:16.720> 50

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
up to 50 but once you zoom in front 50

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.949 
up to 50 but once you zoom in front 50
it's<00:04:18.010> kind<00:04:18.220> of<00:04:18.400> you<00:04:18.730> know<00:04:18.760> it's<00:04:19.690> kind<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:19.900> a

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
it's kind of you know it's kind of a

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.509 
it's kind of you know it's kind of a
little<00:04:20.110> bit<00:04:20.230> stiff<00:04:20.470> but<00:04:20.680> once<00:04:20.950> you<00:04:21.070> zoom<00:04:21.100> in<00:04:21.400> to

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
little bit stiff but once you zoom in to

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.020 
little bit stiff but once you zoom in to
50<00:04:21.880> that's<00:04:22.150> yeah<00:04:22.540> so<00:04:23.290> I'm<00:04:23.380> a<00:04:23.730> might<00:04:24.730> have<00:04:24.880> some

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
50 that's yeah so I'm a might have some

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.810 
50 that's yeah so I'm a might have some
issues<00:04:25.180> with<00:04:25.420> that<00:04:25.720> I'm<00:04:26.170> on<00:04:26.350> to<00:04:26.560> zoom<00:04:26.980> kind<00:04:27.700> of

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
issues with that I'm on to zoom kind of

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.350 
issues with that I'm on to zoom kind of
fast<00:04:28.090> it<00:04:28.810> is<00:04:28.960> kind<00:04:29.170> of<00:04:29.200> sticky<00:04:29.620> so<00:04:30.190> if<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:31.210> have

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
fast it is kind of sticky so if you have

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.240 
fast it is kind of sticky so if you have
this<00:04:31.540> lens<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.140> you<00:04:32.350> know<00:04:32.800> some<00:04:33.010> kind<00:04:33.190> of

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
this lens and you know some kind of

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.160 
this lens and you know some kind of
trick<00:04:33.490> or<00:04:33.520> something<00:04:33.700> or<00:04:34.120> you<00:04:34.600> know<00:04:34.720> some<00:04:35.050> way

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
trick or something or you know some way

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.660 
trick or something or you know some way
of<00:04:35.320> making<00:04:35.590> this<00:04:35.650> more<00:04:35.890> smoother<00:04:36.250> maybe<00:04:36.460> I<00:04:36.550> got

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
of making this more smoother maybe I got

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.480 
of making this more smoother maybe I got
to<00:04:36.760> break<00:04:36.940> it<00:04:37.060> in<00:04:37.710> then<00:04:38.710> you<00:04:39.010> know<00:04:39.130> let<00:04:39.340> me<00:04:39.370> know

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
to break it in then you know let me know

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.390 
to break it in then you know let me know
to<00:04:39.640> this<00:04:40.030> it<00:04:40.300> is<00:04:40.480> stiff<00:04:41.100> especially<00:04:42.100> compared

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
to this it is stiff especially compared

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.550 
to this it is stiff especially compared
to<00:04:42.520> this<00:04:42.640> one<00:04:42.700> this<00:04:42.970> is<00:04:43.030> like<00:04:43.270> super<00:04:43.630> smooth<00:04:43.900> at

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
to this one this is like super smooth at

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.100 
to this one this is like super smooth at
this<00:04:44.890> family's<00:04:45.520> slow<00:04:46.030> motion<00:04:46.450> this<00:04:46.750> one<00:04:46.930> can't

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
this family's slow motion this one can't

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.690 
this family's slow motion this one can't
really<00:04:47.290> do<00:04:47.410> so<00:04:47.560> much<00:04:47.830> in<00:04:47.860> either

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.370 

a<00:04:53.490> picture<00:04:54.490> of<00:04:54.610> f<00:04:54.760> 2.8<00:04:55.120> what<00:04:55.840> that<00:04:55.960> allows<00:04:56.080> me

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
a picture of f 2.8 what that allows me

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.050 
a picture of f 2.8 what that allows me
to<00:04:56.410> do<00:04:56.650> is<00:04:56.680> not<00:04:57.160> only<00:04:57.340> get<00:04:57.610> a<00:04:57.640> little<00:04:57.940> bit<00:04:58.030> of

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
to do is not only get a little bit of

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.120 
to do is not only get a little bit of
Boca<00:04:58.360> that<00:04:58.870> also<00:04:59.170> which<00:04:59.440> is<00:04:59.590> blurred

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
Boca that also which is blurred

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.130 
Boca that also which is blurred
background<00:05:00.670> but<00:05:01.120> it<00:05:01.270> also<00:05:01.420> allows<00:05:01.810> me<00:05:02.020> to

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
background but it also allows me to

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.830 
background but it also allows me to
capture<00:05:02.320> some<00:05:02.620> images<00:05:03.310> in<00:05:03.570> indoor<00:05:04.570> lighting

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
capture some images in indoor lighting

capture some images in indoor lighting
you<00:05:05.560> know<00:05:05.710> you<00:05:06.580> know<00:05:06.730> kind<00:05:07.090> of<00:05:07.180> lowlife<00:05:07.390> but

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
you know you know kind of lowlife but

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.600 
you know you know kind of lowlife but
not<00:05:07.930> too<00:05:08.080> much<00:05:08.110> low<00:05:08.470> like<00:05:08.680> that's<00:05:09.010> what<00:05:09.160> my<00:05:09.310> 50
