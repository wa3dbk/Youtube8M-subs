900 and CDJ 350 ok so here you can see
i've<00:00:19.109> got<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.230> couple<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.619> hard<00:00:19.920> drives

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
i've got a couple of hard drives

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.820 
i've got a couple of hard drives
connected<00:00:20.400> as<00:00:21.029> well<00:00:21.240> as<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.810> 16<00:00:22.260> gig<00:00:22.500> flash

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.870 
connected as well as a 16 gig flash
drive<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.220> that's<00:00:23.279> not<00:00:23.460> i'm<00:00:23.550> going<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.730> focus

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
drive and that's not i'm going to focus

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.269 
drive and that's not i'm going to focus
on<00:00:24.180> here<00:00:24.510> because<00:00:25.350> these<00:00:25.590> ones<00:00:25.769> actually<00:00:26.130> have

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
on here because these ones actually have

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.769 
on here because these ones actually have
some<00:00:26.519> content<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.090> them<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.359> i<00:00:27.420> don't<00:00:27.570> want<00:00:27.720> to

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
some content in them and i don't want to

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.640 
some content in them and i don't want to

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
if you do you're going to be wiping it

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:35.870 
if you do you're going to be wiping it

so<00:00:36.090> copy<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.510> need<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.750> data<00:00:36.930> off<00:00:37.079> at<00:00:37.260> first

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
so copy I need the data off at first

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.280 
so copy I need the data off at first
next<00:00:38.940> load<00:00:39.300> up<00:00:39.450> your<00:00:39.480> Applications<00:00:40.200> folder

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
and go to load your utilities I've got a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.930 
and go to load your utilities I've got a
shortcut<00:00:42.719> here<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:42.960> my<00:00:43.050> dock<00:00:43.460> go<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.730> Disk

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
shortcut here on my dock go to the Disk

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.319 
shortcut here on my dock go to the Disk
Utility<00:00:46.190> takes<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.520> second<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> enumerate

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
Utility takes just a second to enumerate

Utility takes just a second to enumerate
the<00:00:48.450> drives<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.899> are<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.110> there<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.890> ones

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the drives that are on there the ones

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.290 
the drives that are on there the ones
that<00:00:50.219> are<00:00:50.309> set<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> left<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:50.969> physical

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
that are set to the left of the physical

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.939 
that are set to the left of the physical
drives<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.989> ones<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.289> set<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> right<00:00:52.770> are

drives the ones are set to the right are

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.950 
drives the ones are set to the right are
the<00:00:53.070> partitions<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.820> if<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.690> were<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.840> click

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
the partitions so if you were to click

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.450 
the partitions so if you were to click
on<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> partition<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:55.649> example<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> Corsair

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
on a partition for example a Corsair

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.819 
on a partition for example a Corsair
you'll<00:00:56.969> see<00:00:57.120> first<00:00:57.600> ad<00:00:57.899> race<00:00:58.170> raid<00:00:58.649> and

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
you'll see first ad race raid and

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.200 
you'll see first ad race raid and
restore<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.460> tabs<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.850> I've<00:00:59.969> got<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.180> work

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
restore the tabs that I've got to work

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.889 
restore the tabs that I've got to work
with<00:01:00.359> if<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:01.530> go<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.340> drive<00:01:03.000> itself<00:01:03.329> you

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
with if you go to the drive itself you

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.450 
with if you go to the drive itself you
now<00:01:04.110> all<00:01:04.290> sudden<00:01:04.559> see<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> partition<00:01:05.129> option

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
now all sudden see a partition option

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.910 
now all sudden see a partition option
this<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.299> one<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.479> want<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> use<00:01:06.920> don't

this is the one you want to use don't
just<00:01:08.130> erase<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:09.229> under<00:01:10.229> volume<00:01:10.439> scheme<00:01:10.830> select

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
just erase it under volume scheme select

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.399 
just erase it under volume scheme select
current<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.240> change<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:12.930> partition

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
current and change that to one partition

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.300 
current and change that to one partition
because<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.740> don't<00:01:13.890> want<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.159> multiple

because you don't want to have multiple
partitions<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.210> device<00:01:15.420> because<00:01:15.900> only

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
partitions on this device because only

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.130 
partitions on this device because only
the<00:01:16.320> first<00:01:16.560> one<00:01:16.799> will<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.040> read<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:19.020> can

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the first one will be read so you can

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.410 
the first one will be read so you can
change<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.530> name<00:01:19.680> let's<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:21.030> name<00:01:21.210> mine

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
