00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:44.780
 You are recording the c 1 of Bellinger on hand 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:47.720
 As it is hand-held, may Moyes enter, but how is it? 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:53.200

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.480
 How about that 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:36.770
 Will still different from the previous c 1 or I now this interface 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.940
 I'm doing it while monitoring the phone terminal and this headphone connection . 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.290
 But 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.529
 I 'm listening to this b 2 who is not getting white noise 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.739
 Sometimes 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:49.510
 After all the price is also different 

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:52.009
 C 1 door Oh of Behringer 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:56.509
 Why is this one 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:05:00.610
 I think a little kana not're taken by Lee sound quality Dewae in the same way as earlier 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.610
 I would like to get close to my mouth 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:08.220

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.190
 Do you hear 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:30.949
 Well then, last but not least I've used Sony's Lectore condenser microphone 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.949
 I want to record with pcv 80 u 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:38.960
 Hey-and the last Sony electret condenser mic I've been using 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.600

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.820
 How about compared with the previous Japanese condenser microphone Come 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:49.560
 After all, I know 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:54.270
 Because Lectore and Condenser Microphone and Condenser Microphone are different 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.840
 I also think that the sound quality is also slightly different 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.820
 How about that 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.910
 Hey I think Kawan so much is still just in the shovel minutes 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:07.180
 I guess because such a cheeky Toka not familiar with the 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:11.080
 I don't really know how to say this, but 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:14.400
 It was about to record a little bit This electret condenser microphone pcv 80 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:18.620
 u I think this is not enough at all 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.620
 Well I want to end the test in such a feeling 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:26.529
 It feels like 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:29.009
 5 Bellinger's b 2 pro and c 1 this Japan 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:34.139
 I tried to take a trial 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:37.840
 Well, I feel like I 'm getting interface and cable 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:40.529
 Condenser microphone became usable in 2 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:44.729
 I want and I think we use when there is time to be 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:49.499
 The rest is the purchase of the microphone stand It is not the name without it 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:51.060
 It became long with feeling that I bought interface and cable 

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:53.900
 And 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.320
 It was comparison of sound quality
