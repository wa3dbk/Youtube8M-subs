water did you know whales and dolphins

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.589 
water did you know whales and dolphins
do<00:00:12.719> ultrasound<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:13.500> water<00:00:13.740> they<00:00:14.670> take<00:00:14.910> scans<00:00:15.330> I

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
do ultrasound in water they take scans I

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.560 
do ultrasound in water they take scans I
never<00:00:16.379> knew<00:00:16.609> so<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.670> got<00:00:18.029> any<00:00:18.210> pictures

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
never knew so you got any pictures

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.070 
never knew so you got any pictures
surely<00:00:19.529> look<00:00:20.310> at<00:00:20.460> these<00:00:20.640> they<00:00:21.570> were<00:00:21.630> made<00:00:21.900> in

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
surely look at these they were made in

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.820 
surely look at these they were made in
real<00:00:22.320> time<00:00:22.789> great<00:00:23.789> i<00:00:24.060> am<00:00:24.510> glad<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:25.320> mean<00:00:25.560> real

real time great i am glad you mean real

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.920 
real time great i am glad you mean real
time<00:00:26.160> as<00:00:26.430> opposed<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.000> some<00:00:27.240> other<00:00:27.269> kind<00:00:27.750> of

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
time as opposed to some other kind of

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.550 
time as opposed to some other kind of
time<00:00:28.250> well<00:00:29.250> i<00:00:29.519> guess<00:00:30.330> thats<00:00:30.630> water<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.320> black

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
time well i guess thats water the black

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.780 
time well i guess thats water the black
stuff<00:00:32.040> you've<00:00:33.000> got<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.450> water<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.620> black<00:00:34.920> it's

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
stuff you've got it water is black it's

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.420 
stuff you've got it water is black it's
due<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> through<00:00:36.570> transmission<00:00:37.010> I've<00:00:38.010> got

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
due to the through transmission I've got

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.970 
due to the through transmission I've got
it<00:00:38.579> all<00:00:38.760> right<00:00:39.120> through<00:00:40.050> transmission<00:00:40.500> in

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
it all right through transmission in

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.639 
it all right through transmission in
real<00:00:41.190> time<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> good<00:00:43.020> thing<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.500> have

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
real time is that a good thing to have

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.150 
real time is that a good thing to have
in<00:00:44.520> ultrasound<00:00:45.180> we<00:00:45.539> think<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:46.770> water<00:00:47.039> is

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
in ultrasound we think so so if water is

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.990 
in ultrasound we think so so if water is
black<00:00:47.670> what<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.360> white<00:00:48.600> well<00:00:49.530> bone<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.760> white

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
black what is white well bone is white

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.740 
black what is white well bone is white
calcium<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.110> know<00:00:52.289> that's<00:00:53.250> good<00:00:53.610> bone<00:00:54.539> is

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
calcium you know that's good bone is

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.889 
calcium you know that's good bone is
white<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.050> x-ray<00:00:55.680> too<00:00:55.910> so<00:00:56.910> tell<00:00:57.210> me<00:00:57.239> what<00:00:57.660> color

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
white on x-ray too so tell me what color

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.150 
white on x-ray too so tell me what color
is<00:00:58.109> there<00:00:58.320> black<00:00:59.280> no<00:01:00.090> air<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.390> white<00:01:00.600> too

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
is there black no air is white too

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.520 
is there black no air is white too
really<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:03.030> both<00:01:03.300> bone<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.870> air<00:01:04.049> are<00:01:04.260> white

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
really so both bone and air are white

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.969 
really so both bone and air are white
that<00:01:05.460> seems<00:01:05.850> like<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.090> problem<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.810> mean<00:01:07.590> what<00:01:07.830> do

see mrs. Jones you have this white area
on<00:01:12.810> your<00:01:12.840> scan<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.740> either<00:01:13.890> bone<00:01:14.250> or<00:01:14.490> air

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
on your scan that is either bone or air

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.120 
on your scan that is either bone or air
it<00:01:15.390> doesn't<00:01:15.810> seem<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.650> going<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.009> be

well stones are white too
that's<00:01:24.539> due<00:01:24.899> to<00:01:25.079> the<00:01:25.170> calcium<00:01:25.680> right<00:01:26.810> well<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
that's due to the calcium right well the

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.270 
that's due to the calcium right well the
stones<00:01:28.619> without<00:01:28.950> calcium<00:01:29.430> are<00:01:29.880> white<00:01:30.149> too<00:01:30.450> oh

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
stones without calcium are white too oh

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.810 
stones without calcium are white too oh
ok<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.340> soft<00:01:32.789> tissue<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:34.229> grey<00:01:34.649> kind<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.759> a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
ok so soft tissue is it's grey kind of a

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.330 
ok so soft tissue is it's grey kind of a
speckled<00:01:36.270> grey<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.710> see<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.219> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
speckled grey here you can see it on the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.749 
speckled grey here you can see it on the
scan<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:39.360> due<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.929> echogenicity<00:01:40.759> what

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
scan it's due to the echogenicity what

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.090 
scan it's due to the echogenicity what
is<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.090> speckle<00:01:42.569> thing<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.500> looks<00:01:43.829> like<00:01:44.069> a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
is this speckle thing it looks like a

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.800 
is this speckle thing it looks like a
knockoff<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.850> French<00:01:45.149> impressionist

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
knockoff of a French impressionist

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.559 
knockoff of a French impressionist
painting<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.500> guess<00:01:47.340> if<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.670> only<00:01:47.969> have<00:01:48.270> great

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
painting I guess if you only have great

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.499 
painting I guess if you only have great
to<00:01:48.810> work<00:01:48.990> with<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:50.100> know<00:01:50.340> sir<00:01:50.610> at<00:01:50.819> used<00:01:51.119> color

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
to work with you know sir at used color

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.990 
to work with you know sir at used color
and<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.840> worked<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.259> lot<00:01:52.439> better<00:01:53.000> basically

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and it worked a lot better basically

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.480 
and it worked a lot better basically
water<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.539> black<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.170> think<00:01:56.039> I<00:01:56.220> have<00:01:56.459> it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
water is black I think I have it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.339 
water is black I think I have it
straight<00:01:56.939> now<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:58.140> if<00:01:58.289> it's<00:01:58.500> black<00:01:58.799> its<00:01:59.130> water

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
straight now so if it's black its water

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.589 
straight now so if it's black its water
well<00:02:01.349> that's<00:02:02.220> true<00:02:02.579> except<00:02:03.030> for<00:02:03.209> the<00:02:03.270> region

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:03.599 
well that's true except for the region

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.039 
well that's true except for the region
behind<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:04.170> stone<00:02:04.470> it's<00:02:05.220> black<00:02:05.610> too<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.720> due

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
behind a stone it's black too it's due

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.400 
behind a stone it's black too it's due
to<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.289> shadowing<00:02:07.679> from<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> stone<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.670> see<00:02:09.539> or

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
to the shadowing from the stone I see or

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.100
