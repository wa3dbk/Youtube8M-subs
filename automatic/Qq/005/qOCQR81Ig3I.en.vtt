00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.760
 which is trying to turn of course a lot 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.100
 The dispute is about her that why you 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.890
 it is necessary to make the original Lada 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.820
 Well, let's say I like it so much 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.410
 complete set 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:35.130
 like 0603 type floor sixth well this is not 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.770
 it’s not important at all when finally 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.360
 decided that I will take the second 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.340
 the car will be a VAZ 2103 and bring it 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.590

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.640
 staged will remain as exclusive 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.500
 project for the sharpest parts either else 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.800
 anything 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:59.030
 so I 'll tell you about her begin 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.620
 for example adjacency, many know that 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.610
 the car was completely made naked 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:11.040
 bodywork all restored from scratch and 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:15.900
 as if absolutely all the details that are 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.400
 I put my hands do not begin to give 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.400
 example from the front 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.710
 so my lattice as you understand 20 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.650
 let's say a humbly exclusive package 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.380
 she stands icon 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:51.130
 fiat 125 is also a very rare item icon. 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:57.550
 original and absolutely but also 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:02:00.740
 bumper vaz 2103 but unfortunately on 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:05.570
 sidelights and glass are already Russian 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.940
 not the USSR, at least until it is 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.670
 worsens the look further it will all be 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.380
 all the headlights are here as well 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:20.019
 what to do with the right examples this too 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.970
 will change and improve over time 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.530
 I have an apron in the front with the usual 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:35.299

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.190
 put in front all that is not 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.459

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.580

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.700
 help how many times have been so 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.360
 the situation is that 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:20.580
 mined fouled the wall also have 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.190
 export repeaters cost me but they 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.840
 already Russian speaks execution 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.990
 excuse with chrome substrates 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.470
 or rather with the Canadian version of the VAZ 21061 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:41.040
 or rather this whole car 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:45.090
 I have a VAZ 2106 10 1 I also have 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.090
 full chrome package on the doorstep all 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.230
 it is in perfect condition yes i will say one 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.270
 minus too people know the screws around the edges 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.280
 on the left side of the rocks I had from 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.920
 the inevitable 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.410
 on the screw to plant because with the right 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.250
 parties about the last owner how horrible 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.800
 welded it 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.680
 I didn’t have money for new welding 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:12.480
 so far so well hereafter 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:16.350
 krishito will handle my wheels 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.840
 6 ryzh do not stand with kopecks caps 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:26.970
 also as they are known 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:30.060
 but the 03 mirror mirrors I have 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.810
 durable this and the mirror is me 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.740
 collected from three mirrors 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.740
 pretty good 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:48.630
 so handles all the usual Zhigulevsk it 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:54.240
 everyone also knows a little decoration 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:56.040
 driver 2 sticker looks good so 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.770
 do they have a chrome grille stand on 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.470
 rear roof racks 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:05.810
 looks good at least i'm so 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:12.860
 I think the rear wheel is the same to me VAZ 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:16.800
 2106 pack 01 mud flaps comes home and 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:21.660
 have real tolyatti of 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.390
 flipped rook bumper also rear 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.090
 2103 but in the future requires replacement 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:32.310
 because what is chrome on it is not very 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:35.540
 best quality taillight housings 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.010
 iron original but glass 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.580
 Of course, I do n’t even know the brand 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:45.350
 illumined but also the bottom and sir this further too 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.720
 it will all change and improve 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.270
 I also have a label original VAZ 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:56.040
 2103 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:57.960
 Lada some also ask 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.190
 does this backlight work for me 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.230
 you can have seen the photos I held 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.580
 this highlight in this hole under 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:10.380
 parking lights 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:13.500
 but hid the wires thought also 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.240
 a little under the collective farm, he put the car 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.970
 tip 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.639
 is it chromeed on my opinion in 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:23.400
 principle looks good in principle 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:26.810
 it can always be removed if suddenly something 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.810
 I don't like it very much 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.120
 from this side also 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:47.830
 also wheels vaz 2103 cap sticker 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:50.680
 also chrome lattice too and just like 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.289
 the novel sternum made done in 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:58.840
 the USSR 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:07:01.780
 pretty interesting inscription attached 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.039
 the spirit of having a car from the past there 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:07.449
 let's say who does not understand knows but 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:10.740
 maybe someone will say that this is a collective farm 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:14.910
 but at least I like it 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:18.430
 by the way the novel sternum and and no longer 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:20.680
 on this side, in principle, everything is the same as 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.099
 wait as I said the only thing 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:27.990
 I will say that I have one disk 

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:33.970
 VAZ 2103 is this one here 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:36.280
 the holes are convex I don't know, I can see it 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:39.190
 noticed only after i overboard 

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:43.700
 wheel shaft that is a shame okay this 

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:48.260
 never mind mirrors vaz 2103 

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:51.650
 completely made the original all as 

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:55.670
 beautiful grits mudguards I have the most 

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:58.340
 ordinary of course bolts can not you 

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:01.640
 look at them painted black not so 

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.770
 will stand out at least when 

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.080
 the car will not drive at all 

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:11.360
 will be like an exhibition all fenders 

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:14.050
 I'll clean everything up and be so completely 

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.050
 original
