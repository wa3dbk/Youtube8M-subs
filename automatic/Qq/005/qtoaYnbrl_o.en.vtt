 always will and drink another video 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.270
 Good thing I was going to do the gameplay of 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.640

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.710
 show you why not yet 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.820
 made 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.560
 You can see here 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.390
 multiplayer is already connected to my 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.880
 account 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.370
 here all things appear by x-raid 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.510
 You know I can not because it 's just 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.359
 level 4 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.989
 Good guys, they only have what their uncle says. 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:41.769
 technical horizon and the lighthouse I 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.699
 medium 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:49.149
 're no longer has ways this is not good 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.859
 because they will want to give looking for the 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.179
 players 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.179
 the extinguisher player 

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:59.069
 Come on and it was good to see 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.600
 the fire extinguishers very very very much 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.600
 recently 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.130
 Good people, it's practically that 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.530
 happens 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.750
 already starting even if it starts you can 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.909
 choose your weapon and all but 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.180
 you can not play because it gives one 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.840
 error in the game and it returns to the menu 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.670
 initial of the galley so that's it 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.190

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:54.100

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:55.450
 tram is practically equal to the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.039
 others 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.899
 this time it was many people who found 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.679
 You can see they are all with the 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.440
 low level is level 11 only one guy 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.100

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.690

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:19.810

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:24.870

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.870
