00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
but this small swimbaits actually worked

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.810 
but this small swimbaits actually worked
pretty<00:02:44.660> fine<00:02:47.830> had<00:02:48.830> to<00:02:49.010> choose<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.520> small

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
pretty fine had to choose the small

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.270 
pretty fine had to choose the small
corner<00:02:50.360> of<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.600> lake<00:02:50.810> because<00:02:51.260> all<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:52.070> rest

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
corner of the lake because all the rest

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.340 
corner of the lake because all the rest
is<00:02:52.520> covered<00:02:52.940> with<00:02:52.970> leaves<00:02:53.390> you<00:02:53.690> won't<00:02:53.900> be<00:02:54.200> able

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
is covered with leaves you won't be able

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.420 
is covered with leaves you won't be able
to<00:02:54.650> see<00:02:54.950> anything<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:57.230> going<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:57.950> try<00:02:58.130> on<00:02:58.280> the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
to see anything so going to try on the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:07.950 
to see anything so going to try on the
next<00:02:58.460> one<00:02:59.650> so<00:03:00.650> small<00:03:01.010> parts<00:03:01.760> will<00:03:02.060> be

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.340 

not<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.830> easy<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.460> do<00:03:09.610> everything<00:03:10.030> with<00:03:10.960> only

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
not that easy to do everything with only

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:24.110 
not that easy to do everything with only
two<00:03:11.710> hands<00:03:12.280> actually<00:03:13.950> but<00:03:14.950> swim<00:03:15.400> 25<00:03:20.340> I'd<00:03:21.340> say

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
this is certainly resembling a small

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:44.360 
this is certainly resembling a small
tent<00:03:39.859> with<00:03:40.859> his<00:03:41.040> taint<00:03:41.430> pattern<00:03:43.159> let's<00:03:44.159> swim

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
tent with his taint pattern let's swim

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:53.890 
tent with his taint pattern let's swim
pretty<00:03:44.609> fine<00:03:48.349> all<00:03:49.349> right

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
yes the joint crankbait last plant and

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:04.899 
yes the joint crankbait last plant and
through<00:03:58.760> wire<00:04:02.049> it<00:04:03.049> 11<00:04:03.950> centimeters<00:04:04.340> in<00:04:04.879> length

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
through wire it 11 centimeters in length

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.679 
through wire it 11 centimeters in length
which<00:04:05.480> would<00:04:05.780> be<00:04:06.730> well<00:04:07.730> over<00:04:07.760> four<00:04:08.510> and<00:04:08.540> a<00:04:08.659> half

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:08.689 
which would be well over four and a half

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:13.179 
which would be well over four and a half
inches<00:04:10.000> about<00:04:11.000> four<00:04:11.359> and<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.540> half<00:04:11.569> inches<00:04:12.189> my

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:13.189 
inches about four and a half inches my

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:22.099 
inches about four and a half inches my
section<00:04:13.760> I'd<00:04:13.909> say<00:04:17.560> okay
