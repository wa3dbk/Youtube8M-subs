00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.919
 hello you she archi 09 and today we 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:11.960
 consider shemku supply up early in 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.960
 all probably such suppliers 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:20.970
 plutonium such basic there is such 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.150
 uranium feed may not be so straight 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.019
 but for such a survey they built here I 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.510
 also decided to construct the same pitch and at 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.790
 me feed to 90 synthesizers can her 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.770
 build as much as you have 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.879
 place allows you can build at least 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.399
 and there at 181 there at 300 I don't know which one 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.450
 the choice will feed u such uranium 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.000
 me for example here's a tank for how many 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.100
 modules for 20 modules by caught I still 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.449
 expanding it to me as you see 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.780
 limited but the bug works on 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.520
 excellent that is a lot of pluto 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.640
 produces since i still have a tank on 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.090
 clan type can and therefore plutonium me 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.729
 there probably every 2 minutes flies with 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.290
 20 particles I do not know what will be 40 but 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.200
 it will be generally tin 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.500
 so here it is the shooting itself 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.320
 location at location synthesizer 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:25.369
 you've already seen and under each synth 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.750
 we make a hole here and well holes 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.840
 which in which uranium will fall 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.820
 close the bulb uranium will not drop 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.090
 DAC bulb because under the bulb 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:41.549
 no block and so it is calm 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:46.110
 flies as you see here we see how 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.149
 uranium comes from the top floor to 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.770
 bottom that is in the piston are powered from 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.869
 trolleys and pushing uranium in the middle here 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.270
 just fell see he is not a drop 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:02.020
 all quietly flies by this shemku I 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.630
 I am considering because it will take a 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:12.280
 Hyde there is not really anywhere to build it 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:14.379
 only those who understand this i 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.569
 built on screen immediately confess 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:22.390
 Today, my scheme she already has many 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:27.299
 here we have a synthesizer like us 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:34.000
 need and let down 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:37.840
 pistons in one pillar ie one 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.569
 the point here I have a damn not he damazhil 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.849
 Here I have these pistons are pushed into 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.670
 the middle is all uranium but these are lower 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:50.319
 the pistons of the hour will show him they are pushing in 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:54.250
 one point along the way became the factory here they are 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:58.540
 pushed to one point and but one stop 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.510
 which enters the synthesis chamber here 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.730
 90 synthesizers are generally enough right 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.769
 with a head that is, I still have it in stock 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.310
 how much uranium do i have when built 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:15.040
 40 particles I will be calm 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:17.920
 uranium, here between the pillars of these 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.569
 now I will show between these pistons 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.220
 between these pillars you can 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.850
 place a light bulb or 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.319
 or let the plasma to uranium is not 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.910
 turned into 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:32.950
 in this stone but for some reason it 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.440
 will and myself turn into stone you would 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.870
 in general, and you probably will remove this stone 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:43.489
 therefore it is better to leave so 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:47.590
 that's all like looking again from 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:56.420
 trolleys all , everything is extended 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:59.150
 repeaters watch puts video 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.980
 Because I still have this video 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:06.019
 I did not see Malik at all 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.099
 I have not seen this video at all 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:15.049
 and therefore decided to share with you here 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:19.479
 look and do yourself the same with you 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.479
 was on harp 09 thank you all for your attention
