actually<00:01:50.960> quite<00:01:51.229> challenging<00:01:51.440> as<00:01:51.920> well<00:01:51.950> has

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
actually quite challenging as well has

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.410 
actually quite challenging as well has
to<00:01:52.340> be<00:01:52.430> said<00:01:52.640> though<00:01:52.850> this<00:01:52.970> will<00:01:53.090> take<00:01:53.270> some

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
to be said though this will take some

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.210 
to be said though this will take some
time<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.869> master<00:01:54.020> somebody's<00:01:54.860> new<00:01:55.009> rally

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
time to master somebody's new rally

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.889 
time to master somebody's new rally
section<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.180> will<00:01:56.300> need<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.509> get<00:01:56.630> used<00:01:56.780> to

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
section so you will need to get used to

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.749 
section so you will need to get used to
flying<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.229> card<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:57.800> then<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.159> video<00:01:58.399> cut

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.190 
flying the card and then the video cut
unfortunately<00:01:59.540> they'll<00:01:59.720> do<00:01:59.840> cut<00:02:00.020> in<00:02:00.110> the

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
unfortunately they'll do cut in the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.700 
unfortunately they'll do cut in the
video<00:02:00.409> there<00:02:00.710> so<00:02:00.979> I<00:02:01.670> started<00:02:02.330> again<00:02:02.710> camera

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
video there so I started again camera

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
space that we had available so this is

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.270 
space that we had available so this is
just<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.850> original<00:02:23.570> portugal<00:02:24.290> but<00:02:24.890> it's<00:02:25.040> been

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
just the original portugal but it's been
