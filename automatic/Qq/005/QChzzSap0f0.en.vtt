00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 in from enamel in 2010 right on the streets 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.390
 the capital formed a big black hole 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.400
 perfectly round shape 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.170
 but this abyss was not visible even with 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.010
 the helicopter that circled in place 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.950
 accidents 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.379
 pit diameter was as much as 20 meters 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.359
 the depth was 30 meters as in 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.920
 time reported by the authorities of Guatemala and on 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.439
 the place of the deep funnel stood 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.510
 a three-story garment factory which is not 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.960
 was the cause of the unusual 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.429
 holes and which completely went underground 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.590
 the police immediately cordoned off the perimeter 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.809
 so that none of the locals accidentally 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.790
 didn't hit a black hole after some 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.010
 time to the profit spot and geologists 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.989
 even scientists speculate what 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.329
 caused a hole like this 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.340
 sizes and even perfectly round shape 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.309
 it is worth mentioning that a similar incident 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.350
 already happened in this country in 2007 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.449
 literally a few kilometers from 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.670
 this place already had a similar abyss 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.340
 one of the geologists who worked at that time 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.230
 funnels suggested that everything 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.840
 the fault of the recently risen around the country 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.670
 tropical storm agate storm raging 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.680
 so much so that local old-timers 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.170
 they swore they had not seen such a harsh 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.210
 weather in the last 40 years is bad weather 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.700
 wiped out bridges and speed 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.890
 river roads overflowed and began 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.390
 flood the surrounding villages many 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.700
 regions of the country were left without 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.140
 electricity drinking water for a view 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.820
 monte rosso one of the workers 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.790
 ministries of emergency 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.770
 Guatemala reported that geophysical engineers 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.750
 fully confident that the appearance 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.270
 big black hole has nothing to do with 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.340
 by storm or earthquake which 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.920
 happen in these parts quite often 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.630
 nevertheless, almost all geologists 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.579
 agree that under the funnel 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.439
 is the so-called karst 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.240
 cavity appearance of a huge crater 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.729
 provoked a massive relocation 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.220
 local residents other areas of the country 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.189
 people blame local authorities for everything 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.550
 promised and sewer system which 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.770
 required urgent replacement 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.990
 already for at least 10 years 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.760
 a couple of days after the appearance of a hole in 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.300
 watts Malu arrived and several famous 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.010
 ufologists who with great curiosity 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.630
 considered an unusual pit to question 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.570
 if they could find any traces 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.910
 extraterrestrial participle to this occasion they 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.950
 didn't answer that all thanks for
