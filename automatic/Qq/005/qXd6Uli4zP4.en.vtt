00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
in the tank just did an easy triple with

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.919 
in the tank just did an easy triple with
100<00:00:11.490> kilos<00:00:11.820> two<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.150> twenty<00:00:12.360> pounds<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:12.809> now

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
100 kilos two and twenty pounds and now

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.279 
100 kilos two and twenty pounds and now
it's<00:00:13.080> 106<00:00:13.740> kilos<00:00:14.099> also<00:00:14.940> four<00:00:15.089> triples<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:15.630> I

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
it's 106 kilos also four triples so I

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.200 
it's 106 kilos also four triples so I
hope<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.100> won't<00:00:17.490> be<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.699> 9rp<00:00:19.820> from<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.910> second

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
hope it won't be a 9rp from the second

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.080 
hope it won't be a 9rp from the second
set<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:21.720> hope<00:00:22.590> it's<00:00:23.189> gonna<00:00:23.369> be<00:00:23.519> somewhere<00:00:23.939> in

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
set so hope it's gonna be somewhere in

00:00:24.090 --> 00:01:16.230 
set so hope it's gonna be somewhere in
the<00:00:24.539> low<00:00:24.689> 1/10<00:00:25.230> kilo<00:00:25.920> city<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.660> we'll<00:00:27.660> see

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.680 

okay<00:01:17.240> you<00:01:17.299> just<00:01:17.420> saw<00:01:17.840> me<00:01:17.990> do<00:01:18.369> 110<00:01:19.369> kilos<00:01:19.700> for<00:01:20.659> a

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
okay you just saw me do 110 kilos for a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.920 
okay you just saw me do 110 kilos for a
triple<00:01:20.960> it<00:01:21.649> was<00:01:21.830> about<00:01:22.009> a<00:01:22.250> nine<00:01:22.399> RPE<00:01:22.930> expected

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
triple it was about a nine RPE expected

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.070 
triple it was about a nine RPE expected
a<00:01:23.960> little<00:01:24.080> bit<00:01:24.320> more<00:01:24.530> but<00:01:25.539> every<00:01:26.539> day<00:01:26.929> is<00:01:27.050> a

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
a little bit more but every day is a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.710 
a little bit more but every day is a
different<00:01:27.229> day<00:01:27.470> so<00:01:27.759> what<00:01:28.759> I'm<00:01:28.909> doing<00:01:29.420> right

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
different day so what I'm doing right

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.680 
different day so what I'm doing right
now<00:01:29.929> is<00:01:30.130> decrease<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.369> wait<00:01:31.550> so<00:01:31.940> I<00:01:31.970> decrease

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
now is decrease to wait so I decrease

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.270 
now is decrease to wait so I decrease
the<00:01:32.840> way<00:01:32.960> to<00:01:33.020> about<00:01:33.350> what<00:01:33.920> is<00:01:34.009> it<00:01:34.100> about

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
the way to about what is it about

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.410 
the way to about what is it about
exactly<00:01:35.210> 105<00:01:36.020> kilos<00:01:36.380> it's<00:01:37.069> about<00:01:37.280> four<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:38.360> a

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
exactly 105 kilos it's about four and a

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.080 
exactly 105 kilos it's about four and a
half<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.690> five<00:01:38.869> percent<00:01:39.020> drop<00:01:39.470> in<00:01:39.500> weight<00:01:40.090> and

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
half to five percent drop in weight and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.820 
half to five percent drop in weight and
I'm<00:01:41.210> gonna<00:01:41.420> continue<00:01:41.780> doing<00:01:42.170> triples<00:01:42.560> with

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
I'm gonna continue doing triples with

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.249 
I'm gonna continue doing triples with
105<00:01:43.750> until<00:01:44.750> it<00:01:44.840> also<00:01:45.190> becomes<00:01:46.190> a<00:01:46.399> nine<00:01:46.670> RPE<00:01:47.259> my

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
105 until it also becomes a nine RPE my

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.320 
105 until it also becomes a nine RPE my
first<00:01:48.530> back<00:01:48.770> down<00:01:48.950> set<00:01:49.220> will<00:01:49.520> probably<00:01:50.000> be

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
first back down set will probably be

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.910 
first back down set will probably be
somewhere<00:01:50.750> around<00:01:50.869> eight<00:01:51.289> to<00:01:51.560> eight<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:51.890> a

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
somewhere around eight to eight and a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.749 
somewhere around eight to eight and a
half<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.759> I'll<00:01:52.880> keep<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.119> rest<00:01:53.569> in<00:01:53.929> between

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
half and I'll keep the rest in between

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.730 
half and I'll keep the rest in between
consistent<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.450> between<00:01:56.899> two<00:01:57.319> and<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.500> half<00:01:57.619> to

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
consistent so between two and a half to

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.060 
consistent so between two and a half to
three<00:01:57.770> minutes<00:01:58.600> otherwise<00:01:59.740> this<00:02:00.740> doesn't

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
three minutes otherwise this doesn't

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.459 
three minutes otherwise this doesn't
work<00:02:01.219> the<00:02:01.369> system<00:02:01.579> so<00:02:01.969> first<00:02:02.840> back<00:02:03.020> down<00:02:03.200> set

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
work the system so first back down set

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:04.859 
work the system so first back down set
with<00:02:03.649> a<00:02:03.680> hundred<00:02:04.009> and<00:02:04.100> five<00:02:04.250> for<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.549> triple
