00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.630
 hello - how are we good at this 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.370
 I bring you a tweet that has 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.830
 called quite the attention and it's called 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:23.360
 message boss with this tweet we are going to 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.580
 to have a little experience in 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.650
 the facebook chats what do I mean 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.259
 many of you should know what it does 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.290
 some time facebook had a 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.750
 update and presented what is 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.820
 facebook home on android devices 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.370
 good now is so likely price that 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.110
 it's only on three android devices and 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.570
 well what it is that makes us create a 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.550
 interface where we can interact 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.800
 directly with facebook without need 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.600
 to open the good application with the 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.660
 update that had facebook on ios 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.570
 they give us the chats they modify us with 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.390
 small bubbles that 's something that a 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.790
 many liked it good now with this 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.830
 tweet we will be able to have those chats in 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.290
 any part of our sprint board 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.100
 We can see 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.610
 if we open any application follow us 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.520
 keeping the tweets or hear us 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.140
 keeping the chat that as well as 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.780
 I say many have liked and has 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.840
 seemed like an excellent idea the chats 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.770
 are 100% functional we can start 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.960
 open and the chats are 100% functional 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.550
 it is something very very very very good and 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.200
 good what is happening or what is it that 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.370
 is intended to do with this tweet with 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.729
 this type is intended to give a 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.259
 experience what is facebook com 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.619
 well where do we download it how 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.160
 we download we simply have to 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.320
 enter like this dayz and look for messages books 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.240
 this tweet is free in the network to be able 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.790
 So we do not have to add 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.460
 no network for what is the bad point 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.000
 from this good click the bad point is that 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.640
 if we close in multitasking see me I have 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.790
 enough applications now open 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.460
 and we are going to close 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.619
 directly on pages does not work 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.700
 only works directly with the 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:17.250
 facebook application so good today 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.250
 so good we close 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.610
 and what is ours disappears 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.130
 messages what is the chat we will have to 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.530
 enter facebook again and then for 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.480
 get there for this to happen 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.940
 always active we have to have the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.110
 facebook application always in the 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.150
 multitasking ok we can not close it because 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.500
 the messages will be deleted good not the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.540
 messages and not the bubbles ok 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.930
 the bubbles will disappear from there in 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.670
 out everything is 100% functional the truth 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.250
 which is a pretty good click and if you 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.350

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.700
