00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
bigger size although the blade is

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.050 
bigger size although the blade is

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
I know of and yeah so both shower blades

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.750 
I know of and yeah so both shower blades
and<00:02:32.200> Bosch<00:02:32.380> are<00:02:32.560> pop<00:02:32.830> it's<00:02:33.010> only<00:02:33.190> really<00:02:33.489> go

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
and Bosch are pop it's only really go

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.970 
and Bosch are pop it's only really go
with<00:02:34.030> each<00:02:34.600> other<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.290> yeah<00:02:35.500> that's<00:02:35.769> that's

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
with each other so yeah that's that's

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.479 
with each other so yeah that's that's
the<00:02:36.160> foot<00:02:36.340> pocket<00:02:36.810> moving<00:02:37.810> on<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.019> the<00:02:38.140> blade

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
the foot pocket moving on to the blade

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.100 
the foot pocket moving on to the blade
now<00:02:40.260> dimensionally<00:02:41.260> speaking<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.970> blade<00:02:43.750> is

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
now dimensionally speaking this blade is

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.270 
now dimensionally speaking this blade is
the<00:02:44.820> same<00:02:45.820> size<00:02:46.269> as<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:47.650> standard

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
the same size as the standard

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.050 
the same size as the standard

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
thermoplastic blade like the competition

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.430 
thermoplastic blade like the competition
played<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.829> sport<00:02:54.070> played

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
played the sport played

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.760 
played the sport played
same<00:02:57.440> with<00:02:57.680> however<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:59.770> thermoplastic

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
same with however the thermoplastic

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.490 
same with however the thermoplastic
blades<00:03:01.010> at<00:03:01.310> this<00:03:01.970> stage<00:03:02.180> do<00:03:02.870> not<00:03:03.050> have<00:03:03.290> this

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
blades at this stage do not have this

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.610 
blades at this stage do not have this
little<00:03:04.660> rubber<00:03:05.660> fin<00:03:05.960> here<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:07.550> this<00:03:07.760> is<00:03:07.910> a

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
little rubber fin here and this is a

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.980 
little rubber fin here and this is a
adaptation<00:03:09.620> from<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:09.980> earlier<00:03:10.250> model<00:03:10.580> of<00:03:10.990> the

adaptation from the earlier model of the
carbon<00:03:12.350> blades<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.890> earlier<00:03:13.190> model<00:03:13.550> although

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
carbon blades the earlier model although

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.330 
carbon blades the earlier model although
it<00:03:14.480> did<00:03:14.600> have<00:03:14.630> a<00:03:14.780> rubber<00:03:15.020> edge<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.560> protect<00:03:16.040> the

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
it did have a rubber edge to protect the

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.060 
it did have a rubber edge to protect the
blade<00:03:17.000> that<00:03:17.540> didn't<00:03:17.840> have<00:03:17.960> these<00:03:18.050> little<00:03:18.260> sins

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
blade that didn't have these little sins

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.150 
blade that didn't have these little sins
here<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:19.550> now<00:03:19.640> these<00:03:19.820> fins<00:03:20.120> have<00:03:20.900> been<00:03:21.080> put<00:03:22.070> on

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
here and now these fins have been put on

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.270 
here and now these fins have been put on
this<00:03:22.310> thing<00:03:22.570> too<00:03:23.570> or<00:03:24.110> put<00:03:24.530> on<00:03:24.590> this<00:03:24.680> blade<00:03:24.950> to

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
this thing too or put on this blade to

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.200 
this thing too or put on this blade to
improve<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:27.400> driving<00:03:28.400> force<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.150> the

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
improve the the driving force of the

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.020 
improve the the driving force of the
water<00:03:29.480> into<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:29.960> region<00:03:30.560> so<00:03:31.490> instead<00:03:31.790> of<00:03:31.850> the

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
water into the region so instead of the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.630 
water into the region so instead of the
water<00:03:32.150> just<00:03:32.920> pulling<00:03:33.920> off<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.130> side<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.580> the

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
blade these little runners here sort of

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.150 
blade these little runners here sort of
encourage<00:03:38.390> that<00:03:38.540> water<00:03:38.810> to<00:03:39.560> go<00:03:39.710> that

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
encourage that water to go that

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.400 
encourage that water to go that
direction<00:03:40.310> giving<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.120> more<00:03:41.360> thrust<00:03:41.660> for<00:03:42.290> it

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
direction giving you more thrust for it

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.030 
direction giving you more thrust for it
and<00:03:42.680> I<00:03:43.280> have<00:03:43.610> tried<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.660> early<00:03:44.990> model<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.980> just

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
and I have tried the early model it just

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.520 
and I have tried the early model it just
feels<00:03:46.430> a<00:03:46.580> little<00:03:46.610> bit<00:03:46.840> more<00:03:47.840> power<00:03:48.110> coming

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
feels a little bit more power coming

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.880 
feels a little bit more power coming
from<00:03:48.680> these<00:03:48.860> fins<00:03:49.220> for<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:49.790> same<00:03:50.000> amount<00:03:50.240> of

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
from these fins for the same amount of

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.870 
from these fins for the same amount of
noise<00:03:52.210> noise<00:03:53.210> I<00:03:53.690> would<00:03:54.140> say<00:03:54.620> pretty<00:03:55.340> much<00:03:55.460> as

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
noise noise I would say pretty much as

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.570 
noise noise I would say pretty much as
quiet<00:03:56.300> as<00:03:56.660> a<00:03:56.690> plastic<00:03:57.560> blade<00:03:57.770> I<00:03:58.750> have<00:03:59.750> had<00:04:00.020> some

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
quiet as a plastic blade I have had some

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.580 
quiet as a plastic blade I have had some
composite<00:04:01.580> blades<00:04:01.850> which<00:04:02.540> admittedly<00:04:03.050> did

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
composite blades which admittedly did

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.180 
composite blades which admittedly did
not<00:04:03.770> have<00:04:04.010> that<00:04:04.040> little<00:04:05.350> angle<00:04:06.350> in<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.590> ankle

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
not have that little angle in the ankle

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.449 
not have that little angle in the ankle
there<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:07.550> their<00:04:07.700> heel<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:09.590> they<00:04:10.070> were<00:04:10.130> very

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
there and their heel and they were very

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.280 
there and their heel and they were very
noisy<00:04:10.670> just<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.270> nature<00:04:11.480> of<00:04:11.630> how<00:04:11.720> those<00:04:12.020> fins

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
noisy just the nature of how those fins

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.199 
noisy just the nature of how those fins
whipped<00:04:12.620> in<00:04:12.740> the<00:04:12.830> water<00:04:12.980> this<00:04:13.700> one<00:04:13.940> is<00:04:14.090> not

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
whipped in the water this one is not

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.659 
whipped in the water this one is not
like<00:04:14.360> that<00:04:14.420> all<00:04:14.780> these<00:04:14.990> are<00:04:15.260> yeah<00:04:16.220> like<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.520> say

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
like that all these are yeah like I say

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.159 
like that all these are yeah like I say
as<00:04:16.790> quite<00:04:17.060> as<00:04:17.209> a<00:04:17.239> blessed<00:04:17.630> blade<00:04:18.850> weight

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
as quite as a blessed blade weight

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.620 
as quite as a blessed blade weight
weight<00:04:21.169> is<00:04:21.350> good<00:04:21.560> weight<00:04:21.919> is<00:04:22.100> minimal<00:04:22.940> these

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
weight is good weight is minimal these

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.740 
weight is good weight is minimal these
guys<00:04:24.230> in<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.620> water<00:04:24.800> I<00:04:25.210> would<00:04:26.210> still<00:04:26.480> say<00:04:26.720> that

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
guys in the water I would still say that

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.090 
guys in the water I would still say that
there<00:04:27.140> are<00:04:27.230> friction<00:04:27.620> heavier<00:04:27.890> than<00:04:28.070> a

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
there are friction heavier than a

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.340 
there are friction heavier than a
plastic<00:04:28.370> blade<00:04:29.200> but<00:04:30.340> definitely<00:04:31.340> not<00:04:32.169> does<00:04:33.169> he

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350

in<00:04:56.140> the<00:04:56.290> past<00:04:56.560> I've<00:04:56.890> used<00:04:56.920> a<00:04:57.550> plastic<00:04:58.240> blade

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
in the past I've used a plastic blade

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.880 
in the past I've used a plastic blade
although<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:00.850> plastic<00:05:01.390> blade<00:05:01.600> like<00:05:02.470> for

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
although a plastic blade like for

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.330 
although a plastic blade like for
example<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:04.770> competition<00:05:05.770> blade<00:05:05.980> that<00:05:06.160> goes

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
example the competition blade that goes

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.710 
example the competition blade that goes
in<00:05:06.520> here<00:05:07.320> it<00:05:08.320> is<00:05:08.500> a<00:05:08.530> perfectly<00:05:08.980> fine<00:05:09.070> blade<00:05:09.720> but

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
in here it is a perfectly fine blade but

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.210 
in here it is a perfectly fine blade but
you<00:05:10.900> do<00:05:11.050> find<00:05:11.350> in<00:05:11.710> your<00:05:11.950> kick<00:05:12.130> stroke<00:05:12.460> that

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
you do find in your kick stroke that

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.940 
you do find in your kick stroke that
there's<00:05:15.220> a<00:05:15.360> sort<00:05:16.360> of<00:05:16.420> a<00:05:16.600> sweet<00:05:17.230> spot<00:05:17.440> with<00:05:17.920> a

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
there's a sort of a sweet spot with a

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.980 
there's a sort of a sweet spot with a
blade<00:05:18.580> that's<00:05:18.820> really<00:05:19.150> pushing<00:05:19.390> out<00:05:19.840> its

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
blade that's really pushing out its

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.910 
blade that's really pushing out its
power<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:21.250> it's<00:05:21.550> kind<00:05:21.790> of<00:05:21.850> right<00:05:22.060> on<00:05:22.120> that

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
power and it's kind of right on that

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.260 
power and it's kind of right on that
when<00:05:23.920> you're<00:05:24.040> putting<00:05:24.250> your<00:05:24.610> most<00:05:24.970> effort

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
when you're putting your most effort

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.830 
when you're putting your most effort
into<00:05:25.480> the<00:05:25.600> stroke<00:05:25.870> you<00:05:26.590> feel<00:05:26.830> real<00:05:27.340> forward

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
into the stroke you feel real forward

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.430 
into the stroke you feel real forward
driving<00:05:28.840> things<00:05:30.990> but<00:05:31.990> then<00:05:32.110> as<00:05:32.260> soon<00:05:32.290> as

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
driving things but then as soon as

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.920 
driving things but then as soon as
you're<00:05:32.620> switching<00:05:32.950> over<00:05:33.370> your<00:05:33.520> blades

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
you're switching over your blades

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.150 
you're switching over your blades
there's<00:05:34.930> a<00:05:34.960> bit<00:05:35.110> of<00:05:35.170> a<00:05:35.230> dead<00:05:35.440> spot<00:05:35.680> there<00:05:35.950> where

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
there's a bit of a dead spot there where

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.430 
there's a bit of a dead spot there where
they're<00:05:37.060> not<00:05:37.210> pushing<00:05:37.450> you<00:05:37.690> forward<00:05:37.930> as<00:05:38.200> well

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
they're not pushing you forward as well

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.100 
they're not pushing you forward as well
and<00:05:38.920> that's<00:05:39.880> where<00:05:40.180> these<00:05:40.420> really<00:05:40.900> pay<00:05:41.080> off

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
and that's where these really pay off

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.620 
and that's where these really pay off
it's<00:05:41.890> a<00:05:41.980> very<00:05:42.340> constant<00:05:42.850> power<00:05:43.210> all<00:05:43.990> the<00:05:44.470> time

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
it's a very constant power all the time

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.820 
it's a very constant power all the time
that<00:05:46.630> is<00:05:46.810> a<00:05:46.900> very<00:05:47.110> good<00:05:47.230> thing<00:05:47.410> about<00:05:47.530> these

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
that is a very good thing about these

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.670 
that is a very good thing about these
things<00:05:48.100> I've<00:05:48.570> used<00:05:49.570> a<00:05:49.720> plastic<00:05:49.900> version<00:05:50.470> I

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
things I've used a plastic version I

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.390 
things I've used a plastic version I
have<00:05:51.100> used<00:05:51.700> other<00:05:52.390> composite<00:05:52.990> blades<00:05:53.230> and<00:05:54.130> I

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
have used other composite blades and I

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.690 
have used other composite blades and I
definitely<00:05:54.580> find<00:05:54.940> out<00:05:55.120> this<00:05:55.270> one<00:05:56.670> after<00:05:57.670> a

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
definitely find out this one after a

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.320 
definitely find out this one after a
full<00:05:57.940> day's<00:05:58.120> diving<00:05:58.630> you<00:05:59.350> are<00:05:59.500> still<00:05:59.770> tired

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
full day's diving you are still tired

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:06.240 
full day's diving you are still tired
but<00:06:01.330> the<00:06:01.720> legs<00:06:01.930> feel<00:06:02.200> a<00:06:02.230> lot<00:06:02.410> better<00:06:02.560> and<00:06:05.130> and<00:06:06.130> I

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
but the legs feel a lot better and and I

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.330 
but the legs feel a lot better and and I
think<00:06:06.720> as<00:06:07.720> much<00:06:07.960> as<00:06:08.140> we<00:06:08.320> all<00:06:08.470> are<00:06:08.500> looking<00:06:09.010> for
