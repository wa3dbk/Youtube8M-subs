00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 who like me is fan of meaning my song 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.680
 the exchange concert knows the 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.590
 problematic that just not all songs 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.559
 on the cd on it you can buy 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.870
 but that is actually half 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.029
 or more than half is missing from this 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.010
 reason I thought I'll work out 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.109
 a cd concept for the record label what 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.150
 he brings out the cd and hope that it will 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.160
 Maybe in the next one 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.650
 stick to it or even to the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.350
 Idea come and say hey the last 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.880
 he two stagger and the second 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.920
 we can do this after all 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.079
 cd rausbringen concept as the like 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.670
 current concept or song 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.370
 release concept of the broadcast 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.520
 is virtually the spectator 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.969
 this animates itself illegally 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.070
 the songs somewhere else to 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.510
 procure of people that because there 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.510
 have somehow recorded and then 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.460
 yes, somewhere the audio upload and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.460
 for that the music industry is always around 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.720
 It is noted that I would 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.380
 practically with his behavior the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.509
 People are animated to be illegal around 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.759
 to get a shot but okay like 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.970
 would have the fund concept or season 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.759
 Release cd concept look 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.680
 what you drive here is of course completely 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.020
 easy to calculate as for songs 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.570
 ultimately have to come out 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.520
 It should be seven different 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.040
 always one artist 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.770
 get evening and finally there's 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.400
 again a final where then duette 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:46.079
 seven times 18 whole ones are made 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:49.020
 56 songs on the album of the current 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.020
 season are whole 29 songs on it 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.170
 two of them a sleep song version of 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.290
 the catterfeld are the actually 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.040
 not yet heard on tv 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.020
 and there is a star version of that 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.170
 on us so the football song from 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.459
 bourani, what is it? 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.020
 not heard 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.770
 maybe they are playing that in there 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.230
 final 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:19.470
 So there are actually 29 or 28 missing 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.750
 So one really ought to have one 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.490
 more double CD rausbringen so you 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.990
 he already has the one double cd and the 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.390
 remaining missing songs captain on 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.480
 another double cd or you could have 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.520
 equal to a 4 cd box brought out so 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.940
 Two possible concepts become one 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.220
 4 cd box or two of two cd boxes 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.350
 ready now personally but not so 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.410
 great because on the one hand this creates a 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.530
 relatively high price with a 4 cd box 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.240
 on the other side it is like that 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.970
 Maybe one or the other would like to 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.670
 others also the normal original version 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.200
 they do not have that yet 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.510
 maybe it would not be that wrong 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.660
 you would say hey we bring pro 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.420
 evening out a cd what he's the seven 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:08.370
 songs would again plus seven songs 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.320
 the original would be 14 songs 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.630
 depending on what you say 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.850
 sung song therefore not as well 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.440
 his 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.130
 are they so 13 years apart, so to speak 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.010
 later a little bit different version 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:26.280
 at the exchange concert plus then stop 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.040
 the duett thing becomes 14 resp 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.370
 15 songs that you release as cd 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.740
 could be so practically from the 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.530
 number actually an album resp 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.270
 a little short sampler one could 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.740
 maybe say and if that 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.620
 become a bit smarter 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.020
 they would say that you are quite a few 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.230
 old hams are on and bare 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.060
 actually 79 10 euro per cd 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.940
 Of course you could say that 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.950
 hey why physical cd is yes that takes 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.370
 more and more and something is enough 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.470
 actually as a download compilation long 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.630
 every evening as a single download 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.600
 compilation with just as already said 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:10.650
 the corresponding covers the original 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:14.220
 plus the duet and of course 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.470
 the new idea or your own 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.200
 senses of the respective artist of the 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.480
 in the evening and these seven different ones 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.910
 Evenings could be practically useful 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.390
 as a complete thing as a fortune 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.220
 noble variant offer with small 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.680
 maybe after or maybe there are 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.770
 yes, these crazy boxes 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.540
 this special limited editions and what 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.340
 once there were what I so 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.890
 curious such there as any 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.130
 Glasses or what do I know what else 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.180
 say something for the collectors and me 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.220
 think that would be essential 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.850
 The concept always makes more sense 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.670
 so to speak, the items of the evenings 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.260
 now only as download offers and 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.190
 Maybe we'll say okay now 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.470
 also for 40 euros a 4 cd variant 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.960
 and then that's what we say 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.730
 Do not want to disappoint the fan 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.370
 because like it is right now 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.500
 is driven with the cd variant is 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.620
 actually so many of course already 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.080
 in advance to put the cd because he 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.120
 just the favorite artist is there 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.630
 at the season one said oneself silly 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.940
 everything 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:25.110
 yes and then you look at it and 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.420
 after and think that was awesome 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:32.180
 as everything on the cd was so 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:34.380
 example will be his xavier naidoo kw 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.780
 Nice man named camera so by him 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.060
 maybe so far I would have been terrific 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.140
 like that there is neither as 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.090
 single download somewhere to buy 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.500
 it is still on the cd or son 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.820
 that shit and that's you 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.930
 actually have to say so actually 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.760
 Every buyer of the CD practically convenient 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.030
 Basically disappointed, especially since they the 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.580
 Mass of it because of certain songs 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.750
 are missing the favorite artist or something 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.500
 a coverversion and many people the 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.560
 have said themselves 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:10.800
 I want to have the hot things there 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.900
 I would ask now buy the album 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.260
 the pageants are not exactly those 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.390
 it 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.680
 the tÃ¼v the shit not the others 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.600
 I did not think they were that different 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.360
 said here is once again typical of 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:24.480
 case that the music industry completely on 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.220
 Produced by customers and it stops 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.930
 rather more is probably more about that 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.470
 somehow a certain profit too 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.060
 achieve 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.950
 because otherwise this nonsense can be 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:37.990
 I do not even explain my as 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:39.820
 normal music listener or as a fan of one 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.000
 certain formats or specific 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.860
 thing you say hey I would 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.870
 I have everything I need that I need it 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:51.040
 I love everything and this and that gives 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.960
 enough fans are on it and the 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.840
 disappointingly easy reason with it 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.180
 and with that I spend a lot of fans and 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.980
 Of course, I also say fans that you 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.570
 This shit makes it that I think 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.400
 yes I want to puke these songs 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.200
 I should and should remain the people 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.570
 no other choice than the 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.670
 to raise illegally because it is up 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:12.160
 the other way does not exist and that 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:14.830
 is just plain shit so 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.050
 dear record company that would be my cd 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.390
 release concept or more 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.590
 proposals 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:24.100
 think about what he will take over 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.900
 You may or may not want it on everyone 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.180
 case I would recommend such a 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.669
 Variant to make that one the fans 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:33.190
 not disappointed and not against yourself 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:34.900
 because then they will 

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.720
 At some point in principle just not 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.340
 Buy the cd more but say yourself 

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.320
 I charge anyway everything was illegal I know 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.419
 anyway, not what's there for songs 

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.919
 on it are the good ones but only the ones 

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:47.200
 shit I do not want that 

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:49.900
 I only load what I like anyway 

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:54.060
 illegal and of course that's clear 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:54.060
 I make such losses
