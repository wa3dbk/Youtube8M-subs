oriole okay so what I did was I cut out

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.139 
oriole okay so what I did was I cut out
a<00:00:38.640> shield<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> piece<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.230> poster<00:00:40.620> board<00:00:41.149> like

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
a shield on a piece of poster board like

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.959 
a shield on a piece of poster board like
this<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.510> 22<00:00:42.930> inches<00:00:42.960> wide<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.040> 60<00:00:44.399> 26

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
this it's 22 inches wide and 60 26

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.760 
this it's 22 inches wide and 60 26
inches<00:00:45.270> tall<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.200> can<00:00:46.350> cut<00:00:46.530> something

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
inches tall and you can cut something

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.889 
inches tall and you can cut something
like<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.039> out<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.910> get<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> shape<00:00:48.360> about<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
like this out to get the shape about the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.959 
like this out to get the shape about the
way<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.079> want<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.010> too<00:00:50.160> hard<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.579> I

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
way you want it it's not too hard and I

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.020 
way you want it it's not too hard and I
use<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.660> make<00:00:51.809> two<00:00:52.050> copies<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:53.030> cardboard

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
use that to make two copies on cardboard

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.830 
use that to make two copies on cardboard
you<00:00:54.539> could<00:00:54.660> use<00:00:54.780> cardboard<00:00:55.079> or<00:00:55.379> foam<00:00:55.410> board

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
you could use cardboard or foam board

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.970 
you could use cardboard or foam board
but<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.899> wanted<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.199> be<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.379> same<00:00:58.530> size<00:00:58.770> so

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
but you wanted to be the same size so

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.080 
but you wanted to be the same size so
that's<00:00:59.160> why<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> made<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> template<00:00:59.850> first

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
that's why I made the template first

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.689 
that's why I made the template first
maybe<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> template<00:01:01.620> trace<00:01:02.100> out<00:01:02.280> two<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.489> them

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
maybe the template trace out two of them

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.929 
maybe the template trace out two of them
and<00:01:02.850> one<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.510> those<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.530> we've<00:01:04.739> traced<00:01:05.670> out

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
and one of those that we've traced out

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.090 
and one of those that we've traced out
just<00:01:06.659> cut<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.960> out<00:01:07.049> because<00:01:07.560> that'll<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
just cut it out because that'll be the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.179 
just cut it out because that'll be the
shield<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.200> will<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.439> printing<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:10.950> blue

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
shield and I will be printing this blue

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.440 
shield and I will be printing this blue

and as you can see now it's starting to

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.450 
and as you can see now it's starting to
understand<00:01:42.660> it<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:43.530> will<00:01:43.680> actually<00:01:43.890> glue<00:01:44.280> all

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
understand it we will actually glue all

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.600 
understand it we will actually glue all
of<00:01:44.550> these<00:01:44.670> pieces<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:45.690> shield<00:01:45.930> itself

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
of these pieces on to the shield itself

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:53.570 
of these pieces on to the shield itself
just<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.830> looking<00:01:49.830> good<00:01:52.370> so<00:01:53.370> now<00:01:53.520> we

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
just like this looking good so now we

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.620 
just like this looking good so now we
want<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> little<00:01:54.030> bit<00:01:54.120> of<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> curve<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
want a little bit of a curve in the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.330 
want a little bit of a curve in the
shield<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.050> is<00:01:55.200> optional<00:01:55.680> but<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.220> is

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
shield and this is optional but this is

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.730 
shield and this is optional but this is
what<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.520> did<00:01:56.730> I<00:01:56.760> cut<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.000> piece<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.360> this

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
what I did I cut a piece like this

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.250 
what I did I cut a piece like this
that's<00:01:58.740> on<00:01:58.920> 18<00:01:59.280> inches<00:01:59.600> across<00:02:00.600> from<00:02:01.050> side<00:02:01.200> to

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
that's on 18 inches across from side to

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.860 
that's on 18 inches across from side to
side<00:02:01.350> there<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.890> 10<00:02:02.370> inches<00:02:02.640> tall<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.360> then

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
side there and 10 inches tall and then

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.080 
side there and 10 inches tall and then
when<00:02:04.050> you<00:02:04.140> do<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:04.620> and<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.040> glue<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.340> you

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
when you do this and you glue it you

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.450 
when you do this and you glue it you
just<00:02:06.300> bow<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.660> shield<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:07.650> little<00:02:07.980> bit<00:02:08.190> and

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
just bow the shield a little bit and

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.300 
just bow the shield a little bit and
then<00:02:08.910> glue<00:02:09.600> it<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:09.810> place<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.350> then<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.100> bot

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
then glue it in place and then that bot

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.360 
then glue it in place and then that bot
that<00:02:11.550> bow<00:02:11.730> will<00:02:12.030> stay<00:02:12.600> I<00:02:12.870> mean<00:02:13.830> it's<00:02:13.950> optional

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
that bow will stay I mean it's optional

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
that bow will stay I mean it's optional
but<00:02:14.490> it's<00:02:14.670> nice<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.970> have<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> little<00:02:15.270> bit<00:02:15.330> of

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
but it's nice to have a little bit of

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.490 
but it's nice to have a little bit of
curve<00:02:15.630> in<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.810> shield<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.200> makes<00:02:16.260> a

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
curve in that shield that makes a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.490 
curve in that shield that makes a
difference<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.660> fact<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:18.990> piece<00:02:19.290> is

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
difference so in fact that piece is

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.700 
difference so in fact that piece is
pulling<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.220> shield<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:22.080> bow<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.440> just<00:02:22.620> a

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
pulling the shield to bow it just a

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.590 
pulling the shield to bow it just a
little<00:02:22.860> bit<00:02:22.980> glued<00:02:23.640> in<00:02:23.760> place<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.120> pocket

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
little bit glued in place to a pocket

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.590 
little bit glued in place to a pocket
now<00:02:25.380> couple<00:02:25.920> pieces<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.220> rope<00:02:26.460> and<00:02:26.700> some

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
now couple pieces of rope and some

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.420 
now couple pieces of rope and some
electrical<00:02:28.470> tape<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.580> made<00:02:29.760> my<00:02:30.140> handles

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
electrical tape and I made my handles

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.650 
electrical tape and I made my handles
one<00:02:32.430> handle<00:02:32.760> should<00:02:32.880> be<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.000> little<00:02:33.240> bit<00:02:33.360> more

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
one handle should be a little bit more

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.120 
one handle should be a little bit more
open<00:02:33.990> than<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.230> other<00:02:34.350> because<00:02:34.920> you're<00:02:35.040> going

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
open than the other because you're going

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.990 
open than the other because you're going
to<00:02:35.190> put<00:02:35.340> your<00:02:35.550> arm<00:02:36.510> through<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:37.760> your<00:02:38.760> arm

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
to put your arm through that your arm

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.160 
to put your arm through that your arm
has<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.180> fit<00:02:39.420> through<00:02:39.540> one<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:39.930> then<00:02:40.050> your

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
has to fit through one and then your

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.780 
has to fit through one and then your
hand<00:02:40.440> grasps<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.070> other<00:02:41.190> one<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.490> I'll<00:02:41.760> show

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
hand grasps the other one and I'll show

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.260 
hand grasps the other one and I'll show
you<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.330> sec<00:02:43.790> so<00:02:44.790> just<00:02:44.970> improvise

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
you that in a sec so just improvise

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.640 
you that in a sec so just improvise
anything<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.690> can<00:02:45.810> even<00:02:45.930> put<00:02:46.320> a<00:02:46.350> couple<00:02:46.560> of

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
anything you can even put a couple of

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
anything you can even put a couple of
strips<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:46.890> card<00:02:47.070> but<00:02:47.220> if<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.370> want<00:02:47.520> it<00:02:47.580> but

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
strips of card but if you want it but

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.920 
strips of card but if you want it but
see<00:02:47.850> one's<00:02:48.270> a<00:02:48.360> little<00:02:48.450> bit<00:02:48.630> bigger<00:02:48.780> because

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
see one's a little bit bigger because

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.840 
see one's a little bit bigger because
your<00:02:49.140> armpits<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:49.950> then<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.670> hand

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
your armpits in it and then you hand

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.890 
your armpits in it and then you hand
your<00:02:50.970> grass<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.300> other<00:02:51.420> one<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:51.690> that's

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
your grass to the other one and that's

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.199 
your grass to the other one and that's
how<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.170> shield<00:02:52.470> works<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:53.220> let's<00:02:53.430> paint<00:02:54.060> this

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
how the shield works so let's paint this

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:04.790 
how the shield works so let's paint this
thing<00:02:54.270> up<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.690> finish<00:02:54.989> it

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.670 

so<00:03:05.800> I<00:03:05.830> painted<00:03:06.160> mine<00:03:06.900> blue<00:03:07.900> nice<00:03:08.200> blue<00:03:08.440> color

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
so I painted mine blue nice blue color

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.280 
so I painted mine blue nice blue color
spray<00:03:09.040> paint<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.520> like<00:03:10.300> to<00:03:10.420> each<00:03:10.570> to<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.810> latex

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
spray paint I like to each to a latex

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.140 
spray paint I like to each to a latex
spray<00:03:11.590> paint<00:03:11.890> it's<00:03:12.010> very<00:03:12.280> non-toxic<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.060> it's

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
spray paint it's very non-toxic and it's

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.700 
spray paint it's very non-toxic and it's
very<00:03:13.960> little<00:03:14.230> arm<00:03:14.410> smell<00:03:14.770> to<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:17.440> that<00:03:17.590> was

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
very little arm smell to it so that was

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.750 
very little arm smell to it so that was
simple<00:03:17.920> enough<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.280> then<00:03:18.400> all<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:18.640> other

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
simple enough and then all the other

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.790 
simple enough and then all the other
pieces<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.240> show<00:03:19.420> here<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.720> got<00:03:19.990> red<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.200> silver

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
pieces I show here I got red and silver

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.460 
pieces I show here I got red and silver
and<00:03:20.980> some<00:03:21.490> yellow<00:03:21.810> but<00:03:22.810> you're<00:03:23.140> paying<00:03:23.350> all

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
and some yellow but you're paying all

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.230 
and some yellow but you're paying all
those<00:03:23.650> up<00:03:23.830> and<00:03:24.010> then<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:24.520> just<00:03:24.700> glue<00:03:24.970> them<00:03:25.060> on

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
those up and then you just glue them on

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.320 
those up and then you just glue them on
to<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.720> shield<00:03:26.560> like<00:03:26.830> this<00:03:27.070> and<00:03:28.030> if<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.180> want

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
to the shield like this and if you want

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.650 
to the shield like this and if you want
to<00:03:28.390> see<00:03:28.630> these<00:03:29.050> patterns<00:03:29.380> a<00:03:29.910> little<00:03:30.910> clearer<00:03:31.420> I

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
to see these patterns a little clearer I

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.210 
to see these patterns a little clearer I
have<00:03:31.930> instructions<00:03:32.500> for<00:03:32.680> this<00:03:32.890> on<00:03:33.010> my<00:03:33.100> website

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
have instructions for this on my website
