 different functions are read here 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.659
 I'm making funny twisted knee soft ice cream 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.640
 that sounds really exciting and me 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.710
 I'm going to unpack that 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.880
 Ice machine and then we look at the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.700
 take a closer look 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.229
 Here's even some building I 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.070
 look down here that's the one 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.259
 underground 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.560
 there are a lot of different forms 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:36.329
 So I'm here for example bom bom or 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.159
 biscuits and small cakes or here too 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.439
 small items that are nice as 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.710

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.479
 Teddy bear grapes a melon still like that 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.829

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.229
 many many things and here the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.939
 many others were still sharing 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.360
 I'll do it now 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.799
 first unpack and build so I 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.869
 have now the plastic pick in 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.130
 away and you can already see one 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.469
 little bit of everything included in the set 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.209
 This is the big one 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.209
 ice machine there you can different 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.640
 select different shapes and 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.650
 Accordingly comes the ice but 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.330
 there are also many other shapes 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.160
 sat down for example such a cookie 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.610
 looks a bit like loriot case 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.400
 down here is another strawberry and 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.030
 there was one more apple here too 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.190

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.610
 big old machines with it the big one 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.459

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:51.989
 underground pure 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:53.510
 that has to be done right and that 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.040
 are already noises 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.930
 you asked yourself what security 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.930
 made here as cleared as this one 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.310
 and down here, what will you do 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.040
 I can see that better once 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:13.560
 the cup on it and the cup turns 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.250
 That's why this funny 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:21.860
 Sounds like this and here are still coming 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.860

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:41.220

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:56.630
 Also included are these 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:58.950

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.290
 different colors you can 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.940
 Of course, then we take the ice 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:31.610
 to spoon things up and here we still have so 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.080
