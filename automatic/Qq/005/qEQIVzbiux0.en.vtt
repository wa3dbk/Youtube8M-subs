00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
pilot was actually able to bring the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.209 
pilot was actually able to bring the
plane<00:00:40.710> down<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.690> miraculous<00:00:42.690> uh<00:00:43.219> landing

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
plane down in a miraculous uh landing

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.340 
plane down in a miraculous uh landing
over<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> water<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:44.969> from<00:00:45.750> anyone<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.050> saw

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
over the water and from anyone that saw

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.510 
over the water and from anyone that saw
it<00:00:46.379> they<00:00:46.680> said<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.070> looked<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:47.489> though

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
it they said that it looked as though

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.819 
it they said that it looked as though
the<00:00:47.969> plane<00:00:48.210> was<00:00:48.420> landing<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> runway<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
the plane was landing on a runway the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.010 
the plane was landing on a runway the
way<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.039> he<00:00:50.129> was<00:00:50.219> trying<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> land<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.020> so

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
way that he was trying to land it and so

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.420 
way that he was trying to land it and so
I<00:00:52.050> mean<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.469> really<00:00:53.010> give<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.250> up<00:00:53.340> for

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
I mean we have to really give it up for

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.430 
I mean we have to really give it up for
this<00:00:53.520> pilot<00:00:53.760> because<00:00:54.210> he<00:00:54.390> actually<00:00:54.570> did

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
this pilot because he actually did

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.170 
this pilot because he actually did
apparently<00:00:56.039> he<00:00:56.309> did<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.640> amazing

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
apparently he did like this amazing

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.020 
apparently he did like this amazing
landing<00:00:57.570> over<00:00:57.809> water<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.430> I'm<00:00:59.430> sure<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.940> know

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
landing over water and I'm sure you know

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.400 
landing over water and I'm sure you know
if<00:01:00.149> everyone<00:01:00.420> gets<00:01:00.570> out<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.140> man

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
if everyone gets out of this then man

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
because I can't believe it's amazing

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.750 
because I can't believe it's amazing
what<00:01:04.589> he<00:01:04.680> did<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.280> main<00:01:05.430> thing<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.729> I

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
what he did but the main thing that I

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.490 
what he did but the main thing that I
want<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> talk<00:01:06.210> about<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> cause<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
want to talk about is the cause of the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.399 
want to talk about is the cause of the
crash<00:01:08.030> apparently<00:01:09.030> less<00:01:09.510> than<00:01:09.780> five<00:01:10.110> minutes

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
crash apparently less than five minutes

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.590 
crash apparently less than five minutes
after<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> plane<00:01:11.130> took<00:01:11.369> off<00:01:11.580> up<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
after the plane took off up the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.080 
after the plane took off up the
passengers<00:01:13.260> said<00:01:13.770> they<00:01:14.010> heard<00:01:14.250> loud<00:01:14.670> booms

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
passengers said they heard loud booms

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.420 
passengers said they heard loud booms
and<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.930> engines<00:01:16.740> were<00:01:16.890> giving<00:01:17.159> out<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
and the engines were giving out and

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.679 
and the engines were giving out and
there<00:01:17.549> was<00:01:17.580> flames<00:01:17.850> coming<00:01:18.210> out<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> engines

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
there was flames coming out the engines

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.380 
there was flames coming out the engines
and<00:01:19.070> apparently<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.400> plane<00:01:20.670> actually<00:01:20.970> went

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
and apparently the plane actually went

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.300 
and apparently the plane actually went
through<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> flock<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:21.990> geese<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> geese

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
through a flock of geese so the geese

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.820 
through a flock of geese so the geese
got<00:01:23.580> sucked<00:01:23.970> up<00:01:24.180> into<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.600> engine<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.140> they

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
got sucked up into the engine and they

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.010 
got sucked up into the engine and they
caused<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.490> engine<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.909> fail<00:01:27.330> both<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
caused the engine to fail both of the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.649 
caused the engine to fail both of the
engines<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.820> what<00:01:30.090> made<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.420> plane

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
engines and that is what made the plane

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.569 
engines and that is what made the plane
crash<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.350> don't<00:01:31.710> know<00:01:31.770> about<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.950> guys<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.310> I
