 lots of people sending and asking emails 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.850
 tips on how to create a project video 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.519
 and during that video it shows the opening and 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.550
 closure of the module doors because 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.470
 has some users channels of some 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.660
 youtube users the video displayed this 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.100
 possibility 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.230
 it is important to point out that does not promote 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.420
 have a specific function to generate this 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.030
 aperture during video recording and 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.050
 nor does it provide for the opening of furniture during 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.750
 the record 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.000
 this was a discovery of valdinei 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.730
 of the curitiba that the user very 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.199
 then promotes to do 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.480
 this aperture during recording of the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.699
 video initially we will fix the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.379
 tool panel to access 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.879
 the tool openings during the 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.070
 video recording 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.820
 after we will access the vice tool 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.950
 and create a project video 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.110
 defined the course that should be with it 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.360
 If you have questions about how to do this 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.950
 we make it available here on the video channel 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.850
 that teaches you how to create a 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.070
 project bet on show details 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.299
 informs the lowest value for the property 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.220
 step 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.290
 the lower the value reported more 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.900
 slow to be running the video 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.759
 In this case, the video must be 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.720
 slower so there is time to 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.850
 access the opening tool 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:40.000
 foment forms fest the option details 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.070
 show details and position in the 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.820
 dynamic life and a little corner of the screen for 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.310

 access to the tool opening and 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.010
 make a move 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.870
 after finalizing the recording is a space 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.870
