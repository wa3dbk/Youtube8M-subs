Brown like I normally do I'm using this

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.020 
Brown like I normally do I'm using this
color<00:02:55.660> because<00:02:55.960> it's<00:02:56.230> more<00:02:56.410> yellowy<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:57.190> soft

Brown<00:02:58.240> would<00:02:58.480> not<00:02:58.660> really<00:02:58.810> complement<00:02:59.530> these

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650
