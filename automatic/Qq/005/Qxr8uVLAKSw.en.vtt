00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.310
 effectiveness are already at the bit and culture e 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.500
 I'm here today with erika this morning at 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.389
 12 entered the operating room for a 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.280
 breast augmentation surgery 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.469
 then breast augmentation 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.560
 technically the intervention went a lot 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.660
 well but with erika today we want to understand 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.160
 a little better to find out what you live 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.170
 as a patient 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.330
 we require a little erika how it went 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.180
 the day is now eight o'clock 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.550
 evening a few hours passed 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.480
 Tell us a little of a certain day 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.850
 went very well 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.930
 I entered the operating room 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.040
 quiet from the bottom was what 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.620
 I wanted 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.030
 and normal so this means a lot 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.219
 or just a little bit of pain 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.950
 back but given by the position when 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.920
 the bed I would say that for the moment it is 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.379
 see you very happy and peaceful 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.250
 tomorrow morning and let's see how it is 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.270
 the situation 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.500
 hello hi good morning in as promised 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.520
 also this morning we are call with 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.350
 ethics 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.239
 we wanted after this night of rest 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.280
 take advantage of it to ask a few questions 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.250
 best American hello 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.590
 george this morning i wanted to ask 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.390
 how did you know us as known? 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.040
 to the script 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.290
 then I did a research I am 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.659
 generally ended up on the site of o 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.179
 I really liked sluc because 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.999
 a very simple site that makes you understand 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.829
 immediately certain things also a 

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:30.549
 people who don't speak a language 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:32.530
 doctor and so I contacted the income 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.200
 we felt we came to visit 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.819
 from doctor giulio gherardini what 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.340
 I want to ask you now what has you 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.890
 struck by doctor giulio gherardini for 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.810
 where you are here today you did the surgery 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.799
 but many things above all 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.719
 professionalism according to the first quality 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.329
 fundamental of a doctor 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:55.599
 the knowledge of the subject explained in 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.310
 simple matter in a simple way 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:59.770
 because it's not easy 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.450
 I repeat that for those who do not speak 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.069
 medical language understand certain 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:10.929
 things and professionalism and it 's also me 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:13.480
 a little to empathy and also to sincerity where 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.510
 I was considered well in everything and 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.260
 for all I had to do without 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.260
 exaggerate e 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.390
 motivational on the recommended status 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.390
 great 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.170
 another thing I wanted to say is that I don't 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.660
 I felt for not judging her and 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.400
 so this is fundamental because 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.000
 however when making choices of 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.450
 this type is not always easy to find 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.330
 to speak 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.930
 in front of a doctor rather than ad 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.239
 a nourished tower without feeling the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.080
 those little ones who said you were 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.420
 doing the right or wrong thing 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.300
 ask you another question a little 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.940
 I think it is understood from what so far 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.750
 many the faces of hb not that is 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.320
 he reported yes I would do it again because 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.610
 because I'm fine because I feel better and 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:18.960
 just a little bit more than sessa 's estimate 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:21.930
 what would you say to a woman like you? 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.610
 a few months or weeks ago 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.520
 thinking 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.920
 everyone extends to the breast I would say 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.740
 absolutely do it because if this 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:37.260
 what does not make us live well and so is good 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:41.280
 solve it so I promote it thanks 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.700
 thousand erika to use thanks to you too 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.700
