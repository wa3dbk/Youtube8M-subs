00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:10.830
 recommendation for the day of the book and my 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:12.719
 birthday as you'll know if not 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.299
 know for quite some time the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.510
 candadito if you follow him every punctual day 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.189
 or so on plan summer christmas day 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.840
 book we try to make a recommendation 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.609
 so you can read books that we like to 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.170
 us and we tell ourselves a lot of 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.640
 book tube is to recommend in our 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.990
 favorite videos that's why there's a list 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.029
 of reproduction that we leave here 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.070
 below where you can see apart from our 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.660
 recommendation of other vessels and so on 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.329
 also know other channels my 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.520
 recommendation is the dark cock of 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.050
 mÃ¡laga jet not only the first book the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.390
 three although the first one is only in 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.070
 Spanish but although you do not know much 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.930
 English calm because it is very easy to 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.180
 understand the other two 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.969
 it's a paranormal story that deals 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.250
 about a girl there is an accident and 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.930
 all her friends die - she does not 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.399
 remember absolutely nothing of what has 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.590
 past and apart begins to have 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.239
 hallucinations and a lot of things that 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.760
 it is thought that she was going crazy 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.170
 I was surprised because it gives many shots 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.150
 and in the end nothing 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.790
 and is becoming one of my 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.100
 favorite trilogies but the favorite and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.080
 I only die to what you read and my 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.450
 recommendation will not surprise anyone 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.040
 I think it's about rereading wander 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.420
 nesc line as you know has been 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.770
 become my favorite book from 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.539
 that I read it is that I love it and it is 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.350
 wonderful and also more of the 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.450
 adaptation 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.390
 steven spielberg I'm screwed and 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.549
 excited and a bit of everything I have a 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.890
 thing and mixed in the stomach but it 's 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.439
 as in a dystopian future but it is not 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.270
 a dystopia will be in 2044 and the world 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.039
 It's a mess I need to live 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.140
 the environment is a mess 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.909
 everyone is grossed out in 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.369
 general and people spend the day in a 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.780
 virtual reality that is called oasis and is 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.340
 as if they were living there is like 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.890
 a video game but another one seems real 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.590
 virtual reality I go out and suddenly 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.539
 ASSISI owner dies and leaves as a 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.789
 evidence to gain your evidence because 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.039
 I did not have offspring and people 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.470
 Go crazy to find the clues and 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.360
 look for the easter egg at the end and it's 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.679
 super cool if you like video games 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.159
 and the culture of the eighties is going to 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:06.659
 love 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.500
 I also made a video review for 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.440
 If you want 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.840

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.980
 I'm a video game designer and a little 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.330
 terms citations 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.770
 that you have to read it because it 's super 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.390
 chuli and kidnap people or fictions 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.520
 where it is also wonderful and I 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.990
