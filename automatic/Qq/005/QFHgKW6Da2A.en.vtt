00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 they are monitored day and night by 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.890
 five cameras installed in an area where 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.290
 only biologists can enter the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.259
 Pregnant gorillas are the stars of this 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.139
 nominated film to 12 years have taste 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.230
 refined juice and fruit not 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.779
 dispenses a no-grain cereal bar 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.019
 10 years now prefer a diet based 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.630
 of leaves and vegetables according to the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.150
 zoobotanical foundation, the two are more 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.890
 quiet in the last days and are watched 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.190
 close up by leon 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.129
 the gorilla father gladstone explains that lulu 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.510
 can give birth to the first king is that she 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.180
 still pregnant in the period of 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.820
 quarantine in 2013 when the animals 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.309
 newcomers zoos from overseas 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.539
 still had not been taken to the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.989
 enclosure in the loop and thrashed where 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.309
 hurry, right? 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.600
 It really was a surprise but the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.520
 animals from the beginning and whenever 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.559
 normal behavior and is always 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.960
 made a picture of the behavior of 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.640
 have had adequate food 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.489
 So our expectation is that this 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.080
 really if it were a non-success 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.689
 we obviously expected that it was so 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.970
 speed is why no firm 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.549
 a gorilla who 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.280
 reigned alone for a long time i'm not 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.020
 from bh the question of ide is a 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.900
 question that is the animal that was already 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.420
 I was a bit older the gorillas 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.420
 Are you going to stay at least eight years? I'm not 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.259
 of bh then will help preserve the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.360
 species 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.430
 the pup is dependent on the mother during 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.470
 more or less four years nor 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.479
 breastfeeding and after that it is still 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.610
 four more years in the group then 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.159
 eight years from now these puppies have already 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.979
 large groups will form other groups in 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.649
 Brazil's terms were demon terms 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.450
 they may be directed to 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.250
 other stores to form new groups 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.079
 they may be introduced into 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.840
 parks in programs of reintroduction of 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.060
 kind ie looking and raisins and world 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.380
 and we have conservation of this species 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.360
 their knowledge here 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.969
 usually at that time the gorillas already 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.210
 they would be outside but by the sun already 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.280
 is high and where the pregnant gorillas of 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.190
 agreement with biologists after the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.470
 pregnancy gorillas are not showing up 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.110
 a lot here from the outside and 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.440
 audience has almost no chance to see the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.600
 they are sleepier and lazy 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.240
 some resemblance to human pregnancy 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.140
 it's all pregnant 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.720
 and I do not like much of a visit, not from 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.240
 According to this biologist, the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.960
 gorillas look even with the species 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.480
 human 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.610
 eight and a half months of gestation 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.350
 females are extremely protective 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.530
 careful I was going to take care of the 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.840
 hygiene and transport protection 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.700
 of the puppy breastfeeding 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.120
 She always starts with him at the beginning. 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.700
 belly so that it is pressed all the time and 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.680
 usually one hour of breastfeeding . 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.410
 every two hours and then he sleeps 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.960
 little and little goals baby goes 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.260
 passing and increasing he is breast more 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.020
 time - they are from a family that has 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.880
 females who quietly stop then and 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.300
 that we have reported that most of the 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.430
 births usually occur intervention 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.980
 no then we expect people to 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.340
 have a surprise and already have some that 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.340
 leave
