00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
these swells at intervals so you can

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.440 
these swells at intervals so you can
chop<00:02:08.290> really<00:02:08.950> well<00:02:09.250> with<00:02:09.550> it<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:13.240> knife

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
does pretty good to the chopper no it's

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.190 
does pretty good to the chopper no it's
never<00:02:15.910> going<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.680> compare<00:02:17.680> with<00:02:18.070> a<00:02:18.100> kukri<00:02:19.200> but

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
never going to compare with a kukri but

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.140 
never going to compare with a kukri but
it<00:02:20.320> does<00:02:20.530> naturally<00:02:20.800> feel<00:02:21.280> like<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.580> chopper

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150

easily<00:02:25.600> with<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:26.650> cuts<00:02:27.430> well<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.910> got<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.120> good

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
easily with it cuts well you got a good

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.220 
easily with it cuts well you got a good
bevel<00:02:28.720> right<00:02:29.650> angle<00:02:31.230> now<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:34.420> can<00:02:34.660> choke<00:02:35.019> up

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
bevel right angle now you can choke up

become<00:04:00.400> a<00:04:00.430> good<00:04:00.670> Skinner<00:04:02.340> so<00:04:03.340> if<00:04:03.460> I<00:04:03.610> was<00:04:03.850> going

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
become a good Skinner so if I was going

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.830 
become a good Skinner so if I was going
to<00:04:04.060> make<00:04:04.210> any<00:04:04.860> changes<00:04:05.860> to<00:04:06.070> it<00:04:06.370> this<00:04:07.030> tip<00:04:07.540> right

to make any changes to it this tip right

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.699 
to make any changes to it this tip right
here<00:04:08.110> i<00:04:08.140> would<00:04:08.410> change<00:04:08.650> i<00:04:08.920> still<00:04:09.190> want<00:04:09.400> a<00:04:09.430> point

here i would change i still want a point

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.680 
here i would change i still want a point
but<00:04:11.709> i<00:04:11.770> would<00:04:12.040> round<00:04:12.370> it<00:04:12.700> up<00:04:12.850> a<00:04:13.240> little<00:04:13.540> bit

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
but i would round it up a little bit

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.770 
but i would round it up a little bit
more<00:04:13.840> and<00:04:13.900> blunt<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.680> back<00:04:14.860> from<00:04:15.190> say<00:04:15.430> about

this<00:04:20.890> entire<00:04:21.459> top<00:04:21.850> flat<00:04:22.210> right<00:04:22.419> here<00:04:22.450> i<00:04:22.600> would

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
this entire top flat right here i would

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.530 
this entire top flat right here i would
round<00:04:23.280> for<00:04:24.280> putting<00:04:24.669> my<00:04:24.790> hand<00:04:25.000> up<00:04:25.150> there<00:04:25.330> for

very good draw knife and I was a very
impressed<00:04:34.810> with<00:04:34.930> this<00:04:35.110> ability<00:04:35.410> to<00:04:35.800> plane

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
impressed with this ability to plane

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.060 
impressed with this ability to plane
since<00:04:36.760> it's<00:04:37.000> beveled<00:04:37.210> only<00:04:37.570> from<00:04:37.750> one<00:04:37.780> side<00:04:38.350> it

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
since it's beveled only from one side it

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.960 
since it's beveled only from one side it
does<00:04:39.400> a<00:04:39.430> very<00:04:39.550> good<00:04:39.880> job<00:04:40.090> at<00:04:41.760> planing<00:04:42.760> or

bevel down it digs in if i put the bevel
coming<00:04:48.340> up<00:04:48.520> it<00:04:49.169> planes<00:04:50.169> flat<00:04:50.620> and<00:04:50.919> allows<00:04:51.520> me

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
coming up it planes flat and allows me

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.770 
coming up it planes flat and allows me
to<00:04:51.970> take<00:04:52.450> off<00:04:52.630> long<00:04:52.960> thin<00:04:53.440> sheets<00:04:54.100> with<00:04:55.000> it<00:04:55.120> but

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
to take off long thin sheets with it but

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.450 
to take off long thin sheets with it but
it<00:04:55.870> does<00:04:56.050> good<00:04:56.260> job<00:04:56.500> but<00:04:56.650> i<00:04:56.740> would<00:04:56.950> from<00:04:57.250> this

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
it does good job but i would from this

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.000 
it does good job but i would from this
hump<00:04:57.730> forward<00:04:58.630> i<00:04:58.780> would<00:04:58.930> round<00:04:59.200> it<00:04:59.470> and<00:04:59.650> i

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
hump forward i would round it and i

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.920 
hump forward i would round it and i
would<00:05:00.190> change<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.669> tip<00:05:00.910> just<00:05:01.120> a<00:05:01.300> little<00:05:01.540> bit<00:05:01.690> i

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
would change the tip just a little bit i

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.020 
would change the tip just a little bit i
would<00:05:02.530> of<00:05:02.620> course<00:05:02.860> leave<00:05:03.220> this<00:05:03.610> at<00:05:03.970> a

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
would of course leave this at a

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.690 
would of course leave this at a
90-degree<00:05:04.750> spying<00:05:05.169> this<00:05:05.500> saddle<00:05:06.010> because

90-degree spying this saddle because

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.650 
90-degree spying this saddle because
then<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.360> can<00:05:07.570> be<00:05:07.660> used<00:05:07.870> as<00:05:08.140> a<00:05:08.169> scraping<00:05:09.100> to

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
then it can be used as a scraping to

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.440 
then it can be used as a scraping to
removing<00:05:10.660> bark<00:05:10.960> for<00:05:11.410> removing<00:05:12.210> meat<00:05:13.210> from

hide etc

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.080 
hide etc
and<00:05:15.129> he'd<00:05:15.280> be<00:05:15.340> good<00:05:15.520> place<00:05:15.789> to<00:05:15.940> put<00:05:16.000> a

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
and he'd be good place to put a

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.450 
and he'd be good place to put a

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
my review I guess you want to call it of

the William Collins beast model tracker

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.360 
the William Collins beast model tracker
I<00:05:30.599> think<00:05:31.599> you<00:05:31.659> got<00:05:31.780> an<00:05:31.930> idea<00:05:32.199> here<00:05:32.379> we<00:05:32.560> I<00:05:32.830> really

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
I think you got an idea here we I really

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.360 
I think you got an idea here we I really
do<00:05:33.550> I<00:05:33.819> think<00:05:34.300> that<00:05:34.800> with<00:05:35.800> a<00:05:35.830> little<00:05:36.069> bit<00:05:36.310> of

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
do I think that with a little bit of

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.510 
do I think that with a little bit of
refinement<00:05:36.879> I<00:05:37.919> think<00:05:38.919> it<00:05:39.069> would<00:05:39.220> be<00:05:39.250> just

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
refinement I think it would be just

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.420 
refinement I think it would be just
awesome<00:05:40.000> I<00:05:40.180> really<00:05:40.659> do<00:05:40.810> but<00:05:43.379> give<00:05:44.379> me<00:05:44.530> the

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
awesome I really do but give me the

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.460 
awesome I really do but give me the
weakness<00:05:45.879> I<00:05:46.060> have<00:05:46.360> with<00:05:46.599> this<00:05:46.629> is<00:05:47.080> it<00:05:47.199> doesn't

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
weakness I have with this is it doesn't

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.409 
weakness I have with this is it doesn't
have<00:05:47.560> a<00:05:47.590> real<00:05:47.800> point<00:05:49.229> and<00:05:50.789> the<00:05:51.789> weakness<00:05:52.240> i

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
have a real point and the weakness i

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.499 
have a real point and the weakness i
have<00:05:52.720> with<00:05:53.139> kukri<00:05:53.680> is<00:05:53.830> it<00:05:54.669> doesn't<00:05:55.300> lend

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:55.509 
have with kukri is it doesn't lend

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:58.529 
have with kukri is it doesn't lend

itself to detail carving easily it's

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:00.930 
itself to detail carving easily it's
harder<00:05:58.900> to<00:05:58.930> choke<00:05:59.289> up<00:05:59.500> on<00:05:59.710> it<00:05:59.770> because<00:06:00.460> of<00:06:00.729> all

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
harder to choke up on it because of all

this torque for this beast does both of

those better and it's a every knife is a

compromise in some arena but this seems

compromise in some arena but this seems
to<00:06:13.990> be<00:06:14.110> taking<00:06:14.560> the<00:06:14.680> best<00:06:14.949> virtues<00:06:15.520> of<00:06:15.729> the<00:06:16.090> two

a<00:06:18.909> little<00:06:19.090> bit<00:06:19.590> now<00:06:20.849> if<00:06:21.849> I<00:06:22.449> was<00:06:22.659> going<00:06:22.870> to<00:06:22.990> ask

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
a little bit now if I was going to ask

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.510 
a little bit now if I was going to ask
for<00:06:25.000> one<00:06:25.150> of<00:06:25.270> these<00:06:25.419> I<00:06:26.190> think<00:06:27.190> you've<00:06:27.340> got<00:06:27.490> it

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
for one of these I think you've got it

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.749 
for one of these I think you've got it
right<00:06:27.819> with<00:06:28.060> you<00:06:28.210> it's<00:06:28.719> right<00:06:28.990> thickness

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 
right with you it's right thickness

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:32.899 
right with you it's right thickness
right<00:06:30.759> length<00:06:31.090> it's<00:06:31.750> got<00:06:31.960> the<00:06:32.139> right<00:06:32.319> balance

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:32.909 
right length it's got the right balance

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:36.149 
right length it's got the right balance
this<00:06:33.909> curve<00:06:34.330> does<00:06:34.960> lend<00:06:35.289> itself<00:06:35.440> to<00:06:35.919> the

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:36.159 
this curve does lend itself to the

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:40.230 
this curve does lend itself to the
chopping<00:06:36.669> and<00:06:36.819> etc<00:06:37.889> it<00:06:38.889> will<00:06:39.190> baton<00:06:39.580> I'm<00:06:39.940> not

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
chopping and etc it will baton I'm not

Abbott honor but my friend Roger is and

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.120 
Abbott honor but my friend Roger is and
he<00:06:44.169> used<00:06:44.409> it<00:06:44.590> to<00:06:44.620> Baton<00:06:46.289> some<00:06:47.289> firewood<00:06:47.949> up

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130 
he used it to Baton some firewood up

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.719 
he used it to Baton some firewood up
real<00:06:48.370> quick<00:06:48.669> it<00:06:48.909> does<00:06:49.150> good<00:06:49.389> job<00:06:49.659> batani<00:06:50.080> and<00:06:50.729> I

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:51.729 
real quick it does good job batani and I

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:54.930 
real quick it does good job batani and I
think<00:06:51.819> that<00:06:53.130> little<00:06:54.130> refinement<00:06:54.430> of<00:06:54.759> this

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
think that little refinement of this

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.939 
think that little refinement of this
design<00:06:55.360> it'd<00:06:55.779> be<00:06:56.050> awesome<00:06:56.199> this<00:06:56.529> is<00:06:56.680> a<00:06:56.710> really

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:56.949 
design it'd be awesome this is a really

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:00.269 
design it'd be awesome this is a really
good<00:06:57.069> night<00:06:57.509> but<00:06:58.509> with<00:06:58.659> the<00:06:58.810> tip<00:06:59.259> round<00:06:59.979> this

00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:00.279 
good night but with the tip round this

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:02.820 
good night but with the tip round this
it'd<00:07:01.120> be<00:07:01.300> even<00:07:01.389> better<00:07:01.630> in<00:07:01.900> my<00:07:02.349> humble<00:07:02.590> opinion

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
it'd be even better in my humble opinion

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.839 
it'd be even better in my humble opinion
I<00:07:03.750> hope<00:07:04.750> this<00:07:04.930> gives<00:07:05.080> you<00:07:05.199> some<00:07:05.259> ideas<00:07:05.849> once

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:06.849 
I hope this gives you some ideas once

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:09.059 
I hope this gives you some ideas once
