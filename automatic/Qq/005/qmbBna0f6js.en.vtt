00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.240
 I'm going to make two good meals for you today. 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.090
 who will use 100% of a 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.790
 we're going to use pumpkin seed 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.279
 and peel to make a delicious salad 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.710
 and a pumpkin jam with perfect coconut 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:25.140
 So let's start that it gets to 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.720
 start I'll shoot me pumpkin in eight 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.730
 pieces and put inside a 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.890
 shape with a little water in the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.960
 underneath the two more little watery fingers 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.149
 or less at the bottom of the shape if 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.520
 she's still hotter and I'm going 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.219
 cover with aluminum foil and 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.100
 carry these works to 200 degrees celsius 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.350
 even the inside is the ball and 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.300
 There you go and ask and the seed I do 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.850
 what is easily the seed we will 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.550
 separate all pumpkin seeds and 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.590
 seasoning, and there are also 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.660
 it's crispy and we put it on 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.420
 top of our salad but already I 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.909
 explains your part while my 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.740
 ball to if you stop all the little balls 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.780
 that were stuck in my seeds 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.820
 following back into a 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.100
 sieve and I'll wash until they're all right 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.200
 then I put on top of 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.850
 an absorbent paper to dry well and 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.040
 left it more or less for about 30 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.420
 minutes until they look good 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.060
 I'll leave the seeds to 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.790
 dry on the stove and my work that 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.890
 was in the oven is ready then I 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.409
 I'll take it out of the oven to cut through this 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.110
 part carlo dinha and make my sweet of 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.799
 pumpkin now the good part is now the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.049
 good part 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.700
 the underside the shell still comes back 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.619
 to the oven a little bit to 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.619
 keep moving forward and stay softer 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.290
 I thought you separated the flesh from 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.750
 peel pumpkin you'll have to weigh 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.970
 this just before processing and then this 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.930
 account is very simple for each one kilo 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.119
 of pumpkin you use 250 grams of sugar 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.759
 crystal in the case here I have almost two 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.560
 pounds of pumpkin and I'm using 500 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.659
 grams of sugar to process this 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.180
 pump I put a little water 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.130
 it process easier and faster, 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.739
 turned a little mouth to my mouth 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.690
 I really like to make pumpkin candy is 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.430
 that mouth neck that I think she 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.130
 release a little more water and become 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.850
 delicious but can do with any work 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.850
 your candy 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.180
 then just play leftover processed 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.670
 inside the pan next to the sugar also 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.650
 100 grams of cocaine side if you have 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.930
 the fresh grated coconut he got very 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.000
 more tasty but it was not possible 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.790
 to be in the bag after I put two together 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.319
 Cinnamon branches with one site cloves 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.180
 jacques woman to to highlight the 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.550
 taste and I'll take everything to fire 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.890
 mixed dinho and stay cooking it 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.070
 for about 50 minutes at a time. 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.070
 hour 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.510
 I wanted to share with you already 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.820
 must hide there in the corner looks 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.650
 distance between the pan and the 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.880
 happening is a sponge explodes in the 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.130
 house he could send a bomb 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.900
 watch as it avoids to blow it should 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.910
 have a great pashtun those 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.610
 spoons of giant stick that stirs 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.980
 away the business only from that day 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.530
 from afar the church as juca then charges 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.750
 I discovered a technique, I think 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.240
 It's there that you keep 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.330
 I do not know, I do not know but what year are you? 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.190
 give a nudge so the side and the 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.020
 other so but very delicately with the 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.480
 spatula underneath does not stir 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.130
 so are emotions that moment when it is 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.930
 yours soon I'll put a 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.730
 blouse gloves when you pass spatula 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.770
 in the bottom of the pan and you see that the sweet 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.660
 thaÃ­s sticking to the pan it opens 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.940
 That doll is because I like it. 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.920
