00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
said for me it was really important that

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.570 
said for me it was really important that
some<00:01:15.170> people<00:01:15.440> make<00:01:15.620> these<00:01:15.830> and<00:01:16.100> they<00:01:16.220> cut<00:01:16.460> up

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
some people make these and they cut up

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.790 
some people make these and they cut up
their<00:01:16.790> cooler<00:01:17.030> where<00:01:17.780> they<00:01:17.960> use<00:01:18.110> a<00:01:18.140> styrofoam

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
their cooler where they use a styrofoam

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.460 
their cooler where they use a styrofoam
cooler<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.400> cut<00:01:19.550> holes<00:01:19.790> in<00:01:20.030> it<00:01:20.180> but<00:01:21.140> in<00:01:21.380> a

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
cooler and cut holes in it but in a

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.670 
cooler and cut holes in it but in a
small<00:01:21.740> space<00:01:21.920> I<00:01:22.480> wanted<00:01:23.480> to<00:01:23.690> dual<00:01:24.140> purpose

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
small space I wanted to dual purpose

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.740 
small space I wanted to dual purpose
everything<00:01:25.190> so<00:01:25.490> this<00:01:26.240> is<00:01:26.450> still<00:01:26.720> a

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
everything so this is still a

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.370 
everything so this is still a
functioning<00:01:27.560> perfectly<00:01:27.800> good<00:01:28.480> cooler<00:01:29.480> as<00:01:30.260> you

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
functioning perfectly good cooler as you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.380 
functioning perfectly good cooler as you
can<00:01:30.500> see<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:30.890> fits<00:01:31.070> down<00:01:31.340> inside<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.120> little

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
can see it fits down inside the little

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.260 
can see it fits down inside the little
grooves<00:01:32.660> on<00:01:32.900> it<00:01:33.080> and<00:01:33.260> it's<00:01:33.410> good<00:01:33.620> to<00:01:33.740> go<00:01:34.270> put

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
grooves on it and it's good to go put

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.520 
grooves on it and it's good to go put
the<00:01:36.220> TV<00:01:37.220> season<00:01:40.660> and<00:01:41.660> what<00:01:41.840> I'm<00:01:41.930> also<00:01:42.140> going<00:01:42.470> to

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
do so have my 12 volt fan more power the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.990 
do so have my 12 volt fan more power the
better<00:01:47.840> this<00:01:48.110> has<00:01:48.350> decent<00:01:48.830> power<00:01:49.220> I<00:01:49.550> wish<00:01:49.850> it

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
better this has decent power I wish it

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.570 
better this has decent power I wish it
had<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:50.180> little<00:01:50.270> bit<00:01:50.600> more<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.250> i<00:01:52.250> got<00:01:52.430> that

had a little bit more and i got that
plugged<00:01:52.940> in<00:01:53.120> to<00:01:53.600> a<00:01:53.630> converter

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.880 

and<00:02:01.300> we<00:02:01.690> are<00:02:01.840> going<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:02.020> go<00:02:02.230> ahead<00:02:02.290> and<00:02:02.470> turn

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
and we are going to go ahead and turn

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:18.490 
and we are going to go ahead and turn
this<00:02:03.010> puppy<00:02:03.250> on<00:02:08.820> right<00:02:09.820> away<00:02:09.850> right<00:02:13.320> away

this really does help

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.440 
this really does help
not<00:02:22.060> air<00:02:22.300> conditioning<00:02:24.060> but<00:02:25.060> given<00:02:25.300> enough

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
not air conditioning but given enough

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.240 
not air conditioning but given enough
time<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.200> can<00:02:26.410> reduce<00:02:27.130> your<00:02:27.870> anxiety<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:29.560> set<00:02:30.130> up

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
right under 90 I set up a little time

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.000 
right under 90 I set up a little time
lapse<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.450> I'm<00:02:41.020> just<00:02:41.230> going<00:02:41.350> to<00:02:41.380> let<00:02:41.590> this<00:02:41.740> go

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
lapse and I'm just going to let this go

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.059 

I<00:04:10.840> edit<00:04:11.840> this<00:04:11.989> I'll<00:04:12.200> tell<00:04:12.470> you<00:04:12.560> how<00:04:12.650> long<00:04:12.830> it's

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
I edit this I'll tell you how long it's

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.810 
I edit this I'll tell you how long it's
been<00:04:13.160> but<00:04:14.110> it<00:04:15.110> dropped<00:04:15.620> I'd<00:04:15.920> say<00:04:16.160> a<00:04:16.190> good<00:04:16.310> 10

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
been but it dropped I'd say a good 10

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.800 
been but it dropped I'd say a good 10
degrees<00:04:16.850> in<00:04:17.180> here<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:19.400> is<00:04:19.910> very<00:04:21.580> livable

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
degrees in here and it is very livable

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.270 
degrees in here and it is very livable
you'd<00:04:23.810> be<00:04:24.020> surprised<00:04:24.470> how<00:04:24.500> much<00:04:24.919> of<00:04:25.160> a

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
you'd be surprised how much of a

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.540 
you'd be surprised how much of a
difference<00:04:25.700> just<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.120> few<00:04:26.330> degrees<00:04:26.510> can<00:04:26.900> do<00:04:27.080> but

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
difference just a few degrees can do but

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.670 
difference just a few degrees can do but
it's<00:04:28.550> a<00:04:28.700> big<00:04:28.970> improvement<00:04:29.230> see<00:04:30.230> what<00:04:30.530> the

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
it's a big improvement see what the

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.129 
it's a big improvement see what the
status<00:04:30.919> is<00:04:31.340> of<00:04:31.660> rice<00:04:32.660> i<00:04:33.220> would<00:04:34.220> say<00:04:35.110> these<00:04:36.110> are

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
status is of rice i would say these are

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:43.150 
status is of rice i would say these are
about<00:04:37.040> half<00:04:37.520> frozen<00:04:38.000> yet<00:04:40.300> so<00:04:41.300> i<00:04:41.330> think<00:04:41.510> i<00:04:42.160> think

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
about half frozen yet so i think i think

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.129 
about half frozen yet so i think i think
you<00:04:43.400> get<00:04:43.639> a<00:04:43.700> good<00:04:43.970> day<00:04:44.150> out<00:04:44.180> of<00:04:44.479> this<00:04:44.600> or<00:04:44.840> a<00:04:44.870> good

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
you get a good day out of this or a good

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.100 
you get a good day out of this or a good
big<00:04:45.320> block<00:04:45.620> of<00:04:45.650> ice<00:04:46.450> definitely<00:04:47.450> workable<00:04:47.870> and

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
big block of ice definitely workable and

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.620 
big block of ice definitely workable and
doable<00:04:48.410> and<00:04:48.740> that's<00:04:49.550> good<00:04:49.760> drinking<00:04:50.120> water<00:04:50.150> so

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
doable and that's good drinking water so

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.040 
doable and that's good drinking water so
I<00:04:50.660> you<00:04:51.410> can<00:04:51.620> drink<00:04:51.889> it<00:04:52.040> again<00:04:52.280> after

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
I you can drink it again after

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.820 
I you can drink it again after
everything's<00:04:54.050> got<00:04:54.229> to<00:04:54.260> have<00:04:54.440> a<00:04:54.470> couple

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
everything's got to have a couple

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.290 
everything's got to have a couple

can stop and get a big bag ice that will
work<00:05:04.100> and<00:05:06.400> there's<00:05:07.400> several<00:05:07.639> different<00:05:07.790> ways

it down into a bucket of ice water with
a<00:05:27.590> little<00:05:27.770> pump<00:05:28.160> and<00:05:28.510> just<00:05:29.510> keep<00:05:29.690> that

a little pump and just keep that

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.350 
a little pump and just keep that
circulating<00:05:30.740> and<00:05:30.890> that'll<00:05:31.490> also<00:05:31.669> do<00:05:31.970> a<00:05:32.000> great

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
circulating and that'll also do a great

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.930 
circulating and that'll also do a great
job<00:05:32.830> maybe<00:05:33.830> one<00:05:34.070> day<00:05:34.250> I'll<00:05:34.370> make<00:05:34.550> one<00:05:34.580> of<00:05:34.850> those

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
job maybe one day I'll make one of those

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
going to do this out in 120 degrees and

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.980 
going to do this out in 120 degrees and
and<00:05:48.590> be<00:05:49.539> perfect<00:05:50.539> in<00:05:50.690> here<00:05:51.039> but<00:05:52.840> it'll<00:05:53.840> work

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
and be perfect in here but it'll work

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.610
