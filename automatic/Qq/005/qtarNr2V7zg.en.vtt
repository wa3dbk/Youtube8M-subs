00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.270
 hello friends let's learn how to make 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.299
 letters with cardboard and cloth to decorate 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:14.260
 our home materials are fabric 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.260
 r chosen 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.130
 pencil ruler 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.579
 cardboard and cola 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.649
 we started by drawing the letter more than 7 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.649
 centimeters from all sides 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.490
 and we cut the cloth around the cardboard 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:47.500
 that about two or three centimeters 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:51.780
 we now proceed to apply glue 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.780
 and spread well all over the cardboard 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.970
 the paperboard 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.970
 we turn around we enter 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.299
 we press well 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.870
 we give him 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.500
 and stretch with your hands 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.380
 so that the tail sticks and we leave 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.380
 We are dry with the tips 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.609
 we push 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.609
 the tip here too 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.979
 we press it to look good in the corner 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.620
 here 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.329
 and I was here 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.080
 press the two corners 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.220
 let it dry 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.910
 we stretch the cloth and with the fingers 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.910
 we are pressing 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.210
 we have the tail well all over the hole 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.210
 what's left 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.750
 first one fold and then another 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.730
 let's say the corners well in 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.340
 we can help with tweezers 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.810
 and ready and have our letter 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.209
 decorative for our home in this 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.730
 case is made of golden cloth to give it a 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.270
 more vintage and modern touch you can 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.510
