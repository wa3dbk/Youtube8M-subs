lets<00:02:37.860> this<00:02:38.130> kind<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.460> canvass<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.150> colors<00:02:39.660> and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
lets this kind of canvass of colors and

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.340 
lets this kind of canvass of colors and
sounds<00:02:40.790> blend<00:02:41.790> together<00:02:42.000> as<00:02:42.390> one<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:42.900> try<00:02:43.320> out

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
sounds blend together as one so try out

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.470 
sounds blend together as one so try out
try<00:02:43.890> using<00:02:44.100> that<00:02:44.250> right<00:02:44.520> pedal<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.060> sustain

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
try using that right pedal that sustain

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.740 
try using that right pedal that sustain
pedal<00:02:45.950> it's<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.040> cool<00:02:47.270> cool<00:02:48.270> feature<00:02:48.480> on<00:02:48.660> the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
pedal it's a cool cool feature on the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.330 
pedal it's a cool cool feature on the
piano<00:02:49.020> we<00:02:49.230> don't<00:02:49.380> always<00:02:49.530> talk<00:02:49.770> about<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:50.190> so

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
piano we don't always talk about it so

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.430 
piano we don't always talk about it so
there<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:50.940> go<00:02:51.120> all<00:02:51.720> right<00:02:51.780> now<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.020> also<00:02:52.290> have

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
there you go all right now I also have

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.160 
there you go all right now I also have
to<00:02:52.650> touch<00:02:52.830> on<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.400> alternate<00:02:54.360> version<00:02:55.050> of

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
to touch on the alternate version of

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.320 
to touch on the alternate version of
this<00:02:55.380> intro<00:02:55.920> which<00:02:56.130> happens<00:02:56.520> in<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.910> guitar

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
this intro which happens in the guitar

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.150 
this intro which happens in the guitar
solo<00:02:57.720> which<00:02:57.960> is<00:02:58.140> kind<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.590> interlude<00:02:59.010> and

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
solo which is kind of the interlude and

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:11.620 
solo which is kind of the interlude and
the<00:02:59.340> outro<00:02:59.790> and<00:02:59.820> that<00:03:00.060> sounds<00:03:00.390> like<00:03:00.420> this

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.960 

okay<00:03:12.630> so<00:03:12.690> what's<00:03:12.960> happening<00:03:13.320> there<00:03:13.770> is<00:03:13.970> the

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
okay so what's happening there is the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.790 
okay so what's happening there is the
left<00:03:15.180> hand<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.540> simply<00:03:15.690> following<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.560> right

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
left hand is simply following the right

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.620 
left hand is simply following the right
hand<00:03:17.070> cord<00:03:17.430> roots<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.690> we<00:03:18.780> start<00:03:18.990> on<00:03:19.080> D<00:03:19.260> minor

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
hand cord roots so we start on D minor

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.730 
hand cord roots so we start on D minor
now<00:03:21.630> when<00:03:21.750> we<00:03:21.840> move<00:03:21.990> this<00:03:22.110> right<00:03:22.350> hand<00:03:22.560> up<00:03:22.650> to

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
now when we move this right hand up to

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.470 
now when we move this right hand up to
an<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:23.010> minor<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.910> left<00:03:24.090> hand<00:03:24.240> is<00:03:24.330> going<00:03:24.360> to

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
an a minor the left hand is going to

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.370 
an a minor the left hand is going to
follow<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:25.020> route<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:25.860> down<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:27.290> when<00:03:28.290> the

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
follow that route so down to a when the

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.320 
follow that route so down to a when the
right<00:03:28.530> hand<00:03:28.710> moves<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:29.040> an<00:03:29.130> F<00:03:29.310> major<00:03:29.520> triad<00:03:30.120> the

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
right hand moves to an F major triad the

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.740 
right hand moves to an F major triad the
left<00:03:30.900> hand<00:03:31.110> follows<00:03:32.330> and<00:03:33.330> we<00:03:33.540> end<00:03:33.690> on<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.810> G

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
left hand follows and we end on a G

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.179 
left hand follows and we end on a G
so<00:03:36.750> it's<00:03:36.930> playing<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.379> left<00:03:37.650> hand<00:03:37.799> is<00:03:37.920> playing

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:38.189 
so it's playing the left hand is playing

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.099 
so it's playing the left hand is playing
the<00:03:38.340> corresponding<00:03:39.120> roots<00:03:39.420> of<00:03:39.629> the<00:03:39.930> right

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
the corresponding roots of the right

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:47.619 
the corresponding roots of the right
hand<00:03:40.379> cord<00:03:40.769> okay

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.780 

there<00:03:48.439> are<00:03:48.530> two<00:03:48.650> different<00:03:48.980> ways<00:03:49.129> to<00:03:49.519> go<00:03:49.700> about

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
there are two different ways to go about

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.539 
there are two different ways to go about
this<00:03:50.120> rhythmically<00:03:50.689> speaking<00:03:51.129> the<00:03:52.129> first<00:03:52.370> one

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
this rhythmically speaking the first one

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.069 
this rhythmically speaking the first one
is<00:03:52.639> the<00:03:52.760> way<00:03:52.849> that<00:03:53.030> I<00:03:53.090> initially<00:03:53.510> played<00:03:53.959> it

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
is the way that I initially played it

00:03:54.079 --> 00:04:00.929 
is the way that I initially played it
and<00:03:54.170> that<00:03:54.260> would<00:03:54.349> be<00:03:54.469> one<00:03:54.889> and<00:03:56.980> one<00:03:59.019> and

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
and that would be one and one and

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.379 
and that would be one and one and
following<00:04:01.939> the<00:04:02.299> chord<00:04:02.989> transitions

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
following the chord transitions

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:09.160 
following the chord transitions
rhythmically<00:04:05.389> so<00:04:05.799> playing<00:04:07.359> that<00:04:08.359> a<00:04:08.659> when<00:04:09.019> the

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
rhythmically so playing that a when the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.750 
rhythmically so playing that a when the
a<00:04:09.200> changes<00:04:09.920> and<00:04:10.900> then<00:04:11.900> that<00:04:12.079> G<00:04:12.409> when<00:04:13.340> that<00:04:13.519> G

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
a changes and then that G when that G

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.999 
a changes and then that G when that G
changes<00:04:13.969> the<00:04:14.569> other<00:04:14.750> way<00:04:15.019> to<00:04:15.079> play<00:04:15.319> it<00:04:15.530> would

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:16.009 
changes the other way to play it would

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:21.080 
changes the other way to play it would
be<00:04:16.190> like<00:04:16.340> this

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.560 

right<00:04:22.090> hand<00:04:22.330> stays<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.750> same

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.250 

left<00:04:26.200> hand<00:04:26.440> is<00:04:26.470> just<00:04:26.680> playing<00:04:26.920> quarter<00:04:27.310> notes

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
left hand is just playing quarter notes

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.330 
left hand is just playing quarter notes
okay<00:04:29.260> so<00:04:29.620> those<00:04:29.740> are<00:04:29.800> two<00:04:30.010> different<00:04:30.040> ways

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
okay so those are two different ways

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.040 
okay so those are two different ways
I'll<00:04:30.670> let<00:04:30.850> you<00:04:30.940> choose<00:04:31.240> whatever<00:04:31.510> is<00:04:31.750> easiest

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
the second variation with a different

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.760 
the second variation with a different
rhythm<00:04:40.090> in<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.330> left<00:04:40.510> hand<00:04:40.720> alright<00:04:41.590> so

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
here's the intro let's play it at studio

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:51.879 
here's the intro let's play it at studio
tempo<00:04:44.070> one<00:04:45.070> two<00:04:45.700> ready<00:04:46.360> intro

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.110 

repeat

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.120 

and<00:04:58.120> then<00:04:58.870> we're<00:04:59.020> on<00:04:59.110> to<00:04:59.259> the<00:04:59.380> verse<00:04:59.590> it's<00:04:59.919> just

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
and then we're on to the verse it's just

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.010 
and then we're on to the verse it's just
four<00:05:00.400> measures<00:05:00.729> along<00:05:00.910> that<00:05:01.150> intro<00:05:01.449> okay

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020

four measures along that intro okay
here's<00:05:02.229> the<00:05:02.349> variation<00:05:02.860> when<00:05:03.009> the<00:05:03.099> left<00:05:03.280> hand

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
here's the variation when the left hand

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:16.890 
here's the variation when the left hand
changes<00:05:03.910> with<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.479> right<00:05:04.660> hand<00:05:04.990> ready<00:05:05.650> and

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.110 

now<00:05:17.740> here's<00:05:17.980> the<00:05:18.100> other<00:05:18.280> variation<00:05:18.910> with<00:05:19.030> the

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
now here's the other variation with the

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.150 
now here's the other variation with the
left<00:05:19.330> hand<00:05:19.510> playing<00:05:19.870> quarter<00:05:20.200> notes<00:05:20.230> three

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
left hand playing quarter notes three

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.040 
left hand playing quarter notes three
four

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:33.559 

you

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:33.569 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:36.059 

all<00:05:34.569> right<00:05:34.780> so<00:05:35.020> that's<00:05:35.110> it<00:05:35.379> that's<00:05:35.560> the<00:05:35.710> entire

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.069 
all right so that's it that's the entire

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.890
