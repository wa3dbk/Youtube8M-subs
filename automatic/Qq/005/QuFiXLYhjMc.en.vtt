saboteur and how does it set itself

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.689 
saboteur and how does it set itself
apart<00:00:19.470> from<00:00:19.830> those<00:00:19.949> other<00:00:20.160> world<00:00:20.369> war<00:00:20.550> two

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
apart from those other world war two

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.460 
apart from those other world war two
games<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.630> something<00:00:21.810> really<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.289> made<00:00:22.439> a

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
games it's something really we made a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.529 
games it's something really we made a
very<00:00:22.650> conscious<00:00:22.890> decision<00:00:23.130> really<00:00:23.609> long<00:00:23.880> in

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
very conscious decision really long in

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.580 
very conscious decision really long in
the<00:00:24.689> developmen<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.109> project<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.500> we

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the developmen of the project that we

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.259 
the developmen of the project that we
originally<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.609> main<00:00:26.730> thing<00:00:26.760> originally

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
originally so the main thing originally

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.730 
originally so the main thing originally
was<00:00:27.390> just<00:00:27.570> separating<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.050> story<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:28.560> not

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
was just separating the story it's not

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.140 
was just separating the story it's not
the<00:00:28.800> game's<00:00:28.949> not<00:00:29.070> about<00:00:29.340> being<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.910> soldier

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the game's not about being a soldier

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.299 
the game's not about being a soldier
it's<00:00:30.660> your<00:00:30.779> about<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> race<00:00:31.650> car<00:00:31.859> driver<00:00:31.920> turn

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
it's your about a race car driver turn

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.310 
it's your about a race car driver turn
saboteur<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.200> that's

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
saboteur and so that that and that's

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.630 
saboteur and so that that and that's
actually<00:00:34.410> inspired<00:00:34.860> by<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> real<00:00:35.130> world<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
actually inspired by a real world the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.160 
actually inspired by a real world the
hero<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.149> named<00:00:36.420> William<00:00:36.690> cover<00:00:36.899> Williams

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
hero and named William cover Williams

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.440 
hero and named William cover Williams
and<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.829> we<00:00:37.920> started<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.910> so

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
and so we started with that and and so

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.490 
and so we started with that and and so
we<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.690> just<00:00:39.840> kept<00:00:40.050> wanting<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.290> kind<00:00:40.410> of

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
we really just kept wanting to kind of

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.959 
we really just kept wanting to kind of
separate<00:00:40.890> ourselves<00:00:41.010> from<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.430> war<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.640> so

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
separate ourselves from the war and so

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.150 
separate ourselves from the war and so
our<00:00:42.660> games<00:00:42.840> not<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> front<00:00:43.559> lines<00:00:43.739> it's

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
our games not in the front lines it's

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.459 
our games not in the front lines it's
more<00:00:44.430> like<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.870> blockbuster<00:00:45.870> action<00:00:46.050> movie

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
more like a blockbuster action movie

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.840

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
you're not used to seeing this kind of

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.540 
you're not used to seeing this kind of
space<00:01:01.050> describe<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.250> bit<00:01:02.370> more<00:01:02.489> detail

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
space describe that in a bit more detail

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.640 
space describe that in a bit more detail
that<00:01:03.120> will<00:01:03.300> define<00:01:03.480> mechanic<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.170> how<00:01:04.260> it

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
that will define mechanic and how it

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.410 
that will define mechanic and how it
changes<00:01:05.040> over<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> course<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.700> game<00:01:05.820> so

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
changes over the course of the game so

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.609 
changes over the course of the game so
the<00:01:06.510> concept<00:01:06.840> for<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.080> willow<00:01:07.229> fight<00:01:07.409> came

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the concept for the willow fight came

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.530 
the concept for the willow fight came
one<00:01:07.799> basically<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.909> knew<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.270> were<00:01:09.330> gonna<00:01:09.390> do

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
one basically we knew we were gonna do

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.450 
one basically we knew we were gonna do
occupied<00:01:09.930> Paris<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.799> think<00:01:10.979> about<00:01:11.070> Paris

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
occupied Paris and you think about Paris

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.620 
occupied Paris and you think about Paris
when<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.670> close<00:01:11.850> your<00:01:11.880> eyes<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.450> this

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
when you close your eyes and have this

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.020 
when you close your eyes and have this
beautiful<00:01:12.900> vibrant<00:01:13.830> colorful<00:01:14.369> lively<00:01:14.880> city

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
beautiful vibrant colorful lively city

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.850 
beautiful vibrant colorful lively city
but<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:15.960> put<00:01:16.110> Nazis<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.590> there<00:01:16.710> it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
but if you just put Nazis in there it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.530 
but if you just put Nazis in there it
doesn't<00:01:17.070> feel<00:01:17.340> occupied<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.330> really

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
doesn't feel occupied and so we really

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.999 
doesn't feel occupied and so we really
had<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.689> kind<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.930> turn<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.259> over<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.710> Ted

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
had to kind of turn that over on Ted

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.530 
had to kind of turn that over on Ted
that's<00:01:20.700> where<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:20.880> came<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.299> idea<00:01:21.360> of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
that's where we came up the idea of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.850 
that's where we came up the idea of

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
doing black and white and so it

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.289 
doing black and white and so it
literally<00:01:23.130> kind<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.490> sucking<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.970> life<00:01:24.119> out

wanted we wanted to put something

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:49.890 
wanted we wanted to put something
literally<00:02:48.910> on<00:02:49.030> every<00:02:49.299> block<00:02:49.480> in<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.750> game

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
literally on every block in the game

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.660 
literally on every block in the game
something<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.290> do<00:02:50.379> everywhere<00:02:50.829> and<00:02:51.010> so<00:02:51.160> what

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
something to do everywhere and so what

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.069 
something to do everywhere and so what
we<00:02:51.730> did<00:02:51.819> is<00:02:51.879> we<00:02:52.000> started<00:02:52.420> by<00:02:52.510> scaling<00:02:52.810> down<00:02:52.930> a

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
we did is we started by scaling down a

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.600 
we did is we started by scaling down a
map<00:02:53.349> of<00:02:53.560> Paris<00:02:53.829> and<00:02:53.920> building<00:02:54.340> all<00:02:54.489> the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
map of Paris and building all the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.160 
map of Paris and building all the
monuments<00:02:54.879> to<00:02:55.180> real<00:02:55.360> world<00:02:55.569> scale<00:02:55.870> and

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
monuments to real world scale and

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.390 
monuments to real world scale and
putting<00:02:56.440> them<00:02:56.530> where<00:02:56.590> they<00:02:56.769> belong<00:02:57.040> on<00:02:57.220> this

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
putting them where they belong on this

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.339 
putting them where they belong on this
map<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.239> get<00:02:58.480> as<00:02:58.599> a<00:02:58.629> almost<00:02:59.110> like<00:02:59.230> a

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
map so you get as a almost like a

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:00.630 
map so you get as a almost like a
Disneyland<00:02:59.769> version<00:03:00.040> Paris<00:03:00.310> where<00:03:00.459> things

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
Disneyland version Paris where things

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.619 
Disneyland version Paris where things
are<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.760> little<00:03:00.879> bit<00:03:01.030> closer<00:03:01.239> than<00:03:01.569> they

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
are a little bit closer than they

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.030 
are a little bit closer than they
actually<00:03:01.750> are<00:03:01.930> but<00:03:02.200> what's<00:03:02.620> cool<00:03:02.769> about<00:03:02.829> that

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
actually are but what's cool about that

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.770 
actually are but what's cool about that
as<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.220> see<00:03:03.549> these<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:04.060> see<00:03:04.209> a<00:03:04.239> monument<00:03:04.690> from

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
as you see these you see a monument from

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.850 
as you see these you see a monument from
every<00:03:05.049> other<00:03:05.140> monument<00:03:05.560> so<00:03:05.650> they<00:03:05.739> become

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
every other monument so they become

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.699 
every other monument so they become
navigation<00:03:06.579> tools<00:03:06.849> and<00:03:07.030> then<00:03:07.569> from<00:03:07.750> there<00:03:07.930> one

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
navigation tools and then from there one

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.140 
navigation tools and then from there one
of<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:08.889> last<00:03:09.010> key<00:03:09.250> things<00:03:09.489> is<00:03:09.579> just<00:03:09.760> it's<00:03:09.940> kind

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
of the last key things is just it's kind

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.940 
of the last key things is just it's kind
of<00:03:10.180> part<00:03:10.329> of<00:03:10.420> our<00:03:10.630> Odin<00:03:10.900> engine<00:03:11.139> and<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.769> allows

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
of part of our Odin engine and it allows

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.800 
of part of our Odin engine and it allows
us<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.250> render<00:03:12.489> this<00:03:12.609> ways<00:03:12.790> we<00:03:13.329> built<00:03:13.569> all<00:03:13.720> the

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
us to render this ways we built all the

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.449 
us to render this ways we built all the
buildings<00:03:14.109> out<00:03:14.230> of<00:03:14.319> kind<00:03:14.470> of<00:03:14.500> LEGO<00:03:14.769> pieces<00:03:14.889> and

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
buildings out of kind of LEGO pieces and

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.849 
buildings out of kind of LEGO pieces and
and<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:16.090> every<00:03:16.450> building<00:03:16.780> then<00:03:17.470> we<00:03:17.590> put<00:03:17.769> those

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
and so every building then we put those

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:18.930 
and so every building then we put those
down<00:03:18.010> in<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.220> world<00:03:18.370> this<00:03:18.459> is<00:03:18.609> our<00:03:18.730> current

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
down in the world this is our current

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.520 
down in the world this is our current
collections<00:03:19.299> and<00:03:19.810> then<00:03:19.900> from<00:03:20.049> there<00:03:20.230> we<00:03:20.410> could

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
collections and then from there we could

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.960 
collections and then from there we could
swap<00:03:20.799> them<00:03:21.010> out<00:03:21.069> and<00:03:21.190> give<00:03:21.280> every<00:03:21.670> single

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
swap them out and give every single

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.699 
swap them out and give every single
block<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:22.510> its<00:03:22.720> own<00:03:22.840> personality<00:03:23.349> and<00:03:23.560> add

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
block and its own personality and add

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.080 
block and its own personality and add
little<00:03:23.950> accents<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.579> details<00:03:24.849> and<00:03:25.000> so

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
little accents and details and so

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.370 
little accents and details and so
literally<00:03:25.359> every<00:03:25.569> block<00:03:25.780> has<00:03:25.959> a<00:03:25.989> different

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
literally every block has a different

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.020 
literally every block has a different
kind<00:03:26.500> of<00:03:26.560> flavor<00:03:26.799> and<00:03:26.889> feel<00:03:27.099> to<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.310> how<00:03:27.880> much
