00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.450
 good product in this case here this 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.139
 background that would be the container where they come 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.300
 are four macadamia products 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.230
 natural today 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.529
 I leave you teaching what the four are 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.329
 products that are good both 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.519
 macadamia main products 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.739
 natural today are the oil that is 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:38.930
 found in the seed of the nut of 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.820
 macadamia and argan oil good 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.350
 what are we going to achieve with this one with this 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.180
 product 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.339
 for all types of hair especially 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.649
 for hair that is drier and 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.949
 chemically treated by dyes from 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.620
 color permanent actions of curly 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:59.940
 then in this line comes a shampoo 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.949
 a mask an oil and then a 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.619
 product that is a bit like a product 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.390
 of hairstyle I 've already tried it on what 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.850
 I liked most it is that I stopped 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.020
 side what is the foam ever 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.220
 you have seen in a video how I 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.960
 applied some cream product to 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.000
 curly hair work with diffuser 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.310
 good in this case with these 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.380
 products I have not needed to use 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.920
 day plus the foam so I do not get that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.470
 little white face that sometimes 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.460
 the good foam has touched me much more 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.860
 silky my curl is still well marked as 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.100
 more hydrated with more brightness so 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.400
 good the products that come in 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.119
 in what would be in the package we have 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.369
 on the one hand the shampoo on the other hand 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.520
 we have the mask that I for example 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.280
 the other day I applied it do not apply 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.899
 less amount do not clarify and work 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.990
 with the diffuser and I also had the 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.360
 hair very well and then we have 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.640
 these two products that are for a 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.670
 which would be the one that would be the 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.850
 product to comb well though 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.250
 we want smooth although we want to take it 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.239
 curly is like a product of a cream 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.130
 of hairstyle and then we have the oil yo 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.290
 for example I give it before drying and 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.630
 then after drying with a little bit and 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.650
 I return to give are products the truth 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.840
 that not in fat 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.880
 you know the hair I just washed it and 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.500
 me age and there is not that hair that 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.420
 Sometimes you give yourself some oils and you see 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.010
 like the hair as if it would be dirty 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.920
 ok it will be very hydrated but that 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.730
 aspect of oil other than a soft tube 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.239
 for 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.760
 for hair with that dry texture 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.920
 but with brightness and hair is 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.099
 hydrated so even for hair 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.170
 Smooth goes well before drying or 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.940
 Even after dry I've already 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.730
 commented is a product that I like 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.379
 So much with this product already 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.299
 it is a product also now every summer 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.549
 I who wear color especially in the 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.280
 tips, look, I have it hydrated and 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.750
 the hair is very good then I do not 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.519
 had coiled in talking about 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.829
 ingredients of the product I already told you 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.810
 the most important in the end what 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.859
 they work mostly they are oils but they are 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.109
 oils that do not soak the hair and do not 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.940
 what greases that is something important 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.670
 because when we look for products from 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.530
 oil gives us many times fear because 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.870
 can greasy us and in this case 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.299
 even by the root I give myself for all the 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.030
 hair the product and if you see is not 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.620
 it is for nothing because of fat sensation and 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.210
 by not using foam now, it does not come out 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.300
 that white castilla 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.910
 good if you want to know something more of 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.040
 very easy product you have them in 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.320
 facebook you just have to put macadamia 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.020
 Spain you can give me a like 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.150
 Any question you want to ask me 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.760
 I do not make this video because they 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.130
 directly do not sell to the customer 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.650
 final if they do not sell to beauty salons 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.630
 then if you are interested and want 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.480
 know where they sell it in your city 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.490
 with your or near your town 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.710
 you simply write to them I am 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.480
 interested where they sell it in madrid 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:05.380
 where they sell it in valencia in barcelona 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.050
 and they will go and if you want to know 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.300
 some little thing more also because you have the 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.260
 website that the website is 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:16.510

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.420
 advance that the madrid have it in a 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.510

 you write where you can find it for 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.920
 beauty salons the truth that it seems 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.670
 a product to have for the customer 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.530
 final that you will not regret since 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.800
 it's a product I at least tried it 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.780
 and I have loved a product for 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.850
 those people who ask you for extra 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.030
 hydration those wicks their sorrows that 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.820

 Skull does not need to get to everything 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.380
 those tips is a product that is not going 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.770
 to contribute no fat so good 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.740
 I already shut up and nothing because I hope that 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.510
 It has been helpful to know some 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.730
 product more within the theme of the 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:25.040
