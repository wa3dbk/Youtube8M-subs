for me that losing really had no effect
on<00:02:05.670> me<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.850> didn't<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:06.180> care<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.570> we<00:02:06.719> won<00:02:06.869> or

have<00:05:57.120> done<00:05:57.240> and<00:05:57.890> I<00:05:58.890> don't<00:05:59.250> know<00:05:59.490> I<00:05:59.520> just<00:05:59.669> I<00:06:00.000> feel

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
have done and I don't know I just I feel

have done and I don't know I just I feel
like<00:06:00.479> if<00:06:00.750> more<00:06:01.140> people<00:06:01.500> knew<00:06:01.530> about<00:06:01.710> this<00:06:02.160> you

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
like if more people knew about this you

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.590 
like if more people knew about this you
would<00:06:02.550> understand<00:06:03.650> what<00:06:04.650> what<00:06:05.130> makes<00:06:05.820> you<00:06:06.060> sad

what<00:06:06.870> makes<00:06:07.050> you<00:06:07.140> happy<00:06:07.320> why<00:06:07.979> winning<00:06:08.910> is

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
what makes you happy why winning is

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.000 
what makes you happy why winning is
teaching<00:06:09.510> and<00:06:09.690> losing<00:06:10.169> is<00:06:10.260> learning<00:06:10.650> and<00:06:10.800> and

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
teaching and losing is learning and and

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.180 
teaching and losing is learning and and
you<00:06:11.610> can<00:06:11.820> learn<00:06:12.090> more<00:06:12.150> things<00:06:12.750> from<00:06:13.620> losing

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
and that's just my opinion but it it's

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.900 
and that's just my opinion but it it's
it's<00:06:18.960> the<00:06:19.050> way<00:06:19.260> things<00:06:19.320> have<00:06:19.710> gone<00:06:19.740> from<00:06:20.070> me<00:06:20.280> so
