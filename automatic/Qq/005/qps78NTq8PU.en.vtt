00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.760
 a bit like that 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.779
 purely in the topic of sexism 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.849
 I am a specialist if you will 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.070
 seriously now well i have myself 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.949
 already busy for a while 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.769
 There is a title of as the witch like 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.270
 you are now has come out 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:35.720
 So we are a band so I am 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.420
 play in a band with and the power 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.210
 a music that is very hard music 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.890
 a little bit 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.219
 trying to explain what 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.420
 it is still musical in Europe 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.920
 there are a lot of roots 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.160
 interesting instruments in our 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.219
 band bagpipe hurdy-gardy louder 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.030
 such wise the medieval 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.350
 medieval instruments if you like that 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.699
 but we want to do it we are now 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.109
 not a band trying that 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.839
 to revive medieval 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.699
 but for us it is more interesting 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.340
 as for example hip hop or 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.369
 any other things certainly 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.290
 Chic found and searched and are 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:18.200
 then properly disturbed somehow without 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.700
 without thinking and also gives people 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.659
 So what do they say for that ? 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.950
 that's a little bit 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.270
 stupid and so have you ever 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.860
 had to struggle with 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.439
 defamatory things again 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.820
 So now there is also in the industry 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.619
 itself yes of course 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.240
 So there is a lot in this industry 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.890
 jealous of the bands among themselves 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.040
 is always very bad over each other 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.540
 Talked and it is so that you too 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.799
 sometimes wrong drawer is infected 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.869
 to judge the people very superficially 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.490
 but he has to say so quarter 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.899
 have not seen it that way for a long time 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.909
 bad has've completely experienced so 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.409
 have much worse in the industry 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.229
 you do not experience something like that for a long time 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.130
 So long is what you are 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.409
 experienced that I long not so bad 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.200
 like everything here was so clear 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.820
 yes but there is there is the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.109
 sometimes get within the family 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.590
 that you are inside a house 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:04.820
 is that's all there is me 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.109
 I would like to and certainly also the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.399
 others like to hear something from you 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.320
 have brought the rest of his band 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.789
 because you have to do the chairs something 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.140
 clear away so that the band has space because 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.220
 she is a world of performance 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.800
