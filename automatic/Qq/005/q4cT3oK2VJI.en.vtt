00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
screen milk flex by screen made this is

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.009 
screen milk flex by screen made this is
a<00:00:12.849> flexible<00:00:13.299> tempered<00:00:13.809> glass<00:00:13.839> screen

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
a flexible tempered glass screen

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.930 
a flexible tempered glass screen
protector<00:00:14.650> so<00:00:15.009> that's<00:00:15.160> a<00:00:15.250> good<00:00:15.400> closer<00:00:15.669> look

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
protector so that's a good closer look

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.030 
protector so that's a good closer look
so<00:00:16.600> first<00:00:16.870> up<00:00:17.050> this<00:00:17.200> screen<00:00:17.410> protector<00:00:17.830> has<00:00:17.890> an

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
so first up this screen protector has an

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.440 
so first up this screen protector has an
8<00:00:18.250> h<00:00:18.730> hardness<00:00:19.360> it<00:00:19.780> does<00:00:20.110> go<00:00:20.320> up<00:00:20.590> to<00:00:20.770> 9<00:00:21.010> h<00:00:21.250> and<00:00:21.550> so

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
8 h hardness it does go up to 9 h and so

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.150 
8 h hardness it does go up to 9 h and so
is<00:00:22.690> quite<00:00:22.930> resilient<00:00:23.200> it's<00:00:23.500> just<00:00:23.710> slightly

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
is quite resilient it's just slightly

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.430 
is quite resilient it's just slightly
lower<00:00:24.550> because<00:00:24.910> of<00:00:25.030> the<00:00:25.180> flex<00:00:25.960> paleness<00:00:26.110> and

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.440 
lower because of the flex paleness and

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.620 
lower because of the flex paleness and
it<00:00:27.250> still<00:00:27.460> is<00:00:27.580> just<00:00:27.940> as<00:00:28.060> resilient<00:00:28.330> it

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
it still is just as resilient it

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.720 
it still is just as resilient it

with a couple of different cases and it
worked<00:02:16.450> at<00:02:16.600> most<00:02:16.840> some<00:02:17.350> snap<00:02:17.710> on<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.890> back

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010
