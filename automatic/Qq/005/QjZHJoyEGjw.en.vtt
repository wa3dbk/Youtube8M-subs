00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970

really<00:03:11.600> want<00:03:12.020> to<00:03:12.140> want<00:03:12.500> more<00:03:12.650> than<00:03:12.709> anything

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
really want to want more than anything

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.460 
really want to want more than anything
to<00:03:13.250> win<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.610> NBA<00:03:13.790> championship<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:15.110> think

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
to win the NBA championship so I think

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.650 
to win the NBA championship so I think
this<00:03:15.800> is<00:03:16.010> an<00:03:16.250> organization<00:03:17.090> where<00:03:17.239> it<00:03:17.330> can<00:03:17.510> be

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
this is an organization where it can be

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.509 
this is an organization where it can be
done<00:03:17.870> you<00:03:18.050> have<00:03:18.080> support<00:03:18.739> from<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:19.040> top<00:03:19.220> down

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
done you have support from the top down

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.640 
done you have support from the top down
I<00:03:19.790> think<00:03:20.269> it<00:03:20.540> starts<00:03:20.840> with<00:03:20.900> ownership<00:03:21.290> and

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
I think it starts with ownership and

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.500 
I think it starts with ownership and
management<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:22.280> I<00:03:22.519> think<00:03:22.910> these<00:03:23.030> guys<00:03:23.239> do<00:03:23.480> a

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
management and I think these guys do a

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.150 
management and I think these guys do a
great<00:03:23.750> job<00:03:23.959> here<00:03:24.019> and<00:03:24.350> that's<00:03:24.530> why<00:03:24.680> why<00:03:25.100> the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
great job here and that's why why the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.130 
great job here and that's why why the
teams<00:03:25.459> have<00:03:25.610> been<00:03:25.640> so<00:03:25.880> competitive<00:03:26.239> but<00:03:26.690> as

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140
