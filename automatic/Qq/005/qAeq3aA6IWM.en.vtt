00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.740
 knew that in large farms that operate in an industrial 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.090
 selection of crosses affects in a very judicious way 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.009
 some breeders have specialized in breeding especially 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:20.359
 for playback 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.769
 are bulls that have in their genotype the characteristics desired by the 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.570
 cattle ranchers for high milk yields one of the genes that determine 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.429
 with weight gain 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.539
 these bulls we collect without any of these bulls divide in doses and sell 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.470
 for other farmers 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.310
 I do not know 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.940
 in the semae are the spermatozoa 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.910
 those who carry them as subjects that in turn carry the genes 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.360
 Why did you learn all this? 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.320
 for me i had to learn 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.250
 in fact it was that I was here with great value 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.160
 one of them came weak weakly no team finished 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.560
 and he explained all this to me 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.650
 that I even had to apply handling techniques and make crossings 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.440
 selected 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.070
 now from now on I'm only going to buy the good breeding seed 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.460
 Do you really think that doing artificial insemination? 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.800
 were able to produce more milk 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.360
 if it's a very good thing 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.380
 no doubt 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.380
 increases production 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.770
 one month 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.970
 game with good said 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.560
 and you will think that through the combination of genes as it happens in the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.579
 selection of crosses gives us apps north that those of greater interest 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.130
 to answer this question we need to know a little more about how 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.080
 are transmitted 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.880
 characteristics they dis 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.010
 to simplify 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.850
 we will consider that milk production is conditioned because in a 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.070
 single pair of jeans 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.900
 just so you know is actually a group of several clients 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.520
 let's use 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.429
 air marlos out or action when the cli determines the high production of milk 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.239
 and a lowercase or so when it can determine low 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.829
 milk as you have seen today it is similar to the parents in the 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:18.859
 individuals 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:22.169
 with the exception of the targets that have a pendant each pair 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.539
 therefore each individual will have two of them for the production of milk 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:31.179
 we will now consider some possible crosses by looking only at 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:34.379
 this pair of sneakers in piripiri 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.120
 of crossing an idol as management action local action 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.580
 that determine the high production of milk with a knife is how they say action 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.709
 action is so high that they determine high milk production 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.909
 we will have a baby with genes of high milk production also white 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:57.799
 also pepe of life already if we have taken care of and a vacancy thus the city of 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.599
 bruges that indicate that in low milk production we will also have a 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.139
 creates almost empty 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.549
 pp reports the text of low milk production 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.820
 now the previous question whether the cow several high-producing films 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.840
 you do not have in our country the production of milk powder which will be 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.699
 that a genotype as these determinants 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:22.069
 some genes are able to manifest their characteristics even when their 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.079
 different father 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.589
 that means here 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:25.709
 the avaÃ­ we 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.379
 or action is able to determine the high milk yield even though its par 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.449
 be one 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:33.769
 or less 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.769
 consequently individuals of genotype 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.779
 the action 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:43.389
 they produce too much milk as well as undue genotype 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.619
 only that there are lands to explain all this better 

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:53.619
 and that's what you'll see now 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:03.009
 when a genius is able to manifest itself or to produce the 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:06.540
 characteristic that determines even when its to different 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.329
 we said that he is a dominant genius because his effect predominates over 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.399
 other 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:17.109
 already a 'tiny wave' called the recessive gene and it is only capable of 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.100
 manifest its effect when your boat is the same 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.700
 when we refer to genes from the same party we speak in Christmas and light the 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.580
 uppercase and lowercase 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.489
 form a pair of alleles ie the uppercase is a German donate tiny 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.689
 when the two alleles of the bar are the same we said that the individual is as if the 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:38.409
 other 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:42.979
 already when one of the alleles is different from the other we speak due end and until having the 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:44.610
 second shift 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.879
 and humans will it be possible to change the phenotype of beings 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:49.640
 humans 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.640
 Let's see it in practice. 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.180
 when it was born due to breakdowns but the forces in the leg and arm 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.370
 the guild as here 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.409
 another on the leg 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.469
 but then she went through a series of plastic surgeries 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.139
 which altered its phenotype by failing to have birthmarks 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:18.840
 this year by title 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.960
 will be that the selection of crosses and the only way to change 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.189
 the cianorte that one of the individuals 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:26.620
 have you heard 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.680
 genetic engineering and hygiene therapy 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.479
 are things that you always see in the newspapers and magazines that 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.520
 exactly the operation 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.800
 of the genotype of living beings 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.599
 You'll still have lots of stories about it. 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.649
 only now you will understand all this better when drying out with the review 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.289
 and attention turns on the day the time of the review 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.590
 natali allas of today you learn a little more about the genotype that the 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.550
 phenotype of living things 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.560
 saw that there are ways to change the phenotype of living things 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:03.529
 because the phenotypic characteristics depend on external factors but also 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:06.080
 of the genetic makeup of the individual 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.150
 and he saw 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.520
 that there are some procedures to increase the chances of getting 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.710
 have finished desired genotypes 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.710
 when we create 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.309
 And how are the animals? 

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:17.480
 good studies 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.130
 see you next time
