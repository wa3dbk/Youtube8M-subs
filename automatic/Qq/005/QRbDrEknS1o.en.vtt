 a living room that I created last year 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.000
 on a crazy idea that was 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.650
 revive a living room that existed there 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.119
 y to a hundred years ago and who 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.340
 was called the salon of painters and 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.340
 hunting and hunting sculptors with 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.430
 africa 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.140
 since the facts one must remember 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.940
 from the 1930s to the time of the group of 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.640
 twelve sandoz pompon etc 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.530

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.230
 animal artists and we find 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.640
