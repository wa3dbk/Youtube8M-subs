face with a mattifying powder and this
is<00:04:35.270> key<00:04:35.600> when<00:04:35.870> doing<00:04:36.200> a<00:04:36.350> Bollywood<00:04:36.980> look

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
is key when doing a Bollywood look

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.280 
is key when doing a Bollywood look
because<00:04:37.550> you<00:04:37.730> want<00:04:38.030> that<00:04:38.240> matte<00:04:38.570> skin<00:04:39.020> and

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
because you want that matte skin and

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.200 
because you want that matte skin and
setting<00:04:40.040> it<00:04:40.160> is<00:04:40.280> going<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.550> keep<00:04:40.730> the<00:04:40.880> makeup

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
setting it is going to keep the makeup

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.810 
setting it is going to keep the makeup
from<00:04:41.480> moving<00:04:42.190> next<00:04:43.190> i'm<00:04:43.340> rimming<00:04:43.669> the

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
from moving next i'm rimming the

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.090 
from moving next i'm rimming the
waterline<00:04:44.330> and<00:04:44.570> drawn<00:04:44.960> on<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.410> lower<00:04:45.740> lash

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
waterline and drawn on the lower lash

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.970 
waterline and drawn on the lower lash
line<00:04:46.130> with<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.730> black<00:04:46.870> pencil<00:04:47.870> liner<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:48.470> this

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
line with a black pencil liner and this

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.280 
line with a black pencil liner and this
is<00:04:49.190> another<00:04:49.639> important<00:04:50.330> step<00:04:50.690> because<00:04:50.870> this

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
is another important step because this

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.770 
is another important step because this
look<00:04:51.560> is<00:04:51.710> all<00:04:51.980> about<00:04:52.090> strong<00:04:53.090> heavy<00:04:53.389> liner

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
look is all about strong heavy liner

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.170 
look is all about strong heavy liner
then<00:04:54.530> I'm<00:04:54.680> using<00:04:54.830> that<00:04:55.130> liquid<00:04:55.580> liner<00:04:55.760> again

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
then I'm using that liquid liner again

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.480 
then I'm using that liquid liner again
to<00:04:56.360> bring<00:04:56.510> that<00:04:56.720> top<00:04:57.080> liner<00:04:57.380> out<00:04:57.680> to<00:04:58.190> make<00:04:58.340> a

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
to bring that top liner out to make a

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.070 
to bring that top liner out to make a
wing<00:04:58.790> in<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.120> inner<00:04:59.270> tear-duct

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
wing in the inner tear-duct

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.500 
wing in the inner tear-duct
and<00:05:00.380> connecting<00:05:01.070> it<00:05:01.190> to<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:01.460> waterline<00:05:01.760> this

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
and connecting it to the waterline this

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.080 
and connecting it to the waterline this
is<00:05:02.720> a<00:05:02.750> really<00:05:03.380> distinct<00:05:04.040> trend<00:05:04.310> in<00:05:04.490> Bollywood

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
is a really distinct trend in Bollywood

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.290 
is a really distinct trend in Bollywood
that<00:05:05.300> makes<00:05:05.540> the<00:05:05.720> girls<00:05:05.990> look<00:05:06.260> so<00:05:06.710> bold<00:05:07.370> to<00:05:07.729> go

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
that makes the girls look so bold to go

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.300 
that makes the girls look so bold to go

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
one step further I'm going to grab that

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.610 
one step further I'm going to grab that
