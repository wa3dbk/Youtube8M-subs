with water the way that these worked and
I<00:01:18.299> also<00:01:18.570> i<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.409> probably<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
I also i know this is probably not a

I also i know this is probably not a
good<00:01:21.119> thing<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.630> prefer<00:01:22.229> my<00:01:22.670> facial

it probably means that there's lots of
fragrances<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.640> there<00:01:29.790> but<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.030> really<00:01:30.329> don't

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
fact that they didn't smell good or have

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.100 
fact that they didn't smell good or have
any<00:01:59.460> fragrance<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.240> them<00:02:00.390> just<00:02:00.840> kind<00:02:01.079> of

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
any fragrance to them just kind of

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.219 
any fragrance to them just kind of
bothered<00:02:01.560> me<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.610> made<00:02:02.820> them<00:02:03.210> even<00:02:03.450> less

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
bothered me and it made them even less

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.530 
bothered me and it made them even less
appealing<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.860> use<00:02:05.100> bare<00:02:05.759> minerals<00:02:06.149> products

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
appealing to use bare minerals products

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.059 
appealing to use bare minerals products
are<00:02:06.630> supposed<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:06.960> really<00:02:07.140> natural<00:02:07.860> with<00:02:08.039> a

lot of chemicals or fragrances in them

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.420 
lot of chemicals or fragrances in them
so<00:02:10.640> I'm<00:02:10.820> wondering<00:02:11.000> if<00:02:11.390> that's<00:02:11.600> why<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:12.740> didn't

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
so I'm wondering if that's why I didn't

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.780 
so I'm wondering if that's why I didn't
like<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.260> kind<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.290> lack<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:15.590> smell<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.700> the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
like the kind of lack of smell and the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.580 
like the kind of lack of smell and the
fact<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.570> didn't<00:02:17.810> really<00:02:17.930> do<00:02:18.320> anything

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
fact that it didn't really do anything

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
fact that it didn't really do anything
to<00:02:18.860> my<00:02:18.980> skin<00:02:19.430> um<00:02:20.590> maybe<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.950> just<00:02:22.250> need<00:02:22.580> a
