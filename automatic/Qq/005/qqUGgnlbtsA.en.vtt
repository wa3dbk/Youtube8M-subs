00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.650
 and beautiful all the guys here cloth of 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.809
 only return with this new comment 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.250
 of this channel of the gtf clan e 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.859
 Today, guys, I think it's the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.680
 first time I comment you a gameplay 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.109
 in the morning because today is the first 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.240
 June and I tell you the truth mine 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.160
 team did not bridge these though 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.109
 cases who the fuck you whisk us to go to 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.030
 school seriously let's talk about why 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.320
 then in the end on days like these a 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.930
 school doesn't get a shit why 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.879
 however it is a day where one would be 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.290
 could make school ready at the end 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.719
 the teachers did not do so 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.090
 they know they know that boys do 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.670
 would rebel against any form of 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.450
 lesson within days like 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.190
 these 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.620
 so if you want my advice a 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.940
 school do not go there do not escape because 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.770
 the end the escapes the beautiful ones are 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.070
 those you do on important days 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.879
 school not when they go to school not 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.399
 gets fucked 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.250
 so if you want advice from me it is 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.040
 been home sleep and enjoy yours 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.580
 sleep enjoy the morning not to do 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.860
 a fuck 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.350
 now it's 11.40am I woke up 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.850
 like half an hour ago and I heard about the group 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.780
 of the dredd clan who told me there is 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.810
 a comment to make 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.460
 then I took advantage of the opportunity on 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.710
 gameplay that we bring you guys today in 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.210
 leg is made from good gtf time and yes 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.590
 it is a 82 gastric made with lmb 11 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.060
 weapon that I honestly do not know though 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.009
 from what he sees from the video it does not appear 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.320
 be very strong then the gameplay 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.900
 assumes an even higher value among 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.960
 the other is also made in flores or 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.549
 the final result on 80 70 five 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.680
 which are among the many discrepancies 2 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.659
 ganz trick and the end result are 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.130
 obviously the keys of the DNA that is time 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.899
 exaggerated 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.460
 so guys that every life leave a 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.259
 nice i like it because this gameplay 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.259
 I think it's really really absurd 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.670
 and anyway yes even if advanced to do 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.710
 in the end then not like it does not like then 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.750
 so much that standing this kind 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.369
 they are beautiful on any goal in my opinion 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.090
 so I invite you to leave a nice me 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.780
 like it 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.700
 the goal is 500 as usual 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.410
 Today I wanted to talk to you guys about 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.849
 a slightly unusual topic they live on 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.360
 talk about the pasta crises for then 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.920
 then read one 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.180
 because I do all this because of me 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.650
 however, it looks like a nice idea for 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.780
 fill in these seven minutes of 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.160
 commentaries I have you busy and I believe that 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.390
 however it may interest you because of the 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.410
 end she only passes here stories that 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.090
 packs and like 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.700
 for the uninitiated what do acre 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.410
 It goes right I'll briefly introduce 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.690
 because in the end there is not much to say 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.040
 on the tv pasta practically passing you 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.340
 obviously for i is a term that derives 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.590
 from English and means copy in meal 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.720
 radically only the union of creepy and 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.950
 copy and paste as a pass what it wants 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.930
 to say means obviously copy paste 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.250
 and why they are called copy paste 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.250
 they are called that happen to the why 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.520
 they are stories that come that they do 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.350
 success in this way practically if 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.750
 one reads a beautiful story the copy from 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.860
 a site of the charge on another site e 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.860
 etc 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.590
 the story becomes viral and the sphere neither 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.239
 later it will become famous and then 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.950
 the term as kneading is a 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.270
 obviously to krypi which means 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.680
 scary but I believe that more or 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.750
 the less you all know 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.989
 so guys I wanted you today 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.060
 read a pasta crisis we say not 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.160
 however let's say the story is still famous 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.500
 you know bloody mary 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.840
 all those who have not tried to evoke 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.010
 bloody mary in the mirror throughout the 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.780
 his life and sincerely tried 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.799
 so many many times there are never 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.380
 succeeded 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.239
 so I know but I still hope to 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.000
 not to evoke it because in the end it does not 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.610
 I understand why people try try 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.620
 summon these demons I also don't 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.269
 sincerely I understand it myself because it is 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.110
 just try to do these things because 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.610
 never the end 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.120
 fuck if you call a demon then it's a 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.840
 casino but boh in the end the man is 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.049
 attracted to these things 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.330
 from these things I sincerely believe that 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.400
 be it human ingenuity or something 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.430
 because it's definitely not a smart thing 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.170
 the deal, however, is something that attracts 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.100
 however guys I apologize if you 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.900
 my reading will not be perfect however I am 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.299
 very very cool I know it looks 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.390
 ridiculous to say June 1 though 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.519
 when you shower football and then 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.440
 I knew two hours with wet hair 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.620
 you can understand you can believe me 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.729
 colds come to us anyway we begin 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.340
 with the reading of history that 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.990
 only a short choice 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.900
 because it was called bloody mary and belli 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.610
 mary more or less and everyone knows it 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.720
 then mary was suffering from the rare 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.400
 disease 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.140
 his father was a doctor and when he was 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.240
 given to the diagnosis in had or from 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.400
 apparently his daughter's confirmation was 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.260
 now doomed 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.970
 the next day you will have fun but the mother 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.800
 still hopeful as if everyone and leaves 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.630
 to let her attach a thread around the 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.970
 place of the daughter who came out of the 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.110
 coffin and soil 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.360
 this wire connected to one 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.250
 bell weighs on a small bar if la 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.680
 girl had moved would have done 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.870
 ring the bell but in the house of 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.730
 She was not the sound was not 1000 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.190
 so the mother proposed to stay at night 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.450
 and day to guard the daughter but the 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.950
 husband knew that his daughter was not 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.660
 dead then try to convince 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.170
 several times the wife that the girl 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.000
 now root now due excuse 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.320
 from good medical preparations to make a 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.750
 sleeping pill administering to the poor 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.550
 woman while in prayer with 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.950
 the latter was not asleep 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.480
 difficult to bring home when the 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.880
 morning after the cemetery keeper vi 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.860
 he came to find the broken wire detached 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.540
 along with the frightened bell and 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.030
 confused he went to call the parents of 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.160
 girl when they all came back together 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.290
 side to the daughter's grave they pulled out 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.260
 the coffin helping the lid found 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.730
 a gruesome sight mary was 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.950
 twisted into a thing of pain e 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.570
 hands almost natural suffering 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.670
 stained with blood and fingernails stuck 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.200
 the echo because it is also dirty 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.480
 girl had died for lack of 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.100
 oxygen 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.920
 a few days later the godfathers mary fu 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.840
 found in the dead bathroom the mirror was 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.640
 shattered and on the man's dl was of 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.290
 I lower the expression of terror as if 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.450
 had seen death in the face or 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.310
 a ghost 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.540
 the legend tells that if of positions 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.430
 during the mirror at midnight in 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.080
 point with only the light of a candle e 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.830
 steep three times turning on itself 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.630
 bloody mary 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.980
 she looks sparse and those hands 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.110
 stretched all the bloody ones forward 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.270
 thin with the sound of the bell that 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.310
 the accompanies it seems that you will look 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.790
 towards reflect and there the reflection of the 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.430
 mirror 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.470
 she will tell you the future but if you turn and the 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.780
 look you will die after a day of como 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.910
 as of course it is only a legend 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.680
 here a thrill came to you not 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.080
 I know if it will come because I am anyway 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.160
 reading the site page and at the end 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.170
 of history there is a pretty image 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.250
 disturbing to mary in the mirror that 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.540
 you will never see better than not 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.009
 you will look for the story anyway for 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.449
 look for it just look for whoever you do ita 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:40.819
 and will surely be one of the first 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:42.409
 results on google so if you want 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:44.419
 look for it said we have arrived 

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:47.149
 even today at the end of the video 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:48.979
 I hope that the gameplay and commentary 

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:50.779
 you enjoyed the story if there is 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:52.639
 liked gameplay passed by the channel of 

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:54.649
 storm in case you enjoyed the 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.419
 comment remained in my channel and vi 

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:58.610
 I also remember to leave a nice me 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:00.139
 like because the goal is 500 e 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.330
 you too are doing your part 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:16.479
 so here it seems we all feel the 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:16.479
 next beautiful tft videos killed
