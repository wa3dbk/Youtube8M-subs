00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
kind of tracted to the practice and then

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.680 
kind of tracted to the practice and then
was<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.460> rammer<00:01:39.090> doesn't<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:41.690> rammer

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
was the rammer doesn't know so rammer

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.020 
was the rammer doesn't know so rammer
and<00:01:43.080> then<00:01:43.260> the<00:01:43.440> guy<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.430> goes<00:01:44.610> over<00:01:44.940> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
and then the guy that goes over the

third generation bozo taxi no person was
really<00:01:48.720> active<00:01:49.080> so<00:01:49.770> those<00:01:50.010> most<00:01:50.490> three<00:01:50.880> and

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300

here<00:02:23.480> they<00:02:23.660> did<00:02:23.810> grow<00:02:24.020> up<00:02:24.610> subsequently<00:02:25.610> they

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.650 
here they did grow up subsequently they
had<00:02:26.510> little<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.990> do<00:02:27.280> just<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.970> their<00:02:29.180> make<00:02:29.450> sure

that my hand brakes were sufficiently so

that my hand brakes were sufficiently so
me<00:02:33.830> that<00:02:34.070> was<00:02:34.250> so<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.180> had<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.570> opportunity<00:02:35.890> in

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
me that was so I had the opportunity in

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.780 
me that was so I had the opportunity in
the<00:02:37.670> inspiration<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.720> I<00:02:39.020> started<00:02:39.860> being<00:02:40.670> a

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
the inspiration so I started being a

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:57.400 
the inspiration so I started being a
band<00:02:41.030> of<00:02:41.120> myself<00:02:52.959> well<00:02:53.959> us<00:02:54.260> as<00:02:54.620> first<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.610> was<00:02:56.410> it

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
band of myself well us as first I was it

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.350
