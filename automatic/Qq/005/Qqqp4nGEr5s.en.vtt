00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
sounds kind of cruel especially when the

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.340 
sounds kind of cruel especially when the
plants<00:01:25.369> this<00:01:25.520> big<00:01:25.790> but<00:01:26.090> hey<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:26.960> gotta<00:01:27.170> have

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.039 
plants this big but hey you gotta have
priorities<00:01:28.659> especially<00:01:29.659> when<00:01:29.750> it<00:01:29.810> comes<00:01:29.900> to

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
priorities especially when it comes to

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.330 
priorities especially when it comes to
tomatoes<00:01:31.509> okay<00:01:32.509> this<00:01:32.869> next<00:01:33.140> one<00:01:33.409> is<00:01:33.439> a<00:01:34.009> cherry

really<00:01:37.640> small<00:01:38.000> I<00:01:38.060> just<00:01:38.420> planted<00:01:38.659> it<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.049> other

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
really small I just planted it the other

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.350 
really small I just planted it the other
day<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:40.369> although<00:01:40.610> it's<00:01:40.790> a<00:01:40.850> little<00:01:40.880> bit<00:01:41.180> late

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
day and although it's a little bit late

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.420 
day and although it's a little bit late
in<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.509> season<00:01:41.720> for<00:01:42.140> planting<00:01:42.890> least<00:01:43.130> here<00:01:43.340> in

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
in the season for planting least here in

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.240 
in the season for planting least here in
Florida<00:01:43.880> I<00:01:44.140> figured<00:01:45.140> what<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.320> heck<00:01:45.590> I<00:01:45.770> cherry

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
Florida I figured what the heck I cherry

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.350 
Florida I figured what the heck I cherry
tomatoes<00:01:46.670> grow<00:01:46.880> so<00:01:47.090> well<00:01:47.119> and<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:47.540> fast<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.770> I

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
tomatoes grow so well and so fast so I

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.280 
tomatoes grow so well and so fast so I
look<00:01:50.360> forward<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.780> this<00:01:50.899> one<00:01:51.110> probably

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
look forward to this one probably

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.149 
look forward to this one probably
doubling<00:01:51.950> in<00:01:52.070> height<00:01:52.340> by<00:01:52.610> next<00:01:52.939> week<00:01:54.159> okay

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
doubling in height by next week okay

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.929 
doubling in height by next week okay
next<00:01:55.820> one<00:01:56.149> is<00:01:57.219> probably<00:01:58.219> one<00:01:58.399> of<00:01:58.430> my<00:01:58.520> favorite

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
next one is probably one of my favorite

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.230 
next one is probably one of my favorite
tomatoes<00:01:59.329> and<00:01:59.570> this<00:01:59.810> is<00:01:59.930> brandy<00:02:00.409> wine<00:02:00.619> and

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
tomatoes and this is brandy wine and

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.789 
tomatoes and this is brandy wine and
it's<00:02:02.240> potato<00:02:02.539> leaf<00:02:02.840> plant<00:02:03.140> so<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.469> can<00:02:03.619> see

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
it's potato leaf plant so you can see

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.679 
it's potato leaf plant so you can see
that<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.789> leaves<00:02:05.000> are<00:02:05.299> a<00:02:05.329> little<00:02:05.509> bit

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
that the leaves are a little bit

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.200 
that the leaves are a little bit
different<00:02:06.310> they<00:02:07.310> don't<00:02:07.490> have<00:02:07.700> all<00:02:07.759> the

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
different they don't have all the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.900 
different they don't have all the
serrated<00:02:08.810> edges<00:02:09.070> that<00:02:10.070> most<00:02:10.310> Tomatoes<00:02:10.550> have

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
serrated edges that most Tomatoes have

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.540 
serrated edges that most Tomatoes have
that's<00:02:11.180> why<00:02:11.570> it's<00:02:11.720> called<00:02:11.870> stay<00:02:12.140> awake<00:02:12.550> this

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
that's why it's called stay awake this

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.620 
that's why it's called stay awake this
one<00:02:13.760> doesn't<00:02:13.970> have<00:02:14.150> any

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
one doesn't have any

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.360 
one doesn't have any
tomatoes<00:02:16.170> at<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.440> moment<00:02:16.770> because<00:02:16.860> what<00:02:17.220> I've

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
see I like potato leaf plants because

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.640 
see I like potato leaf plants because
they<00:03:07.380> seem<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:09.020> whether<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.260> heat<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> little

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
they seem to whether the heat a little

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.140 
they seem to whether the heat a little
bit<00:03:10.890> better<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:12.900> course<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.320> downside<00:03:13.440> is

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
bit better of course the downside is

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.570 
bit better of course the downside is
they<00:03:15.150> don't<00:03:15.300> flower<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.380> bloom<00:03:16.560> as<00:03:16.890> well<00:03:17.100> in
