ballistics I found that anything under
100<00:04:30.550> yards<00:04:31.060> if<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.240> just<00:04:31.390> put<00:04:31.540> it<00:04:31.630> at<00:04:31.750> its

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
100 yards if you just put it at its

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.750 
100 yards if you just put it at its
lowest<00:04:32.080> setting<00:04:32.380> it's<00:04:32.980> typically<00:04:33.460> shooting

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
lowest setting it's typically shooting

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.000 
lowest setting it's typically shooting
right<00:04:33.940> on<00:04:34.150> or<00:04:34.390> barely<00:04:34.570> above<00:04:34.990> then<00:04:35.800> when<00:04:35.950> you

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
right on or barely above then when you

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.740 
right on or barely above then when you
graduate<00:04:36.160> out<00:04:36.610> to<00:04:36.760> a<00:04:36.790> hundred<00:04:37.120> yards<00:04:37.480> you<00:04:37.570> just

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
graduate out to a hundred yards you just

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.170 
graduate out to a hundred yards you just
have<00:04:37.870> to<00:04:37.960> compensate<00:04:38.290> and<00:04:38.770> aim<00:04:39.640> just<00:04:39.940> barely

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
have to compensate and aim just barely

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.570 
have to compensate and aim just barely
below<00:04:40.660> and<00:04:41.110> out<00:04:41.380> out<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:41.920> about<00:04:42.130> two<00:04:42.400> hundred

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
below and out out to about two hundred

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.160 
below and out out to about two hundred
yards<00:04:42.850> you<00:04:43.150> have<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.420> aim<00:04:43.480> a<00:04:43.510> little<00:04:43.750> bit<00:04:43.900> low

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
yards you have to aim a little bit low

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.230 
yards you have to aim a little bit low
then<00:04:45.010> once<00:04:45.250> you<00:04:45.340> graduate<00:04:45.790> to<00:04:45.910> three<00:04:46.120> hundred

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
then once you graduate to three hundred

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.420 
then once you graduate to three hundred
or<00:04:46.540> three<00:04:46.750> hundred<00:04:46.780> meters<00:04:47.290> and<00:04:47.530> on<00:04:47.620> out<00:04:47.830> it's

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
or three hundred meters and on out it's

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.400 
or three hundred meters and on out it's
shooting<00:04:48.730> on<00:04:48.880> point<00:04:49.180> or<00:04:49.510> a<00:04:49.540> little<00:04:49.780> or<00:04:49.900> a

shooting on point or a little or a
little<00:04:50.740> bit<00:04:50.860> where<00:04:51.190> you<00:04:51.250> got<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.460> actually<00:04:51.580> do

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
little bit where you got to actually do

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.710 
little bit where you got to actually do
some<00:04:51.970> holdover<00:04:52.450> with<00:04:52.600> it<00:04:52.780> so<00:04:54.000> anyway<00:04:55.000> uh<00:04:55.030> other

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
some holdover with it so anyway uh other
