00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:19.340
 hello my name is with rocker 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.220
 welcome to the review discover dallas 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.420
 cases for the iphone 6 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.710
 here it looks like in black lie the 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.380
 question is of course how rated one 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.610
 something like how to rate a case for me 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.760
 always a very serious thing 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.290
 every other priority has mine 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.580
 Priorities were clear to me I wanted 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.770
 have a case 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.239
 that is as possible the iphone 6 with 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.370
 one hand to use 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.379
 That's why I'm synonymous for iphone 6 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.960
 and decided for the iphone 6 plus because 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.199
 I want the whole thing easy with one hand 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.420
 can serve 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.370
 the case edeltannen case what I am 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.199
 That's why it came from 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.180
 immediately got the tip in a narrower selection 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.799
 By the way, I have twitter over there 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.530
 company kaba written i asked by 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:05.120
 which kay should take and has 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.190
 looked at me and now I have 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.470
 she and at the same time song is like 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.630
 I'm really good 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.040
 almost perfect only almost but I have it 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.930
 simply more than the whole house down 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.120
 It looks very classy too 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.790
 good as i like this this one 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.490
 have leather feeling on the back 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.380
 We still have two slots for credit cards 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.900
 push in or which cards too 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.140
 you always want to be part of it 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.170
 put in your paperwork 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.570
 Here company name is punched in 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.330
 The sewed also very neat man 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.520
 Pretty nice, so from work 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.770
 of processing here you can really 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.410
 Do not complain it feels very good 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:53.120
 here again an accent set 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:55.160
 sewed on the whole as well 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.030
 inside you can see beautiful as is 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.800
 every room as optimal protection display 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.170
 Here we have a small kink edge 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.230
 to be able to do better 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.560
 better to sculpt these areas is 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.170
 reinforced so there is really something 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.650
 harder than material processed here 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.260
 it is also about the very nice the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.099
 interpretations so he fits everything 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.819
 here too 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.520
 this area is firmer so offers 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.290
 also 100 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:32.280
 in optimal protection the opening for the 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:36.630
 Camera sees the processing here 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.130
 So really nice from the 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.650
 I would like to get it from one 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.450
 point of the four of five trifles 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.920
 maybe seven here that this one 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.230
 did not know very well but how 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.450
 said is really minimalist 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.190
 things that really stand out yet 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.250
 possible exactly looks great 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.560
 like a very nice part 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.140
 the question is how well does the whole thing prove 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.900
 and how does this case protect the iphone 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.760
 yes look at the iphone Rhine to 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.530
 give is relatively simple here on the 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.830
 a page and then press in here and 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.080
 because it looks the same iphone stops here 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.920
 inside really bombproof respect 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.200
 no problem 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.900
 that could keep falling out 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.590
 happy 100 100 percent so really 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.510
 problem-free 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.460
 The buttons are still beautiful 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.190
 everything is neatly accessible 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.880
 is cut out by on the gravel 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.410
 Covered on the bottom as well 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.970
 Everything without problems reaches here 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.680
 even years of paralysis 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.060
 plug really fits and so on because 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.880
 is indeed synonymous with thought so really 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:40.080
 there is enough room for maneuver 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:42.630
 and that fits in well with one 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.190
 it is on the right switch 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.880
 of course, the iphone 6 was too 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.740
 quite the recess provided and also 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.500
 very nice is the iphone 6 and the 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.300
 camera the chapter out but also this one 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.700
 Cheese by these politicians on the 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.900
 back protects this area because 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.500
 just the case is higher than how the 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.500
 lens of the camera 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:12.460
 a one- handed operation exactly sweet on 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.890
 and to go wonderfully a little 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.290
 I still have something to criticize 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.940
 I'm better bothered or what I can 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.700
 want to lie now falls for next 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.690
 series here a small slit 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.960
 free up 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:30.280
 here on the back is yes that the 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.630
 speakers from the iphone and to one 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.480
 easy is easy, he is perfect 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.150
 unfold could lift off and 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.010
 Unfortunately this is not included here 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.820
 my lectures cases iphone 5 was here 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.650
 in slit inside 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.090
 I'll get a slit 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.220
 but I want to do that 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.860
 recommend makes a small here 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.380
 cut runs then really deserves 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.450
 the full points must be your points 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.880
 deduct because since one-hand operation 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.890
 technically not fit so I have to 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.760
 now open again and must there 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.340
 I call this way 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.560
 Practically , simple slot rows would be too 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.860
 meet us 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.810
 Nevertheless, the case fully complies 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.120
 his purpose through protection concerns her 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.790
 you see we have all the sick and ill 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.040
 corners do you have that the phone touches 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.360
 Never the underground it feels 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.770
 insanely good 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.770
 it looks really neat 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.140
 Made of leather is simply leather 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.850
 there you can say what you want 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.660
 It's a natural product that's been around 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.910
 Thousands of years in use there and 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.360
 sat nadal already knew why she did that 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.910
 do 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.810
 very nice casey i can to mine 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:40.180
 really only recommend site 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.560
 if he is not ordered a case very much 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.740
 beautiful sees different others 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.390
 So you have something to unfold 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.180
 bottom up under same 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:52.419
 I'll put that in the description 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.480
 link to this cases rows of me 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:57.280
 clear purchase recommendation and his work 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.060
 Thank that he immediately so quickly 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.460
 have delivered 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:06.150
 That was a little preview on yours 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.150
