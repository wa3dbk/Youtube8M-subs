involved<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.070> sport<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.840> yeah<00:02:03.840> it's<00:02:04.020> it's

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
involved in the sport but yeah it's it's

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.370 
involved in the sport but yeah it's it's
I<00:02:04.560> think<00:02:04.619> time

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
I think time

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.309 
I think time
wind<00:02:05.829> it<00:02:05.979> up<00:02:06.070> do<00:02:06.939> you<00:02:07.030> feel<00:02:07.210> physically<00:02:08.080> you're

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
wind it up do you feel physically you're

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.620 
wind it up do you feel physically you're
tiring<00:02:08.590> or<00:02:08.920> aging<00:02:09.880> or<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.149> it<00:02:10.209> a<00:02:10.270> mental<00:02:10.599> thing

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
tiring or aging or is it a mental thing

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.809 
tiring or aging or is it a mental thing
or<00:02:10.899> is<00:02:10.989> it<00:02:11.110> both<00:02:11.230> of<00:02:11.410> us<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.830> guess<00:02:12.550> it's<00:02:12.730> a

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
or is it both of us I guess it's a

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.190 
or is it both of us I guess it's a
little<00:02:12.849> bit<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.209> both<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:13.540> mean<00:02:13.660> it's<00:02:14.080> an

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
little bit of both I mean it's an

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.809 
little bit of both I mean it's an
obvious<00:02:14.319> thing<00:02:14.650> as<00:02:14.800> you<00:02:14.920> get<00:02:15.040> older<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.640> do

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
obvious thing as you get older you do

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.540 
obvious thing as you get older you do
age<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.269> don't<00:02:16.300> recover<00:02:16.720> as<00:02:16.959> fast<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:18.459> have

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
age you don't recover as fast you have

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.370 
age you don't recover as fast you have
to<00:02:18.610> train<00:02:18.940> longer<00:02:19.599> and<00:02:19.720> harder<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.200> get<00:02:20.319> into

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
to train longer and harder to get into

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.479 
to train longer and harder to get into
form<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.500> harder<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.920> recover<00:02:24.190> from

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
form and it is harder to recover from

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.960 
form and it is harder to recover from
from<00:02:25.090> hard<00:02:25.330> races<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:25.900> hard<00:02:26.050> efforts<00:02:26.970> but

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
from hard races and hard efforts but

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.610 
from hard races and hard efforts but
also<00:02:28.180> on<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.510> mental<00:02:28.900> side<00:02:29.050> of<00:02:29.230> things<00:02:29.349> like

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
also on the mental side of things like

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.530 
also on the mental side of things like
I've<00:02:29.769> got<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.190> young<00:02:30.430> family<00:02:30.670> got<00:02:30.940> three<00:02:31.180> kids<00:02:31.390> I

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
I've got a young family got three kids I

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.600 
I've got a young family got three kids I
don't<00:02:31.569> like<00:02:31.900> being<00:02:32.170> away<00:02:32.290> from<00:02:32.440> home<00:02:32.800> for<00:02:32.860> long

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
don't like being away from home for long

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.000 
don't like being away from home for long
periods<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:34.959> know<00:02:35.019> they'd<00:02:35.739> like<00:02:35.980> to

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
periods and and I know they'd like to

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.890 
periods and and I know they'd like to
have<00:02:36.250> their<00:02:36.430> dad<00:02:36.580> at<00:02:36.730> home<00:02:36.910> so<00:02:37.180> that's<00:02:37.360> that

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
have their dad at home so that's that

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.600 
have their dad at home so that's that
forms<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.380> little<00:02:38.590> part<00:02:38.799> of<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.130> just<00:02:39.220> the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
forms a little part of it and just the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.270 
forms a little part of it and just the
fact<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.910> you<00:02:40.120> know<00:02:40.150> if<00:02:41.049> I<00:02:41.530> was<00:02:41.680> still<00:02:41.950> riding

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
fact that you know if I was still riding

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.720 
fact that you know if I was still riding
like<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.790> was<00:02:42.940> between<00:02:43.299> 0<00:02:43.780> 2<00:02:44.019> and<00:02:44.410> 0<00:02:44.500> 8<00:02:44.739> then<00:02:45.190> you

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
like I was between 0 2 and 0 8 then you

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.580 
like I was between 0 2 and 0 8 then you
know<00:02:45.819> I'd<00:02:46.000> probably<00:02:46.209> still<00:02:46.750> be<00:02:46.810> going<00:02:47.049> to<00:02:47.500> be

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
know I'd probably still be going to be

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.289 
know I'd probably still be going to be
winning<00:02:47.830> heaps<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.130> races<00:02:48.519> but<00:02:48.700> that's<00:02:49.000> that's

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
winning heaps of races but that's that's

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.250 
winning heaps of races but that's that's
not<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.690> case<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.110> that's<00:02:50.200> normal<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:52.260> yeah

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
not the case and that's normal and yeah

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.960 
not the case and that's normal and yeah
everything's<00:02:53.709> just<00:02:53.890> just<00:02:54.310> taking<00:02:54.549> a<00:02:54.610> natural

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
everything's just just taking a natural

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.089 
everything's just just taking a natural
progression<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.569> that's<00:02:56.500> where<00:02:56.680> we<00:02:56.709> are<00:02:56.920> now

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
progression and that's where we are now

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.300 
progression and that's where we are now
what<00:02:57.880> have<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.000> done<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:58.420> year<00:02:58.630> so<00:02:58.840> far<00:02:59.310> not
