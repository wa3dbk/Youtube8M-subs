00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.399
 a I guess it was because I thought that I should give the version to the previous time . 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.670
 Because I said so, I can not help but explain 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.880
 It became very heavy when I gave the version and I left it as it is 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.340
 Version upgrade 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.370
 Wait until mod comes on 8th, I think it's good 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:48.050
 Do we wish to be in the villagers observed in 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.350
 I wonder if the number of villagers has increased since the last time but maybe 100 but I want more 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.149
 It is too much 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.149

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.360
 Ah ah ah 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:09.520
 Hahaha Marisa Well Oh every time I make it explode every time Yatsuyama It's a villager's fleeing 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:14.000

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:17.780
 Do n't run away with my jacket and throw a bucket 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.310
 The water in the field has leaked and it's getting dull Do not say that 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:25.970
 Somehow you guys it not happened the way if happened Do'm happens I have to say every time 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.460
 Den I'm Dondake testicles like do not say such a thing 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.060
 So Tsukureyo in a narrow Toko than make a wall 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.400
 What does that mean 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.300
 What kind of thing 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:41.470
 Fled the by villagers have if back I I'm silane yeah yeah villagers's to 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:45.490
 It doesn't make sense to say such a thing, but breakage of the glass is quite hard 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.570
 11 I have to burn the sand I have a lot of sand here 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.570
 Say it is not true 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.470
 Let's keep a bucket of Satsuki toss, I wonder if the villagers will go home at night 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.710
 Items 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.740
 That's why I understand that's why 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.970
 Now it's fine to wait until night, let's have a petri dish and kill time 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:11.340
 If you kill such destroying all the month, but only infinitely white people will reduce 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.340
 Too much azalea and heavy and then double speed time 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:40.740
 Villagers turn to the second half and where do you think I will go now 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.410
 Go with you easy mode to go to the abandoned mine, which I found a little before from different would animate 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.640
 White the best Hado that you want to equipment state from 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.640
 Hard Toka unreasonable gate'm N' 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.830
 Let's go in good 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.110
 I am 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.110
 Is not 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.109
 If you say so why I go to the closed school I will go to collect the rails of the trolley I'd make it 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.120
 I have got a mess of iron when I'm making cass 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:15.470
 So take the rail that is in a closed school 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.470
 That's Bamiyan, it's foot and it 's McDonald's , so it 's definitely too much 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.100
 I am short-lived 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.710
 It's a lie It's hard to hit it. 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.710
 I smashed it 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.180
 There are no tears, so let's go back to school soon 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.299
 Yeah 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.299
 Certainly the gate where there is an abolished school, let's go here 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:57.180
 Was up to heavy rain in such as case, got the diamond came certainly before it is after a long time to come to here 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.180
 Yeah 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.360
 Shall we go from that hole ? 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.910
 In it there was a will continue to take speed time 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:58.350
 The rails were 64 things and 11 things were taken well 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.350
 Where do you want to place the dolly in the house and sheepfield location 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:03.090

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.120

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:15.009
 Putsu 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.009
 Speaking of which, the villagers who ran away have returned, something has not been recorded 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.729
 Why was it reset when I raised the results cancellation version now ? 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.919
 Really 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.919
 Let's take an example from here to Kuwabata 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:30.499
 I am 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:41.129
 Apparently it has a past main road 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:43.129

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.129

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.750

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.470

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.470
 Was Chima' used in gold and KanoRin 5 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:28.960
 This time I 'm going to be here so soon or not that's why I used double speed this time 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:33.610
 Not good Toka Guso Thats had bought the adhesive does not even 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:37.950
