00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.040 
days ago so how would you respond to
those<00:04:55.479> people<00:04:55.659> who<00:04:55.900> are<00:04:55.960> very<00:04:56.199> upset<00:04:58.020> again<00:04:59.020> I

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
those people who are very upset again I

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.219 
those people who are very upset again I
just<00:04:59.229> think<00:04:59.470> that<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.979> the<00:05:00.370> call<00:05:00.639> was<00:05:00.849> made

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
just think that the the call was made

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.439 
just think that the the call was made
for<00:05:02.229> Cody<00:05:02.470> safety<00:05:02.949> okay<00:05:03.250> so<00:05:03.520> I<00:05:03.699> think<00:05:04.150> it'd<00:05:04.419> be

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
for Cody safety okay so I think it'd be

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.360 
for Cody safety okay so I think it'd be
irresponsible<00:05:04.840> for<00:05:05.349> us<00:05:05.620> if<00:05:05.830> we<00:05:05.949> just<00:05:06.099> kind<00:05:06.250> of

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
irresponsible for us if we just kind of

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.890 
irresponsible for us if we just kind of
shined<00:05:06.610> it<00:05:06.729> on<00:05:06.849> let<00:05:07.030> him<00:05:07.090> have<00:05:07.270> a<00:05:07.300> flag<00:05:07.569> and<00:05:07.780> if

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
shined it on let him have a flag and if

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.390 
shined it on let him have a flag and if
he<00:05:07.960> got<00:05:08.110> jumped<00:05:08.530> or<00:05:08.620> something<00:05:08.919> like<00:05:09.069> that<00:05:09.250> or

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
he got jumped or something like that or

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.430 
he got jumped or something like that or
hurt<00:05:09.580> well<00:05:10.090> then<00:05:10.270> I<00:05:10.300> think<00:05:10.750> that<00:05:10.900> that<00:05:11.110> you

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440

know<00:05:12.370> it's<00:05:12.909> kind<00:05:13.150> of<00:05:13.210> like<00:05:13.330> one<00:05:13.479> of<00:05:13.599> those

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
know it's kind of like one of those

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.089 
know it's kind of like one of those
