00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.950 
for an in-form in my opinion anyway his
long<00:01:47.040> shot<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.520> massive<00:01:48.060> pro<00:01:48.300> and<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.720> long

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
long shot is a massive pro and this long

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.630 
long shot is a massive pro and this long
shot<00:01:49.170> actually<00:01:49.410> made<00:01:49.800> this<00:01:49.980> guy<00:01:50.159> back<00:01:50.430> out

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
shot actually made this guy back out

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.520 
shot actually made this guy back out
just<00:01:51.210> look<00:01:51.480> at<00:01:51.600> how<00:01:51.720> good<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.170> look<00:01:52.470> at

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
just look at how good this is look at

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.470 
just look at how good this is look at
how<00:01:52.590> far<00:01:52.920> out<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.430> mean<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> power<00:01:54.270> behind

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
how far out is I mean the power behind

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.840 
how far out is I mean the power behind
that<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.840> insane<00:01:55.230> and<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:56.070> guy<00:01:56.310> backs<00:01:56.640> out

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
that is insane and this guy backs out

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.360 
that is insane and this guy backs out
faster<00:01:57.450> than<00:01:57.630> someone<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.590> don't<00:01:58.920> know<00:01:59.159> an

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
faster than someone that I don't know an

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.850 
faster than someone that I don't know an
example<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.540> anyways<00:02:00.900> he<00:02:01.230> scores<00:02:01.560> at<00:02:01.710> go

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
example of but anyways he scores at go

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.380 
example of but anyways he scores at go
with<00:02:01.980> his<00:02:02.070> left<00:02:02.280> foot<00:02:02.400> so<00:02:02.730> he's<00:02:02.850> weak<00:02:03.030> foot<00:02:03.240> is

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
with his left foot so he's weak foot is

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.240 
with his left foot so he's weak foot is
perfect<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.050> mean<00:02:04.080> he's<00:02:04.350> five<00:02:04.590> star<00:02:04.860> week<00:02:05.040> for

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
perfect I mean he's five star week for

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.010 
perfect I mean he's five star week for
it<00:02:05.580> really<00:02:05.850> doesn't<00:02:06.120> matter<00:02:06.210> which<00:02:06.570> foot<00:02:06.840> it

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
it really doesn't matter which foot it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.380 
it really doesn't matter which foot it
takes<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.380> shot<00:02:07.650> on<00:02:07.830> now<00:02:08.399> another<00:02:08.700> pro<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.149> his

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
takes a shot on now another pro is his

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.660 
takes a shot on now another pro is his
shot<00:02:09.629> power<00:02:09.840> his<00:02:10.050> shot<00:02:10.289> power<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.709> insane<00:02:11.310> but

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
shot power his shot power is insane but

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.509 
shot power his shot power is insane but
his<00:02:11.819> long<00:02:12.060> shots<00:02:12.330> are<00:02:12.480> kind<00:02:12.659> of<00:02:12.780> mad<00:02:13.260> by<00:02:14.069> his

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
his long shots are kind of mad by his

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.729 
his long shots are kind of mad by his
curve<00:02:15.030> his<00:02:15.269> curve<00:02:15.540> adds<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.079> his<00:02:16.200> long<00:02:16.439> shots

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
curve his curve adds to his long shots

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.729 
curve his curve adds to his long shots
which<00:02:17.069> does<00:02:17.450> basically<00:02:18.450> just<00:02:18.930> swing<00:02:19.290> them<00:02:19.319> all

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
which does basically just swing them all

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.410 
which does basically just swing them all
over<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.219> place<00:02:20.400> at<00:02:20.579> times<00:02:20.819> he's<00:02:20.969> finesses

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420
