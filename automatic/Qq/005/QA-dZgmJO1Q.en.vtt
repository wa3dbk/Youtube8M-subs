00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.740 

all<00:00:11.759> right

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.550 

our<00:00:15.169> motor

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.900 

I

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.810 

completely<00:00:21.269> well<00:00:21.710> this<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.039> inner<00:00:23.189> world

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.509 

3:36<00:00:26.820> batteries<00:00:27.239> and<00:00:27.919> this<00:00:28.919> in<00:00:29.070> your<00:00:29.160> 30<00:00:29.399> amp

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
3:36 batteries and this in your 30 amp

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.380 
3:36 batteries and this in your 30 amp
fuse<00:00:29.970> protector<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.689> here's<00:00:31.169> the<00:00:31.289> switch

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
fuse protector and here's the switch

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.899 
fuse protector and here's the switch
this<00:00:33.390> switch<00:00:33.449> is<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.530> three<00:00:35.160> prong<00:00:35.699> switch

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:37.909 
this switch is but a three prong switch

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:43.160 
this switch is but a three prong switch
it<00:00:38.909> basically<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:40.190> turns<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.400> and<00:00:41.579> off<00:00:42.170> sit

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
it basically just turns on and off sit

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:53.540 
it basically just turns on and off sit
those<00:00:43.379> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.310 

and<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.650> blood<00:00:55.650> pumping<00:00:56.660> battery<00:00:57.660> it

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
and this is the blood pumping battery it

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.150 
and this is the blood pumping battery it
uh<00:00:58.580> there's<00:00:59.580> only<00:00:59.730> three<00:01:00.120> wires<00:01:00.420> coming<00:01:00.840> from

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
uh there's only three wires coming from

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.930 
uh there's only three wires coming from
the<00:01:02.160> actual<00:01:02.550> bike<00:01:02.970> there's<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.080> positive

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
the actual bike there's the positive

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.430 
the actual bike there's the positive
battery<00:01:05.960> read<00:01:07.220> this<00:01:08.220> negative<00:01:08.790> battery<00:01:09.440> black

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
battery read this negative battery black

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.320 
battery read this negative battery black
and<00:01:10.830> then<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.550> what<00:01:11.700> I'm<00:01:11.790> assuming<00:01:12.090> is

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
and then this is what I'm assuming is

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.650 
and then this is what I'm assuming is
the<00:01:12.510> ground<00:01:12.780> battery<00:01:13.410> and<00:01:13.850> I<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.270> connect

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
the ground battery and I just connect

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.340 
the ground battery and I just connect
the<00:01:16.590> controller<00:01:17.070> black<00:01:17.670> cord<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.110> ground

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
the controller black cord to the ground

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.140 
the controller black cord to the ground
cord<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.800> I<00:01:22.800> do<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.000> that

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
cord of this and I do that just so that

00:01:24.150 --> 00:02:00.820 
cord of this and I do that just so that
I<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.300> get<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.930> bike<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.890> turn<00:01:26.130> on

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:13.090 

hey<00:02:01.310> daddy

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.300 

I<00:02:13.190> guess<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.150> could<00:02:14.300> record

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.510 

so<00:02:18.640> basically<00:02:19.090> I<00:02:19.210> get<00:02:19.480> it<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.720> turn

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.820 

I<00:02:24.580> can<00:02:24.910> do<00:02:25.090> that

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
I can do that

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.020 
I can do that
if<00:02:26.980> anybody<00:02:27.370> can<00:02:27.550> tell<00:02:27.790> me<00:02:27.970> why<00:02:28.800> if<00:02:30.000> what<00:02:31.000> I

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
if anybody can tell me why if what I

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.000 
if anybody can tell me why if what I
have<00:02:31.210> to<00:02:31.360> do<00:02:31.540> in<00:02:32.140> order<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.440> get<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:32.860> throttle

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
have to do in order to get the throttle

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.460 
have to do in order to get the throttle
hooked<00:02:33.400> up<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:36.100> throttle<00:02:36.460> right<00:02:36.640> here<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:37.090> a

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
hooked up the throttle right here is a

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.360 
hooked up the throttle right here is a
half<00:02:38.470> twist

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
half twist

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.070 
half twist
topless<00:02:41.120> grotto<00:02:41.480> with<00:02:41.750> cruise<00:02:42.230> control

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.680 

three<00:02:47.290> main<00:02:47.470> wires<00:02:47.740> are<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.850> blue<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.660> red

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
three main wires are the blue the red

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.800 
three main wires are the blue the red
and<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.050> black<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.700> other<00:02:51.820> two<00:02:52.150> for

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
and the black and that the other two for

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.610 
and the black and that the other two for
the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
the

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.430 
the
so<00:02:54.280> anyone<00:02:54.849> can

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.710 

very<00:03:00.950> helpful

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.810 

right<00:03:05.260> now<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:05.470> have<00:03:05.710> like<00:03:06.040> I<00:03:06.190> said<00:03:06.220> before<00:03:06.520> the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
right now I have like I said before the

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.480 
right now I have like I said before the
battery<00:03:07.180> plugged<00:03:07.660> into<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.960> power<00:03:08.400> but<00:03:09.400> then

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
battery plugged into the power but then

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.800 
battery plugged into the power but then
I<00:03:09.580> have<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.880> motor<00:03:10.120> cable<00:03:11.050> which<00:03:11.710> is

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
I have the motor cable which is

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.810 
I have the motor cable which is
redundant<00:03:13.810> on<00:03:14.050> an<00:03:14.560> e-bike<00:03:14.860> I<00:03:15.070> suppose<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.760> don't

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
redundant on an e-bike I suppose I don't

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.120 
redundant on an e-bike I suppose I don't
know<00:03:16.000> if<00:03:16.150> I<00:03:16.240> just<00:03:16.420> ignore<00:03:16.780> that<00:03:16.810> or<00:03:17.230> what<00:03:17.470> and

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
know if I just ignore that or what and

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.910 
know if I just ignore that or what and
then<00:03:18.250> I've<00:03:18.340> got<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.670> key<00:03:19.740> wires<00:03:21.090> together<00:03:22.090> and

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
then I've got the key wires together and

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.800 
then I've got the key wires together and
I'm<00:03:24.250> thinking<00:03:24.730> maybe<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.390> controller

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
I'm thinking maybe the the controller

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.360 
I'm thinking maybe the the controller
would<00:03:26.050> be<00:03:26.170> something<00:03:26.440> like<00:03:26.590> this<00:03:26.920> green<00:03:27.190> wire

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
would be something like this green wire

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.360 
would be something like this green wire
and<00:03:27.760> these<00:03:28.330> two<00:03:28.569> wires<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:29.200> don't<00:03:29.860> know<00:03:30.040> if<00:03:30.220> this

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
and these two wires I don't know if this

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.220 
and these two wires I don't know if this
is<00:03:30.400> even<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.880> right<00:03:31.060> controller<00:03:31.540> if<00:03:31.870> anyone

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
is even the right controller if anyone

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.080 
is even the right controller if anyone
knows<00:03:32.349> how<00:03:32.380> to<00:03:32.560> get<00:03:32.800> a<00:03:33.370> really<00:03:34.000> good

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
knows how to get a really good

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.850 
knows how to get a really good
controller<00:03:34.569> for<00:03:34.840> this<00:03:34.930> bike<00:03:35.200> then<00:03:35.500> that<00:03:35.770> would

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
controller for this bike then that would

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.000 
controller for this bike then that would
also<00:03:35.920> be<00:03:36.130> useful<00:03:36.370> well<00:03:37.380> so<00:03:38.380> yeah<00:03:38.560> let<00:03:38.890> me<00:03:38.920> know

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
also be useful well so yeah let me know

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.729 
also be useful well so yeah let me know
on<00:03:39.160> your<00:03:39.640> videos<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.090> your<00:03:40.930> text<00:03:41.230> response<00:03:41.560> is

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
on your videos and your text response is

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.110 
on your videos and your text response is
what<00:03:41.920> I<00:03:41.950> can<00:03:42.160> do<00:03:42.310> and<00:03:42.459> I<00:03:42.550> would<00:03:42.640> be<00:03:42.730> really<00:03:43.030> be

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
what I can do and I would be really be

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.989
