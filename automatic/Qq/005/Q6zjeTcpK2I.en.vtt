Namaskar
Welcome to nishamadhulika.com

00:00:08.031 --> 00:00:12.390
Whenever we make chaat we need sweet chutney.

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:25.156
This sweet chutney is often prepared with tamarind pulp, dry mango khatai, raw mango and dates.

00:00:25.781 --> 00:00:32.656
We have already prepared all the chutney but today we’ll make sweet chutney with dry mango powder.

00:00:32.812 --> 00:00:38.008
This chutney can be prepared instantly and very easily.

00:00:38.516 --> 00:00:42.883
Let’s start with the procedure of making sweet chutney with dry mango.

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:53.218
For this, take dry mango powder in any vessel, add water into it and allow it to simmer.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.922
So add mango powder in any vessel.

00:00:57.695 --> 00:01:05.078
We have taken ¼ cup (30 grams) mango powder.

00:01:06.672 --> 00:01:07.875
Add it in a vessel.

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:13.984
Always use steel vessel for making sweet chutney with mango powder.

00:01:14.078 --> 00:01:17.469
Now add 1 cup water into it and turn on the flame.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:28.257
Also, we have taken 1 cup (200 grams) jaggery (crushed).

00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:32.523
Add jaggery in the vessel as well.

00:01:33.905 --> 00:01:35.554
Try selecting jaggery with good variety.

00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:49.382
If the jaggery has some impurities then dissolve it water first, strain the mixture and then mix it with mango powder.

00:01:49.773 --> 00:01:55.898
Dissolve the jaggery in ½ cup water separately first and then add it.

00:01:56.164 --> 00:02:02.101
We have used the best quality jaggery here, so there is no need to strain the mixture.

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:07.476
We are using for making the chutney but sugar can also be used.

00:02:07.813 --> 00:02:14.734
So, if you making chutney with sugar then take 200 grams (1 cup) sugar.

00:02:15.023 --> 00:02:20.382
And then similarly add mango powder, water and sugar in the vessel.

00:02:21.164 --> 00:02:26.750
We have added jaggery and now cook chutney on low flame.

00:02:27.155 --> 00:02:34.453
Keep the flame low so that jaggery dissolves completely and mango powder gets puffy.

00:02:36.586 --> 00:02:44.945
Meanwhile cut 6 to 7 dates.

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:50.835
Cut dates in long and thin pieces.

00:02:54.094 --> 00:02:57.000
We are cooking chutney of very low flame.

00:02:57.452 --> 00:03:06.601
It can be seen that jaggery has dissolved in water completely and mango powde has turned puffy.

00:03:06.898 --> 00:03:08.984
Now we’ll add spices into it.

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:14.679
Add 1 tsp black salt and mix well.

00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:24.921
Also add 1 tsp garam masala, 1 tsp ginger powder and ½ tsp red chilly powder.

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:33.210
Cook the chutney on low flame for 6 to 7 minutes.

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:35.773
Within few minutes, chutney will be ready.

00:03:36.922 --> 00:03:43.750
We cooked the chutney for 5 to 6 minutes after adding spices.

00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:49.758
Now we’ll add chopped dates in the chutney and cook for another 5 to 6 minutes.

00:03:53.211 --> 00:03:54.094
Check later.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.703
We have cooked chutney for 5 more minutes.

00:03:59.766 --> 00:04:04.352
We have cooked the chutney for 20 minutes.

00:04:04.718 --> 00:04:10.350
Chutney has turned thick in consistency and is appearing good in color.

00:04:10.797 --> 00:04:13.797
Chutney is ready, turn off the flame.

00:04:14.336 --> 00:04:16.789
Take out the chutney in a bowl.

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.953
But before that, allow the chutney to get bit cooled.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.391
Chutney has slightly cooled; now take it out in a bowl.

00:04:27.703 --> 00:04:36.765
Instant and delicious sweet chutney with mango power is ready.

00:04:37.015 --> 00:04:43.592
So, whenever you are making chaat, prepare this chutney very instantly.

00:04:44.445 --> 00:04:51.937
This sweet chutney can be stored in refrigerator for up to 6 months.

00:04:52.883 --> 00:04:57.305
When chutney cools completely, store in any container.

00:04:57.625 --> 00:05:05.640
Make sure you wash the container with boiling water and dry it nicely before storing the chutney in it.

00:05:06.273 --> 00:05:11.875
And whenever you prepare chaat, take it out from refrigerator and use.

00:05:12.172 --> 00:05:25.968
If chutney gets dense in consistency, then add some water into it and bring in use while making chaat.
