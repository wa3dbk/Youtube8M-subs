00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
top of it and they push down really hard

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.599 
top of it and they push down really hard
by<00:00:27.050> applying<00:00:27.350> pressure<00:00:27.619> to<00:00:27.800> the<00:00:27.920> glass<00:00:28.220> itself

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
by applying pressure to the glass itself

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.660 
by applying pressure to the glass itself
what<00:00:29.210> happens<00:00:29.570> is<00:00:29.750> these<00:00:29.900> tabs<00:00:30.260> as<00:00:30.590> you<00:00:31.460> push

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
down these tabs go into the glass

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.710 
down these tabs go into the glass
causing<00:00:34.070> it<00:00:34.160> not<00:00:34.340> to<00:00:34.550> snap<00:00:34.790> so<00:00:35.420> it's<00:00:35.570> very

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
causing it not to snap so it's very

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.689 
causing it not to snap so it's very
important<00:00:36.230> not<00:00:36.680> to<00:00:36.710> just<00:00:36.860> push<00:00:37.220> down<00:00:37.460> on<00:00:37.489> it

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
important not to just push down on it

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.490 
important not to just push down on it
the<00:00:38.030> first<00:00:38.269> key<00:00:38.449> thing<00:00:38.690> is<00:00:38.870> to<00:00:38.900> make<00:00:38.989> sure<00:00:39.290> that

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
the first key thing is to make sure that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.049
