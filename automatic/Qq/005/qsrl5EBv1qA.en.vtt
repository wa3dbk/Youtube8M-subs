00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.209
 ah 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.070
 a very simple dish the octopus we have 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.340
 Cooked 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.230
 in water with 10% salt 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.170
 and it does not remove the laurel 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.100
 more or less traditional and now we give it 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.680
 a crispy touch 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.240
 it does not consist in giving it a bark 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.730
 what 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.730
 flavor it basically then 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.940
 the body we will accompany a puree 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:46.250
 of potato but the potatoes are cooked 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:52.309
 water - water octopus that is 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:54.730
 that's why he has this violet of a flavor 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.730
 very good 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.550
 we take advantage of the water from the equation of 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.059
 octopus we take a potato and then we do 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.540
 a puree that serves as a garnish for 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.360
 light we make you fruits 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.110
 making a wait reduction and juice 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.340
 of Orange 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.340
 and when it 's cooked 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.690
 we crush it with some have confited in 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.960
 olive oil 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.840
 two buds and then we assemble with oil 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.320
 olive when those other three were 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.909
 musicians results 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.060
 but let's represent the octopus 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.060
 as well 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.579
 you have to give it a golden touch 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.700
 to enhance the flavor 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.440
 we really see in the hair 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.400
 together that one with simple crunchy 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.400
 that suits her 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.840
 we have already said that we octopus have 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.840
 caught in a traditional way 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.150
 we leave you a little al dente because 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.150
 to cook in the pan 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.950
 then each stream 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.690
 highlights the recent on both sides 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.690
 dora 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.190
 everything that we have already said is a good 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.349
 multiple 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.349
 with the public 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.980
 the octopus and we bring you braised 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.390
 this is why he has made a bark 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.390
 crunchy 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.950
 we read braided in medallions 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.050
 ah 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.050
 we put it on the plate 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.700
 then of course it's a bit of puree 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.500
 then we put the light aioli 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.500
 fruits 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.370
 and we give it a touch of paprika 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.330
 and we have a whale products 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.460
 and here is a graceful octopus
