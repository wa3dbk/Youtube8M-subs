00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
chassis intrusion jumper some system

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.390 
chassis intrusion jumper some system
units<00:04:49.180> do<00:04:49.780> provide<00:04:50.110> that<00:04:50.260> facility<00:04:50.770> you<00:04:51.370> can

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
units do provide that facility you can

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.060 
units do provide that facility you can
connect<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:52.240> cable<00:04:52.870> to<00:04:53.230> that<00:04:53.440> small<00:04:53.710> jumper

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
connect a cable to that small jumper

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.400 
connect a cable to that small jumper
just<00:04:54.280> below<00:04:54.520> those<00:04:54.700> SATA<00:04:54.970> connectors<00:04:55.510> and<00:04:55.720> if

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
just below those SATA connectors and if

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.800 
just below those SATA connectors and if
somebody<00:04:56.800> opens<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.550> lid<00:04:57.820> then<00:04:58.420> the<00:04:58.600> next

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
somebody opens the lid then the next

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.180 
somebody opens the lid then the next
time<00:04:58.900> you<00:04:58.960> boot<00:04:59.170> the<00:04:59.230> system<00:04:59.350> up<00:04:59.770> you'll<00:05:00.040> be

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
time you boot the system up you'll be

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.040 
time you boot the system up you'll be
told<00:05:00.400> you'll<00:05:00.640> be<00:05:00.730> warned<00:05:01.060> that<00:05:01.120> somebody<00:05:01.840> has

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
intruded into the chassis somebody has

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.940 
intruded into the chassis somebody has
opened<00:05:04.270> up<00:05:04.360> your<00:05:04.510> system<00:05:04.960> and<00:05:05.110> may<00:05:05.800> have

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
opened up your system and may have
