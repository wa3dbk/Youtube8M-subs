as that so here's what I just do a

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.530 
as that so here's what I just do a
little<00:03:50.120> demonstration

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
little demonstration

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.800 
little demonstration

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
spawning and the model spotting is a

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.559 
spawning and the model spotting is a
necessity<00:03:59.400> because<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.120> allows<00:04:00.299> you<00:04:00.480> to

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
necessity because it allows you to

necessity because it allows you to
change<00:04:00.840> clothes<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.439> facial<00:04:01.860> features<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:02.250> if

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
change clothes and facial features so if

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.699

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
you install the player modification this

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.710 
you install the player modification this
is<00:04:04.860> where<00:04:05.040> you'll<00:04:05.189> you'll<00:04:05.670> access<00:04:06.180> those<00:04:06.420> and

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
is where you'll you'll access those and

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.199 
is where you'll you'll access those and
