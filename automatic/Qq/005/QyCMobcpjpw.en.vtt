stayed with Vicki during a class and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.869 
stayed with Vicki during a class and
realized<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.770> really<00:00:55.800> were<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> same

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
realized that we really were on the same

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.450 
realized that we really were on the same
wavelength<00:00:57.469> after<00:00:58.469> talking<00:00:58.739> with<00:00:58.890> Vicki<00:00:59.280> we

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
wavelength after talking with Vicki we

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.910 
wavelength after talking with Vicki we
really<00:00:59.850> worked<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.780> there<00:01:01.109> was<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.350> very

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
really worked out that there was a very

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.789 
really worked out that there was a very
big<00:01:02.250> missing<00:01:02.760> part<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.329> point<00:01:03.719> training<00:01:04.229> where

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
big missing part in point training where

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.160 
big missing part in point training where
what<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.369> was<00:01:05.700> building<00:01:05.970> girls<00:01:06.330> up<00:01:06.659> with<00:01:07.049> the

what I was building girls up with the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
pre point training to a certain level

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.359 
pre point training to a certain level
and<00:01:09.630> she<00:01:09.659> was<00:01:10.380> taking<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.920> at<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> pre

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369

were<00:01:13.830> all<00:01:14.040> kinds<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.520> funny<00:01:14.729> practices<00:01:15.360> going

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
were all kinds of funny practices going

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
on all across the board and we were

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.630 
on all across the board and we were
often<00:01:19.110> seeing<00:01:19.380> students<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.040> at<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> clinic

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
often seeing students in at the clinic

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.219 
often seeing students in at the clinic
for<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> lot<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.240> injuries<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.960> could<00:01:22.110> have

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
for a lot of injuries that could have

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.859 
for a lot of injuries that could have
been<00:01:22.380> prevented<00:01:22.650> by<00:01:23.159> very<00:01:23.729> safe<00:01:24.090> integrated

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
been prevented by very safe integrated

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.140 
been prevented by very safe integrated
point<00:01:25.140> training<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.280> Vicki<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.700> started

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
point training so Vicki and I started

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.819 
point training so Vicki and I started
talking<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.810> decided<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.470> wanted<00:01:28.770> to

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
talking we decided that we wanted to

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.219 
talking we decided that we wanted to
create<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.520> program<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.659> take<00:01:30.930> down

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
create this program to take down

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.289 
create this program to take down
students<00:01:31.920> from<00:01:32.100> their<00:01:32.280> first<00:01:32.549> pair<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:32.939> pointe

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
students from their first pair of pointe

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.569 
students from their first pair of pointe
shoes<00:01:33.540> through<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.560> pre<00:01:34.890> professional<00:01:35.369> level

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
shoes through to pre professional level

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.539 
shoes through to pre professional level
training<00:01:36.110> so<00:01:37.110> that's<00:01:37.619> when<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.829> devised<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
training so that's when I devised the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.490 
training so that's when I devised the
program<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.329> gets<00:01:39.630> split<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.170> into<00:01:40.350> three

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
program that gets split up into three

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.550 
program that gets split up into three
stages<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:42.119> first<00:01:42.150> stage<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.960> specifically

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
stages the first stage is specifically

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.740 
stages the first stage is specifically
for<00:01:43.860> beginners<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.460> point<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.090> then<00:01:45.570> there's

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
for beginners on point and then there's

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.050 
for beginners on point and then there's
an<00:01:45.869> intermediate<00:01:46.619> level<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.220> then<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> third

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
an intermediate level and then the third

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.330 
an intermediate level and then the third
level<00:01:48.390> really<00:01:48.899> takes<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> professional

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
level really takes the professional

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.870 
level really takes the professional
student<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:51.470> we've<00:01:52.470> also<00:01:52.740> added<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.670> lot<00:01:53.850> of

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
student on we've also added in a lot of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.149 
student on we've also added in a lot of
preparatory<00:01:54.329> exercises<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.530> go<00:01:55.860> through

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
preparatory exercises that I go through

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.639 
preparatory exercises that I go through
to<00:01:56.759> get<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.060> correct<00:01:57.450> muscle<00:01:57.990> firing<00:01:58.560> a

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
to get the correct muscle firing a

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.590 
to get the correct muscle firing a
muscle<00:01:59.040> patterning<00:01:59.460> happening<00:01:59.820> right<00:02:00.360> from

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
muscle patterning happening right from

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.300 
muscle patterning happening right from
the<00:02:00.719> beginning<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.710> start<00:02:01.920> integrating

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the beginning so we start integrating

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.730 
the beginning so we start integrating
core<00:02:02.909> control<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.719> turnout<00:02:03.990> control<00:02:04.500> and

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
core control and turnout control and

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.639 
core control and turnout control and
foot<00:02:04.920> control<00:02:05.340> right<00:02:06.060> from<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.479> start<00:02:06.649> it's

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
foot control right from the start it's

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.619 
foot control right from the start it's
really<00:02:08.099> really<00:02:08.580> important<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.209> when<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.450> go

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
really really important that when you go

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.860 
really really important that when you go
through<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.140> program<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.890> transition

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
through this program you transition

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.050 
through this program you transition
these<00:02:12.080> exercises<00:02:12.650> across<00:02:13.220> into<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.790> class

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
these exercises across into the class

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.149 
these exercises across into the class
work<00:02:14.390> so<00:02:15.080> that<00:02:15.319> you<00:02:15.409> can<00:02:15.590> really<00:02:15.799> start

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
work so that you can really start

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.280 
work so that you can really start
establishing<00:02:16.370> those<00:02:17.120> patterns<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:18.019> whole

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
establishing those patterns the whole

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.559 
establishing those patterns the whole
way<00:02:18.470> through<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.700> that's<00:02:19.879> when<00:02:20.090> we<00:02:20.239> recommend

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
way through and that's when we recommend

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.800 
way through and that's when we recommend
that<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.650> dancers<00:02:22.220> start<00:02:22.610> this<00:02:23.000> program<00:02:23.540> in

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
that the dancers start this program in

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.589 
that the dancers start this program in
Demi<00:02:24.200> pointe<00:02:24.530> shoes<00:02:24.860> because<00:02:25.549> as<00:02:25.760> opposed<00:02:26.330> to

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
Demi pointe shoes because as opposed to

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.960 
Demi pointe shoes because as opposed to
facing<00:02:27.470> everything<00:02:28.040> all<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:28.459> want<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.819> go

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
facing everything all you want to go

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.569 
facing everything all you want to go
they<00:02:29.569> can<00:02:29.750> start<00:02:30.049> in<00:02:30.319> demi<00:02:30.590> pointe<00:02:30.950> shoes<00:02:31.220> they

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
they can start in demi pointe shoes they

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.970 
they can start in demi pointe shoes they
can<00:02:31.760> start<00:02:32.030> becoming<00:02:32.750> aware<00:02:32.989> of<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.620> three

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
can start becoming aware of the three

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.800 
can start becoming aware of the three
muscle<00:02:34.430> groups<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.790> we<00:02:34.909> constantly<00:02:35.420> talk

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
muscle groups that we constantly talk

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.660 
muscle groups that we constantly talk
about<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.440> they<00:02:36.920> start<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:37.310> learn<00:02:37.459> the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
about and they start to learn the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.610 
about and they start to learn the
exercises<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.659> then<00:02:39.049> it's<00:02:39.200> not<00:02:39.409> such<00:02:39.590> a

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
exercises and then it's not such a

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.199 
exercises and then it's not such a
difficult<00:02:40.190> transition<00:02:40.400> because<00:02:40.849> that's

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
difficult transition because that's

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.789 
difficult transition because that's
really<00:02:41.420> what<00:02:41.629> we're<00:02:41.780> after<00:02:41.989> is<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.290> smooth

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
really what we're after is a smooth

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.920 
really what we're after is a smooth
transition<00:02:43.370> onto<00:02:43.700> point<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.269> one<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:44.900> is

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
transition onto point and one that is

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.289 
transition onto point and one that is
quite<00:02:45.319> injury<00:02:45.829> free<00:02:46.129> and<00:02:46.340> as<00:02:46.670> pain-free<00:02:47.000> as

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
quite injury free and as pain-free as

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.199 
quite injury free and as pain-free as
possible<00:02:47.510> as<00:02:48.019> well<00:02:48.230> of<00:02:48.590> course<00:02:48.890> we<00:02:49.640> also<00:02:49.849> go

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
possible as well of course we also go

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.729 
possible as well of course we also go
through<00:02:50.569> a<00:02:50.599> lot<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:51.079> information<00:02:51.620> about

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
through a lot of information about

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.890 
through a lot of information about
fitting<00:02:52.250> pointe<00:02:52.670> shoes<00:02:52.910> breaking<00:02:53.599> them<00:02:53.750> in
