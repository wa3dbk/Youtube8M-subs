00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
tank up to the top you want to make sure

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.410 
tank up to the top you want to make sure
you<00:01:21.689> fill<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.080> gas<00:01:22.259> tank<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> brim

you fill the gas tank to the brim

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.550 
you fill the gas tank to the brim
because<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.600> don't<00:01:24.810> want<00:01:25.020> mooseter<00:01:25.530> and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
because you don't want mooseter and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.740 
because you don't want mooseter and
condensation<00:01:26.310> building<00:01:27.090> up<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> fuel

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
condensation building up in the fuel

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.600 
condensation building up in the fuel
tank<00:01:28.020> over<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.380> wintertime<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> good

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
tank over the wintertime so it's a good

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.890 
tank over the wintertime so it's a good
idea<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.850> go<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.119> fill<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> tank<00:01:30.570> up<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
idea to go and fill the tank up to the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.999 
idea to go and fill the tank up to the
top<00:01:31.939> got<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.119> done<00:01:33.360> there<00:01:33.630> wouldn't<00:01:34.259> top<00:01:34.860> it

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
top got that done there wouldn't top it

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.160 
top got that done there wouldn't top it
off<00:01:35.130> ideally<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.420> get<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.780> ask<00:01:36.930> this

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
off ideally if you can get to ask this

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.649 
off ideally if you can get to ask this
does<00:01:38.100> not<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.549> ethanol<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.540> would

does not have ethanol in it that would

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.620 
does not have ethanol in it that would
be<00:01:39.689> best<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.880> have<00:01:41.880> no<00:01:42.030> choices<00:01:42.509> you

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
be best but if you have no choices you

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.170 
be best but if you have no choices you
can<00:01:42.780> use<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.860> regular<00:01:44.009> ethanol<00:01:44.490> gas<00:01:44.700> up<00:01:45.030> to

can use the regular ethanol gas up to

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.460 
can use the regular ethanol gas up to
about<00:01:45.329> 10%<00:01:45.630> mixture

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
about 10% mixture

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.700 
about 10% mixture
go<00:01:47.220> ahead

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
go ahead

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.760 
go ahead
pop<00:01:47.980> this<00:01:48.130> up

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.620 

like<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.400> said<00:01:53.460> earlier<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.270> really<00:01:54.450> want

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
like I said earlier you just really want

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.970 
like I said earlier you just really want
to<00:01:54.660> make<00:01:54.750> sure<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.110> top<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.470> fuel<00:01:55.740> tank

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
to make sure that you top this fuel tank

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.220 
to make sure that you top this fuel tank
off<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:57.300> don't<00:01:57.510> want<00:01:57.720> to<00:01:57.780> leave<00:01:57.900> it<00:01:57.930> half-full

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
off you don't want to leave it half-full

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.170 
off you don't want to leave it half-full
during<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.950> wintertime<00:01:59.220> because<00:01:59.580> anything

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
during the wintertime because anything

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.240 
during the wintertime because anything
that's<00:02:00.450> left<00:02:00.930> above<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.470> fuel<00:02:01.680> line<00:02:01.890> inside

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
that's left above the fuel line inside

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.350 
that's left above the fuel line inside
the<00:02:02.370> tank<00:02:02.580> there's<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.850> potential<00:02:03.210> for

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the tank there's a potential for

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.930 
the tank there's a potential for
moisture<00:02:03.870> to<00:02:04.160> condensate<00:02:05.160> so<00:02:05.760> we'll<00:02:05.850> go<00:02:05.910> ahead

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
moisture to condensate so we'll go ahead

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.370 
moisture to condensate so we'll go ahead
and<00:02:06.120> fill<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.360> tank<00:02:06.540> up<00:02:06.750> now<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:07.140> we'll<00:02:07.260> move

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
and fill this tank up now and we'll move

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.020 
and fill this tank up now and we'll move
on<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.860> next<00:02:07.890> step<00:02:08.369> which<00:02:08.789> will<00:02:08.910> be

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
on up to the next step which will be

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.699 
on up to the next step which will be
fogging<00:02:09.330> your<00:02:09.600> motors<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.170> then<00:02:10.320> blowing<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
fogging your motors and then blowing the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.850 
fogging your motors and then blowing the
excess<00:02:11.009> water<00:02:11.220> out<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.550> stay<00:02:11.730> tuned<00:02:12.860> alright

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
excess water out so stay tuned alright

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.949 
excess water out so stay tuned alright
so<00:02:13.980> now<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.130> we<00:02:14.310> have<00:02:14.610> completely<00:02:15.060> treated

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
so now that we have completely treated

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.930 
so now that we have completely treated
our<00:02:16.080> fuel<00:02:16.440> we<00:02:16.740> want<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.980> do<00:02:17.100> now<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.520> run<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
our fuel we want to do now is run the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.510 
our fuel we want to do now is run the
motors<00:02:18.300> for<00:02:19.110> at<00:02:19.290> least<00:02:19.410> five<00:02:19.740> minutes<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.430> get

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
motors for at least five minutes to get

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.910 
motors for at least five minutes to get
the<00:02:20.670> fuel<00:02:20.910> circulated<00:02:21.750> from<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.260> tank<00:02:22.740> into

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
the fuel circulated from the tank into

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.800 
the fuel circulated from the tank into
the<00:02:23.070> engine<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:24.060> want<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.300> make<00:02:24.390> sure<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.600> do

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
the engine you want to make sure you do

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.370 
the engine you want to make sure you do
that<00:02:25.050> if<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:26.010> have<00:02:26.810> not<00:02:27.810> pre<00:02:28.020> treated<00:02:28.320> your

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
that if you have not pre treated your

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.470 
that if you have not pre treated your
gas<00:02:28.560> prior<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.520> fresh<00:02:29.790> gas<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.209> obviously

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.850 
now the next step we're going to do is
to<00:02:47.880> fog<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.750> motors<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.200> then<00:02:49.290> we'll<00:02:49.410> pull

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
to fog the motors and then we'll pull

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.430 
to fog the motors and then we'll pull
out<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.070> excess<00:02:50.310> water<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.580> stay<00:02:50.820> with<00:02:50.940> us<00:02:51.000> all

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.520 

I'm<00:03:46.170> assuming<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.710> burst<00:03:46.980> right<00:03:47.310> now

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.110

for oil or for smoke to begin billowing
out<00:03:57.850> of<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.060> exhaust<00:03:58.330> so<00:03:59.400> get<00:04:00.400> a<00:04:00.430> little<00:04:00.580> burst

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.210 

and<00:05:08.560> I'm<00:05:08.680> going<00:05:08.800> to<00:05:08.830> shut<00:05:09.010> the<00:05:09.130> water<00:05:09.280> off

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
and I'm going to shut the water off

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.860 
and I'm going to shut the water off
now<00:05:12.220> we<00:05:12.280> got<00:05:12.520> the<00:05:12.640> motor<00:05:12.790> shut<00:05:13.120> off<00:05:13.270> we<00:05:13.510> know<00:05:13.750> we

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
now we got the motor shut off we know we

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.140 
now we got the motor shut off we know we
fived<00:05:14.170> it<00:05:14.350> significantly<00:05:14.920> enough<00:05:15.190> I've<00:05:15.970> got

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
fived it significantly enough I've got

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.540 
fived it significantly enough I've got
the<00:05:16.270> water<00:05:16.420> shut<00:05:16.810> off<00:05:16.840> now<00:05:17.200> one<00:05:18.100> last<00:05:18.310> thing

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
the water shut off now one last thing

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.550 
the water shut off now one last thing
that<00:05:18.580> I'm<00:05:18.760> going<00:05:18.940> to<00:05:18.970> do<00:05:19.120> to<00:05:19.810> prepare<00:05:19.990> for<00:05:20.230> the

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
that I'm going to do to prepare for the

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.870 
that I'm going to do to prepare for the
winter<00:05:20.830> season<00:05:21.040> especially<00:05:21.310> if<00:05:21.670> you're<00:05:21.790> going

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
winter season especially if you're going

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.100 
winter season especially if you're going
to<00:05:21.970> be<00:05:22.030> in<00:05:22.120> an<00:05:22.240> area<00:05:22.390> where<00:05:22.600> you<00:05:22.690> here<00:05:22.870> have<00:05:23.050> a

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
to be in an area where you here have a

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.260 
to be in an area where you here have a
hard<00:05:23.350> freeze<00:05:23.680> I'm<00:05:24.640> going<00:05:24.820> to<00:05:24.880> go<00:05:24.970> ahead<00:05:25.030> and

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
hard freeze I'm going to go ahead and

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.150 
hard freeze I'm going to go ahead and
boil<00:05:25.390> out<00:05:25.540> the<00:05:25.720> excess<00:05:26.080> water<00:05:26.110> that<00:05:26.920> might

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
boil out the excess water that might

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.950 
boil out the excess water that might
still<00:05:27.220> be<00:05:27.490> inside<00:05:27.970> the<00:05:28.180> engine<00:05:28.540> after<00:05:28.660> this

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
still be inside the engine after this

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.720 
still be inside the engine after this
flush<00:05:29.200> job<00:05:29.470> so<00:05:30.010> we'll<00:05:30.130> go<00:05:30.220> ahead<00:05:30.250> and<00:05:30.400> go<00:05:30.550> back

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
flush job so we'll go ahead and go back

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.440 
flush job so we'll go ahead and go back
to<00:05:30.880> neutral

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
to neutral

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.840 
to neutral
we'll<00:05:31.840> start<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:32.230> engine<00:05:35.490> now<00:05:36.490> want<00:05:36.670> to<00:05:36.700> let

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
we'll start the engine now want to let

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.090 
we'll start the engine now want to let
this<00:05:37.230> evacuate<00:05:38.230> the<00:05:38.320> water<00:05:38.530> out<00:05:38.740> of<00:05:38.770> the<00:05:38.890> motor

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
this evacuate the water out of the motor

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.250 
this evacuate the water out of the motor
so<00:05:39.340> we'll<00:05:39.460> bump<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.760> throttles<00:05:40.180> here<00:05:40.420> to<00:05:41.110> pull

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
so we'll bump the throttles here to pull

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.570 
so we'll bump the throttles here to pull
out<00:05:41.380> the<00:05:41.500> excess<00:05:41.800> water<00:05:41.830> then<00:05:42.220> we'll<00:05:42.340> shut<00:05:42.460> it

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
out the excess water then we'll shut it

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:51.790 
out the excess water then we'll shut it
down

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.110 

now<00:05:52.800> we<00:05:52.860> know<00:05:53.100> that<00:05:53.250> we<00:05:53.310> have<00:05:53.520> all<00:05:53.670> the<00:05:53.820> cooling

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
now we know that we have all the cooling

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.640 
now we know that we have all the cooling
water<00:05:54.270> out<00:05:54.540> of<00:05:54.690> the<00:05:54.780> engines<00:05:55.140> so<00:05:55.350> at<00:05:55.500> the

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
water out of the engines so at the

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.140 
water out of the engines so at the
winter<00:05:55.890> during<00:05:56.070> the<00:05:56.190> wintertime<00:05:56.430> if<00:05:56.820> you<00:05:57.000> have

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
winter during the wintertime if you have

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.550 
winter during the wintertime if you have
a<00:05:57.180> freeze<00:05:57.540> you're<00:05:57.870> not<00:05:57.990> going<00:05:58.110> to<00:05:58.170> have<00:05:58.320> water

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
a freeze you're not going to have water

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.080 
a freeze you're not going to have water
inside<00:05:58.770> the<00:05:59.070> motor<00:05:59.250> that<00:05:59.430> could<00:05:59.580> expand<00:05:59.940> and

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
inside the motor that could expand and

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.890 
inside the motor that could expand and
cause<00:06:00.240> damage

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
cause damage

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.750 
cause damage
so<00:06:01.290> that's<00:06:01.470> your<00:06:01.590> winterization<00:06:01.800> processing

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
so that's your winterization processing

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.430 
so that's your winterization processing
you<00:06:02.850> have<00:06:02.970> four<00:06:03.240> steps<00:06:03.630> your<00:06:03.930> first<00:06:04.140> step<00:06:04.320> is

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
you have four steps your first step is

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.170 
you have four steps your first step is
obviously<00:06:04.740> going<00:06:04.860> to<00:06:04.920> be<00:06:05.040> to<00:06:05.130> stabilize<00:06:05.700> your

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
obviously going to be to stabilize your

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.820 
obviously going to be to stabilize your
fuel<00:06:06.510> and<00:06:06.780> get<00:06:06.960> the<00:06:07.050> fuel<00:06:07.260> treatment<00:06:07.650> in<00:06:07.710> the

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
fuel and get the fuel treatment in the

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.860 
fuel and get the fuel treatment in the
India<00:06:08.190> fuel<00:06:08.490> the<00:06:08.970> second<00:06:09.360> step<00:06:09.510> is<00:06:09.690> going<00:06:09.810> to

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
India fuel the second step is going to

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.300 
India fuel the second step is going to
be<00:06:09.990> to<00:06:10.080> go<00:06:10.170> ahead<00:06:10.290> and<00:06:10.530> get<00:06:10.650> the<00:06:10.800> fuel<00:06:11.040> actually

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
be to go ahead and get the fuel actually

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.240 
be to go ahead and get the fuel actually
