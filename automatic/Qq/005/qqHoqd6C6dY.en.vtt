and I think it's something that people
once<00:01:43.840> they<00:01:43.959> jump<00:01:44.170> in<00:01:44.410> there<00:01:44.709> they're<00:01:44.979> gonna

once they jump in there they're gonna

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:46.589 
once they jump in there they're gonna
really<00:01:45.340> discover<00:01:45.880> their<00:01:46.119> creative<00:01:46.569> juices
