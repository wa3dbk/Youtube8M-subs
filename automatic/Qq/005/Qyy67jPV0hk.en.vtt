00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.429
 billion 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.030
 This time people are here in Maine 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.830
 fantin craft and I know the guys like it 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.140
 a lot of these books is why I 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.760
 keep bringing them, huh? 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.340
 I honestly was sick of playing 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.650
 online craft a while ago and there I 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.090
 brought I have kind of a philosophy 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.800
 on the channel that I have to do what I 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.779
 I want ok, people 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.160
 of course I have with whom you do 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.110
 the two to do what I want to do 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.030
 What do you want the same time? 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.890
 kind of marrying your two courses and great 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.230
 but I was nauseated by minecraft 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.480
 I could not bear to play again after 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.640
 a few years she's going to be like 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.340
 the model arrives arrives and even when the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.680
 visus the channel views being 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.500
 increasingly mine I still do not 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.559
 I wanted to do it, I felt tired. 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.600
 but this feeling of fatigue has to 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.180
 see if it's running out because the middle channel 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.370
 that the puma is great because the canal 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.600
 stabilized me in the crowd he stayed 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.780
 people are at a point where we get 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.840
 in a day to catch 50 60 thousand views and there 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.820
 this video then reaches 70 80 and when 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.700
 the video is good to get 100 thousand views 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.890
 Which is good, right? If you think you have 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.710
 100 thousand people watching a video of mine 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.810
 It's something that still impresses me. 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.460
 since the beginning of my channel I was 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.680
 impressed scale that I stayed 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.630
 impressed when there were 800 people is 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.030
 one guy who happened to be here was 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.090
 It 's because he gave me all the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.329
 here's a guy behind me, huh? 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.150
 Fear fear guy over there the car over there and he has 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.070
 a sword and he has a sword of the 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.380
 ondina game is this because he told 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.409
 You friend, man, let's be friends with people. 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.360
 leave me, leave me for the love of God 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.860
 because I do not want to die 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.380
 oh caracas, motherfucker than 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.799

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.990
 seems to be very thorough in part of the 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.140
 Snowmen, I'll tell you something that has 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.580
 It has nothing to do with cinnamon coming. 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.990
 I think it 's better to have a name on the 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.360
 boat because I'm going to have to go by the water 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.490
 and clean water water 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.010
 I did not put the webcam or the video of 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.680
 Today I wish I knew what you 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.739

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.130
 You both do if you're over there. 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:57.510

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.170
 so a game or not for you is cool 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.700
 see me playing 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.650
 was I feel that when playing with the 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.510
 double champion was in the face of old tacho 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.459
 was a good guy did not see that he was happy 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.630
 at the rate house 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.940
 maybe this is something I can 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.620
 train and have a nice face 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.850
 When I'm recording here concentrated 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.580
 to clean the screen is to use the means 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.200
 closed, you know why I'm sleepy and 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.480

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.860
 I honestly was putting in 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.940
 I think the guys like it 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.370

 the guys like do not do the sun because they 're not 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.420
 I think there has to be a balance 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.100
 You understood that you have to do what you want. 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.920

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.780
 You have to do what the fuck has to do. 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.400
 who do what you want and match 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.890

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.390
 same time, this son of a bitch also 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.890

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.530
