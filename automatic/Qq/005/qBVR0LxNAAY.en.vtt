bits that I'd like to show you so first
of<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.270> metal<00:01:24.960> grill<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.710> take

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
of all it's a metal grill so I can take

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.179 
of all it's a metal grill so I can take
my<00:01:26.130> life<00:01:26.430> eating<00:01:27.229> there<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.439> screwed<00:01:29.009> on

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
my life eating there just screwed on

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.679 
my life eating there just screwed on
around<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.520> side<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.329> take<00:01:30.570> this

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
around the side so you can take this

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.310 
around the side so you can take this
hopefully<00:01:31.259> panel<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:33.439> around<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.590> body<00:01:34.799> just

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
hopefully panel up around the body just

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.380 
hopefully panel up around the body just
brought<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.409> camera<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> bit<00:01:37.860> closer<00:01:38.250> now<00:01:38.460> to

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
brought the camera a bit closer now to

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.749 
brought the camera a bit closer now to
look<00:01:39.540> at<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.840> back<00:01:40.020> panel<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.030> CL<00:01:42.030> at<00:01:42.240> 108

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
look at the back panel of the CL at 108

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.639 
look at the back panel of the CL at 108
so<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:45.119> course<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.780> our<00:01:46.020> speakon

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
so of course we have our speakon

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.980 
so of course we have our speakon
connector<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.790> normal<00:01:49.220> to<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.340> core

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
connector this is just normal to in core

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.420 
connector this is just normal to in core
the<00:01:51.990> closest<00:01:52.350> are<00:01:52.439> actually<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
the closest are actually just the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.359 
the closest are actually just the
tweeter<00:01:53.820> level<00:01:54.180> here<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> crossover<00:01:55.369> so

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
tweeter level here on the crossover so

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.459 
tweeter level here on the crossover so
that<00:01:56.490> we<00:01:56.579> can<00:01:56.790> make<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.090> work<00:01:57.270> 3<00:01:57.630> DB<00:01:57.960> higher

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
that we can make it work 3 DB higher

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.200 
that we can make it work 3 DB higher
than<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.899> mid-range<00:02:00.899> driver<00:02:01.909> this<00:02:02.909> is

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
than the mid-range driver this is

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.330 
than the mid-range driver this is
sometimes<00:02:03.450> handy<00:02:04.049> for<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:04.560> you're<00:02:04.770> having<00:02:05.009> to

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
sometimes handy for if you're having to

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.210 
sometimes handy for if you're having to
cover<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.180> larger<00:02:06.719> area<00:02:06.750> or<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> larger<00:02:07.979> crowd

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
cover a larger area or a larger crowd

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.809 
cover a larger area or a larger crowd
you<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:09.060> actually<00:02:09.209> adjust<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:10.110> 2<00:02:10.289> +<00:02:10.500> 3<00:02:10.709> DB<00:02:11.160> to

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
you can actually adjust that 2 + 3 DB to

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.350 
you can actually adjust that 2 + 3 DB to
get<00:02:12.000> better<00:02:12.150> coverage<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.870> high

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
get better coverage of the high

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.890 
get better coverage of the high

is sound Neath this at 220 watts RMS our
guess<00:02:33.760> that's<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.150> peak<00:02:34.390> value<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:37.200> of

guess that's the peak value and of

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.810 
guess that's the peak value and of
course<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.530> gives<00:02:38.680> us<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.980> impedance<00:02:39.640> which

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
course it gives us the impedance which

it's<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:47.950> female<00:02:48.370> socket<00:02:49.110> all<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.260> do<00:02:50.470> is<00:02:50.709> you

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
it's a female socket all you do is you

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.860 
it's a female socket all you do is you
line<00:02:51.010> up<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:53.459> large<00:02:54.459> put<00:02:54.730> on<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:54.910> top<00:02:55.150> push<00:02:55.690> it

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
line up the large put on the top push it

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.830 
line up the large put on the top push it
in<00:02:56.020> as<00:02:56.800> you<00:02:57.010> turn<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:58.209> clicks<00:02:58.540> into<00:02:58.720> place

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
in as you turn it it clicks into place

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.840 
in as you turn it it clicks into place
again<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.709> pull<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.010> out<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.459> turn<00:03:00.610> it<00:03:00.730> back

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
again you pull it out to turn it back

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.940 
again you pull it out to turn it back
out<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:03.040> means<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.489> once<00:03:03.850> it's<00:03:04.060> in<00:03:04.209> there

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
out that means that once it's in there

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.260 
out that means that once it's in there
it's<00:03:05.950> nice<00:03:06.070> and<00:03:06.400> secure<00:03:06.550> it's<00:03:06.910> not<00:03:07.060> going<00:03:07.209> to

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
it's nice and secure it's not going to

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.440 
it's nice and secure it's not going to
come<00:03:07.420> out<00:03:07.540> while<00:03:08.410> it's<00:03:08.560> in<00:03:08.680> use<00:03:09.209> it's<00:03:10.209> got<00:03:10.420> a

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
come out while it's in use it's got a

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.510 
come out while it's in use it's got a
handle<00:03:10.660> on<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.170> top<00:03:11.200> quite<00:03:11.860> easy<00:03:12.010> lifting

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
handle on the top quite easy lifting

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.330 
handle on the top quite easy lifting
rather<00:03:12.790> when<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.060> do<00:03:13.180> lift<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:13.600> it<00:03:13.780> will<00:03:14.340> fall

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
rather when you do lift it it will fall

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.479 
rather when you do lift it it will fall
at<00:03:15.610> an<00:03:15.730> angle<00:03:16.650> doesn't<00:03:17.650> make<00:03:17.739> it<00:03:17.920> very<00:03:17.950> easy<00:03:18.160> to

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
at an angle doesn't make it very easy to

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.690 
at an angle doesn't make it very easy to
carry<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.750> sides<00:03:20.049> are<00:03:20.320> also<00:03:20.769> at<00:03:21.190> an<00:03:21.310> angle

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
carry to the sides are also at an angle

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.120 
carry to the sides are also at an angle
so<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:21.970> can<00:03:22.360> actually<00:03:22.510> use<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:23.019> as<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.440> wedge<00:03:23.799> so

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
so you can actually use it as a wedge so

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.490 
so you can actually use it as a wedge so
some<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.519> ways<00:03:24.640> we've<00:03:24.880> in<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.000> back<00:03:25.500> still

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
some of the ways we've in the back still

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.770 
some of the ways we've in the back still
just<00:03:27.340> about<00:03:27.610> enough<00:03:27.880> room<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.330> have<00:03:28.540> your

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
just about enough room to have your

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.590 
just about enough room to have your
speakon<00:03:29.410> connector<00:03:30.060> without<00:03:31.060> damaging<00:03:31.480> the

speakon connector without damaging the

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.560 
speakon connector without damaging the
back<00:03:31.840> again<00:03:32.410> depending<00:03:32.950> on<00:03:33.100> which<00:03:33.640> connector

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
back again depending on which connector

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.720 
back again depending on which connector
which<00:03:34.780> brand<00:03:35.049> of<00:03:35.140> connects<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:35.620> use<00:03:38.730> that's

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
which brand of connects you use that's

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.789 
which brand of connects you use that's
like<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.720> front<00:03:41.049> one<00:03:41.290> you've<00:03:41.440> got<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.680> as<00:03:41.769> a

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
like the front one you've got it as a

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.470 
like the front one you've got it as a
wedge<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:43.540> angle<00:03:43.900> isn't<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.250> best<00:03:45.489> usually<00:03:46.209> I

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
wedge the angle isn't the best usually I

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.380 
wedge the angle isn't the best usually I
would<00:03:47.049> usually<00:03:47.200> have<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:47.620> slightly<00:03:47.860> higher

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
would usually have it slightly higher

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.080 
would usually have it slightly higher
but<00:03:49.390> again<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:49.810> can<00:03:50.019> use<00:03:50.340> songs<00:03:51.340> crop<00:03:51.790> and

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
but again you can use songs crop and

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.420 
but again you can use songs crop and
there's<00:03:52.209> Neath<00:03:52.360> it<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.630> keep<00:03:52.810> it<00:03:52.989> there<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:54.280> is

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
there's Neath it to keep it there it is

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.130 
there's Neath it to keep it there it is
a<00:03:54.459> nice<00:03:54.700> little<00:03:54.970> wedge<00:03:55.239> if<00:03:55.510> you're<00:03:55.720> doing<00:03:55.989> a
