the<00:01:56.759> game<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.149> weren't<00:01:57.719> there<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.049> past<00:01:58.290> call

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the game that weren't there in past call

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.469 
the game that weren't there in past call
of<00:01:58.649> duty<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.100> now<00:01:59.520> there's<00:01:59.729> just<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.329> much

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
of duty and now there's just so much

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.230 
of duty and now there's just so much
more<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.320> can<00:02:01.439> do<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:01.890> much<00:02:02.009> more

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
more that you can do so much more

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.100 
more that you can do so much more
customization<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.390> I'm<00:02:03.780> going<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.990> talk

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
customization and I'm going to talk

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.810 
customization and I'm going to talk
about<00:02:04.229> customization<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:05.070> another<00:02:05.490> video<00:02:05.670> I

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
about customization in another video I

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.730 
about customization in another video I
think<00:02:06.149> but<00:02:06.600> for<00:02:06.780> now<00:02:06.899> let's<00:02:07.110> keep<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.439> supply

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
think but for now let's keep it supply

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.320 
think but for now let's keep it supply
drops<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.250> elite<00:02:08.550> variants<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.929> think

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
drops and elite variants and I think

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.700 
drops and elite variants and I think
they<00:02:10.479> will<00:02:10.750> definitely<00:02:10.990> be<00:02:11.380> bringing

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
they will definitely be bringing

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.200 
they will definitely be bringing
something<00:02:12.040> like<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.460> to<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.730> table<00:02:12.880> in

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
something like that to the table in

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.670 
something like that to the table in
black<00:02:13.330> ops<00:02:13.540> 3<00:02:13.630> I<00:02:13.870> don't<00:02:14.110> see<00:02:14.290> how<00:02:14.470> they<00:02:14.620> could

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
black ops 3 I don't see how they could

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.060 
black ops 3 I don't see how they could
go<00:02:15.340> back<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.270> no<00:02:16.690> Supply<00:02:17.110> Drop<00:02:17.170> game<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.890> my

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
go back to a no Supply Drop game in my

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.160 
go back to a no Supply Drop game in my
opinion<00:02:18.100> because<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.880> just<00:02:19.000> it's<00:02:19.630> something

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
opinion because it just it's something

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.840 
opinion because it just it's something
they<00:02:20.440> call<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.770> duty<00:02:20.980> has<00:02:21.130> been<00:02:21.340> lacking<00:02:21.490> for<00:02:21.790> a

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
they call of duty has been lacking for a

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.550 
they call of duty has been lacking for a
long<00:02:22.000> time<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.360> with<00:02:22.510> advanced<00:02:22.810> warfare<00:02:23.170> they

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
long time and with advanced warfare they

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.200 
long time and with advanced warfare they
finally<00:02:23.950> put<00:02:24.130> it<00:02:24.220> in<00:02:24.340> if<00:02:24.550> you<00:02:24.670> look<00:02:24.850> at<00:02:24.970> games

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
finally put it in if you look at games

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.470 
finally put it in if you look at games
like<00:02:25.480> counter-strike<00:02:25.780> csgo<00:02:26.710> they<00:02:27.370> have<00:02:27.820> these

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
like counter-strike csgo they have these

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.390 
like counter-strike csgo they have these
case<00:02:28.810> openings<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.410> people<00:02:30.010> are<00:02:30.250> obsessed

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
case openings and people are obsessed

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.890 
case openings and people are obsessed
with<00:02:30.700> them<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.000> know<00:02:31.090> it's<00:02:31.300> awesome<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.690> have

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
with them you know it's awesome to have

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.630 
with them you know it's awesome to have
a<00:02:32.140> gun<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.590> made<00:02:32.830> me<00:02:32.920> somebody<00:02:33.250> else<00:02:33.370> doesn't

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
a gun that made me somebody else doesn't

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.890 
a gun that made me somebody else doesn't
have<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.210> believe<00:02:34.240> in<00:02:34.600> counter-strike

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
have and I believe in counter-strike

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.020 
have and I believe in counter-strike
it's<00:02:35.260> just<00:02:35.470> like<00:02:35.620> palette<00:02:35.980> swaps<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:36.880> it's

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
it's just like palette swaps so it's

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.400 
it's just like palette swaps so it's
just<00:02:37.180> different<00:02:37.360> cameras<00:02:37.840> for<00:02:37.990> Uganda<00:02:38.290> but

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
just different cameras for Uganda but

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.110 
just different cameras for Uganda but
some<00:02:38.590> of<00:02:38.680> these<00:02:38.740> camels<00:02:39.130> are<00:02:39.280> very<00:02:39.850> rare<00:02:40.090> and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
some of these camels are very rare and

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.970 
some of these camels are very rare and
if<00:02:40.450> they<00:02:40.600> bring<00:02:40.870> this<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.200> advanced<00:02:41.500> warfare<00:02:41.830> I

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
if they bring this to advanced warfare I

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.950 
if they bring this to advanced warfare I
would<00:02:42.130> like<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.340> see<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.880> counter-strike<00:02:43.630> type

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
would like to see a counter-strike type

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.170 
would like to see a counter-strike type
system<00:02:44.680> where<00:02:44.860> you're<00:02:44.950> able<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.400> sell<00:02:45.670> the

supply drops or trade them and I

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.810 
supply drops or trade them and I
definitely<00:02:47.710> think<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.160> there<00:02:48.370> should<00:02:48.400> be<00:02:48.670> a

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
definitely think that there should be a

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.390 
definitely think that there should be a
Supply<00:02:49.420> Drop<00:02:49.480> trade<00:02:50.080> shop<00:02:50.410> where<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.040> can<00:02:51.130> if

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
you have a gun that somebody else wants

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.780 
you have a gun that somebody else wants
maybe<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.410> could<00:02:53.620> trade<00:02:53.800> my<00:02:53.830> Moore's<00:02:54.280> doctor

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
maybe I could trade my Moore's doctor

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.180 
maybe I could trade my Moore's doctor
for<00:02:55.030> your<00:02:55.060> as<00:02:55.390> someone<00:02:56.140> speakeasy<00:02:56.770> I<00:02:56.890> think

that would be absolutely awesome to have
the<00:02:59.350> ability<00:02:59.440> to<00:03:00.010> do<00:03:00.490> that<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:01.000> think<00:03:01.209> that

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
the ability to do that and I think that

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.550 
the ability to do that and I think that
that's<00:03:01.330> something<00:03:01.810> they<00:03:02.020> should<00:03:02.170> definitely

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
that's something they should definitely

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.160 
that's something they should definitely
bring<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.010> table<00:03:03.220> in<00:03:04.090> black<00:03:04.540> ops<00:03:04.750> 3<00:03:04.870> and

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
bring to the table in black ops 3 and

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.270 
bring to the table in black ops 3 and
now<00:03:05.620> i'm<00:03:06.190> gonna<00:03:06.430> go<00:03:06.550> ahead<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.790> say<00:03:06.970> i<00:03:07.330> am<00:03:08.280> 95%

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
now i'm gonna go ahead and say i am 95%

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.160 
now i'm gonna go ahead and say i am 95%
sure<00:03:09.520> that<00:03:09.790> they<00:03:09.910> would<00:03:10.120> bring<00:03:10.450> some<00:03:10.990> type<00:03:11.140> of

elite<00:03:14.680> variants<00:03:15.250> are<00:03:15.370> concerned<00:03:15.700> I'm<00:03:16.120> not

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
elite variants are concerned I'm not

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.520 
elite variants are concerned I'm not
sure<00:03:16.540> how<00:03:16.690> they're<00:03:16.840> going<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.050> do<00:03:17.140> that<00:03:17.290> will

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
sure how they're going to do that will

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.380 
sure how they're going to do that will
they<00:03:17.560> make<00:03:17.890> it<00:03:17.950> so<00:03:18.640> that<00:03:18.790> there<00:03:18.970> will<00:03:19.090> just<00:03:19.150> be

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
they make it so that there will just be

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.509 
they make it so that there will just be

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
will they do this elite variant thing

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.060 
will they do this elite variant thing
where<00:03:25.150> some<00:03:25.360> nums<00:03:25.570> are<00:03:25.720> just<00:03:25.930> better<00:03:26.350> than

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
where some nums are just better than

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.710 
where some nums are just better than
other<00:03:27.280> guns<00:03:27.519> because<00:03:27.700> as<00:03:27.940> we've<00:03:28.239> seen<00:03:28.480> some

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
other guns because as we've seen some

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.420 
other guns because as we've seen some
people<00:03:28.989> really<00:03:29.260> dislike<00:03:29.890> that<00:03:30.040> some<00:03:30.220> people

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430

people really dislike that some people
think<00:03:30.580> it's<00:03:30.790> unfair<00:03:31.180> that<00:03:31.420> some<00:03:31.870> people<00:03:32.080> get

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
think it's unfair that some people get

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.750 
think it's unfair that some people get
such<00:03:32.410> great<00:03:32.650> guns<00:03:32.980> but<00:03:33.190> let<00:03:33.340> me<00:03:33.370> know<00:03:33.519> what<00:03:33.640> do

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760

you<00:03:33.850> think<00:03:34.150> in<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.330> comments<00:03:35.080> section<00:03:35.110> below

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
you think in the comments section below

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.050 
you think in the comments section below
as<00:03:35.709> far<00:03:35.739> as<00:03:36.010> I'm<00:03:36.190> concerned<00:03:36.220> they<00:03:37.030> are

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
as far as I'm concerned they are

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.199 
as far as I'm concerned they are
definitely<00:03:37.510> bringing<00:03:38.400> supply<00:03:39.400> drops<00:03:39.640> back<00:03:40.000> to

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
definitely bringing supply drops back to

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.460 
definitely bringing supply drops back to
black<00:03:40.450> ops<00:03:40.630> 3<00:03:40.780> from<00:03:40.900> everything<00:03:41.290> we've<00:03:41.440> seen

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
black ops 3 from everything we've seen

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.170 
black ops 3 from everything we've seen
and<00:03:41.920> heard<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.250> think<00:03:42.580> that<00:03:42.700> there's<00:03:42.850> no<00:03:43.030> way

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
and heard I think that there's no way

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.580 
and heard I think that there's no way
that<00:03:43.209> they<00:03:43.480> wouldn't<00:03:43.810> bring<00:03:44.019> them<00:03:44.200> back<00:03:44.380> and

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
that they wouldn't bring them back and

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.620 
that they wouldn't bring them back and
so<00:03:45.100> yeah<00:03:45.250> that's<00:03:45.430> my<00:03:45.580> opinion<00:03:45.880> black<00:03:46.269> ops<00:03:46.450> 3

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
so yeah that's my opinion black ops 3

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.509 
so yeah that's my opinion black ops 3
will<00:03:46.840> have<00:03:47.019> supply<00:03:47.320> drops<00:03:47.590> in<00:03:47.800> addition<00:03:48.459> to

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
will have supply drops in addition to

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:49.890 
will have supply drops in addition to
that<00:03:48.640> I<00:03:48.790> think<00:03:48.820> that<00:03:49.060> some<00:03:49.330> type<00:03:49.510> of<00:03:49.540> weapon

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
that I think that some type of weapon

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.630 
that I think that some type of weapon
variants<00:03:50.230> will<00:03:50.410> come<00:03:50.590> back<00:03:50.800> let<00:03:51.340> me<00:03:51.370> know<00:03:51.519> what

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
variants will come back let me know what

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.500 
variants will come back let me know what
