00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:09.719
 mean using now 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:12.809
 modern wall boilers 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.699
 dual circuit single circuit we 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.070
 We face such a problem as 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.050
 volatility of boilers i.e. 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.070
 let's say ariston boiler 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.640
 we are generally any italian or 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.769
 German brand is very sensitive to 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.260
 voltage drops and the like 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.090
 the question is solved naturally by installation 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.590
 stabilizer further 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.579
 electricity in our country very often 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.629
 shut off 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:50.780
 and for reasons of accident and understandable reasons 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.770
 it happens what to do with Katya 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.379
 volatile can of course 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.539
 use 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.170
 power station but again boilers 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.110
 sensitive to the sine wave which gives 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.000
 power station either use 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.010
 initially 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.070
 in vector powerhouse but they 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:17.210
 quite expensive 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:21.720
 what can i offer you here is one of 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.810
 the most inexpensive options are such here 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.770
 the inverter is also a stabilizer 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.770
 battery charger then 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.850
 there is 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.920
 battery connects to this 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:39.079
 battery inverter is desirable to take 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.020
 larger capacity and preferably of course 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.659
 gel which is not afraid of deep 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.590
 discharges to one and a half thousand in my 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:52.219
 deep charge cycles 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:56.890
 the battery is also worth not small money well 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:59.299
 but we can say that almost forever 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.909
 you can use ordinary car 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.239
 but there do not allow deep discharges 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:09.950
 Here we have a gel battery here 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:13.810
 there is also an inverter that is when disconnecting 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.569
 light or account with a strong drop 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.650
 the inverter works for us as a psk 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.160
 computer that is it switches 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.769
 immediately on the battery and takes power 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.819
 with a 12 volt battery converts it 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.720
 in 220 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:34.700
 Well, the starting frequency of 50 hertz, as it were 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.099
 you did we test the tests are worth 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.760
 100 ampere battery 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:44.680
 an hour is enough for about 12 hours of work 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:50.480
 the inverter boiler 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:54.260
 come with a different power of 850 ampere hours 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:59.090
 mine is he able to give out somewhere 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:02.299
 500 watts and then blogs for the boiler to us 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.530
 this inverter is quite enough 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:09.400
 mean in the limit 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.400
 6 7 thousand who is the battery 12 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:19.910
 can in principle not be afraid to leave the house 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:23.079
 go somewhere there this is what we have 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.730
 when turning off the light, defrost systems 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:30.500
 that is, when turning on the electricity 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.419
 back the inverter charges the discharged 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.629
 battery and works on like 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:37.420
 stabilizer 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:42.140
 such is the scheme 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.750
 Inverters in my opinion an additional 2 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.970
 sockets can 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.530
 1 mass is used for the other boiler 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.530
 for gas valve
