00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.460
 Turn around and there on your thing or things. 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.139
 Brazil, how are you? What 's up? 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.089
 People, I'll tell you something here. 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.039
 I've always been a guy who leaves the 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.990
 things like that for the last hour but not 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.760
 It's for the last hour. 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.560
 hour last seconds I have to 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.029
 to do something like this 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.550
 but I'll say it does not exist, it's not for 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.710
 I'm lazy but it's because of laziness 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.869
 year day without too lazy and say 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.450
 feeling of having a time that I do not 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.890
 I'm 70, this feeling is not so much I'm going 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.960
 have this feeling and when will you see 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.629
 Fuck, kind of a schoolteacher. 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.760
 I was going to spend a book for a month. 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.690
 to read a book I was doing for 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:50.399
 start the table book did not start reading 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.989
 the book five minutes before the event and 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.570
 if the move to leave everything to the last 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.190
 time reads book deliver work do 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.500
 Do that do the dishes in the pond. 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.300
 of the mother not from here to make that cry if 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.730
 can speak but it was expected that there would 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.350
 with a speech here, because I know 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.049
 that he ran away to deliver everything from 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.490
 last minute the team to bad not speech 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.200
 will not be today because it is not the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.280
 politically correct speech because I 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.260
 with my speech politically 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.420
 wrong that I left everything to last 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.680
 time I was doing well as incredible as it seems 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.030
 I was doing well 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.890
 today I think the following when you have a 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.049
 Proof and tauari teacher warns you that 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.020
 approving a month before the race but is 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.659
 if it's eroding down, it's a teacher's 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.090
 Isabella who had evidence in evidence 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.619
 month I did not think about the race until the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.880
 contact proof 11 have got going 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.990
 problem of a gentleman missing a young lady 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.790
 knows that those friends who stay so 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.439
 You know you know the guy keeps picking it up. 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.780
 information of everyone so get 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.369
 I'm going to draw four I'm not abstracting everything 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.470
 to pretend that he did not listen when the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.210
 teacher so start the test I 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.140
 I worried it was too late I did not have 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.000
 what to do 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.880
 but going back to the book when 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.159
 teacher passed a book to us 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.130
 read what I did she gave herself a month to 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.750
 read 20 days of gossip I forgot and free 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.170
 existed was the cock 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.090
 yours the last week the last two days 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.619
 I always made the reader very fast. 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.119
 then make a dynamic reading such that 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.129
 I understood, I always asked. 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.780
 There was a lot of simplification good to not 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.360
 I say this more incredible though it may seem 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.920
 when the evidence reached imports 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.750
 person wanted there at the beginning when the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.520
 teacher passed the house book was 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.620
 forgotten was already very wet with the 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.390
 own ten days and had 20 days 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.610
 to think a test as well as the 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.860
 questions and 16 God and it gets noel if 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.450
 saw that it was what gave the team 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.030
 but the problem is that I was 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.830
 so with proofs with works 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.290
 to stop to change a little because 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.790
 Work sucks work and school 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.530
 work and college deals with a 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.780
 work that is is a bag is not because 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.940
 work does not imply you and this is the 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.070
 brain working together implies that 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.540
 people together with you more brains 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.040
 more people talking more people 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.390
 filling the bag and more people to 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.040
 deliver the job more perspective of 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.480
 note is more work to fuck famous 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.550
 They do not want anything, it's not good. 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.950
 work that you accept in the bossa group you 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.870
 You're to blame if you're doing something wrong, you did not do anything. 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.520
 I cried that it does not have you not 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.110
 to make a visit to you it's going to be bad if it goes away 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.760
 blame anyone else for a job 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.430
 school college work anyway 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.560
 always has a clique to do work 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.690
 is not always so best friends with 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.239
 best friends then if it's five 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.130
 best group good friends together 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.750
 incubus, the work is only reasonable 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.280
 also recipe that group of guys 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.080

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.540

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.950

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.769
 They are not even there for nothing, we are use in the 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.810

 it will pay well know a bid is that 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.350
 It's always that group that the teacher 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.780
 hates the members she does not care 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.400
 five bis lupi dogs there doing groups 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.170
 can do a little legal work but 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.459
 It was this teacher who hates cars. 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:54.090
 So she's going to watch the work like this. 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:57.030
 in the face of new contempt was lacking with 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.350
 the pins calderón that enough then is neither 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.330
 that's why the guys are talking about her 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.680
 You are thinking about how the guys will do 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.549
 né type face can cause the ball 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.260
 not whiter 00 what you are already marked 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.390
 by the teacher you are the face of the foundation 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.400
 that she hates no matter who does the 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.350

 the nerd gathers without speech he throws me there 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.990

 will everything take 10 formed valley of the tongue 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.099
 What's this is that the test is time for 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.289
 themselves and talk like that 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:36.690

 world does not look people do not keep better 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.490
 of which I was most angry at this group 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.139
 waste is that they go all 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.090
 right there they intercede 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.310

 I work and the teacher there 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.280

 nice to have a little and to finish 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.919
 there are those groups of travelers 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.840
 those who do not even know they will have 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.550
 do not even know they are in the group. 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.409
 they discover that they are in the group one 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.599

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.340

 the group wants a job ready and see 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.580
 that treacherous isaf of a plan that exists 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.050
 My group is a very 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.060
 interesting was a group that was 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.759

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.199
 us two hours before delivering the 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.669
 work, we spoke here, we were 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.440
 one group had not delivered the work 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.349

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:45.630
 The conclusion of all this is as follows 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:48.360
 Working in a group sucks 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.070

 In conclusion, this video had a lot of 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:26.159
