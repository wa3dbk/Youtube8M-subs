00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.969
 but also lead this report Alexey 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:03.180
 Pershin and reconsiders 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.970
 good afternoon dear cold fans 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.730
 France 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.190
 accepts herds of cattle and pigs 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.589
 already prepare replenishment 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.699
 confused means accepts it so 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:16.209
 in the match now we will see the battle dance in 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.730
 performance of Samarans 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.640
 m but let's see how different 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.640
 from Georgian 1 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.109
 protocol 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.669
 to show 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.390
 and I'm floating to you 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.320
 but father cents 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.320
 to factory 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.350
 sands after such stations 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.190
 further contributing 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.820
 fortification in the team 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.220
 togetherness probably games can solve 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.740
 long deadpan faces 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.710
 that's only in Russian 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.549
 absolute indifference of all goes 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.200
 about showing all your best 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.799
 the guys we saw and did not see this 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.220
 no and if so 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.860
 do not speak 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.610
 he was what they saw and how these teams 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.670
 panties and am friends with each other 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.050
 remember what 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.280
 we managed to sucked section of the section 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.420
 article of that year 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.340
 ruby state met between 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.720
 five times 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.690
 and so far so far disappointing 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.440
 statistics for 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.750
 for execution 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.660
 but they never beat South 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.630
 Africa probably has this 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.400
 certain reasons in the world ranking 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.420
 these commands are and 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.299
 don't say that very near 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.489
 but they are separated by 6 positions m fourth 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.199
 ranking position
