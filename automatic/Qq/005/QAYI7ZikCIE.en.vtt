00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.730 
of sauce now this is the lien parents
are<00:02:02.969> very<00:02:03.060> strong<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.899> we<00:02:04.079> want<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.409> be<00:02:04.500> careful

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
are very strong so we want to be careful

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.630 
are very strong so we want to be careful
but<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.430> pairs<00:02:05.909> really<00:02:06.240> well<00:02:06.420> with<00:02:06.630> beef<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:08.340> we

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
but it pairs really well with beef so we

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.990 
but it pairs really well with beef so we
put<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:08.910> back<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.450> machine

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
put this back on the machine

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.160 
put this back on the machine
again<00:02:12.000> if<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.180> could<00:02:12.330> feel<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.870> very

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
again if you could feel this is very

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.050 
again if you could feel this is very
very<00:02:13.440> cold<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.100> that's<00:02:14.340> where<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.730> should<00:02:14.790> be

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
very cold and that's where it should be

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.270 
very cold and that's where it should be
do<00:02:15.209> not<00:02:15.240> try<00:02:15.660> this<00:02:15.690> when<00:02:16.050> if<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.440> burger<00:02:17.069> meat

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
do not try this when if the burger meat

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.550 
do not try this when if the burger meat
does<00:02:17.580> not<00:02:17.819> hold<00:02:18.240> it<00:02:18.990> will<00:02:19.170> not<00:02:19.319> work<00:02:19.530> properly

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
does not hold it will not work properly

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.100 
does not hold it will not work properly
so<00:02:20.250> give<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.150> mix<00:02:22.160> do<00:02:23.160> not<00:02:23.340> over<00:02:23.610> mix

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
so give this a mix do not over mix

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.300 
so give this a mix do not over mix
you're<00:02:25.110> not<00:02:25.260> over<00:02:25.530> handle<00:02:25.920> these<00:02:26.040> are<00:02:26.220> the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
you're not over handle these are the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.580 
you're not over handle these are the
secrets<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.880> burgers<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:30.290> probably<00:02:31.290> that's

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
secrets to burgers and probably that's

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.640 
secrets to burgers and probably that's
enough<00:02:32.270> so<00:02:33.270> that<00:02:33.300> was<00:02:33.600> on<00:02:33.750> for<00:02:34.080> maybe<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.380> minute

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
enough so that was on for maybe a minute

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.190 
enough so that was on for maybe a minute
and<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.890> half<00:02:35.010> two<00:02:35.280> minutes<00:02:35.400> if<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:36.020> you<00:02:37.020> can

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
and a half two minutes if that you can

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.870 
and a half two minutes if that you can
go<00:02:37.350> in<00:02:37.500> also<00:02:37.860> with<00:02:37.980> other<00:02:38.160> flavors<00:02:38.459> sometimes

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
go in also with other flavors sometimes

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.140 
go in also with other flavors sometimes
I<00:02:39.209> like<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.510> put<00:02:39.690> in<00:02:40.040> onion<00:02:41.040> salt<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.580> garlic

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
I like to put in onion salt and garlic

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.910 
I like to put in onion salt and garlic
salt<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.540> don't<00:02:42.690> normally<00:02:42.870> use<00:02:43.140> salts<00:02:43.680> but<00:02:43.800> they

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
salt I don't normally use salts but they

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.770 
salt I don't normally use salts but they
work<00:02:44.100> really<00:02:44.340> well<00:02:44.489> for<00:02:44.880> this<00:02:45.330> type<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.690> a

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
work really well for this type of a

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.620 
work really well for this type of a
presentation<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:47.070> if<00:02:47.970> you're<00:02:48.150> not<00:02:48.300> sure<00:02:48.360> about

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
presentation so if you're not sure about

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.780 
presentation so if you're not sure about
its<00:02:49.140> seasoning<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.680> great<00:02:50.160> trick<00:02:50.489> would<00:02:50.670> be<00:02:50.700> to

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
its seasoning a great trick would be to

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.790 
its seasoning a great trick would be to
take<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.060> small<00:02:51.420> piece<00:02:51.630> out<00:02:51.930> make<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.560> little

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
take a small piece out make a little

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.710 
take a small piece out make a little
hamburger<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.640> taste<00:02:53.940> cook<00:02:54.330> it<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.570> then

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
hamburger and taste cook it and then

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.990 
hamburger and taste cook it and then
taste<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.170> first<00:02:55.440> then<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.310> can<00:02:56.340> go<00:02:56.610> ahead<00:02:56.700> and

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
taste it first then you can go ahead and

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.229 
taste it first then you can go ahead and
try<00:02:57.180> them<00:02:57.360> all<00:02:57.480> make<00:02:58.350> them<00:02:58.530> all<00:02:58.650> up<00:02:59.000> for<00:03:00.000> later

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
try them all make them all up for later

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.680 
try them all make them all up for later
on<00:03:00.769> to<00:03:01.769> shape<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.220> hamburgers<00:03:02.819> bearing<00:03:03.569> in

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
on to shape the hamburgers bearing in

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.150 
on to shape the hamburgers bearing in
mind<00:03:03.720> once<00:03:04.080> again<00:03:04.350> if<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.739> don't<00:03:04.950> want<00:03:05.100> to

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
mind once again if you don't want to

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.860 
mind once again if you don't want to
handle<00:03:05.280> them<00:03:05.489> too<00:03:05.670> much<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:06.090> have<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.480> couple<00:03:06.810> of

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
handle them too much I have a couple of

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.170 
handle them too much I have a couple of
ways<00:03:07.019> for<00:03:07.319> you<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:08.040> first<00:03:08.220> way<00:03:08.489> is<00:03:08.519> if<00:03:09.090> you

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
ways for you the first way is if you

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.540 
ways for you the first way is if you
want<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.450> thinner<00:03:10.370> hamburger<00:03:11.370> or<00:03:11.519> something

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
want a thinner hamburger or something

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.580 
want a thinner hamburger or something
like<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.360> would<00:03:12.510> work<00:03:12.630> really<00:03:12.840> well<00:03:12.989> on

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
like this that would work really well on

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.550 
like this that would work really well on
a<00:03:13.650> barbecue<00:03:14.370> outside<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.510> I'm<00:03:16.260> going<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.440> show

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
you how to put that together we take a

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.509

want a smaller with four ounces the

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.190 
want a smaller with four ounces the
bigger<00:03:24.060> they<00:03:24.239> are<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.510> easier<00:03:24.840> they<00:03:25.019> are<00:03:25.049> to

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
bigger they are the easier they are to

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.560 
bigger they are the easier they are to
handle<00:03:25.680> on<00:03:25.799> it<00:03:25.950> especially<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.519> barbecue<00:03:26.850> so

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
I'm just going to pop this onto some

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.340 
I'm just going to pop this onto some
saran<00:03:29.160> wrap<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:29.640> have<00:03:29.910> here<00:03:30.269> some<00:03:30.900> plastic
