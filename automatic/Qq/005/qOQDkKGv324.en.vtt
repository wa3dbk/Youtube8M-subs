00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.000
 To fulfill his promise to build a school in Tibet 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.470
 Sakyong started running marathons to get money. 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.450
 SMR: This is put into the shoe. 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.650
 When you cross the starting line and finish line, it will check your time. 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.000
 Mitchell Levy: And do they have checkpoints to make sure you haven't run off the track? 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.150
 SMR: I think you can take a taxi. [laughter] 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.100
 Mitchell Levy: [Laughs] I'd do that. 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.100
 SMR: I think they have a way to do it. 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:34.280
 [whistle] Starter: Five, four, three, two, one [siren sound] 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.000
 SMR: We run for Tibet, we run for these reasons 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.240
 and every time you know you have a little bit of suffering, it will help many people. 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:52.300
 [encouragement and clapping] 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.630
 I think in the West sometimes the body and mind are divided; 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.210
 so when people think about meditation or spiritual life, 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.340
 they think it is about getting away from the body as such. 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.230
 In fact, they should be united. 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.150
 Sometimes, when you first run, you have a lot of thoughts. 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.650
 As in meditation, when you first sit down, you have a lot of thoughts. 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.000
 And then, as you move, you start to balance your mind and body; 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.540
 So I think it is with any kind of sport or activity. 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.170
 When you are riding; it's a balance. When skiing or playing golf 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.000
 whatever it is; there is coordination of mind and body. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.860
 And that is innate; 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.000
 because the concept of meditation means that you synchronize your mind with your body. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.290
 You are using the present moment as a measuring machine; 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.500
 and when you let your mind go too far into the future 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.000
 like: "how much I have left" and so on, sometimes you get tired sometimes. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 The present moment can be this very full moment. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.160
 When you run, if you can be there, time passes very quickly. 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.520
 The more the mind is processed, the stronger it is. 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.580
 the more flexible it becomes. Same with the body. 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.000
 I think that when you train the body, it becomes stronger and more flexible.
