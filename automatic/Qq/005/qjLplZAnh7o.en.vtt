00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
fence that will short it out and will

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.789 
fence that will short it out and will
drain<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.909> battery<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.570> cause<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.619> have

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
drain the battery and cause you to have

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.999 
drain the battery and cause you to have
a<00:01:14.130> low<00:01:14.460> voltage<00:01:14.760> reading<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.540> your<00:01:15.720> fence<00:01:16.009> one

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
a low voltage reading on your fence one

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.200 
a low voltage reading on your fence one
of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> other<00:01:17.280> things<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.670> helps<00:01:18.000> with

of the other things that helps with
grass<00:01:18.479> as<00:01:18.750> well<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.290> sag<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:20.159> put<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.880> extra

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
grass as well is sag I put in extra

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.380 
grass as well is sag I put in extra
posts<00:01:22.549> because<00:01:23.549> if<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.820> don't<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.210> that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
posts because if you don't have that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.120 
posts because if you don't have that

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
extra post you can kind of see that the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.719 
extra post you can kind of see that the
fence<00:01:26.369> sag<00:01:26.670> down<00:01:30.290> now<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.320> use<00:01:31.680> premier<00:01:32.220> fencing

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
fence sag down now I use premier fencing

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.550 
fence sag down now I use premier fencing
and<00:01:32.970> they<00:01:33.689> came<00:01:33.840> out<00:01:33.960> with<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.140> new<00:01:34.290> product

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
and they came out with a new product

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.380 
and they came out with a new product
it's<00:01:34.829> like<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.100> premier<00:01:35.280> plus<00:01:35.850> chicken

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
it's like the premier plus chicken

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.539 
it's like the premier plus chicken
netting<00:01:36.659> which<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.799> shorter<00:01:38.159> run<00:01:38.340> it's

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
netting which it's just shorter run it's

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.780 
netting which it's just shorter run it's
a<00:01:38.640> hundred-foot<00:01:39.180> run<00:01:39.420> versus<00:01:39.810> 164<00:01:40.710> foot<00:01:41.430> but

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
a hundred-foot run versus 164 foot but

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.149 
a hundred-foot run versus 164 foot but
they<00:01:41.909> have<00:01:42.150> more<00:01:42.600> fence<00:01:42.899> posts<00:01:43.350> tied<00:01:43.740> closer

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
they have more fence posts tied closer

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.100 
they have more fence posts tied closer
together<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.450> don't<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.960> run

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
together so that you don't have to run

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.920 
together so that you don't have to run
around<00:01:46.229> extra<00:01:46.979> fence<00:01:47.189> posts<00:01:47.549> tying<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.659> you

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.749 
both on farm sometimes some of my fences
I<00:01:55.110> put<00:01:55.290> extra<00:01:55.439> posts<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.579> was<00:01:56.670> an

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
I put extra posts in and that was an

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.819 
I put extra posts in and that was an
extra<00:01:57.000> expense<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.990> have<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.229> extra<00:01:58.469> posts

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
extra expense to have the extra posts

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.380 
extra expense to have the extra posts
but<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.310> hundred<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.670> sixty<00:01:59.969> four<00:02:00.119> foot

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
but it's a hundred and sixty four foot

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.690 
but it's a hundred and sixty four foot
run<00:02:00.570> versus<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> hundred<00:02:01.290> foot<00:02:01.649> run<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.460> there's

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
run versus a hundred foot run so there's

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.090 
run versus a hundred foot run so there's
a<00:02:02.759> toss<00:02:03.180> up<00:02:03.450> whatever<00:02:03.960> works<00:02:04.200> for<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.560> works

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
a toss up whatever works for you works

horizontal lines on the fence can get
