00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:06.919
Yup.

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:20.580
Hi, mum! Hi, dad! This is your wonderful
and wildly successful daughter

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.338
recording you a letter to you from the glorious starship Enterprise.

00:00:24.773 --> 00:00:27.657
I know it’s later than I said I would,
but as a security officer,

00:00:27.687 --> 00:00:29.798
I have a lot of responsibilities...

00:00:29.828 --> 00:00:31.057
even as an ensign.

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:38.794
That. Was. Startling.

00:00:44.156 --> 00:00:46.221
Over there is the recreation room

00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:49.458
perpetually populated by every
other member of the crew

00:00:49.488 --> 00:00:51.961
and next door is sick bay.

00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:54.086
Normally, I like the
proximity to the sick bay,

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:56.829
but, every once in a while,
we bring somebody on board...

00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:05.778
The scream-y fellow is doctor Adams

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:09.897
I think? - from the
penal colony - maybe?

00:01:10.363 --> 00:01:12.214
He’s being held down the corridor.

00:01:18.392 --> 00:01:19.929
interesting fact:

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.686
Did you know that most of the quarters on
board the Enterprise don’t even have windows?

00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:28.011
There are maybe six portholes
in the entire place

00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:30.517
and you usually have to go
to the bridge for them.

00:01:30.895 --> 00:01:32.295
Mine’s over there.

00:01:32.983 --> 00:01:33.983
My window.

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:35.643
I’m pretty lucky.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:39.219
Kirk...

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:40.633
to Enterprise!

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.420
Kirk...

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.161
to Enterprise!

00:01:47.196 --> 00:01:48.254
Captain Kirk?

00:01:48.284 --> 00:01:50.410
Ensign Williams here. Come in. Kirk?

00:01:57.085 --> 00:01:58.788
I love you, mum and dad! Bye!

00:01:58.874 --> 00:02:02.074

00:02:12.303 --> 00:02:13.552
Kirk... to...

00:02:13.824 --> 00:02:15.748
Enterprise!

00:02:16.363 --> 00:02:17.481
Kirk to...

00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:18.640
anyone!

00:02:18.983 --> 00:02:20.172
Anyone!

00:02:20.736 --> 00:02:21.736
The pain!

00:02:22.502 --> 00:02:23.502
Someone!

00:02:24.053 --> 00:02:25.081
It hurts...

00:02:25.242 --> 00:02:28.960
so mu... u... u...
