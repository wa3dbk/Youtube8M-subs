00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.510 
looking for partial positions today I'm
gonna<00:00:24.740> look<00:00:24.890> at<00:00:25.010> something<00:00:25.160> a<00:00:25.250> little<00:00:25.400> more

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
complicated it is a position surge and

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.440 
complicated it is a position surge and
it<00:00:28.100> is<00:00:28.220> something<00:00:28.340> I<00:00:28.580> mentioned<00:00:29.000> in<00:00:29.090> my<00:00:29.120> last

your own game so this is where chest

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.870 
your own game so this is where chest
base<00:00:57.440> is<00:00:57.710> incredibly<00:00:58.220> helpful<00:00:58.489> it's<00:00:58.790> a

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
base is incredibly helpful it's a

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
going to look for right now is isolated

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.899 
going to look for right now is isolated
deep<00:01:08.780> on<00:01:09.080> positions<00:01:09.740> how<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.010> find<00:01:10.430> those<00:01:10.700> in

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
deep on positions how to find those in

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.330 
deep on positions how to find those in
chess<00:01:11.390> base<00:01:11.630> 11<00:01:11.930> by<00:01:12.229> doing<00:01:12.650> a<00:01:12.799> partial

chess base 11 by doing a partial
position<00:01:13.820> search<00:01:14.030> so<00:01:14.690> what<00:01:14.810> we'll<00:01:14.930> do<00:01:15.020> is

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
position search so what we'll do is

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.780 
position search so what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:15.350> right<00:01:15.590> click<00:01:15.620> on<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.340> database<00:01:16.760> that

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
we'll right click on the database that

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.190 
we'll right click on the database that
we<00:01:17.180> want<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:17.750> search<00:01:17.960> will<00:01:18.500> select<00:01:18.920> search<00:01:20.200> go

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
we want to search will select search go

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.109 
we want to search will select search go

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
to the position tab all of which we did

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.149 
to the position tab all of which we did
in<00:01:23.210> our<00:01:23.270> previous<00:01:23.540> video<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.290> we'll<00:01:24.799> put<00:01:24.979> a

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
in our previous video and we'll put a

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.480 
in our previous video and we'll put a
pawn<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:25.970> white<00:01:26.270> pawn<00:01:26.510> on<00:01:26.750> d4<00:01:27.470> but<00:01:28.220> how<00:01:28.369> do<00:01:28.430> we

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
pawn a white pawn on d4 but how do we

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.210 
pawn a white pawn on d4 but how do we
isolate<00:01:29.270> it<00:01:29.479> if<00:01:30.080> we<00:01:30.290> do<00:01:30.440> a<00:01:30.470> search<00:01:30.710> right<00:01:30.950> now

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
isolate it if we do a search right now

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.800 
isolate it if we do a search right now
it'll<00:01:31.460> just<00:01:31.640> be<00:01:31.729> games<00:01:31.970> in<00:01:32.180> which<00:01:32.270> white<00:01:32.570> pawn

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
it'll just be games in which white pawn

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.050 
it'll just be games in which white pawn
is<00:01:32.960> on<00:01:33.110> d4<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:33.619> there<00:01:33.830> may<00:01:34.040> be<00:01:34.070> white<00:01:34.490> pawns<00:01:34.760> on

either side of it or on the same file so
how<00:01:37.460> do<00:01:37.520> we<00:01:37.610> isolate<00:01:38.299> this<00:01:38.510> pawn<00:01:38.810> well<00:01:39.409> I'll

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
how do we isolate this pawn well I'll

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.960 
how do we isolate this pawn well I'll
show<00:01:39.680> you<00:01:39.740> how<00:01:39.920> we<00:01:39.979> do<00:01:40.189> it<00:01:40.310> over<00:01:40.610> here<00:01:40.790> there

in<00:03:36.269> this<00:03:36.419> position<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.409> does<00:03:37.530> remind<00:03:37.859> us

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
in this position but it does remind us

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.969 
in this position but it does remind us
that<00:03:38.129> one<00:03:38.879> of<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.120> tenants<00:03:39.569> of<00:03:39.889> for<00:03:40.889> the

clicking on games notice we get a king
there<00:05:28.080> we<00:05:28.349> could<00:05:28.530> have<00:05:28.620> excluded<00:05:28.949> Kings<00:05:29.370> by

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
there we could have excluded Kings by

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.310 
there we could have excluded Kings by
the<00:05:29.729> way<00:05:29.910> if<00:05:30.030> we'd<00:05:30.150> wanted<00:05:30.300> to<00:05:30.599> but<00:05:31.110> we<00:05:31.199> can

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
the way if we'd wanted to but we can

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.629 
the way if we'd wanted to but we can
click<00:05:31.470> on<00:05:31.500> these<00:05:31.740> any<00:05:32.550> of<00:05:33.120> these<00:05:33.210> games<00:05:34.070> and<00:05:35.070> we

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
click on these any of these games and we

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.000 
click on these any of these games and we
noticed<00:05:36.060> that<00:05:36.150> there<00:05:36.270> is<00:05:36.570> a<00:05:36.720> pawn<00:05:36.990> or<00:05:37.320> a<00:05:37.380> sorry

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
noticed that there is a pawn or a sorry

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.339 
noticed that there is a pawn or a sorry
piece<00:05:38.280> directly<00:05:38.789> in<00:05:38.970> front<00:05:39.000> of<00:05:39.419> the<00:05:39.539> white<00:05:39.750> d4

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
piece directly in front of the white d4

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:47.360 
piece directly in front of the white d4
pawn<00:05:44.000> so<00:05:45.000> the<00:05:45.090> point<00:05:45.270> is<00:05:45.690> very<00:05:46.680> simply<00:05:47.099> to<00:05:47.220> show

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
pawn so the point is very simply to show

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.439 
pawn so the point is very simply to show
you<00:05:48.470> how<00:05:49.470> to<00:05:49.530> use<00:05:49.830> the<00:05:50.070> exclude<00:05:51.710> board

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
you how to use the exclude board

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.670 
you how to use the exclude board
anything<00:05:54.449> you<00:05:54.690> put<00:05:54.810> on<00:05:54.870> the<00:05:55.050> excluded<00:05:55.409> board

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
anything you put on the excluded board

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.159 
anything you put on the excluded board
cannot<00:05:56.370> be<00:05:56.669> in<00:05:56.909> the<00:05:57.330> position<00:05:57.630> that<00:05:57.810> just

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
cannot be in the position that just

00:05:58.169 --> 00:05:59.600 
cannot be in the position that just
based<00:05:58.380> pulls<00:05:58.650> up<00:05:58.889> so<00:05:59.039> it's<00:05:59.159> a<00:05:59.220> great<00:05:59.310> way<00:05:59.550> to

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
based pulls up so it's a great way to

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.450 
based pulls up so it's a great way to
augment<00:06:00.240> to<00:06:00.360> look<00:06:00.599> for<00:06:01.020> board<00:06:01.380> we<00:06:02.280> need<00:06:02.430> a

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
augment to look for board we need a

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.719 
augment to look for board we need a
white<00:06:02.970> pawn<00:06:03.240> on<00:06:03.389> d4<00:06:03.840> any<00:06:04.169> black<00:06:04.740> piece<00:06:05.009> on<00:06:05.250> d5

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
white pawn on d4 any black piece on d5

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.930 
white pawn on d4 any black piece on d5
which<00:06:06.630> is<00:06:06.780> what<00:06:06.930> we<00:06:07.080> get<00:06:07.380> if<00:06:07.650> we<00:06:07.680> click<00:06:08.099> now<00:06:08.370> but

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
which is what we get if we click now but

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.610 
which is what we get if we click now but
