their race machines and there's they're

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.580 
their race machines and there's they're
basically<00:00:12.120> toned<00:00:12.809> down<00:00:12.900> for<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.170> street<00:00:13.380> and

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
basically toned down for the street and

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.770 
basically toned down for the street and
there's<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.429> some<00:00:14.730> differences<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.269> motor<00:00:15.480> and

seating<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.529> it's<00:00:17.160> important<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.640> make<00:00:17.789> a

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
seating and it's important to make a

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.120 
seating and it's important to make a
decision<00:00:18.480> about<00:00:18.779> what<00:00:19.080> you're<00:00:19.619> looking<00:00:19.949> for

is a really fun piece of machinery but

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.340 
is a really fun piece of machinery but
each<00:00:30.210> one<00:00:30.480> will<00:00:30.660> be<00:00:30.810> feel<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> little<00:00:31.800> different

of the seat is a lot of different
different<00:00:44.700> feel<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.149> all<00:00:45.270> feel<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.780> it's

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
different feel it's all feel and it's

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.389 
different feel it's all feel and it's
been<00:00:46.050> critically<00:00:46.530> important<00:00:46.920> because<00:00:47.070> you

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
been critically important because you

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.740 
been critically important because you
control<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.910> bike<00:00:48.059> with<00:00:48.239> your<00:00:48.390> body<00:00:48.539> position

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
control the bike with your body position

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.869 
control the bike with your body position
you<00:00:49.590> need<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.920> be<00:00:50.010> able<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.309> hold<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
you need to be able to hold on to the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.090 
you need to be able to hold on to the
tank<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.530> your<00:00:52.680> feet<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:52.980> right

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
tank and have your feet in the right

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.680 
tank and have your feet in the right

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
place so that you can ride the bike

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.529 
place so that you can ride the bike
effectively<00:00:55.789> so<00:00:56.789> when<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.059> choose<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> bike

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
effectively so when you choose a bike

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.090 
effectively so when you choose a bike
the<00:00:58.050> best<00:00:58.260> thing<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.440> do<00:00:58.590> really<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.949> go

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the best thing to do really is to go

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.470 
the best thing to do really is to go
down<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.399> dealerships<00:00:59.820> and<00:00:59.940> sit<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.210> all

down to the dealerships and sit on all

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.060 
down to the dealerships and sit on all
of<00:01:00.629> them<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:01.109> what<00:01:01.320> feels<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> best<00:01:01.859> what

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
of them see what feels the best what

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.349 
of them see what feels the best what
makes<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.309> feel<00:01:02.489> like<00:01:02.520> you're<00:01:02.789> comfortable

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359
