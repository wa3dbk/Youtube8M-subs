well another really excellent contest I
said<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.900> last<00:03:50.080> part<00:03:50.440> would<00:03:50.650> be<00:03:50.770> a<00:03:50.800> hard<00:03:51.100> act

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
said the last part would be a hard act

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.460 
said the last part would be a hard act
to<00:03:51.370> follow<00:03:51.459> these<00:03:52.240> boys<00:03:52.540> have<00:03:52.750> done<00:03:52.900> a<00:03:52.959> winner

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
to follow these boys have done a winner

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.900 
to follow these boys have done a winner
of<00:03:53.770> that<00:03:54.130> contest

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
of that contest

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.960 
of that contest
by<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.390> unanimous<00:03:55.480> decision<00:03:56.670> Simpson<00:03:57.670> in<00:03:57.850> the

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
by a unanimous decision Simpson in the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.229 
by a unanimous decision Simpson in the
red<00:03:58.150> zone<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.830> judges<00:03:59.830> make<00:04:00.069> it<00:04:00.280> unanimous

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
red zone the judges make it unanimous

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.120 
red zone the judges make it unanimous
I<00:04:01.270> thought<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:02.050> might<00:04:02.230> have<00:04:02.319> been<00:04:02.440> closer<00:04:02.800> than

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
I thought it might have been closer than

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.220 
I thought it might have been closer than
that<00:04:03.340> but<00:04:03.700> nevertheless<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.720> means<00:04:04.959> that

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
that but nevertheless it means that

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.770 
that but nevertheless it means that
