00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.290

bad<00:00:35.880> as<00:00:36.270> they<00:00:36.809> added<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:38.040> thingy<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.210> you

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
bad as they added the thingy so you

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.750 
bad as they added the thingy so you
can't<00:00:39.570> do<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.079> anymore<00:00:40.440> but<00:00:41.309> then<00:00:41.430> again<00:00:41.550> you

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
can't do this anymore but then again you

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.600 
can't do this anymore but then again you
can<00:00:42.210> climb<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.140> now<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.980> stand<00:00:44.370> on

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610

can climb like this now like stand on
the<00:00:44.820> ladder<00:00:45.140> so<00:00:46.140> that's<00:00:46.350> good<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.860> guess<00:00:47.510> kind

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
the ladder so that's good I guess kind

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.910 
the ladder so that's good I guess kind
of<00:00:49.340> but<00:00:50.340> again<00:00:50.550> they<00:00:50.700> didn't<00:00:51.120> add<00:00:51.500> vines<00:00:52.500> or

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
of but again they didn't add vines or

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.540 
of but again they didn't add vines or
flammable<00:00:53.760> now<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.510> they<00:00:55.039> they<00:00:56.039> act<00:00:56.190> exactly

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
flammable now and they they act exactly

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.060 
flammable now and they they act exactly
like<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.270> latter<00:00:57.480> stood<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.109> one<00:00:58.170> point<00:00:58.859> one

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
like the latter stood in one point one

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.049 
like the latter stood in one point one
so<00:00:59.730> that's<00:01:00.629> always<00:01:00.809> good<00:01:01.170> it'll<00:01:01.620> give<00:01:02.129> match<00:01:02.789> a

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
so that's always good it'll give match a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.190 
so that's always good it'll give match a
bit<00:01:03.239> more<00:01:03.390> diversity<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.720> they<00:01:06.720> of
