00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.710
 hello to all of you 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.390
 miss little angel 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.570
 today I propose a new 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.789
 so tutoring on a ps3 controller for 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.490
 change a broken or damaged joystick 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.830
 again the occurrence mine broken here is 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.949
 so it's very simple and joystick 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.840
 they are either black are sold black blue 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.460
 pink by the colors you want 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.760
 so it can be sold individually or 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.690
 by two so that's me it will be two 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.730
 so me it's origins sony I 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.210
 taken back on another planet 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.200
 so to start 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.390
 at the back of the controller there are the five 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.860
 holes so inside there are 5 10 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.879
 so we need a screwdriver 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.670
 cruciform pure delight and levis I know 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:04.879
 not if you go to see it's not very 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.879
 big so his supporters of the words 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:17.000
 So then you press the middle here 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.620
 on the back shell on because in 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.920
 done there is a clip here is the aisle 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.080
 enclosures 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.290
 so what to watch out for is 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.170
 especially not boxes and both 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.030
 triggers r2 d2 after cisse and boly 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.060
 dislocated separates well it's easy 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.899
 ahmatjan to the problem so you take off 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.899
 career clau 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.970
 like this 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.180
 Here you put aside that 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.490
 be careful about losing lists so 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.260
 after inside we find the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:55.090
 battery so it's simple to remove 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.400
 crises and here you are disconnecting 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.020
 like this you put aside and 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.060
 then on the green plate a stand 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.500
 here is a cruciform screw 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.200
 it's not the same as the hulls 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:11.500
 back so you davis and this fact 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.930
 watch out for the beast you remove the 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.530
 green circuit board without forcing its 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.069
 sister 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.810
 so he's gone out and to remove 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.319
 the touristy it's simple you have 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.569
 just to shoot 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:29.969
 that's the way it is so if you do not pick up 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.249
 your votes two sticks depending on if you have 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:34.530
 broke the other two and you rewrap 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:36.900
 on it so there is no sense because it 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.739
 is holed at the ball so you can not 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.319
 you deceive you nestle them kill him 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.849
 this is a pressure and that observed 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.150
 then back up this time 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.129
 so watch out for printed circuit boards 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.430
 transparent so that's what gives the 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.260
 current or LEDs that fit together is a 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.930
 rubber underneath i good black 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.210
 blow of hangover is here that 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.110
 fits in both 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.500
 on the side so makes it 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.090
 makes good 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.010
 you put your circuit back after 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.640
 winter by two films this attention 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.770
 a paquin panel and 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.890
 but an island denis the circuit where the 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.990
 plastic so you just fit them 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.870
 pressing this is not necessary to force 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.459
 it comes back alone then go you 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.610
 put your life back once it's 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:29.209
 everything in place here you will tighten 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:32.840
 moderately no need to squeeze a fund 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.550
 to break the care of life under the 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.110
 circuit board or even the plastic to 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.820
 the hand 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:42.260
 So here it is back up 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:45.440
 nickel you take your battery here 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.720
 so the battery so you hook up bah 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.540
 I 'm not driving I 'm not knowing anymore 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.700
 do you plug the encrypted art into 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.880
 nerve circuit board holes 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.400
 this is like this so there the outfits if 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.660
 I put the controller like that well of your 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:05.390
 So here we go then rethread the 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.390
 hull from behind we will start with 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.670
 put the triggers in the clouds in 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.200
 troops by attention to go 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.540
 gently to avoid removing for 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.920
 back to lose the known time 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.920
 so you put them on 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:26.190
 like this here is the ceni after here 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.800
 you have to pull a little on the plastic 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.520
 to go over the battery 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.480
 here I spent my ways 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.480
 and that's it 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.229
 here 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:47.060
 but it's beautiful no here is the joystick 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:49.050
 earth in a box that here works 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.590
 you see that the 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.110
 joysticks 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.470
 he is rather successful star select all 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:00.420
 it works so it's easy 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.420
 to screw novices and then go 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.480
 the joystick is back from joystiq 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.950
 exchanged here is so it's impeccable 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.650
 on this I wish you a good 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.170
 day a good evening it depends when 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.300
 you're going to watch my video 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.640
 if you have any advice to give me or 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.480
 comments to make me do not hesitate 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.820
 there is no problem 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.650
 a little green thumb is the reward 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.550
 it always makes me happy it helps me 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.190
 move forward in my videos 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.320
 if you put a little thumb I do not like 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.360
 not only why does it also put 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.680
 do not worry it leads on this I 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.300
 wish you a good day and I 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.300
 tell you to my next chaired bye bye
