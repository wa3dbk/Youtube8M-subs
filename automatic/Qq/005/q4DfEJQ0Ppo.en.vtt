more natural do something just slightly

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:07.740 
more natural do something just slightly
lighter<00:02:06.340> than<00:02:06.429> your<00:02:06.700> skin<00:02:06.729> tone<00:02:07.149> but<00:02:07.390> still

you happen to be using it and I'm going

to put that on my lower lash line but to

guess you could call it I'm going to go

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.539 
guess you could call it I'm going to go
slightly<00:03:28.120> under<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.019> lash<00:03:29.470> line<00:03:29.769> and<00:03:30.040> kind<00:03:30.400> of

slightly under the lash line and kind of

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.000 
slightly under the lash line and kind of
leave<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.760> gap<00:03:31.269> which<00:03:32.049> may<00:03:32.319> seem<00:03:32.380> we're<00:03:32.769> in<00:03:32.889> the

leave a gap which may seem we're in the
larger<00:03:33.700> gap<00:03:33.910> that<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.299> leave<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.780> more<00:03:34.989> kind

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
larger gap that you leave the more kind

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.199 
larger gap that you leave the more kind
of<00:03:35.319> artificial<00:03:35.859> it'll<00:03:36.190> look<00:03:36.340> right<00:03:36.700> I'm<00:03:36.880> just

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
of artificial it'll look right I'm just

flesh tone one I don't know - flesh tone
one<00:04:07.300> it<00:04:07.750> will<00:04:07.960> create<00:04:08.110> a<00:04:08.230> more<00:04:08.320> natural

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
illusion white is definitely more harsh

illusion white is definitely more harsh
as<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.860> knife<00:04:12.040> said<00:04:12.280> that<00:04:12.430> before<00:04:12.730> whole

throughout<00:04:13.270> this<00:04:13.390> tutorial<00:04:13.870> but<00:04:14.350> I'm<00:04:14.470> just

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
throughout this tutorial but I'm just

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.400 
throughout this tutorial but I'm just
going<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:14.920> put<00:04:15.190> that<00:04:15.430> on<00:04:15.670> my<00:04:15.730> lower<00:04:16.390> lash<00:04:17.080> line

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
going to put that on my lower lash line

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.570 
going to put that on my lower lash line
and<00:04:19.470> that<00:04:20.470> probably<00:04:20.770> does<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.340> most

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
and that probably does the most

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.210 
and that probably does the most
noticeable<00:04:22.450> effect<00:04:23.140> which<00:04:23.560> will<00:04:23.890> look<00:04:24.040> more

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220

starting<00:06:00.040> from<00:06:00.220> the<00:06:00.370> base<00:06:00.580> to<00:06:00.820> the<00:06:00.910> end<00:06:01.150> start

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
starting from the base to the end start

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:07.170 
starting from the base to the end start
in<00:06:01.690> the<00:06:01.780> middle<00:06:02.080> to<00:06:02.230> the<00:06:02.260> end<00:06:05.910> and<00:06:06.910> this<00:06:07.120> is

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
in the middle to the end and this is

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.090 
in the middle to the end and this is
what<00:06:07.480> the<00:06:07.600> finished<00:06:07.960> eye<00:06:08.230> looks<00:06:08.500> like<00:06:08.710> I<00:06:08.920> left

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
what the finished eye looks like I left

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.380 
what the finished eye looks like I left
the<00:06:09.220> other<00:06:09.310> one<00:06:09.400> completely<00:06:09.970> blank

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.390 
the other one completely blank

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.970 
the other one completely blank
so<00:06:10.480> you<00:06:10.540> could<00:06:10.720> see<00:06:10.930> more<00:06:11.200> of<00:06:11.500> a<00:06:11.650> difference

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:11.980 
so you could see more of a difference

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.320 
so you could see more of a difference
instead<00:06:12.280> of<00:06:12.400> going<00:06:12.610> to<00:06:12.700> the<00:06:12.790> end<00:06:12.940> of<00:06:13.030> the<00:06:13.090> video

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
instead of going to the end of the video

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.660 
instead of going to the end of the video
and<00:06:13.720> the<00:06:14.560> beginning<00:06:15.130> of<00:06:15.220> the<00:06:15.340> video<00:06:15.580> to

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
and the beginning of the video to

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.270 
and the beginning of the video to
compare<00:06:16.150> I<00:06:16.560> probably<00:06:17.560> look<00:06:17.800> a<00:06:17.890> little<00:06:18.070> bit

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
compare I probably look a little bit

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.630 
compare I probably look a little bit
silly<00:06:18.520> it's<00:06:18.910> not<00:06:19.120> a<00:06:19.150> huge<00:06:19.900> difference<00:06:20.770> but<00:06:21.490> if

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
silly it's not a huge difference but if

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.580 
silly it's not a huge difference but if
you<00:06:21.760> accentuate<00:06:22.330> certain<00:06:22.690> things<00:06:23.050> I<00:06:23.260> did<00:06:23.500> in

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
you accentuate certain things I did in

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.630 
you accentuate certain things I did in

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 
the video you can get more and more

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.550 
the video you can get more and more
artificial<00:06:25.210> looks<00:06:25.630> depending<00:06:26.020> on<00:06:26.110> how<00:06:26.350> do<00:06:26.410> you
