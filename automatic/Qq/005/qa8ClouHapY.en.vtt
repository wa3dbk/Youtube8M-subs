leftover liquid which also has a lot of

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.629 
leftover liquid which also has a lot of
seed<00:01:34.969> residue<00:01:35.539> it<00:01:36.200> is<00:01:36.319> going<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.619> drain<00:01:37.310> back

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:37.639 
seed residue it is going to drain back

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.539 
seed residue it is going to drain back
so<00:01:38.210> this<00:01:38.359> is<00:01:38.600> ray<00:01:38.810> of<00:01:39.109> Sun<00:01:39.859> we're<00:01:40.039> gonna<00:01:40.310> mix

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
so this is ray of Sun we're gonna mix

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.469 
so this is ray of Sun we're gonna mix
this<00:01:40.840> ensure<00:01:41.840> that<00:01:42.280> all<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.609> pulp<00:01:43.819> is<00:01:43.999> inside

keep this ready if you have any other

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.110 
keep this ready if you have any other
mold<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:41.049> could<00:02:41.230> also<00:02:41.380> set<00:02:41.769> it<00:02:41.920> in<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.700> mold

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
mold you could also set it in that mold

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.539 
mold you could also set it in that mold
I<00:02:43.209> have<00:02:43.600> already<00:02:43.870> greased<00:02:44.140> it<00:02:44.400> keep<00:02:45.400> this

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
I have already greased it keep this

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:53.880 
I have already greased it keep this
aside<00:02:46.410> I'm<00:02:47.410> going<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.739> first<00:02:48.040> add<00:02:48.310> sugar<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:52.890> a

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
aside I'm going to first add sugar and a

aside I'm going to first add sugar and a
few<00:02:54.819> drops<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.360> water<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.940> will<00:03:01.870> allow<00:03:02.110> this

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
few drops of water and will allow this

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:11.000 
few drops of water and will allow this
to<00:03:02.470> melt<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:02.920> form<00:03:03.519> a<00:03:03.700> sugar<00:03:04.330> serum

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.670 

now<00:03:11.640> this<00:03:11.849> is<00:03:11.970> bubbling<00:03:12.560> sugar<00:03:13.560> has<00:03:13.740> melted

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
now this is bubbling sugar has melted

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:25.589 
now this is bubbling sugar has melted
and<00:03:17.360> let's<00:03:18.360> add<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.780> pulp

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.140

and now guys for some muscle power you

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.030 
and now guys for some muscle power you
don't<00:03:28.269> have<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.629> do<00:03:28.749> anything<00:03:29.260> now<00:03:29.469> leave

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
thickened into an ice jam consistency

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.259 
thickened into an ice jam consistency
and<00:04:03.010> what<00:04:03.280> I've<00:04:03.400> done<00:04:03.549> is<00:04:03.760> made<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.030> batch

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
and what I've done is made a batch

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.289 
and what I've done is made a batch
earlier<00:04:04.719> stored<00:04:05.260> it<00:04:05.409> and<00:04:05.819> this<00:04:06.819> is<00:04:07.000> how<00:04:07.150> it

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
earlier stored it and this is how it

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.729 
earlier stored it and this is how it
looks<00:04:08.579> looks<00:04:09.579> so<00:04:09.819> nice<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:10.299> simple<00:04:10.719> no<00:04:11.379> extra

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.860 
breads
toast<00:04:22.630> whatever<00:04:23.490> but<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:25.240> idea<00:04:25.509> is<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.750> make

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
toast whatever but the idea is to make

barrage<00:04:26.229> so<00:04:26.830> let's<00:04:27.669> get<00:04:27.820> back<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.210> story<00:04:31.259> okay

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
barrage so let's get back to story okay

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.730 
barrage so let's get back to story okay
now<00:04:32.909> this<00:04:33.909> is<00:04:33.970> in<00:04:34.389> the<00:04:34.479> jam<00:04:34.690> consistency<00:04:35.560> but

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
now this is in the jam consistency but

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.089 
now this is in the jam consistency but
obviously<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:37.360> need<00:04:37.659> to<00:04:37.810> check<00:04:38.169> at<00:04:38.830> what

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
obviously you need to check at what

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:44.010 
obviously you need to check at what
stage<00:04:39.490> is<00:04:39.940> your<00:04:40.500> sugar<00:04:41.500> I<00:04:42.449> am<00:04:43.449> just<00:04:43.690> going<00:04:43.930> to

take a small drop and you know what this

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.710 
take a small drop and you know what this
is<00:04:49.150> setting<00:04:49.659> you<00:04:50.050> can<00:04:50.259> see<00:04:51.240> into<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.270> nice<00:04:54.720> soft

overnight and next day what we are going
to<00:05:27.190> do<00:05:27.310> is<00:05:27.460> we<00:05:27.670> are<00:05:27.760> going<00:05:27.910> to<00:05:27.970> cut<00:05:28.630> it<00:05:28.780> into<00:05:28.960> the

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
to do is we are going to cut it into the

to do is we are going to cut it into the
side<00:05:29.470> sheets<00:05:30.060> so<00:05:31.060> I've<00:05:31.150> already<00:05:31.510> made<00:05:31.720> a<00:05:31.750> batch

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
side sheets so I've already made a batch

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.310 
side sheets so I've already made a batch
earlier<00:05:32.620> and<00:05:33.570> usually<00:05:34.570> people<00:05:34.720> cut<00:05:35.020> it<00:05:35.170> into

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
earlier and usually people cut it into
