with him so far is a him standing up the

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.920 
with him so far is a him standing up the
I<00:03:16.709> kind<00:03:17.709> of<00:03:17.739> made<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:17.950> mistake<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.670> some<00:03:19.660> of<00:03:19.810> his

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
I kind of made a mistake and some of his

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.560 
I kind of made a mistake and some of his
joints<00:03:20.350> like<00:03:20.470> his<00:03:20.620> hips<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.220> his<00:03:21.310> ankles<00:03:21.820> were

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
joints like his hips and his ankles were

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.640 
joints like his hips and his ankles were
kind<00:03:22.989> of<00:03:23.080> loose<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:25.030> try<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.810> tighten<00:03:26.380> them

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
kind of loose and I try to tighten them

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.580 
kind of loose and I try to tighten them
up<00:03:26.830> with<00:03:27.130> some<00:03:27.400> glue<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:28.260> i<00:03:29.260> think<00:03:29.500> i

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
up with some glue and i think i

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.949 
up with some glue and i think i
accidentally<00:03:30.220> applied<00:03:30.580> too<00:03:30.940> much<00:03:31.239> glue<00:03:31.660> and

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
accidentally applied too much glue and

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.740 
accidentally applied too much glue and
made<00:03:32.230> them<00:03:32.440> too<00:03:32.709> tight<00:03:33.010> so<00:03:33.360> I'm<00:03:34.360> going<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.600> have

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
made them too tight so I'm going to have

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.770 
made them too tight so I'm going to have
to<00:03:35.220> work<00:03:36.220> that<00:03:36.550> out<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.790> little<00:03:37.120> bit<00:03:37.330> and<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:37.660> have

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
to work that out a little bit and I have

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.620 
to work that out a little bit and I have
just<00:03:37.989> going<00:03:38.290> in<00:03:38.410> sand<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:38.980> supports<00:03:39.459> and<00:03:39.670> then

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
just going in sand and supports and then

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.229 
just going in sand and supports and then
some<00:03:40.840> parts<00:03:41.140> keep<00:03:41.980> breaking<00:03:42.519> off<00:03:42.700> like<00:03:43.030> this

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
some parts keep breaking off like this

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.240 
some parts keep breaking off like this
front<00:03:43.840> skirt<00:03:44.080> that<00:03:44.320> just<00:03:44.800> broke<00:03:45.100> off<00:03:45.280> here<00:03:46.230> I'm

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
front skirt that just broke off here I'm

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.000 
front skirt that just broke off here I'm
thinking<00:03:48.250> if<00:03:48.820> if<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.630> can't<00:03:49.900> fix<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.380> joints<00:03:50.830> I

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
thinking if if I can't fix the joints I

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.750 
thinking if if I can't fix the joints I
might<00:03:51.670> just<00:03:51.910> have<00:03:52.090> to<00:03:52.209> make<00:03:52.360> this<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:53.760> fixed

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
might just have to make this a fixed

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.650 
might just have to make this a fixed
pose<00:03:55.000> resin<00:03:55.720> kit<00:03:55.930> as<00:03:56.140> in<00:03:56.500> it<00:03:57.310> won't<00:03:58.180> move<00:03:58.420> I

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
pose resin kit as in it won't move I

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.820 
pose resin kit as in it won't move I
mean<00:03:58.810> it'll<00:03:58.959> still<00:03:59.200> have<00:03:59.320> some<00:03:59.530> articulation

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
mean it'll still have some articulation

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.640 
mean it'll still have some articulation
like<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.400> arms<00:04:00.850> are<00:04:01.000> fine<00:04:01.300> I<00:04:01.660> haven't<00:04:02.380> had<00:04:02.470> any

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
like the arms are fine I haven't had any

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.039 
like the arms are fine I haven't had any
problems<00:04:03.040> with<00:04:03.070> the<00:04:03.250> arms<00:04:03.519> at<00:04:03.670> all<00:04:03.790> there<00:04:04.180> they

problems with the arms at all there they

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:05.910 
problems with the arms at all there they
move

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
move

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:13.800 
move

split down the middle of the binder that

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.620 
split down the middle of the binder that
uh<00:04:38.350> neo<00:04:39.070> grade<00:04:39.430> apparently<00:04:40.030> thought<00:04:40.240> looked

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
uh neo grade apparently thought looked

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.129

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
shatri as close to the original line art

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.230 
shatri as close to the original line art
as<00:04:47.350> possible<00:04:48.030> so<00:04:49.030> I'm<00:04:50.130> taking<00:04:51.130> out<00:04:51.550> that<00:04:51.580> split

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
that big split with putty so that's

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.219 
that big split with putty so that's
what's<00:05:00.639> taking<00:05:01.060> so<00:05:01.090> long<00:05:01.300> with<00:05:01.630> these<00:05:01.810> binders

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
what's taking so long with these binders

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.770 
what's taking so long with these binders
and<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:02.560> kind<00:05:03.370> of<00:05:03.430> just<00:05:03.610> got<00:05:03.790> frustrated<00:05:04.690> and

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
shouldn't take too much longer than that

death<00:05:48.280> scythe<00:05:48.550> hell<00:05:48.930> mod<00:05:49.930> that<00:05:50.289> I<00:05:50.350> was<00:05:50.560> doing

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
death scythe hell mod that I was doing

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.690 
death scythe hell mod that I was doing
with<00:05:51.010> the<00:05:51.090> master<00:05:52.090> grade<00:05:52.450> in<00:05:52.690> her<00:05:52.780> frame<00:05:53.700> yeah

with the master grade in her frame yeah

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.540 
with the master grade in her frame yeah
I<00:05:54.729> haven't<00:05:55.150> messed<00:05:55.450> with<00:05:55.690> it<00:05:55.870> and<00:05:56.860> even<00:05:57.280> longer

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
I haven't messed with it and even longer

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.420 
I haven't messed with it and even longer
than<00:05:57.760> kushat<00:05:58.390> riga<00:05:58.979> don't<00:05:59.979> even<00:06:00.160> think<00:06:00.250> I've

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
than kushat riga don't even think I've

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.550 
than kushat riga don't even think I've
taken<00:06:00.669> it<00:06:00.850> out<00:06:00.910> of<00:06:00.970> the<00:06:01.120> box<00:06:01.300> since<00:06:01.660> new<00:06:02.200> years

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
taken it out of the box since new years

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.350 
taken it out of the box since new years
so<00:06:04.020> yeah<00:06:05.020> it's<00:06:05.350> it's<00:06:06.310> even<00:06:06.940> further<00:06:07.120> behind

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
so yeah it's it's even further behind

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.890 
so yeah it's it's even further behind
than<00:06:07.780> this<00:06:08.169> guy

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
than this guy

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.300 
than this guy
so<00:06:10.900> I<00:06:11.289> guess<00:06:11.889> that's<00:06:12.099> about<00:06:12.310> it<00:06:14.069> i'm<00:06:15.069> going<00:06:15.220> to

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
so I guess that's about it i'm going to

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.210 
so I guess that's about it i'm going to
be<00:06:15.400> reviewing<00:06:16.229> master<00:06:17.229> grade<00:06:17.440> exia<00:06:17.919> next<00:06:18.759> and

a two-part review for master grade
kampfer<00:06:39.759> and<00:06:41.069> i<00:06:43.289> guess<00:06:44.289> that's<00:06:44.530> about<00:06:44.680> it<00:06:44.830> for

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:45.009 
kampfer and i guess that's about it for

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.730 
kampfer and i guess that's about it for
now<00:06:45.190> I<00:06:45.310> can't<00:06:45.669> think<00:06:45.789> of<00:06:45.940> anything<00:06:46.180> else<00:06:46.740> so

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
now I can't think of anything else so

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.730 
now I can't think of anything else so
