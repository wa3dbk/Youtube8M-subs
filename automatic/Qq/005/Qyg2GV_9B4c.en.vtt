00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.260
 day the ladies yes I wanted you one 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.030
 video to the fans at the women varnishes 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.160
 make two because I have two 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.810
 bought and after I showed this 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.930
 had I have many wondered what I 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.279
 because now from the holder and directly 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.450
 After that I could not say yes because 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.430
 they then have not really tested 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.550
 but now i have tested it 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.840
 and thought I'll take my time 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.340
 a little something that counts itself 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.600
 actually i have no time but 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.430
 it is always so when something completely 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.050
 important to do then pushes you 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.540
 so long before and over 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.040
 other things so very bad but me 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.980
 first make the video and then 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.960
 Let's get the bad stuff and that 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.590
 sense polish I have the two 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.020
 This is a live show that I saw live 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.810
 I now on it and then 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.120
 strictly this is the one here 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.980
 and yes, I already had both on it 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.369
 I first painted her 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.460
 after I bought that and yes 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.960
 then I have it first thin layer 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.490
 applied then did not have that 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.890
 completely covered because I thought okay 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.360
 a second on it and then it has 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.610
 covered but it is almost not anymore 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.080
 dried so of course I am too 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.880
 a bit confused as far as that goes 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.360
 because I always have the essens top coat 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.900
 draufmachen and dry normal varnish 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.460
 so totally fast and I do that 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.690
 only with it and that's why mine 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.840
 nails also within five minutes 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.760
 pretty dry and that's just it 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.320
 in the paint that one because he no top 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.460
 should make over coat was then that 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.110
 effect away you hear that maybe 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.180
 That's a rough surface after and 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.250
 if I make your stop about it then 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.690
 it looks different now so now 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.130
 and yes then 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.500
 it has all this effect gone 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.820
 should be so moderate and yes then 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.100
 but I have in spite of the top coat 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.880
 brought over to dry faster 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.259
 and then against that too 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.039
 then 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.720
 I can not really care for you right now 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.940
 exactly say I think I have it 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.590
 then down four or five days 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.790
 because I just have something else on it 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.300
 Wanted with top coat got it now 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.860
 Did not like it so much because that will be 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.209
 it will not be smooth so you have to 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.190
 her the top coat really very much 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.190
 layers before it really works 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.840
 now and with it this one layer top 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.980
 second coaches dried all over 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.860
 fast but it does not feel so good to me 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.090
 So like I do not I 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.180
 got the yes now then again it 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.380
 but then without top coat and then 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.880
 I have a slightly thicker one directly 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.510
 Therefore, Schicht took that away from 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.980
 discovered at the beginning and must say it has 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.510
 Although it really took longer 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.440
 it is dried but it is fortunate 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.200
 then someday correctly 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.700
 dried there are also paints there 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.950
 is it then still a few hours 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.569
 or even after one day and then 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.700
 if you push in that way then that is 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.170
 brand then to see anyway though 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.500
 has been drying for so long but 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.700
 in which the is so after about 15 to 20 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.540
 minutes he is really too 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.920
 dried and then it is good too 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.010
 you just have to know that this is one 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.230
 takes a bit longer with the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.290
 durability I was quite surprised 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.970
 So now has the top coat like 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.720
 said not exactly five days or so 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.700
 held 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.010
 and there were not really any 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.650
 Traces of what I do not want it from 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.190
 would have burst or tip who I had 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.810
 not with that either and I have it 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.790
 after seeing the red with the top coat 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.389
 have worn that you applied that 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.239
 the color is strict and that has become 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.400
 made on wednesday and no 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.200
 top coach made about it and that is 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.480
 surprisingly a bit faster 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.060
 dried so I had to somehow 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.799
 Do not wait so long do not know 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.750
 but for sure i'm with you 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.660
 so much in terms of that 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.630
 more satisfied 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.310
 which is then painted on Wednesdays and 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.829
 friday I had such a little tip 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.019
 but was not much 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:12.389
 So I actually expected because 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:18.570
 that's why glitter that's it then 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:19.769
 Derive faster and wears off faster 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.789
 it just seems obvious to them 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.800
 longer 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:28.060
 I had a thumb on a saturday 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.490
 that it has peeled off a bit 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.930
 that is splintered can therefore 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.570
 I come to the bathroom 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.330
 cleaned and everything else was done 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.580
 have that easy with the housework 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.900
 then not so good because 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.270
 otherwise it's always very good 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.610
 held 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.110
 and yes, but after Saturday it is 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.090
 keep getting worse and then 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.820
 I have this monday yesterday 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.380
 yesterday monday and here again 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.820
 made because I wanted to look now 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.320
 if that's natural with simple 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.639
 a little bit better and that went 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.650
 better so what do I say about it with the 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.630
 rough surface that's just such a 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.979
 Matter that one must like that I can 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.419
 Do not tell you if that's good either 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.280
 or bad because you have to go for it 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.820
 you decide that you like it 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.520
 or not 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:16.270
 I personally like it better without it 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.550
 top coat i find that with this room 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.460
 very interesting and very nice 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.680
 I like that what the color selection 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.270
 I think I am very beautiful 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.909
 have only two colors but the 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.289
 colors that are now also in the dm 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.030
 there are some that are good for me 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.590
 fallen and when i am between 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.720
 The two decide will be so on 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.250
 every case strip I like 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.240
 somehow again ten times better than 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:43.780
 here because he still has such relatively large 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.669
 pizza particles in it so silver and that 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.770
 looks very classy of them so me 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.900
 like the really very good at 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:53.409
 whereas we love this song of love 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.639
 I like it too, but I think so 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:58.060
 I find with whom I buy again 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:00.520
 So yes, I think he is quite 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.960
 nice but it is a must-have which 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.599
 no longer buy in any case 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.310
 this pink is going to be that very light pink 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:08.110
 then like very well to 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.270
 I wanted to buy myself last dm 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.659
 because I was there again and then 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.669
 since two girls have the buy too 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:17.289
 If there was only one left there 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.610
 once from the two themselves 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.720
 taken away and the other one was already 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.250
 sad that she will not be anymore 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.610
 and then I dance and live 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.240
 the great but yes so I'm going to 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.580
 still pick 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.870
 but as I said with these women that 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.020
 you have to decide for yourself if he wants that 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.030
 May you because I can not to tell you 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.960
 but matter of taste as I said 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:38.490
 I like it better without top coat and me 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.409
 would just keep watching that they are such 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.150
 Colors with you take so big 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:43.470
 We have cluster particles on in there 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.919
 personally just much better 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.300
 like it just like that 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:51.569
 it glitters already but it is just 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:55.169
 not so bitter the matter of taste 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:56.159
 ok so durability is actually quite 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:58.889
 in order 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:59.789
 tip who has you then after two 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:02.159
 three days 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:03.330
 but it still comes as I said 

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:04.590
 on your merkel 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.569
 why as I said I do not always have 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.849
 it also depends on your nails 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:10.319
 if nail polish never works well with you 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:12.000
 I do not know whether the hold up well 

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:12.870
 we keep nail polish with me 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.380
 always pretty long 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.699
 because my nails are really hard 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.699
 Dancing and yes no idea 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:22.770
 so if you have the way I have then 

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:25.050
 In any case, you three so four four days 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.400
 of it in any case and afterwards had 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.759
 Just look it can be at 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.199
 I now a housework was fine 

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:33.389
 I think I have been too long now 

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:35.789
 talked for these two lacquer or for 

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:37.080
 this black lacquer I hope that has 

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:39.690
 helped you a little bit 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:42.449
 the cost just under two euros I mean pro 

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.349
 piece and thus maybe now 

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:47.099
 also said everything 

00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:49.710
 11 millimeters are ok in it then hope 

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:51.330
 I helped that and you can 

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.830
 tell me yes if it is of the paints 

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.000
 Does that mean anything for now? 

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.120
 I can imagine you too 

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.949
 because that's very special but 

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.610
 Just let me know and 

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:01.610
 take care
