00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.149 

now<00:00:00.750> we're<00:00:00.930> going<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.079> work<00:00:01.199> backwards<00:00:01.260> and

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
now we're going to work backwards and

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.710 
now we're going to work backwards and
instead<00:00:02.460> of<00:00:02.520> using<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.970> cuboid<00:00:03.330> we're<00:00:03.540> going<00:00:03.659> to

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
instead of using a cuboid we're going to

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.630 
instead of using a cuboid we're going to
go<00:00:03.810> back<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.200> cube<00:00:04.500> we're<00:00:05.130> going<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.310> find

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
go back to a cube we're going to find

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.490 
go back to a cube we're going to find
the<00:00:05.850> unknown<00:00:06.210> dimension<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.899> cube<00:00:07.140> given

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
the unknown dimension of a cube given

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.080 
the unknown dimension of a cube given
the<00:00:07.589> volume<00:00:07.799> so<00:00:08.550> let's<00:00:08.730> remember<00:00:08.970> that

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
the volume so let's remember that

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.730 
the volume so let's remember that
formula<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.719> we've<00:00:09.840> talked<00:00:10.050> about<00:00:10.200> the

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
formula that we've talked about the

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.900 
formula that we've talked about the
volume<00:00:11.780> equals<00:00:12.780> length<00:00:13.170> times<00:00:13.380> width<00:00:14.160> times

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
volume equals length times width times

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.640 
volume equals length times width times
height<00:00:15.030> now<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:15.990> important<00:00:16.500> thing<00:00:16.619> to

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
height now the important thing to

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.890 
height now the important thing to
remember<00:00:16.800> for<00:00:17.070> cube<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.449> all<00:00:18.720> the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
remember for cube is that all the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.019 
remember for cube is that all the
dimensions<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.590> cube<00:00:19.830> are<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.160> same<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
dimensions of a cube are the same so the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.929 
dimensions of a cube are the same so the
length<00:00:21.539> equals<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.529> width<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.070> equals<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
length equals the width and equals the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.820 
length equals the width and equals the
height<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.779> because<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.230> three<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.529> these<00:00:25.619> are

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
height so because the three of these are

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.320 
height so because the three of these are
equal<00:00:26.130> I'm<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.640> call<00:00:26.820> all<00:00:27.060> three

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
equal I'm just going to call all three

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.570 
equal I'm just going to call all three
of<00:00:27.449> them<00:00:27.599> s<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.289> s<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.980> going<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.189> stand<00:00:29.490> for

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
of them s and s is going to stand for

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.410 
of them s and s is going to stand for
this<00:00:30.390> side<00:00:30.660> length<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.009> cube<00:00:35.360> so<00:00:36.360> I'm

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
this side length of the cube so I'm

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.420 
this side length of the cube so I'm
going<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> rewrite<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.140> formula<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:38.100> be<00:00:38.250> s

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
going to rewrite this formula to be s

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.619 
going to rewrite this formula to be s
cubed<00:00:39.090> V<00:00:39.930> equals<00:00:40.469> s<00:00:40.710> cubed<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:42.239> let's<00:00:42.420> take<00:00:42.600> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
cubed V equals s cubed so let's take a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.799 
cubed V equals s cubed so let's take a
look<00:00:42.809> at<00:00:42.930> Part<00:00:43.079> A<00:00:43.260> V<00:00:44.040> equals<00:00:44.430> s<00:00:44.640> cubed<00:00:45.030> well<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
look at Part A V equals s cubed well the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.889 
look at Part A V equals s cubed well the
volume<00:00:45.989> here<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.500> 27<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.239> need<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> number

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
volume here is 27 so I need a number

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.590 
volume here is 27 so I need a number
that<00:00:49.410> multiplied<00:00:49.980> by<00:00:50.010> itself<00:00:50.550> twice<00:00:50.910> gives<00:00:51.449> me

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
that multiplied by itself twice gives me

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.529 
that multiplied by itself twice gives me
27<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:53.129> also<00:00:53.250> think<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.730> think<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.390> this

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
27 I can also think this think of this

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.229 
27 I can also think this think of this
as<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.960> cubed<00:00:55.230> root<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.680> could<00:00:56.280> say<00:00:56.430> s<00:00:56.640> equals

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
as the cubed root I could say s equals

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.869 
as the cubed root I could say s equals
the<00:00:57.780> cubed<00:00:58.170> root<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.710> 27<00:00:59.960> which<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.020> 3<00:01:01.230> or<00:01:01.879> what

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the cubed root of 27 which is 3 or what

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.270 
the cubed root of 27 which is 3 or what
number<00:01:03.329> multiplied<00:01:04.049> by<00:01:04.080> itself<00:01:04.619> two<00:01:05.250> times

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
number multiplied by itself two times

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.859 
number multiplied by itself two times
gives<00:01:06.000> us<00:01:06.119> 27<00:01:06.600> well<00:01:07.350> 3<00:01:07.650> times<00:01:08.340> 3<00:01:08.700> times<00:01:09.270> 3<00:01:09.450> does

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
gives us 27 well 3 times 3 times 3 does

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.340 
gives us 27 well 3 times 3 times 3 does
equal<00:01:09.990> 27<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.610> that's<00:01:11.790> how<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:11.970> figured<00:01:12.360> out<00:01:12.450> 3<00:01:12.780> 3

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
equal 27 so that's how I figured out 3 3

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.300 
equal 27 so that's how I figured out 3 3
is<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> side<00:01:13.890> length<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.460> my<00:01:14.610> first<00:01:14.880> cube<00:01:15.210> and

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
is the side length of my first cube and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
is the side length of my first cube and
I'm<00:01:17.310> actually<00:01:17.460> gonna<00:01:17.640> put<00:01:17.909> feet<00:01:18.119> there

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
I'm actually gonna put feet there

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.929 
I'm actually gonna put feet there
because<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.659> don't<00:01:18.840> want<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> forget<00:01:19.110> my<00:01:19.290> label

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
because I don't want to forget my label

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.429 
because I don't want to forget my label
for<00:01:20.939> Part<00:01:21.150> B<00:01:21.210> Emma<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> same<00:01:21.960> thing<00:01:22.170> v

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
for Part B Emma do the same thing v

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.920 
for Part B Emma do the same thing v
equals<00:01:22.830> s<00:01:23.040> cubed<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.119> I'm<00:01:24.299> looking<00:01:24.600> for<00:01:24.900> a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
equals s cubed so I'm looking for a

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.140 
equals s cubed so I'm looking for a
number<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.770> multiplied<00:01:26.340> by<00:01:26.369> itself<00:01:26.880> two

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
number that multiplied by itself two

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.679 
number that multiplied by itself two
times<00:01:27.180> gives<00:01:27.810> me<00:01:28.009> 216<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:30.030> do<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.360> or<00:01:30.630> I

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
times gives me 216 so I can do that or I

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.620 
times gives me 216 so I can do that or I
can<00:01:31.320> simply<00:01:31.500> say<00:01:31.890> s<00:01:32.159> equals<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.150> cubed<00:01:33.479> root

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
can simply say s equals the cubed root

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.090 
can simply say s equals the cubed root
of<00:01:33.990> 216<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:36.090> cube<00:01:36.299> root<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.450> 216<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.200> 6<00:01:37.439> so

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
of 216 and the cube root of 216 is 6 so

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.450 
of 216 and the cube root of 216 is 6 so
the<00:01:38.220> lengths<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.610> cube<00:01:38.970> B<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:40.130> 6<00:01:41.130> feet<00:01:43.460> lastly

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
the lengths of cube B is 6 feet lastly

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.069 
the lengths of cube B is 6 feet lastly
for<00:01:44.610> Part<00:01:44.820> C<00:01:44.880> we're<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.750> do<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.869> same

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
for Part C we're going to do the same

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.200 
for Part C we're going to do the same
exact<00:01:46.439> process<00:01:46.680> v<00:01:47.430> equals<00:01:47.909> s<00:01:48.570> cubed<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:50.210> 1,000

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
exact process v equals s cubed so 1,000

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.289 
exact process v equals s cubed so 1,000
equals<00:01:51.600> side<00:01:52.500> cubed<00:01:52.890> society<00:01:53.880> equals<00:01:54.210> the
