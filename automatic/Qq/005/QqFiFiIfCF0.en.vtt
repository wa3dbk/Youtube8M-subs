really<00:00:15.089> cool<00:00:15.240> seed<00:00:15.839> it's<00:00:16.740> really<00:00:16.920> unique<00:00:17.130> I

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
really cool seed it's really unique I

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.660 
really cool seed it's really unique I
haven't<00:00:17.670> seen<00:00:17.880> many<00:00:18.119> seeds<00:00:18.480> like<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.869> or

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
haven't seen many seeds like this or

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.250 
haven't seen many seeds like this or
many<00:00:20.670> worlds<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.359> should<00:00:21.660> say<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:22.230> actually

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
many worlds I should say that actually

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.470 
many worlds I should say that actually
have<00:00:24.140> overhangs<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.529> craters<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.580> floating

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
have overhangs and craters and floating

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.269 
have overhangs and craters and floating
blocks<00:00:27.779> there<00:00:28.230> may<00:00:28.349> be<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.560> lot<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.859> them<00:00:29.099> out

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
blocks there may be a lot of them out

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.880 
blocks there may be a lot of them out
there<00:00:29.340> but<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.869> really<00:00:30.960> have<00:00:31.410> everything

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
there but I just really have everything

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.160 
there but I just really have everything
that<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:32.070> generate<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:33.210> kind<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.600> normal

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
that I generate is just kind of normal

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.069 
that I generate is just kind of normal
it's<00:00:34.320> not<00:00:34.469> really<00:00:35.210> not<00:00:36.210> too<00:00:36.450> crazy<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:36.989> this

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
it's not really not too crazy but this

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.560 
it's not really not too crazy but this
is<00:00:37.230> actually<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.649> really<00:00:37.800> cool<00:00:37.890> seed<00:00:38.340> there<00:00:39.270> are

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
is actually a really cool seed there are

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.040 
is actually a really cool seed there are
actually<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> few<00:00:40.469> overhangs<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.280> hills<00:00:42.050> in

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
actually a few overhangs and hills in

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.080 
actually a few overhangs and hills in
this<00:00:43.530> seed<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.129> I'll<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:44.250> go<00:00:44.550> ahead<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.760> fly

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
this seed so I'll just go ahead and fly

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.850 
this seed so I'll just go ahead and fly
around<00:00:45.270> show<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.719> guys<00:00:45.840> some<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
around show you guys some of the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.130 
around show you guys some of the
features<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.180> some<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.480> stuff<00:00:48.750> that's<00:00:49.020> in

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
features and some of the stuff that's in

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.830 
features and some of the stuff that's in
the<00:00:49.260> seed<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.059> it's<00:00:51.059> really<00:00:51.210> cool<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.449> believe

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the seed and it's really cool I believe

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.740 
the seed and it's really cool I believe
that<00:00:52.110> there<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.379> actually<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.829> crater<00:00:53.219> or

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
that there is actually a crater or

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.090 
that there is actually a crater or
something<00:00:54.750> back<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.500> goes<00:00:55.680> all<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.920> way

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
something back here it goes all the way

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.450 
something back here it goes all the way

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
blocks like I said this is just crazy

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.260 
blocks like I said this is just crazy
look<00:01:48.180> at<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.420> over<00:01:48.810> here<00:01:49.490> everything<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.790> I
