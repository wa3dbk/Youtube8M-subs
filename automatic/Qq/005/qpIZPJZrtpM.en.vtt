00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.370
 good afternoon with you reel alexander and 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.940
 Today there will be such a small review 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.000
 new gets 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.640
 this is volkswagen jetta 2015 model 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.590
 years she has undergone small changes 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.150
 so let's say the facelift we have a new 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.130
 front bumper 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.640
 in it we see new fog 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.020
 lanterns also stand next to a model with 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.660
 new headlights finally we waited 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.970
 car with new LED headlights 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:46.260
 olya volkswagen passat and others 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.630
 Group cars, in principle, face 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.350
 a little retouched was 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.600
 Look interesting all the same car 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.239
 for several years sold from ordinary 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.660
 headlights with lenses live we are bored 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.850
 and so the manufacturer claims they are 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.220
 increased clearance and distance between 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:13.830
 ground bumper let's measure here 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.670
 just exactly we have about 22 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.409
 centimeter 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.860
 vampire hangs ground clearance i'm not 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.080
 I can measure to go far but 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.409
 to the manufacturerâ€™s statement he became 16 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.340
 centimeters that is important for Russia 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.310
 false radiator grille department on 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.270
 gloss that looks spectacular just on 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.150
 by car 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.369
 dark colors it is not particularly noticeable 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.890
 will look beautiful on light 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.950
 for example, ashore cars are also headlights 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.710
 slightly sharpened they began to look 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.470
 Manners and Golf 7 on the motor scale 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.229
 there is no change here as before 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.810
 I myself had a volkswagen jetta 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.630
 2010 and as I remember there he was 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.640
 change telescopic support and here 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.479
 ordinary stick support 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:11.280
 also somehow thin looks 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:13.220
 we do not have heat protection sealer 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.130
 around the perimeter so there will be 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.940
 dust from the side 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.830
 view virtually no this car 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.960
 This is the average set in more 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.760
 rich trim levels here will be with us 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.920
 Keep the raban finish here 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.350
 seals 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.640
 17-inch wheels are also available. 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.080
 here are regular 205 6016 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.810
 This as and say poorly 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.750
 equipment here caps most 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.160
 interesting we got behind is new 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.320
 rear optics in richer 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.330
 she LEDs 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.480
 doris well say so dorestaylingovaya 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.730
 danfoss Jett elevator reminded me in 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.760
 car audi especially behind 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.090
 now it began to look more at 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.880
 ironing but of course in the press release 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.630
 It means that she began to resemble golf 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.950
 7 but I'm sorry, but it became yellow 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.720
 like audi 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.120
 latest generation a3 a4 trunk gets 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.810
 same huge 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.550
 but I am confused by these arcs 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.130
 if it changes memory dorestaylingovoy 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:31.250
 the models here were arcs without these 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:33.470
 casing mechanism we have made quite 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:39.290
 ergonomically, it will not really 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:42.740
 to hide the seat we can 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.610
 decompose only from the trunk with these 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.030
 levers 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.640
 pulling him flat floor we do 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.680
 not working out but hole for 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.560
 loading long lengths is huge 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.900
 almost the size of the entire rear 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.800
 sofa as you can see the seats fold 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.380
 relations 60 to 40 in the trunk all 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.230
 made a very nice body in person here 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.530
 us plastic shelf she is pretty 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.510
 still tough here we have full size 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.830
 spare tire with necessary 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.630
 tools to replace it on the door 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.930
 the trunk we have drawn as you can 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:25.550
 close the trunk we have a comfortable ledge 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:28.540
 for the hand at first it did not work right 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.540
 pull in stronger 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.400
 either has not yet developed a trunk either 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:39.080
 he just lines up need to pull harder 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.860
 as long logs that can be put in 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.870
 the trunk we will be about 175 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.319
 centimeters is up to the driver's back 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:52.039
 the seats of the salon changes a little bit 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:53.810
 changed by the wheel Pinned from the bottom insert 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.139
 from glossy plastic 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.699
 Immediately so or kushki here ordinary role 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:02.120
 pain rich trim will 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:05.780
 Multifunction instrument wells have become a little 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:09.289
 deeper that's more began to look like 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:13.550
 golf 7 inserts 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:16.360
 we have a carbon is an ordinary plastic 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.340
 just looks like carbon 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.550
 mirrors principle of the same form 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.220
 They are too small of course for the city for us 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:29.780
 in richer trim levels will 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:31.699
 electric folding and monitoring 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.419
 blind spots we moved into a car with 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:38.479
 more rich picking here 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:41.180
 seven-step with g flashing button 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:43.389
 engine start volkswagen by tradition 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.610
 she's so classic nondescript 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:49.789
 the center console is trimmed with us again 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:52.580
 gloss it all will get dirty 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:54.310
 magnitolka is not the top 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.940
 phone can be synchronized 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:01.630
 Multimedia are you monitoring blind spots 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.630
 automatic folding mirrors 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.210
