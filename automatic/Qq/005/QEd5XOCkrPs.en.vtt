00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.390 

one<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.469> things<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.769> bugged<00:00:14.070> me<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.219> lot

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
one of the things that bugged me a lot

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.519 
one of the things that bugged me a lot
on<00:00:14.549> P<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.299> get<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.660> animation

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
on P I is that I get the animation

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.320 
on P I is that I get the animation
looking<00:00:16.830> nice<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.010> snappy<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.760> viewports

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
looking nice and snappy in the viewports

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.900 
looking nice and snappy in the viewports
but<00:00:18.990> once<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.439> rented<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.890> out<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.279> motion<00:00:20.670> blur

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
but once I rented it out the motion blur

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.460 
but once I rented it out the motion blur
would<00:00:21.240> smooth<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.689> out<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.020> much<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.380> the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
would smooth it out so much that the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.920 
would smooth it out so much that the
animation<00:00:22.980> would<00:00:23.130> lose<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> lot<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.580> its<00:00:23.789> pop<00:00:24.090> so

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
animation would lose a lot of its pop so

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.509 
animation would lose a lot of its pop so
I've<00:00:25.109> been<00:00:25.410> trying<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.920> cope<00:00:26.070> with<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.310> few

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
I've been trying to cope with a few

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.730 
I've been trying to cope with a few
tools<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:27.180> would<00:00:27.330> help<00:00:27.510> make<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.140> OpenGL

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
tools that would help make the OpenGL

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.769 
tools that would help make the OpenGL
displays<00:00:29.189> look<00:00:29.400> more<00:00:29.670> like<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.330> rendered

output<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.949> first<00:00:32.219> one<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.669> just<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.149> 3d

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
previous frame and then it uses a cutoff

to<00:00:53.910> figure<00:00:54.180> out<00:00:54.300> whether<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.690> vertex<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.289> on

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
to figure out whether the vertex is on

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
leading edge on the smear so that the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.930 
leading edge on the smear so that the
form<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.899> still<00:01:01.079> distinct<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.460> back<00:01:02.640> part

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
form is still distinct but the back part

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.670 
form is still distinct but the back part
of<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.030> geometry<00:01:03.570> will<00:01:03.690> get<00:01:03.840> smeared<00:01:04.229> back<00:01:04.470> in

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
of the geometry will get smeared back in

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.429 
of the geometry will get smeared back in
time<00:01:05.060> if<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.299> wanted<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.659> could<00:01:06.810> also<00:01:07.080> add<00:01:07.409> a

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
time if you wanted you could also add a

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.380 
time if you wanted you could also add a
little<00:01:07.770> tiny<00:01:08.130> bit<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.490> motion<00:01:08.850> blur<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.150> smooth

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
little tiny bit of motion blur to smooth

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.060 
little tiny bit of motion blur to smooth
it<00:01:09.479> out<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.200> whole<00:01:10.350> point<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.770> letting

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
it out but the whole point is letting

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.859 
it out but the whole point is letting
the<00:01:11.100> animator<00:01:11.549> control<00:01:12.000> things<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.600> doing

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the animator control things and doing

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.469 
the animator control things and doing
away<00:01:13.110> with<00:01:13.229> motion<00:01:13.799> blur<00:01:13.979> entirely<00:01:14.580> plus<00:01:15.240> all

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
away with motion blur entirely plus all

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.660 
away with motion blur entirely plus all
those<00:01:15.840> weird<00:01:16.409> little<00:01:16.799> geometry<00:01:17.280> problems

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
those weird little geometry problems

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.550 
those weird little geometry problems
actually<00:01:17.880> look<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.360> lot<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.960> dry<00:01:19.200> brush

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
actually look a lot like the dry brush

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.499 
actually look a lot like the dry brush
effect<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.159> 2d<00:01:20.430> guys<00:01:20.610> will<00:01:20.880> sometimes<00:01:21.270> put

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
effect that 2d guys will sometimes put

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.420 
effect that 2d guys will sometimes put
on<00:01:21.600> their<00:01:21.750> smears<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.680> actually<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.400> that

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
on their smears so I actually like that

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.160 
on their smears so I actually like that
it's<00:01:23.729> not<00:01:23.880> all<00:01:24.060> perfect<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.600> clean<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.080> it

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
it's not all perfect and clean and it

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.840 
it's not all perfect and clean and it
gives<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.409> nice<00:01:25.560> little<00:01:25.860> extra<00:01:26.280> bit<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.430> motion

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
gives a nice little extra bit of motion

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.300 
gives a nice little extra bit of motion
than<00:01:27.000> forced<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.630> smear<00:01:28.280> unfortunately<00:01:29.280> I

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
than forced to the smear unfortunately I

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.950 
than forced to the smear unfortunately I
didn't<00:01:29.610> figure<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.970> out<00:01:30.090> until<00:01:30.299> p<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.689> was

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
didn't figure this out until p I was

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.899 
didn't figure this out until p I was
almost<00:01:31.110> finished<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.280> doesn't<00:01:32.549> show<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.700> in

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
almost finished so it doesn't show up in

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.120 
almost finished so it doesn't show up in
the<00:01:32.970> final<00:01:33.150> film<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.680> next<00:01:34.890> time<00:01:34.950> around

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the final film but the next time around

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.399 
the final film but the next time around
I<00:01:35.430> really<00:01:35.729> want<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.000> push<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.509> animation<00:01:37.229> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
I really want to push the animation and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.170 
I really want to push the animation and
exaggerate<00:01:37.979> things<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.310> lot<00:01:38.460> more<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.880> this

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
exaggerate things a lot more so this

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.600 
exaggerate things a lot more so this
will<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> key<00:01:40.049> part<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.590> look<00:01:40.860> another

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
will be a key part of that look another

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.249 
will be a key part of that look another

tool I've been working on is still
really<00:01:43.770> rough<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:44.939> honest<00:01:45.240> I'm<00:01:45.360> not

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
really rough and to be honest I'm not

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.330 
really rough and to be honest I'm not
sure<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.020> coding<00:01:46.470> skills<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:47.070> really

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
sure I have the coding skills to really

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.569 
sure I have the coding skills to really
do<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.610> right<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.200> gist<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.159> that

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
do it right but the gist of it is that

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.609 
do it right but the gist of it is that
it<00:01:50.880> makes<00:01:51.030> several<00:01:51.360> copies<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:52.020> your<00:01:52.290> geometry

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
it makes several copies of your geometry

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.230 
it makes several copies of your geometry
and<00:01:53.189> then<00:01:53.369> makes<00:01:53.579> them<00:01:53.759> all<00:01:53.909> slightly

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and then makes them all slightly

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.990 
and then makes them all slightly
transparent<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.219> lot<00:01:56.399> like<00:01:56.640> motion

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
transparent so it's a lot like motion

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.420 
transparent so it's a lot like motion
blur<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.600> after<00:01:57.930> effects<00:01:58.290> not<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.070> highest

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
blur and after effects not the highest

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.100 
blur and after effects not the highest
quality<00:01:59.610> but<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> animator<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.899> at<00:02:00.990> least

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
quality but the animator can at least

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.319 
quality but the animator can at least
see<00:02:01.530> exactly<00:02:02.100> what<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.670> motion<00:02:02.969> blur<00:02:03.180> is

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
see exactly what the motion blur is

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.749 
see exactly what the motion blur is
doing<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.689> their<00:02:03.810> animation<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.619> then<00:02:05.610> at

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
doing to their animation and then at

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.850 
doing to their animation and then at
render<00:02:06.060> time<00:02:06.090> those<00:02:06.840> extra<00:02:07.380> models<00:02:07.680> get

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
render time those extra models get

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.350 
render time those extra models get
thrown<00:02:08.129> away<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.640> real<00:02:08.819> motion<00:02:09.209> blur

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
thrown away and the real motion blur

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.390 
thrown away and the real motion blur
should<00:02:09.720> be<00:02:10.020> pretty<00:02:10.259> much<00:02:10.500> identical<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:11.250> this

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
should be pretty much identical to this

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.700 
should be pretty much identical to this
now<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.330> course<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:12.690> also<00:02:12.930> tied<00:02:13.319> into<00:02:13.470> the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
now of course it's also tied into the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.830 
now of course it's also tied into the
camera<00:02:13.950> settings<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.550> if<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.910> animator<00:02:15.300> wants

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
camera settings so if the animator wants

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.890 
camera settings so if the animator wants
they<00:02:16.050> can<00:02:16.260> animate<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.860> shutter<00:02:17.130> speed<00:02:17.520> and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
they can animate the shutter speed and

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.330 
they can animate the shutter speed and
adjust<00:02:18.900> things<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.290> fit<00:02:19.440> their<00:02:19.590> animation<00:02:20.130> and

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
adjust things to fit their animation and

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.680 
adjust things to fit their animation and
then<00:02:20.460> those<00:02:20.640> settings<00:02:21.030> will<00:02:21.240> get<00:02:21.360> carried

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
then those settings will get carried

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.990 
then those settings will get carried
through<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.320> final<00:02:22.650> render<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.580> as<00:02:23.850> I

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
through to the final render so as I

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.610 
through to the final render so as I
mentioned<00:02:24.030> that<00:02:24.420> particular<00:02:24.990> tool<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.440> still

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
mentioned that particular tool is still

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.620 
mentioned that particular tool is still
really<00:02:25.860> rough<00:02:26.160> but<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.820> smear<00:02:27.180> tool<00:02:27.360> works

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
really rough but the smear tool works

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.420 
really rough but the smear tool works
great<00:02:27.960> so<00:02:28.230> if<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.500> happen<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.830> be<00:02:28.920> an<00:02:29.010> exercise

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
great so if you happen to be an exercise

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.580 
great so if you happen to be an exercise
user<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:30.030> have<00:02:30.270> uploaded<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.810> ice<00:02:30.930> compound<00:02:31.470> to

sponsoring<00:02:36.960> this<00:02:37.050> episode<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.800> actually

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
sponsoring this episode it actually

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.680 
sponsoring this episode it actually
takes<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.610> lot<00:02:38.850> more<00:02:38.880> work<00:02:39.330> than<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.540> would

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
takes a lot more work than you would

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.840 
takes a lot more work than you would
imagine<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:40.230> put<00:02:40.410> on<00:02:40.560> even<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.340> very<00:02:41.520> short

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
imagine to put on even a very short

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.760 
imagine to put on even a very short
podcast<00:02:42.330> like<00:02:42.570> this<00:02:42.780> so<00:02:43.050> having<00:02:43.260> them<00:02:43.500> come<00:02:43.650> on

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
podcast like this so having them come on

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.200 
podcast like this so having them come on

previously planned so if you haven't
heard<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.720> fxphd<00:02:52.290> they<00:02:52.770> are<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.040> visual<00:02:53.430> effects

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
heard of fxphd they are a visual effects

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.790 
heard of fxphd they are a visual effects
training<00:02:54.240> site<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.690> currently<00:02:55.470> i'm<00:02:55.620> actually

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
training site and currently i'm actually

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.950 
training site and currently i'm actually
teaching<00:02:56.310> my<00:02:56.460> second<00:02:56.910> xsi<00:02:57.300> class<00:02:57.630> through

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
teaching my second xsi class through

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.930 
teaching my second xsi class through
there<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.530> they've<00:02:59.040> got<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.280> great<00:02:59.580> bunch<00:02:59.880> of

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
there so they've got a great bunch of

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.670 
there so they've got a great bunch of
professors<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.420> great<00:03:00.690> community<00:03:01.140> be<00:03:01.410> sure<00:03:01.590> to
