 Da Vinci Jr.1.0 - Printer Quality Maintenance 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.100
 If the printing quality of the da Vinci Jr.1.0 3D printer is not ideal 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.100
 May be the following reason 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.100
 Platform patch is damaged due to multiple prints 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.600
 Causes the printed product to stick to the platform 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.900
 Please pull the platform to the appropriate distance 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.000
 Take out a new platform patch 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.700
 Tearing the release paper and the patch at a distance of 3 cm 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:38.000
 Attached to the printing platform while tearing the edge 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.700
 Platform patch can be reused 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.800
 Replace when worn 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.500
 As the number of prints increases 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.300
 Carbon deposits and dirt in the nozzle may affect print quality 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.700
 It is recommended that you clean the nozzles after each print for 25 hours. 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.400
 Select "UTILITIES" (function) 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.500
 Then select "CLEAN NOZZLE" (cleaning nozzle) 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.900
 Finally select "YES" (confirm) 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.300
 Waiting for print head heating 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.900
 When the temperature reaches the standard, the print head will be automatically moved to the center of the machine. 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.400
 "READY FOR CLEAN" will be displayed on the screen. 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.900
 To avoid burns, use a needle-nose pliers to hold the nozzle to clean the wire. 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:33.400
 Carefully insert into the hole in the nozzle, clean up and down 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.800
 After cleaning is complete, press the "OK" button to exit this function. 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.200
 In addition to the nozzle, it is recommended to clean the gear regularly. 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.200
 Insert the gear cleaning brush into the gear hole 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.800
 Brush up and down to remove dirt 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.100
 If the print head is too old, it may not be discharged due to clogging. 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.500
 It is recommended to replace the new print head at this time. 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.600
 Please return the print head before replacing the print head. 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.000
 Select "UTILITIES" (function) 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.500
 Then select "CHANGE SPOOL" (replace wire shaft) 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.800
 Finally select "UNLOAD FILAMENT" (exit wire) 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.500
 Waiting for print head heating 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.200
 Manual auxiliary reel rotation when the wire exits 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.500
 Make the printing machine's return process smoother 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.500
 Select "UTILITIES" (function) 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.400
 Then select "HOME AXES" (printing device homing) 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.900
 "YES" (confirm) 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:47.700
 Waiting for the print head to return home 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.800
 Turn off the printer power 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.200
 Press the white button at the back to remove the old print head 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.400
 Pull out the cable 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.400
 Lightly press the spring around the feed hole 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.800
 Pull out the wire guiding tube 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.600
 After plucking, if the front end of the wire guiding tube is flattened 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.100
 Will cause the wire to fail to feed and discharge smoothly 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.500
 Please use the blade to cut the deformed part 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.100
 The total length of the pipeline after resection must be at least 50 cm 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.900
 Insert the wire guide tube into the new print head 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:39.800
 Connect the cable to the connector of the new print head 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.300
 Put the print head back on the printer 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:55.800
 Finally, confirm whether the cable is fixed in the cable slot. 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.000
 Replacement nozzle is completed 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.600
 If the print quality has not improved 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.200
 Please use the "Z OFFSET" (print module adjustment) function to adjust the printing module 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.300
 Select "UTILITIES" (function) 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.300
 Then select "Z OFFSET" (print module adjustment) 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.100
 This function is to adjust the spacing between the print head and the printing platform. 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.700
 Please record the Z OFFSET value of the original factory setting first. 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.500
 Adjust based on this 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:33.600
 The recommended gap between the nozzle and the printing platform (adhesive tape) is the distance that allows two A4 papers to be smoothly pulled out. 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.800
 Increase/decrease the value by 0.1mm 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.900
 Increase the value by 0.1mm, increase the gap between the printing module and the platform by 0.1mm 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.200
 Reduce the value by 0.1mm, reduce the gap between the printing module and the platform by 0.1mm 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.500
 After testing and printing, evaluate whether to continue to adjust 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.400
 Press "OK" to end the printing module adjustment 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:59.200
 Da Vinci Jr. 1.0 3D printer quality maintenance is complete!
