00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.240
 so here it is not this 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.130
 Are you learning to learn lens events ? 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.259

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.769
 so alex is well on it 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.350
 provoked to provoke our anger 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.600
 now deliberately short study i would contact you 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.330

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.410
 first thing is a gold interesting and 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.780
 it would probably feel fit in therefore 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.819
 No problem for coffee, I'm fine 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:37.690

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:44.540
 Confused radiate here no shit HSV 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:46.070

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:55.370
 toxic papers inc fly the step on it 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.310
 but I do not know exactly how much 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.160
 that he really is not really 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.450
 what I wanted to see 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.280
 from the chapel that does not pull now 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.260
 really much on meyer is no good 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.650
 so it then goes up you shit 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.650
 fool me 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:20.890
 that's how it must be 35 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:29.950
 So what is it trying to do for a long time? 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:32.440
 Storm 80 special from blood comeback good 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.790
 flames storm was cool the attack is running 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.400
 so hyper ball found 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:44.020
 hello hello do you see me around 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:50.500
 Pokemon here and now it continues 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:52.209

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.940
 did you defeat me but now it is 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.680
 not so easy you have to know 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.510
 Alone on your own like children 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:08.380
 i left with me i had her 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:14.709

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:18.359
 sony boss of islam poisonous shit me 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.359
 wanted to paralyze the pokémon still 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.800
 the florianis clear 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.830
 well, silver comes with short reports 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:42.570
 attack who swap perfect silver 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:46.440
 itself flames storm acid shit on 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:49.200
 acid flame rad and daun has fled 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:54.060
 because nothing else comes of aare bock in 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.560
 The fight for the bike just so paradoxical 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.320
 purely so I do not know does not belong 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.360
 to the team but if it is already here 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.220
 space for Schwendermarkt is partly platzwart 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.710
 Do not waste placeholder then 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.080
 it must also do something else comes 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.290
 chrome os ends the case now 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:16.530
 very casual with a thunderstalk 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:18.420
 attacke so martina you are like to 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:23.550

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:29.030
 Let's go in now because nobody is waiting 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.030

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.790

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.100
 me so holy shit people know what up 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.020
 Wherever I briefly try this one 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.900
 Bug times to the best 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.110
 after this little incident 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.450
 I am always redesigned and everything 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:53.430
 I would say paletti 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:54.570

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.200

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:17.400

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.990

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:24.720
 now something of festivalnight and me 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:33.180
 with again dragon boat still a mantra 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:36.210
 courage the thing would have to be around 190 kp 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:39.750
 own about 90 kg as well as now 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:42.659
 It looks like he has 43 here 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:46.130
 standard and yes as it looks like 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:46.130
 it seems so much 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:54.800
 yes i would say toxic purely then 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.699

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:01.469
 ok it because of me that i have too 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:07.680
 long walk no more buck around here 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:11.009
 it would actually have to be 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:14.630
 create that self-destruction if 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:14.630
 That's why I would send in on the left 

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:20.029
 provide 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:27.210

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:36.030

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.630

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.070
