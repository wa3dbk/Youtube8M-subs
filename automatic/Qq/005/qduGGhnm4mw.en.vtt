00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 being all guys we're here today a 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.080
 new video we are and Sunday so me 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.059
 brings a configuration for a pc from 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:15.990
 gaming this time on a 700 euro budget e 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.279
 for a combination amd 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.890
 you will say that I have already done this 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.140
 what is true but this is particular 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.019
 because why probed to put one 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.630
 amd card of the series radeon r9 those 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.849
 new that have come out of a few days from 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.170
 23 days now anyway 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.279
 we immediately begin to analyze the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.050
 motherboard components 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.510
 here is an error written on the site 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.739
 here written 990 fx extreme 3r 2.0 here 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.690
 perfect the usual that spam 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.719
 i answer him later he managed to 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.750
 appear even today in the excellent video 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:52.500
 this however I said is not a new e 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.770
 90 fx 9 70 years old, however the extreme 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.260
 create visions 2.0 then 970 chipset 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.219
 good for overclocking revision 2.0 then 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.199
 natively supports all piledrivers 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:07.320
 it's a great motherboard I had the ex 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.570
 33 normal before taking it rock and vi 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.240
 I can guarantee that it will guarantee several 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.700
 satisfactions more solid fx 8.320 here 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.150
 costs more than compared to 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.770
 other places cost 145 with 330 of amazon 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.080
 he obviously does it because of the price 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.830
 is the only r9 duty at the moment 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.740
 video cards 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.170
 the only one I found at least 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.509
 however the usual 8 core 3.5 gb that 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.810
 arrives at 4 with the turbo you can 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.810
 quietly 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.980
 over block it provided you take a 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.020
 decent sink because the basic one 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.930
 sucks and take it to a lot of levels 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.720
 very tall and for 145 I feel 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.430
 absolutely to recommend you ram 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.230
 even by now you will be tired of 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.610
 see them but they are the usual kingston 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:02:00.020
 hyperx 2 for 4 gb 1600 mag and with latency 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.080
 cl9 low profile precise timing 9 9 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.700
 9 27 low profile heat sink then 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.380
 you won't have problems if you want to put 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.440
 of the senators bulky damage like gods 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.130
 noctua of thermalright silverstone 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.930
 things like this are great cards 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.890
 excellent sorry cards scotti in 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.890
 banks of ram with decent frequency 1600 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.560
 meyers however is the right one for me and 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.230
 those that are worth the price are also those 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.080
 which cost less then absolutely 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.450
 absolutely recommend that we arrive 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.340
 to the strong piece the one that changes second 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.710
 me the configuration the video card r9 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.450
 270 hicks this video card 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.120
 despite being in the series anyway 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.980
 new is practically another card 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.270
 amd video rebranded and it's my card 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.520
 video the one that mounts on my system 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.489
 therefore I do not mount 270 hicks uphill 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.340
 78 70 xt but the data is exactly the 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.600
 themselves 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.300
 the only thing seems to have one 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.459
 chip surface smaller than 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.820
 what i saw that should in 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.380
 I mean the theory pelino consumption 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.930
 lower but does not consume much of it 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.300
 however dissipation 2 alix now that I have 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.940
 me too on a great system of 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.410
 dissipation 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.770
 the mistro between the wind radiator le 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.420
 heatpipe you can crossfire with 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.910
 this video card has one of 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.530
 wight a vga a hdmi a mini display 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.420
 port and also has just come out then 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.910
 will also be among the video cards 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:38.070
 optimized for the HCP 4 percent 84 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.930
 euro for the astra absolutely recommend 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.850
 then we also have a real hard drive 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:48.580
 bomb is the cav air black dawn tera 700 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.770
 7200 rpm sorry just three inches e 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.260
 half size is a set of prey 6 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.120
 gigabyte 6 gb per second in short, the 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.710
 64 year old buffer and a hard disk 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.710
 really fast even faster than 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.690
 my me a blue carrier and for 77 euros 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.060
 I did not think this and much more instead 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.680
 I was surprised and absolutely 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.590
 I couldn't not put it because you'll have it 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.960
 really fast performances not up to par 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.820
 of an ssd of course however anyway 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.650
 respectable performances 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.359
 just to get an idea know that the 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.540
 my caviar blue that goes without this 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:24.419
 anyway he has a writing in my opinion 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:29.140
 something like 110 and reading 150 then 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:33.220
 absolutely great feeder the 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:37.360
 our trusty or cz modes 600 watts 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.460
 the pro the semi modular is a step 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.690
 600 watt power supply unit in the form of a module 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.430
 80 plus modular bronze certificate for 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.950
 who does not know what it means means 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.590
 that some cables are fixed see these 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.120
 here respect these here that you hollow 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.590
 here they are fixed and then in these slots that 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.290
 we can go to insert the cables that 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.210
 we need an excellent power supply 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.250
 for the really low price of 73 euros 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.870
 will be able to manage everything is also a certain one 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:07.960
 therefore true overclocking margin 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:11.110
 then I finally recommend our keys a k 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.360
 380 of the master kurer we go to 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.320
 analyze them for a moment I never think 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.060
 that he had never used for one 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.600
 configuration but now I want it 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.130
 I just want to show it so let's start 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.419
 immediately saying that at the window on the 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.280
 next you can see yours 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.220
 hardware with the ability to mount 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.660
 a cable management fan is as good as 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.169
 you can see they can let us through 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.319
 nobody 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:35.699
 but back here anyway in this forum 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:38.469
 here to connect them properly 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:42.419
 hiding them presents its own one already 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:45.069
 fan 140 seems to me on the front 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.919
 has the ability to install a lot 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:49.270
 another event including one on the back 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:52.389
 one thinks even on the superior but not 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.860
 I am sure therefore also guarantees one 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:59.199
 good expandability and reaction 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:03.370
 also presents the beauty of six 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:05.110
 pci ports exiting out for any 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.779
 liquid cooling go 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:11.259
 power supply obviously in low doors 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:15.129
 usb on the front headphone and microphone jack 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:17.319
 and power button and it's a great one 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:19.599
 that the dx format will therefore support 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.919
 all the pieces I just mentioned and there 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:23.169
 in short, it will allow for a price 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:25.539
 absolutely honest to take home 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.099
 a casey of excellent quality then the 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:29.259
 video ends here i hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:31.930
 also because you think you are among the first 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:33.759
 who use the new amd cards in one 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.189
 configuration I think in Italy and does not 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:37.750
 I have seen again in Italian so I hope 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:39.550
 to have been precisely the first a 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.539
 use them and we'll see each other 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.539
 hello video
