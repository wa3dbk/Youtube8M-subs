00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.129 
that weight and you know the fat loss
factor<00:04:45.280> gives<00:04:45.820> him<00:04:46.030> you<00:04:46.270> know<00:04:46.389> a<00:04:46.419> plan<00:04:46.780> a

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
factor gives him you know a plan a

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.040 
factor gives him you know a plan a
program<00:04:47.620> and<00:04:48.100> a<00:04:48.250> way<00:04:48.400> to<00:04:48.460> do<00:04:48.700> that<00:04:48.850> so<00:04:49.510> you<00:04:49.930> know

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
program and a way to do that so you know

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.530 
program and a way to do that so you know
that<00:04:50.290> I<00:04:50.320> think<00:04:50.560> you<00:04:51.340> know<00:04:51.490> the<00:04:51.639> the<00:04:51.910> other<00:04:52.240> good

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
that I think you know the the other good

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.480 
that I think you know the the other good
thing<00:04:52.600> for<00:04:52.870> him<00:04:53.050> is<00:04:53.260> that<00:04:53.470> with<00:04:54.010> the<00:04:54.040> fat<00:04:54.340> loss

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
thing for him is that with the fat loss

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.310 
thing for him is that with the fat loss
factor<00:04:54.550> there's<00:04:55.360> light<00:04:55.630> at<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:55.900> end<00:04:56.050> of<00:04:56.229> the

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
factor there's light at the end of the

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.980 
factor there's light at the end of the
tunnel<00:04:56.710> it's<00:04:56.950> not<00:04:57.190> like<00:04:57.460> well<00:04:58.240> you're<00:04:58.780> only

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
tunnel it's not like well you're only

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.170 
tunnel it's not like well you're only
you<00:04:59.500> know<00:04:59.620> you<00:04:59.680> can<00:04:59.889> only<00:04:59.950> eat<00:05:00.190> you<00:05:00.639> know<00:05:00.729> tofu

you know four stars just because of to
me<00:06:07.539> it<00:06:07.750> seems<00:06:07.990> I<00:06:08.110> could<00:06:08.260> be<00:06:08.350> a<00:06:08.380> little

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
me it seems I could be a little

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.560 
me it seems I could be a little
difficult<00:06:08.740> you<00:06:09.160> know<00:06:09.250> if<00:06:09.700> you<00:06:09.850> aren't<00:06:10.180> one
