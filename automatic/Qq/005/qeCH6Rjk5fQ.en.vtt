time<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.710> looked<00:00:11.309> for<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:13.040> way<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:15.049> transport<00:00:16.049> my

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
time I looked for a way to transport my

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.939 
time I looked for a way to transport my
files<00:00:17.150> an<00:00:18.150> electronic<00:00:18.690> media<00:00:18.990> storage<00:00:19.410> system

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
files an electronic media storage system

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.370 
files an electronic media storage system
there<00:00:20.910> was<00:00:21.029> external<00:00:21.510> from<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.810> computer<00:00:22.080> that

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
there was external from a computer that

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.310 
there was external from a computer that
i<00:00:23.369> could<00:00:24.150> use<00:00:24.269> they<00:00:24.420> would<00:00:24.570> have<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> good<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
i could use they would have a good a

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.820 
i could use they would have a good a
really<00:00:26.189> good<00:00:26.310> user<00:00:26.519> experience<00:00:27.619> so<00:00:28.619> there's<00:00:28.769> a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
really good user experience so there's a

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.290 
really good user experience so there's a
lot<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:28.980> different<00:00:29.250> things<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.699> meet<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
lot of different things that meet the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.280 
lot of different things that meet the
basic<00:00:30.449> needs<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:32.239> data<00:00:33.239> transfer<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.960> storing

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
basic needs of data transfer in storing

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.560 
basic needs of data transfer in storing
your<00:00:34.380> files<00:00:34.649> there's<00:00:35.430> external<00:00:36.120> hard<00:00:36.300> drives

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
your files there's external hard drives

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.069 
your files there's external hard drives
there's<00:00:37.129> cds<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.430> dvds<00:00:38.750> there's<00:00:39.750> discs<00:00:40.379> like

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
there's cds and dvds there's discs like

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.770 
there's cds and dvds there's discs like
floppy<00:00:43.079> disks<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.940> zip<00:00:44.940> disks<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.600> kind

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
floppy disks and zip disks and that kind

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.040 
floppy disks and zip disks and that kind
of<00:00:45.809> thing<00:00:46.010> and<00:00:47.010> then<00:00:47.219> there's<00:00:47.370> flash<00:00:47.579> drives

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
of thing and then there's flash drives

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.330 
of thing and then there's flash drives
and<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.289> there's<00:00:49.469> kind<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.649> pros<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.039> cons<00:00:50.190> to

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
and so there's kind of pros and cons to

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.400 
and so there's kind of pros and cons to
each<00:00:50.460> all<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.879> them<00:00:51.030> attempt<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.870> meet<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
each all of them attempt to meet the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.670 
each all of them attempt to meet the
basic<00:00:52.590> needs<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:54.030> user<00:00:54.440> which<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
basic needs of the user which is the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.920 
basic needs of the user which is the
first<00:00:55.829> step<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.280> good<00:00:56.460> user<00:00:56.610> experience<00:00:56.930> and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
first step in a good user experience and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.389 
first step in a good user experience and
all<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.260> them<00:00:58.350> are<00:00:58.379> pretty<00:00:58.559> successful<00:00:59.250> in

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
all of them are pretty successful in

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.220 
all of them are pretty successful in
meeting<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.699> basic<00:00:59.850> need<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.270> saving<00:01:00.840> data

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
meeting the basic need of saving data

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.590 
meeting the basic need of saving data
and<00:01:01.500> pulling<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.800> back<00:01:01.949> up<00:01:02.190> but<00:01:03.000> some<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.510> them

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
and pulling it back up but some of them

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.929 
and pulling it back up but some of them
really<00:01:03.870> don't<00:01:04.049> go<00:01:04.260> above<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.070> beyond<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
really don't go above and beyond and and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.520 
really don't go above and beyond and and
to<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> good<00:01:06.479> user<00:01:06.659> experience<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.409> need

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
to have a good user experience you need

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.560 
to have a good user experience you need
to<00:01:07.680> go<00:01:07.830> above<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.760> beyond<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.240> make<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
to go above and beyond and make the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.630 
to go above and beyond and make the
customer<00:01:10.049> really<00:01:10.320> enjoy<00:01:10.830> using<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.430> and

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
customer really enjoy using it and

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.730 
customer really enjoy using it and
anticipate<00:01:12.570> problems<00:01:12.720> they<00:01:13.080> might<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.500> and

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
anticipate problems they might have and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.859 
anticipate problems they might have and
kind<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.270> respond<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.450> those<00:01:15.570> things<00:01:15.960> too<00:01:16.259> so

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
kind of respond to those things too so

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.760 
kind of respond to those things too so
disks<00:01:18.869> for<00:01:19.110> example<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:20.130> CDs<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:21.600> DVDs<00:01:22.170> are

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
disks for example like CDs and DVDs are

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.810 
disks for example like CDs and DVDs are
usually<00:01:23.900> read<00:01:24.900> only<00:01:25.049> or<00:01:25.560> at<00:01:26.310> least<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.640> most

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
usually read only or at least on most

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.730 
usually read only or at least on most
systems<00:01:27.259> rewriting<00:01:28.259> them<00:01:28.380> wouldn't<00:01:28.619> work

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
systems rewriting them wouldn't work

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.069 
systems rewriting them wouldn't work
very<00:01:28.799> well<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:30.060> might<00:01:30.270> work<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.750> some

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
very well so that might work in some

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.480 
very well so that might work in some
situations<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.009> doesn't<00:01:32.310> really<00:01:32.369> work

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
situations but it doesn't really work

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.319 
situations but it doesn't really work
for<00:01:32.640> what<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.000> was<00:01:33.180> looking<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:34.939> zip<00:01:35.939> disks

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
for what I was looking for and zip disks

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.969 
for what I was looking for and zip disks
and<00:01:36.450> floppy<00:01:36.689> disks<00:01:37.140> are<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.590> not<00:01:37.740> really

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
and floppy disks are just not really

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.770 
and floppy disks are just not really
supported<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> lot<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.939> systems<00:01:39.210> these<00:01:39.540> days

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
supported on a lot of systems these days

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.539 
supported on a lot of systems these days
it's<00:01:40.290> not<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.829> doesn't<00:01:40.950> really<00:01:41.130> work<00:01:41.250> that

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
it's not that doesn't really work that

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.760 
it's not that doesn't really work that
well<00:01:41.700> either<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.990> then<00:01:43.380> there's<00:01:43.530> flash

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
well either and then there's flash

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.679 
well either and then there's flash
drives<00:01:44.159> external<00:01:44.970> hard<00:01:45.270> drives<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.659> be

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
drives external hard drives can be

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.910 
drives external hard drives can be
pretty<00:01:45.899> bulky<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.409> they're<00:01:46.560> pretty<00:01:46.740> much<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
pretty bulky and they're pretty much the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.649 
pretty bulky and they're pretty much the
same<00:01:47.189> thing<00:01:47.250> as<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> flash<00:01:48.000> drive<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.479> lot<00:01:48.630> of

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
same thing as a flash drive in a lot of

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.429 
same thing as a flash drive in a lot of
cases<00:01:49.340> so<00:01:50.340> flash<00:01:51.240> drives<00:01:51.600> were<00:01:52.049> definitely

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
cases so flash drives were definitely

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.440 
cases so flash drives were definitely
the<00:01:52.619> best<00:01:52.880> best<00:01:53.880> thing<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.180> what<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.360> was

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
the best best thing for what I was

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.679 
the best best thing for what I was
looking<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:56.000> after<00:01:57.000> not<00:01:57.180> after<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.509> while

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
looking for and after not after a while

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.830 
looking for and after not after a while
I<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:58.110> kind<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.530> decided<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:59.399> a<00:02:00.060> specific<00:02:00.329> flash

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
I I kind of decided on a specific flash

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.359 
I I kind of decided on a specific flash
drive<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.290> used<00:02:01.500> for<00:02:01.560> several<00:02:02.009> years<00:02:02.219> it

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
drive that I used for several years it

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.060 
drive that I used for several years it
was<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.520> sandisk<00:02:03.149> cruzer<00:02:03.810> flash<00:02:04.740> drive<00:02:05.040> and

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
was the sandisk cruzer flash drive and

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.410 
was the sandisk cruzer flash drive and
it<00:02:05.310> had<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.880> pretty<00:02:06.479> good<00:02:06.600> user<00:02:07.229> experience<00:02:07.350> um

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
it had a pretty good user experience um

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.680 
it had a pretty good user experience um
it<00:02:09.420> was<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:10.709> offered<00:02:11.009> large<00:02:11.489> storage<00:02:11.879> size<00:02:12.239> is

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
it was it offered large storage size is

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.820 
it was it offered large storage size is
very<00:02:12.780> portable

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
very portable

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.880 
very portable
and<00:02:14.240> it<00:02:15.240> looked<00:02:15.510> nice<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:16.140> was<00:02:16.230> retractable

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
and it looked nice it was retractable

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.830 
and it looked nice it was retractable
which<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.030> didn't<00:02:18.210> have<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.330> cap<00:02:18.630> or

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
which so it didn't have a cap or

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.680 
which so it didn't have a cap or
anything<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.440> would<00:02:19.590> lose<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.250> um<00:02:20.690> the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
USB you didn't put a lot of winter

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.820 
USB you didn't put a lot of winter
terrible<00:02:23.760> USB<00:02:24.180> port<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:25.620> was<00:02:25.710> really

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
terrible USB port so it was really

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.770 
terrible USB port so it was really
awesome<00:02:26.100> Anna<00:02:26.910> had<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.210> keychain<00:02:27.450> that

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
awesome Anna had a keychain that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.910 
awesome Anna had a keychain that
connected<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.400> my<00:02:29.400> keys<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:31.260> was<00:02:31.560> easy

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
connected to my keys and so it was easy

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.940 
connected to my keys and so it was easy
to<00:02:32.130> keep<00:02:32.820> track<00:02:32.880> of<00:02:33.470> with<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.530> problem<00:02:34.860> with

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
to keep track of with a problem with

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.560 
to keep track of with a problem with
that<00:02:34.980> flash<00:02:35.400> drive<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:36.060> happened<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.450> me

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
that flash drive and this happened to me

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.720 
that flash drive and this happened to me
several<00:02:36.750> times<00:02:37.080> is<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.250> had<00:02:38.460> such<00:02:38.700> a

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
several times is that it had such a

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.420 
several times is that it had such a
small<00:02:39.210> keychain<00:02:39.960> that<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.890> keychain<00:02:41.250> would

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
small keychain that the keychain would

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.150 
small keychain that the keychain would
get<00:02:41.550> bent<00:02:41.880> after<00:02:42.240> a<00:02:42.270> little<00:02:42.420> while<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:43.160> the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
get bent after a little while and the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.830 
get bent after a little while and the
flash<00:02:44.370> drive<00:02:44.400> would<00:02:44.760> fall<00:02:44.970> off<00:02:45.000> my<00:02:45.300> keys<00:02:45.540> and

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
flash drive would fall off my keys and

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.260 
flash drive would fall off my keys and
so<00:02:46.020> then<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.230> was<00:02:46.410> trying<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.710> carry<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.040> around

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
so then I was trying to carry it around

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.970 
so then I was trying to carry it around
and<00:02:48.270> it<00:02:48.360> just<00:02:48.660> in<00:02:49.050> my<00:02:49.260> pocket<00:02:49.680> or<00:02:49.800> in<00:02:49.890> my

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
backpack or somewhere and it was just a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.580 
backpack or somewhere and it was just a
big<00:02:51.480> problem<00:02:51.810> trying<00:02:51.990> to<00:02:52.110> find<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.410> all<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
big problem trying to find it all the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.350 
big problem trying to find it all the
time<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.800> really<00:02:53.100> wanted<00:02:53.340> one<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.150> could

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
time I really wanted one that I could

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.790 
time I really wanted one that I could
keep<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:54.690> my<00:02:54.810> keys<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.290> they<00:02:55.380> would<00:02:55.530> stay<00:02:55.770> on

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
keep on my keys and they would stay on

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.020 
keep on my keys and they would stay on
my<00:02:56.070> keys<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:57.740> one<00:02:58.740> day<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.250> was<00:03:00.090> in<00:03:00.930> class<00:03:01.290> and

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
my keys so one day I was in class and

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.160 
my keys so one day I was in class and
another<00:03:03.030> student<00:03:03.480> took<00:03:03.570> out<00:03:03.720> his<00:03:03.870> flash<00:03:04.140> drive

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
another student took out his flash drive

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.400 
another student took out his flash drive
and<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:05.700> said<00:03:05.760> I'm<00:03:06.060> seared<00:03:06.330> flash<00:03:06.510> drive<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.050> it

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
and I said I'm seared flash drive and it

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.900 
and I said I'm seared flash drive and it
was<00:03:07.500> made<00:03:07.650> by<00:03:07.770> trance<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:08.370> it's<00:03:08.610> called<00:03:08.820> a

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
was made by trance and it's called a

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.840 
was made by trance and it's called a
transcend<00:03:09.420> jetflash<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:11.250> has<00:03:11.490> this

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
transcend jetflash and it has this

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.670 
transcend jetflash and it has this
little<00:03:11.910> it's<00:03:12.540> likely<00:03:12.900> it's<00:03:13.110> like<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.410> cruiser

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
little it's likely it's like the cruiser

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.920 
little it's likely it's like the cruiser
in<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.010> its<00:03:14.130> retractable<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:15.240> it<00:03:15.750> looks

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
in that its retractable and it looks

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.350 
in that its retractable and it looks
nice<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:17.160> those<00:03:17.310> are<00:03:17.490> some<00:03:17.520> traits<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.180> the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
nice and so those are some traits of the

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.410 
nice and so those are some traits of the
user<00:03:18.930> experience<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.800> it<00:03:20.100> has<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.239> did

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
user experience that it has and so did

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.100 
user experience that it has and so did
the<00:03:21.510> same<00:03:21.690> disc<00:03:21.930> one<00:03:22.140> but<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:24.209> has<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:25.019> way

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
the same disc one but it has the way

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.070 
the same disc one but it has the way
it's<00:03:25.290> designed<00:03:26.030> there's<00:03:27.030> this<00:03:27.180> metal<00:03:27.570> casing

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
it's designed there's this metal casing

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.320 
it's designed there's this metal casing
that<00:03:28.320> comes<00:03:29.010> out<00:03:29.190> at<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.370> end<00:03:29.580> into<00:03:30.030> this

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
that comes out at the end into this

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.970 
that comes out at the end into this
little<00:03:31.850> ring<00:03:32.850> that<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.390> can<00:03:33.810> attach<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.739> a

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
little ring that you can attach to a

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.850 
little ring that you can attach to a
keychain<00:03:35.160> pretty<00:03:35.550> easily<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.750> it's<00:03:37.320> all<00:03:37.530> part

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
keychain pretty easily and it's all part

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.680 
keychain pretty easily and it's all part
of<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.130> flash<00:03:38.730> drive<00:03:39.030> so<00:03:39.209> this<00:03:39.330> isn't<00:03:39.570> going

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
of the flash drive so this isn't going

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.540 
of the flash drive so this isn't going
to<00:03:39.750> bend<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.140> fall<00:03:40.380> off<00:03:40.590> like<00:03:40.950> like<00:03:41.190> on<00:03:41.370> the

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
to bend and fall off like like on the

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.630 
to bend and fall off like like on the
sandisk<00:03:42.480> cruzer<00:03:42.810> one<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.440> so<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.190> saw<00:03:44.400> this<00:03:44.430> and

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
sandisk cruzer one and so I saw this and

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.949 
sandisk cruzer one and so I saw this and
I<00:03:44.760> thought<00:03:44.790> this<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.150> perfect<00:03:45.690> for<00:03:45.840> what<00:03:45.930> I

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
I thought this is perfect for what I

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.240 
I thought this is perfect for what I
want<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.200> do<00:03:46.380> I<00:03:46.590> want<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.920> put<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.100> on<00:03:47.160> my

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
want to do I want to put it on my

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.699 
want to do I want to put it on my
keychain<00:03:47.430> so<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:47.820> ordered<00:03:48.000> one<00:03:48.320> and<00:03:49.320> I<00:03:49.530> thought

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
keychain so I ordered one and I thought

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:50.870 
keychain so I ordered one and I thought
this<00:03:49.860> is<00:03:49.920> going<00:03:50.070> to<00:03:50.190> have<00:03:50.310> pretty<00:03:50.519> good<00:03:50.640> user

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
this is going to have pretty good user

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.490 
this is going to have pretty good user
experience<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.600> now<00:03:52.080> that<00:03:52.260> I've<00:03:52.350> been<00:03:52.440> using

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
experience and now that I've been using

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.360 
experience and now that I've been using
it<00:03:52.830> for<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:53.040> while<00:03:53.220> um<00:03:54.800> with<00:03:55.800> you<00:03:55.950> look<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.250> can

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
it for a while um with you look you can

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.190 
it for a while um with you look you can
you<00:03:56.430> compare<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.970> like<00:03:57.330> my<00:03:57.600> car<00:03:57.840> key<00:03:58.019> on<00:03:58.110> my

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
you compare it to like my car key on my

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.570 
you compare it to like my car key on my
key<00:03:58.380> chain<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.620> wouldn't<00:03:58.950> want<00:03:59.070> a<00:03:59.130> flash<00:03:59.310> drive

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
key chain I wouldn't want a flash drive

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.900 
key chain I wouldn't want a flash drive
that's<00:04:00.420> going<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.989> be<00:04:01.019> big<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.500> bulky<00:04:01.910> this

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
that's going to be big and bulky this

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.150 
that's going to be big and bulky this
keys<00:04:03.150> already<00:04:03.360> kind<00:04:03.720> of<00:04:03.810> big<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.080> bulky<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:04.680> um

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
keys already kind of big and bulky so um

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.820 
keys already kind of big and bulky so um
I<00:04:06.030> wouldn't<00:04:06.720> want<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:06.870> flash<00:04:07.050> trap<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.440> exceed

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
I wouldn't want a flash trap to exceed

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.370 
I wouldn't want a flash trap to exceed
the<00:04:08.040> size<00:04:08.250> of<00:04:08.400> this<00:04:08.519> key<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.030> so<00:04:09.810> this<00:04:09.959> one<00:04:10.200> is

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
the size of this key and so this one is

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.140 
the size of this key and so this one is
perfect<00:04:10.590> it's<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.130> same<00:04:11.310> color<00:04:11.519> as<00:04:11.700> my<00:04:11.730> key<00:04:12.000> so

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
perfect it's the same color as my key so

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.550 
perfect it's the same color as my key so
it<00:04:12.239> really<00:04:12.390> goes<00:04:12.600> on<00:04:12.840> my<00:04:12.989> keychain<00:04:13.200> really

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
it really goes on my keychain really

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.259 
it really goes on my keychain really
nicely<00:04:13.769> if<00:04:14.130> I<00:04:14.220> if<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.489> cared<00:04:14.730> about<00:04:14.790> that<00:04:15.120> which

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
nicely if I if I cared about that which

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.050 
nicely if I if I cared about that which
I<00:04:15.510> don't<00:04:15.989> really<00:04:16.169> but<00:04:16.290> some<00:04:16.470> people<00:04:16.739> might

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
I don't really but some people might

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.330 
I don't really but some people might
care<00:04:18.060> about<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.479> it<00:04:18.780> going<00:04:19.109> with<00:04:19.290> the<00:04:19.320> keys<00:04:19.620> but

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
care about it it going with the keys but

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.130 
care about it it going with the keys but
it's<00:04:20.519> really<00:04:20.669> a<00:04:20.790> perfect<00:04:21.180> size<00:04:21.419> even<00:04:21.959> when

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
it's really a perfect size even when

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.400 
it's really a perfect size even when
it's<00:04:22.289> not<00:04:22.940> retracted<00:04:23.940> it's<00:04:24.840> still<00:04:25.140> smaller

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
it's not retracted it's still smaller

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.440 
it's not retracted it's still smaller
than<00:04:25.580> my<00:04:26.580> biggest

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
than my biggest

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.380 
than my biggest
key<00:04:27.630> so<00:04:28.250> it<00:04:29.250> fits<00:04:29.580> really<00:04:29.730> nicely<00:04:30.000> on<00:04:30.300> my

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
key so it fits really nicely on my

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.100 
key so it fits really nicely on my
keychain<00:04:30.630> um<00:04:31.310> it's<00:04:32.310> really<00:04:32.640> it's<00:04:33.390> plastic<00:04:33.990> but

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
keychain um it's really it's plastic but

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.830 
keychain um it's really it's plastic but
it<00:04:34.140> has<00:04:34.380> again<00:04:34.710> this<00:04:34.830> metal<00:04:35.580> casing<00:04:36.030> so<00:04:36.270> it's

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
it has again this metal casing so it's

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.620 
it has again this metal casing so it's
really<00:04:37.140> durable<00:04:37.940> yeah<00:04:38.940> just<00:04:39.120> I<00:04:39.270> don't<00:04:39.330> feel

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
really durable yeah just I don't feel

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.720 
really durable yeah just I don't feel
like<00:04:39.810> this<00:04:40.050> is<00:04:40.230> going<00:04:40.410> to<00:04:40.620> break<00:04:40.800> off<00:04:41.070> that

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
like this is going to break off that

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.050 
like this is going to break off that
it's<00:04:41.910> it's<00:04:42.420> stiff<00:04:42.810> enough<00:04:42.990> here<00:04:43.290> when<00:04:43.500> you're

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
it's it's stiff enough here when you're

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.670 
it's it's stiff enough here when you're
pulling<00:04:45.060> it<00:04:45.240> out<00:04:45.360> that<00:04:46.050> it's<00:04:46.320> not<00:04:46.440> going<00:04:46.590> to

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
pulling it out that it's not going to

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.320 
pulling it out that it's not going to
just<00:04:47.190> do<00:04:47.310> that<00:04:47.430> on<00:04:47.580> its<00:04:47.760> own<00:04:47.850> so<00:04:47.910> it's<00:04:48.240> not

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
just do that on its own so it's not

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.890 
just do that on its own so it's not
going<00:04:48.450> to<00:04:48.540> be<00:04:48.630> like<00:04:48.720> in<00:04:48.780> your<00:04:49.050> pocket<00:04:49.470> and<00:04:49.590> um

going to be like in your pocket and um

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.400 
going to be like in your pocket and um
come<00:04:51.900> out<00:04:52.080> of<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.860> casing<00:04:53.070> there<00:04:53.340> so<00:04:53.640> it's

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
come out of the casing there so it's

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.340 
come out of the casing there so it's
that's<00:04:55.410> just<00:04:55.560> really<00:04:55.710> good<00:04:55.980> um<00:04:57.080> so<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:58.110> feel

good user experience in a lot of ways it

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.770 
good user experience in a lot of ways it
the<00:05:04.620> engineering<00:05:05.190> of<00:05:05.280> it<00:05:05.430> obviously<00:05:05.630> make<00:05:06.630> it

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
the engineering of it obviously make it

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.940 
the engineering of it obviously make it
more<00:05:06.900> durable<00:05:07.490> I<00:05:08.490> haven't<00:05:09.240> seen<00:05:09.480> any<00:05:09.950> extreme

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
more durable I haven't seen any extreme

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.260 
more durable I haven't seen any extreme
marketing<00:05:11.400> on<00:05:11.520> this<00:05:11.730> i<00:05:11.880> feel<00:05:12.030> like<00:05:12.180> the

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
marketing on this i feel like the

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.190 
marketing on this i feel like the
sandisk<00:05:12.750> one<00:05:13.050> is<00:05:13.320> marketed<00:05:13.920> really<00:05:14.160> well<00:05:14.370> and

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
sandisk one is marketed really well and

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.530 
sandisk one is marketed really well and
there's<00:05:16.200> i<00:05:16.530> think<00:05:17.430> people<00:05:17.700> like<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.300> have<00:05:18.480> that

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
there's i think people like to have that

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.430 
there's i think people like to have that
one<00:05:18.960> but<00:05:19.560> um<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:20.360> saw<00:05:21.360> this<00:05:21.510> that<00:05:22.020> a<00:05:22.050> friend<00:05:22.320> had

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
one but um I saw this that a friend had

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.620 
one but um I saw this that a friend had
this<00:05:22.590> one<00:05:22.830> and<00:05:22.950> it<00:05:22.980> made<00:05:23.130> me<00:05:23.160> want<00:05:23.430> to<00:05:23.460> end<00:05:23.670> I

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
this one and it made me want to end I

would recommend it to anyone else too so

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.210 
would recommend it to anyone else too so
I<00:05:26.880> think<00:05:27.690> word-of-mouth<00:05:28.140> marketing<00:05:28.290> and<00:05:29.100> just

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
I think word-of-mouth marketing and just

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.250 
I think word-of-mouth marketing and just
the<00:05:29.820> fact<00:05:29.850> that<00:05:30.120> people<00:05:30.450> like<00:05:30.630> to<00:05:30.840> use<00:05:30.870> the

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
the fact that people like to use the

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.470 
the fact that people like to use the
drive<00:05:31.500> speaks<00:05:31.920> a<00:05:32.070> lot<00:05:32.190> for<00:05:32.460> it<00:05:32.580> um<00:05:33.620> the

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
drive speaks a lot for it um the

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.600 
drive speaks a lot for it um the
aesthetic<00:05:36.480> design<00:05:36.660> of<00:05:37.050> it<00:05:37.230> again<00:05:37.830> it's<00:05:38.070> it's

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610
