00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
part in the trailer but um there's a

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.479 
part in the trailer but um there's a
couple<00:02:45.510> there's<00:02:46.049> a<00:02:46.139> 30-second<00:02:46.799> preview<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.340> it

on the Funimation Channel and actually

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.589 
on the Funimation Channel and actually
it<00:02:50.219> sounds<00:02:50.519> more<00:02:50.670> like<00:02:50.700> -<00:02:50.939> toca<00:02:51.299> from<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
it sounds more like - toca from the

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.360 
it sounds more like - toca from the
first<00:02:51.810> episode<00:02:51.930> today<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.439> Lima<00:02:52.769> Bridge<00:02:52.950> so<00:02:53.340> I

of<00:04:56.889> rainy<00:04:57.250> and<00:04:57.580> not<00:04:57.849> very<00:04:58.210> creative<00:04:58.569> I<00:04:59.139> could

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
of rainy and not very creative I could

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.409 
of rainy and not very creative I could
have<00:04:59.560> come<00:04:59.800> up<00:04:59.830> with<00:04:59.979> that<00:05:00.370> at<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.699> age<00:05:00.910> of<00:05:01.060> 10

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
have come up with that at the age of 10

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.550 
have come up with that at the age of 10
um<00:05:02.970> even<00:05:03.970> though<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.449> action<00:05:04.930> even<00:05:05.380> though

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
um even though the action even though

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.650 
um even though the action even though
basically<00:05:06.160> that's<00:05:06.729> the<00:05:06.819> entire<00:05:07.120> premise<00:05:07.539> of

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
basically that's the entire premise of

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.409 
basically that's the entire premise of
the<00:05:07.780> show<00:05:07.810> it's<00:05:08.710> still

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
the show it's still

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.070 
the show it's still
Funimation<00:05:10.419> could<00:05:10.569> have<00:05:10.660> come<00:05:10.780> up<00:05:10.900> with<00:05:10.930> a

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
Funimation could have come up with a

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.260 
Funimation could have come up with a
better<00:05:11.169> catchphrase<00:05:12.030> judging<00:05:13.030> by<00:05:13.210> the

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
better catchphrase judging by the

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.480 
better catchphrase judging by the
trailer<00:05:13.930> and<00:05:14.139> the<00:05:14.259> I<00:05:14.500> actually<00:05:14.710> did<00:05:15.130> try<00:05:15.370> to
