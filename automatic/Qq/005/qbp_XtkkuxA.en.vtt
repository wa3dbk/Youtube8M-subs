00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
models out here one of the comments that

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.920 
models out here one of the comments that
I<00:00:16.740> got<00:00:16.830> originally<00:00:17.340> was<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.810> an

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
I got originally was is this this is an

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.890 
I got originally was is this this is an
Air<00:00:19.170> Jordan<00:00:19.199> 2<00:00:19.760> and<00:00:20.760> if<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.119> guys<00:00:21.240> do<00:00:21.720> or

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
Air Jordan 2 and if you guys do or

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.420 
Air Jordan 2 and if you guys do or
didn't<00:00:22.199> know<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.039> obviously<00:00:23.160> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
didn't know this is obviously a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.560 
didn't know this is obviously a
different<00:00:23.670> model<00:00:23.760> than<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.060> Air<00:00:24.180> Jordan<00:00:24.210> two

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
different model than the Air Jordan two

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.839 
different model than the Air Jordan two
but<00:00:24.720> it's<00:00:24.840> very<00:00:24.930> similar<00:00:25.260> same<00:00:25.710> era<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.760> then

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
but it's very similar same era and then

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.820 
but it's very similar same era and then
they<00:00:27.029> retro<00:00:27.359> these<00:00:27.539> starting<00:00:28.170> last<00:00:28.349> year<00:00:28.560> and

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
they retro these starting last year and

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.439 
they retro these starting last year and
so<00:00:28.949> we've<00:00:29.609> seen<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.760> couple<00:00:29.910> other<00:00:30.179> colorways

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
so we've seen a couple other colorways

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.580 
so we've seen a couple other colorways
here<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.779> there<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.170> one<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.470> better

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
here in there this is one of the better

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.150 
here in there this is one of the better
ones<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.890> my<00:00:31.980> opinion<00:00:32.329> but<00:00:33.920> there<00:00:34.920> will<00:00:34.980> be<00:00:35.040> an

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
ones in my opinion but there will be an

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.260 
ones in my opinion but there will be an
on<00:00:35.250> foot<00:00:35.430> section<00:00:35.700> also<00:00:35.820> at<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.030> end<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.210> this

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
on foot section also at the end of this

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.360 
on foot section also at the end of this
video<00:00:36.450> for<00:00:36.630> those<00:00:36.930> curious<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.890> anyway<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.190> I

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
video for those curious but anyway so I

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.889 
video for those curious but anyway so I
wanted<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.910> show<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.090> guys<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> Air<00:00:39.510> Jordan<00:00:39.540> 2

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
wanted to show you guys the Air Jordan 2

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.450 
wanted to show you guys the Air Jordan 2
is<00:00:39.960> next<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> Python<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.250> kind<00:00:41.399> of

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
is next to the Python so you can kind of

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.160 
is next to the Python so you can kind of
get<00:00:41.579> an<00:00:41.700> idea<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.450> one's<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.780> hard<00:00:42.989> one<00:00:43.110> to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
get an idea this one's a hard one to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.830 
get an idea this one's a hard one to
tell<00:00:43.440> because<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.309> entire<00:00:44.640> upper<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.210> one

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
tell because the entire upper is one

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.860 
tell because the entire upper is one
print<00:00:46.370> so<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.399> can't<00:00:47.760> really<00:00:47.940> get<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
print so you can't really get like the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.049 
print so you can't really get like the
idea<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.590> differences<00:00:49.980> between<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
idea of the differences between this and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.209 
idea of the differences between this and
maybe<00:00:51.149> some<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.510> other<00:00:51.629> models<00:00:52.219> obviously

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
maybe some of the other models obviously

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.240 
maybe some of the other models obviously
the<00:00:53.760> air<00:00:53.969> here<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:55.079> nice<00:00:55.320> indicator<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.039> it

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the air here is a nice indicator that it

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.610 
the air here is a nice indicator that it
is<00:00:56.280> Nike<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.629> then<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.230> see<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.500> says

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
is Nike and then you can see it says

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.450 
is Nike and then you can see it says

it's a nice material on this kind of
Python<00:01:14.850> print<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.350> difference<00:01:16.710> between

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
Python print but the difference between

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.210 
Python print but the difference between
the<00:01:17.130> two<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.939> pretty<00:01:18.270> significant<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.960> mean

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
the two is is pretty significant I mean

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.499 
the two is is pretty significant I mean
the<00:01:20.220> white<00:01:20.369> leather<00:01:20.580> part<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.030> pretty<00:01:21.270> cheap

the white leather part is pretty cheap
white<00:01:22.259> leather<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:23.130> material<00:01:23.640> right<00:01:23.759> here<00:01:23.939> I

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
white leather this material right here I

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.510 
white leather this material right here I
would<00:01:24.450> say<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.720> kind<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:24.990> premium<00:01:25.400> but<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
would say is kind of premium but you

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.980 
would say is kind of premium but you
could<00:01:26.670> see<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> white<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.390> toe<00:01:27.570> box<00:01:27.810> area

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
could see the white on the toe box area

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.289 
could see the white on the toe box area
is<00:01:28.229> pretty<00:01:28.470> pretty<00:01:28.799> shabby<00:01:29.070> that's<00:01:30.060> one

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
is pretty pretty shabby that's one

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.760 
is pretty pretty shabby that's one
reason<00:01:30.509> why<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.259> because<00:01:31.290> it's

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
reason why I like this is because it's

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.880 
reason why I like this is because it's
the<00:01:32.189> whole<00:01:32.310> entire<00:01:32.640> thing<00:01:32.759> has<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.890> this

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the whole entire thing has this this

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.859

laces on this one I know they did
shoveled<00:01:40.950> right<00:01:41.100> now<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:41.520> these<00:01:42.180> are<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the off-white look on this one as well

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.440 
the off-white look on this one as well
the<00:01:49.079> soles<00:01:49.759> exactly<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> same<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.180> both<00:01:51.329> of

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the soles exactly the same on both of

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.960 
the soles exactly the same on both of
these<00:01:51.540> models<00:01:51.780> as<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.770> see<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
these models as you can see the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.300 
these models as you can see the
comparison<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.079> Air<00:01:55.229> Jordan<00:01:55.259> 2<00:01:55.740> however

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
comparison to the Air Jordan 2 however

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.219 
comparison to the Air Jordan 2 however
you<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:56.850> see<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> model<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.630> pretty

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
you can see that the model is pretty

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.230 
you can see that the model is pretty
similar<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.950> soles<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.729> only<00:01:59.909> difference

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
similar to the soles the only difference

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.260 
similar to the soles the only difference
is<00:02:00.649> obviously<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.860> stars<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.909> little<00:02:03.180> bit

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
is obviously the stars and a little bit

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.880 
is obviously the stars and a little bit
of<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.390> pattern<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:04.259> different<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:04.740> it's

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
of the pattern is is different but it's

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.620 
of the pattern is is different but it's
fundamentally<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:06.090> pretty<00:02:06.270> much<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.479> same

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
fundamentally it's pretty much the same

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.330 
fundamentally it's pretty much the same
you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.810> see<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.049> Jordan<00:02:07.439> versus<00:02:07.710> Nike<00:02:08.190> on

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
you can see the Jordan versus Nike on

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.550 
you can see the Jordan versus Nike on
the<00:02:08.759> bottom<00:02:09.060> as<00:02:09.209> well<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.690> then<00:02:10.200> some<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.500> the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
the bottom as well and then some of the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.410 
the bottom as well and then some of the
designs<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.790> little<00:02:12.000> bit<00:02:12.090> different

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
designs is just a little bit different

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.970 
designs is just a little bit different
but<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.200> could<00:02:13.500> see<00:02:13.650> that

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
but you could see that

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.530 
but you could see that
-<00:02:14.190> has<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.730> bumps<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.269> back<00:02:15.390> as<00:02:15.720> well<00:02:15.959> and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
- has the bumps on the back as well and

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.080 
- has the bumps on the back as well and
just<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.690> different<00:02:19.049> layout<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.760> midsole

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
just a different layout the the midsole

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.550 
just a different layout the the midsole
is<00:02:21.209> also<00:02:21.450> different<00:02:21.690> as<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:21.930> can<00:02:22.049> see<00:02:22.200> side<00:02:22.440> by

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
is also different as you can see side by

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.199 
is also different as you can see side by
side<00:02:22.970> maybe<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.090> do<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.170> make<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.319> easier

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
side maybe I do this to make it easier

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.100 
side maybe I do this to make it easier
side<00:02:27.209> by<00:02:27.360> side<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.659> mid<00:02:27.810> soles<00:02:27.989> are

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
side by side the mid soles are

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.309 
side by side the mid soles are
completely<00:02:28.470> different<00:02:29.450> but<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> opéra<00:02:30.840> there

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
completely different but the opéra there

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.570 
completely different but the opéra there
was<00:02:31.410> quite<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.680> bit<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.860> similarities<00:02:32.370> as<00:02:32.489> you

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
was quite a bit of similarities as you

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.910 
was quite a bit of similarities as you
can<00:02:32.700> see<00:02:32.879> between<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.930> cuts<00:02:34.140> as<00:02:34.379> you<00:02:34.680> can<00:02:34.799> see

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
can see between the cuts as you can see

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.729 
can see between the cuts as you can see
right<00:02:35.129> here<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.879> here<00:02:36.660> they<00:02:37.379> look<00:02:37.560> fairly

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
right here and here they look fairly

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.069 
right here and here they look fairly
similar<00:02:38.330> this<00:02:39.330> one<00:02:39.510> goes<00:02:39.660> all<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.900> way<00:02:39.989> down

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
similar this one goes all the way down

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.399 
similar this one goes all the way down
to<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.470> point<00:02:40.769> this<00:02:40.950> one<00:02:41.129> does<00:02:41.280> not<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:43.230> there's

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
to a point this one does not so there's

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:44.809 
to a point this one does not so there's
some<00:02:43.560> some<00:02:43.890> similarities<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.489> some

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
some some similarities to some

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.970 
some some similarities to some
definitely<00:02:45.360> or<00:02:45.599> not<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:46.530> can<00:02:46.650> see<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.860> toe

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
definitely or not you can see the toe

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.880 
definitely or not you can see the toe
box<00:02:47.220> area<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:48.239> stitching<00:02:48.660> kind<00:02:49.049> of<00:02:49.200> similar

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
box area the stitching kind of similar

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.680 
box area the stitching kind of similar
kind<00:02:50.129> of<00:02:50.190> different<00:02:50.660> as<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.840> can<00:02:51.959> see<00:02:52.200> there

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
kind of different as you can see there

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.030 
kind of different as you can see there
and<00:02:54.690> all<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.410> all<00:02:55.500> it's<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.799> mean<00:02:55.920> it's

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
and all in all it's I mean it's

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.430 
and all in all it's I mean it's
obviously<00:02:56.370> just<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:57.060> different<00:02:57.329> model<00:02:57.450> but<00:02:57.750> for

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
obviously just a different model but for

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.750 
obviously just a different model but for
those<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.590> don't<00:02:58.920> really<00:02:59.099> like<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.549> Air
