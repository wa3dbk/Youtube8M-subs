00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.140
 good to all 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:08.889
 sorry for the voice but it is that they are 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.110
 the 11 am and hits me madrugÃ³n 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.270
 to be able to come here to the class that 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.280
 come out he gave me in conditions that is 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.660
 your little things that you already have to start 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.580
 take into account in the acknowledgments 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.580
 but that every moment 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.000
 in today's class we're going to do the one 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.070
 arm in arm crawl on one arm a 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.510
 crawl arm is not exactly like the 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.120
 dead point the death point of crawl 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.800
 although we make an arm followed by another 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.930
 arm the two arms we have them 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.250
 forward in the exercise of an arm in 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.470
 arms let's have the arm that we 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.780
 move down attached to the body is worth 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.640
 basically the only thing that is very simple 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.699
 we have to do is go arm-wrestling 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.010
 with one arm while the other arm 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:55.190
 stays attached to the body seems easy 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.800
 but this is the good exercise of the 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.079
 more complicated techniques than there are for 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.520
 own experience that I bring a 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.800
 Lots of water while I learned to do 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.630
 this exercise and because when he sent it 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.280
 to the students I realize that they 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.050
 it costs a lot of work to be swallowed 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.080
 middle pool and so on 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.020
 good the beginning 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.480
 we go there with our heads in the water 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.670
 an arm attached to the body and we're going to 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.110
 starting we're going to start moving the 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.400
 right arm for example 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.710
 if in the dead center of crawl what is 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.840
 was about stopping the cyclicity of 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.610
 magician here we are going to try that the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.500
 Cyclicity is constant, although 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.360
 let's go alone with one arm we 're 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.430
 moving only one arm and the other 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.930
 arm stays attached to the body is worth it 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.390
 you know that the arm has to go bent 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.310
 outside folded inside and doing 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.380
 the grip pull on that garrett and with 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.540
 push is worth this arm exercise 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.550
 an arm will allow me to have a lot 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.080
 more freedom when doing the role 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.060
 gone that you already know that one of the parties 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.650
 most important of the crawl and back 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.550
 of asymmetrical styles 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.950
 ok then I'll go every time I give 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.979
 a stroke I will facilitate and 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.690
 favoring that role of embrace gone that 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.640
 I'm interested for the crawl and for the 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.090
 back in short what you have to 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.860
 try is a normal croft lara just 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.810
 that with an arm as if we did not have to 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.390
 this arm but let's take a stroke 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.080
 ghost when I breathe good we're going to 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.630
 do a progression of exercises 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.340
 I already do an exercise now we have 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.010
 more advanced also that already 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.840
 I will explain later but in principle 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.510
 as I've been doing for years 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.340
 Exercise is as follows 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.380
 let's do the first exercise that 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.590
 let's learn is going to be an arm a 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.900
 arm 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.180
 breathing towards the arm side of 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.859
 we move 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.049
 if we go with the right bass and the other 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.490
 grafo stays here still let's go 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.000
 breathing 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.880
 next to 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.170
 from the arm of modern 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.380
 when we are going to breathe if you give 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.450
 account comes a time when 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.760
 you need to take out your arm to breathe 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.930
 if I breathe to the right while the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.890
 uphill I can not get my arm out 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.520
 because it would touch me we have here the phase 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.510
 shooting 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.790
 whereas when you take off your head 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.590
 to breathe 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.540
 what happens is that if we are giving 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.450
 strokes constantly and breathing 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.219
 to the side if I do not get to put another 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.140
 once the head in the center 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:26.150
 I usually go away a lot for the 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.010
 sides I'm diverting a lot from the swim 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.910
 the ideal would be to breathe every two 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.730
 strokes 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.830
 I do not breathe and the second when the steam 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.180
 here but yes 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.180
 respite and the 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.610
 so it's easier to master and 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.280
 dosing the breath if you like 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.380
 a lot of work at first breathing like this 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.540
 because we lack air for the face 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.850
 every stroke there is at least at least 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.910
 the basic emotions 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.330
 when I do a long in this way 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.330
 I go like crazy 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.120
 breathing every stroke 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.950
 or breathing each stroke as much 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.980
 important of this one arm exercise 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.620
 an arm is to favor the roll and do it worth 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.630
 the other arm has to go giving a 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.090
 ghostly stroke is not standing still 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.130
 there trying only to give the 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.860
 strokes and I am say with the body 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.150
 rigid and breathing with his head like that and 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.020
 making the rare posture but that 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.830
 it has to be the whole movement 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:31.630
 dynamic so that when I give the 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.409
 arm stroke the other arm enters 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.019
 and it goes wrong 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:37.939
 and I'm giving that role gone while I go 

00:04:36.019 --> 00:04:40.099
 giving the hugging independently 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:42.289
 that he breathes remember that 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.969
 breathing in crawl is simply 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.469
 accompany the movement of the trunk and 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:48.020
 comes out the head is not leave the trunk 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:50.110
 stand still and throw your head to the side 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.720
 you can not here 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.880
 and then here it comes out and I pretend 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.060
 the ghost hugged her so that if 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:02.610
 you realize although I go like that is what 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.610
 same as the stroke starts 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:18.020
 Like the other grace, I'm still giving 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:20.830
 strokes and to follow the full swim 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.830
 Where i want 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.370
 always favoring this role edo
