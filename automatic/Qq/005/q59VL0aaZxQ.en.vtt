00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
who came up with that I see that's what

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.949 
who came up with that I see that's what
I<00:03:10.079> didn't<00:03:10.560> put<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.769> writer<00:03:11.100> home<00:03:11.570> yeah<00:03:12.570> I<00:03:12.600> think

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
I didn't put a writer home yeah I think

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:13.970 
I didn't put a writer home yeah I think
that's<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.350> reason<00:03:13.470> why<00:03:13.620> there<00:03:13.859> was<00:03:13.950> no

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
that's the reason why there was no

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.280 
that's the reason why there was no
writer<00:03:14.549> credited<00:03:15.090> because<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.660> guess<00:03:15.959> it<00:03:16.200> would

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
writer credited because I guess it would

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.460 
writer credited because I guess it would
be<00:03:16.320> uh<00:03:16.440> some<00:03:17.160> controversy<00:03:17.910> but<00:03:18.090> it's<00:03:18.239> like

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
be uh some controversy but it's like

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.590 
be uh some controversy but it's like
that's<00:03:19.470> just<00:03:19.739> not<00:03:19.980> even<00:03:20.220> funny<00:03:20.609> I<00:03:20.730> mean<00:03:21.000> don't
