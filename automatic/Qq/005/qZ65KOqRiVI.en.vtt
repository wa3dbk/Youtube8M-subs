00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
what they're planning to do so I just

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.350 
what they're planning to do so I just
recall<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.160> moment<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.550> recall<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:33.210> saw

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
recall in the moment I recall we saw

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.410 
recall in the moment I recall we saw
them<00:00:33.540> both<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:34.200> saw<00:00:34.320> them<00:00:34.500> toppling<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.210> it<00:00:36.210> was

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
them both we saw them toppling so it was

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.780 
them both we saw them toppling so it was
too<00:00:36.540> late<00:00:36.710> it's<00:00:37.710> not<00:00:37.890> where<00:00:38.070> your<00:00:38.250> problems

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
too late it's not where your problems

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.549 
too late it's not where your problems
early<00:00:39.149> came<00:00:39.390> from<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.840> think<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.260> fact<00:00:40.469> that

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
early came from you think the fact that

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.500 
early came from you think the fact that
you<00:00:40.860> were<00:00:41.520> planning<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:41.969> doing<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.300> lane

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
you were planning on doing that lane

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.119 
you were planning on doing that lane
swap<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.050> had<00:00:43.230> being<00:00:43.559> up<00:00:43.680> against<00:00:44.040> that

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
swap and that had being up against that

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.889 
swap and that had being up against that
Lane<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.550> then<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.850> all<00:00:45.120> kind<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.750> went

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
Lane and then I all kind of went

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.209 
Lane and then I all kind of went
downhill<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> early<00:00:46.739> game<00:00:46.890> from<00:00:47.039> there

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
downhill for the early game from there

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.979 
downhill for the early game from there
yeah<00:00:47.640> pretty<00:00:47.820> much<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.270> game<00:00:48.420> plan<00:00:48.570> was<00:00:48.809> to

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
yeah pretty much the game plan was to

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.720 
yeah pretty much the game plan was to
lane<00:00:49.170> swap<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.559> everything<00:00:50.250> was<00:00:50.370> based<00:00:50.579> off

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
lane swap and everything was based off

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.689 
lane swap and everything was based off
that<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.270> when<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.379> didn't<00:00:52.680> no<00:00:53.219> one<00:00:53.250> knew<00:00:53.550> what

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
that so when we didn't no one knew what

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.119 
that so when we didn't no one knew what

playing teams through rotations through
team<00:01:16.830> play<00:01:17.040> well<00:01:17.990> it's<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.229> more<00:01:19.380> fun<00:01:21.950> good

comic relief we need that after that
long<00:01:26.220> game<00:01:26.520> no<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.060> honestly<00:01:27.570> there<00:01:27.780> must<00:01:27.990> be

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
long game no but honestly there must be

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.140 
long game no but honestly there must be
something<00:01:28.619> because<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> pattern<00:01:29.909> for

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
something because it is a pattern for

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.640 
something because it is a pattern for
you<00:01:30.270> guys<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.720> guys<00:01:30.869> know<00:01:31.170> how<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.409> play

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
you guys that you guys know how to play

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.440 
you guys that you guys know how to play
when<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:31.920> comes<00:01:32.130> down<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.610> wire<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.150> just

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
when it comes down to the wire it just

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.120 
when it comes down to the wire it just
takes<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.869> while<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.200> get<00:01:34.320> started<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.890> every

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
takes a while to get started in every

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.010 
takes a while to get started in every
game<00:01:35.280> well<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.610> think<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.390> goes<00:01:36.600> back<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
game well I think it goes back to the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.230 
game well I think it goes back to the
plan<00:01:37.290> because<00:01:37.619> we<00:01:38.159> had<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> solid<00:01:38.610> plan<00:01:38.909> really

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
plan because we had a solid plan really

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.390 
plan because we had a solid plan really
good<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.750> would<00:01:39.900> definitely<00:01:40.710> win<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.130> game<00:01:41.280> if

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
good we would definitely win the game if

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.960 
good we would definitely win the game if
we<00:01:41.430> follow<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.540> then<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:44.490> fact<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.820> we

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
we follow this and then the fact that we

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.760 
we follow this and then the fact that we
couldn't<00:01:45.210> land<00:01:45.420> swap<00:01:45.630> ruined<00:01:46.020> everything<00:01:46.320> so
