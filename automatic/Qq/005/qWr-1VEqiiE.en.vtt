00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello to all of the board offers a 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.990
 punk nail art to achieve this effect 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.849
 marble and very easily and small 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.420
 fast flowers you can do at 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.420
 varnish 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.650
 to make our trees and you do not have 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.750
 need only film paper so it's 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.210
 cellophane paper that I crumpled then 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.130
 that everyone has one at home I 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.130
 then took some polish that I'm going 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.570
 lay on a dry white base and so 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.099
 then you take some nail polish 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.900
 any text that secure it 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.430
 We just let them go together you 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.710
 put drops everywhere 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.290
 by superimposing them too why not and 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.450
 just tap lightly with this 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.180
 crumpled paper and so that will give in 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.950
 effect a little marbled or wrinkled after 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.629
 results really vary depending 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.149
 colors that you will choose 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.340
 so there I make them I put varnish 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.710
 I tap a little bit more you have 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.750
 tapping the nato plus it's going to mix the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.929
 varnish and make a uniform rendering 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.609
 so it's up to you to choose in fact we can 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.039
 also do it at the end of the nails 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.510
 so kind of french manicure so 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.400
 I put a little bit and I tap 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.290
 slightly while going up a little 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.390
 little towards criticism hull i take 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.370
 then this superb top coat lm 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.930
 glitter cosmetics and I 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.240
 apply it on top to standardize 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.369
 the result is that it shelters a little bit 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.960
 for the little Japanese flowers you 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.220
 need a fine brush so you 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.110
 can you take a brush that you 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.229
 resize or for example an old eye 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.240
 liner and polish and then each 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.979
 petal is going to be composed of two traits 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.430
 as you see so in fact we do 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.619
 kinds of v who come together 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.170
 so in the center so every time I 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.600
 do it dv so you have to press the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.369
 brush and pick up the brush so 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.310
 it's a little bulging on 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.710
 the sides for it to give a shape to 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.530
 the flower be pretty enough and so 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.299
 I make four or five petals in 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.579
 next depending on the place you 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.479
 have and here is the result I applied 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.159
 my top coat 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.899
 I hope this little video you 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.969
 will have pleased and will have given you ideas 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.310
 for back to school since you go 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.010

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.910
