00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.830 
switch on the very back of the connector
and<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.740> switches<00:01:53.310> from<00:01:53.490> analog<00:01:54.060> TV<00:01:54.329> to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
and that switches from analog TV to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.590 
and that switches from analog TV to
high-definition<00:01:55.320> TV<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.369> lot<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.180> times<00:01:57.390> when

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
high-definition TV a lot of times when

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.300 
high-definition TV a lot of times when
people<00:01:57.659> take<00:01:58.049> their<00:01:58.229> xboxes<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.189> out

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
people take their xboxes in and out

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.249 
people take their xboxes in and out
though<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.579> actually<00:01:59.759> bump<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.509> switch<00:02:00.899> to

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
though I actually bump that switch to

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.350 
though I actually bump that switch to
one<00:02:01.649> or<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.100> other<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.640> then<00:02:02.850> they<00:02:03.000> get<00:02:03.119> no

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
one or the other and then they get no

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.050 
one or the other and then they get no
picture<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.020> TV<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.549> an<00:02:05.759> easy<00:02:05.909> fix

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
picture on the TV so that is an easy fix

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.889 
picture on the TV so that is an easy fix
