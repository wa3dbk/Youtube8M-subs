00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.049
 from the cemetery with a Jew 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.049
 and the foreman of the mine 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.930

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.070
 here exercise Catholic repetition is 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.130
 Protestant 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.670
 in the Methodist then why not what 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.670
 they left buried 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.200
 then here is here they made their 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.450
 the English departed because when he 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.120
 They passed three days they can not 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.610
 intern then the desperate go to 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.640
 see the municipal president and ask him 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.890
 to give them a piece of land to 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.770
 make their headquarters but they do not 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.430
 they want anywhere they want the 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.430
 hill more 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.700
 then says one of them says to 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.460
 president and secretary they asked 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.040
 do we expose ourselves here but not what 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.500
 could be cut because there nothing more 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.899
 is in the middle of the earth what 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.299
 other is pure tepetate rock and not what 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.700
 they can serve castilo then they came back 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.680
 to go down with the Jew they stay with 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.799
 he here and others are going to see 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.799
 President 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.750
 in the relays it says they are doing 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.390
 here you are living 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.409
 they explain to them that they could not 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.270
 endure it because the only one that land 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.270
 if they are afraid that they go in the night 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.310
 the marbles but then departures 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.710
 president 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.430
 well on the hill below they think that 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.430
 they can not bury 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.230
 they come here they started to dig ask 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.740
 that is the time since the list is ready 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.960
 thing of the Jew they started to bury 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.720
 but when they're burying him he started 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.870
 rain the clouds gathered and there is 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.760
 a great storm looks like an Indian them 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.890
 they could no longer continue to throw dirt on the 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.350
 curve because the shot was filling 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.290
 of water they were already well wet 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.610
 one of them says the green to this dead 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.319
 he is so damned 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.800
 and now what are we going to do 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.460
 one of them meat 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.760
 and leave it like that 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.930
 with the morning we come early 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.990
 yes yes 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.960
 the other day that is presented 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.630
 they will not find it anymore because it shows 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.850
 emotion association dragged the skins and 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.190
 the earth and in wall shorts 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.830
 there was no sign where he had been 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.830
 they search around here they look over there 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.450
 and now that we're going 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.250
 from end to end 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.250
 yes 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.370
 ask the income 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.319
 and the English that nothing else tells us 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.319
 nothing people out there for years 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.290
 what the English do not 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.879
 then the English 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.879
 they agree 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.930
 when they are here one of them says that 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.150
 the name will be put to the song 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.300
 because the real of the models any 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.180
 minutes before 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.760
 we are Catholics we do not believe in the saints 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.380
 what name do we put 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.950
 let's put the dry name of the 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.690
 plane 1 they agreed but there was a 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.810
 English that was not from our 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.670
 observe 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:20.269
 and since I had not tuned in one of 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:24.370
 they tell me hear you who are here 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.370
 stopped what name would you like 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.460
 we are english 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.960
 we come to work the lines and many 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.160
 of us are going to die and we're going to 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.770
 arrive 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.070
 put English song as 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.800
 we 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.650
 and so they did they put the song of 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.220
 the centuries and the poor Jew because 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.140
 never ignore it completely it's going to 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.360
 end the world is not going to know where 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.789
 do you mean me 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.509
 how can he be here in the middle of this 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.509
 table about jazz 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:04.480
 and over there 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.480
 america and seasons 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.810
 and we would not be scrambled 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:16.990
 we are not upset if we find a 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:20.110
 tomb a completely rectangular box 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.520
 a simple painted paint drawers 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.520
 black with a person 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:31.599
 and he was in the middle of having a good time 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:31.599
 if some are young 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.970
 and then they did 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.389
 the clown is the only one who is so 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:51.449
 different than all with all the graves 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:54.510
 is the clown is the only one who is so 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.580
 different because he asked to be buried 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.030
 well because he is thanking 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.030
 Mexico 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.199
 the wine among the English miners 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:07.810
 strange circus that he started to walk 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:09.550
 the whole republic but one day he entered 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.310
 the nostalgia to see his friend the 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.680

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.300
 parking before being one of the 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.729
 patios of the girl of pains the 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.349

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:25.349
 but a great weighing prix 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.440

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:51.410
 appeared some 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:53.870
 cold and with its classic haze and asks 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.120
 to his friends and family that if he 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.520
 comes to die and they do some town or 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.360
 city in the republic that bring 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.360
 necessary 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.120
 then from piles friends and colleagues and 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.520
 If he gets to die, do not be buried 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.610
 like everyone who is oriented watching 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:14.880
 but going to the east already what 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.950
 bury in that way that means that 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.740
 he does not turn his back on mexico 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.380
 otherwise thank you that mexico has 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.970
 received with open arms and what 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.370
 that he can not do in his town 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.740
 england city to succeed because 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.930
 they despised him for being poor to whom 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.480
 Mexico gave him all the love and everything 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.790
 love is a thank you as a 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.470
 rebellion towards his people and he took 

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.870
 to reveal with theirs because what 

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.730
 they despised what the English humiliated 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.790
 because he belonged to a circus 

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.070
 clown 

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:49.980
 and immediately when he counted his 

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.980
 jokes because he was like a clown 

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.660
 that's why Christians 

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:03.730
 it can also be genetic 

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.730
 they have hidden well job 

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.180
