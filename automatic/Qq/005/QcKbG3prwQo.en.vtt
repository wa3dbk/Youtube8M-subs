00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 here are our teammates as well as the rest 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.860
 of the team to which join 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.250
 also the other teams of the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.839
 pack 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.500
 we wanted to react to the cases 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.109
 of doping that affected our training 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:26.250
 yesterday so we named that I do you 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.930
 to pass today we have pain we 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.480
 have trouble for our team our 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.800
 family but also for cycling 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.870
 French and the whole of cycling 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.329
 all these years to fight for 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.870
 restore our image again 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.210
 good to be tarnished by inconsistency 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.690
 20 of those who prefer to believe that in 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.960
 cheating 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.640
 we are bigger earlier rather than 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.620
 to have the humility to accept their 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.239
 weaknesses 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.829
 discredit again thrown on our 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.800
 sport 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.050
 she will deserve after so many years to 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.570
 fight against doping 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.220
 we will not give up despite the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.729
 feeling of helplessness that invades us 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.960
 sometimes the cheats of your fingers 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.600
 earth must be put out of the system 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.570
 and we hope that someday every 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.180
 competitors will understand that only 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.689
 performance gained through work and 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.700
 self- sacrificing self- sacrifice for 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.520
 millions of people who believe in us and 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.670
 we argue we're not going 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.869
 give up one thousand 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.820
 working hours of all 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.520
 business 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.610
 the thousands of kilometers traveled and 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.079
 the tons of sacrifices we made 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.210
 let's continue to do the job that 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.369
 we like 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.070
 we do not want to lower our heads and 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.710
 we will continue the fight because the 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.850
 truth is that this sport is beautiful and that 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.409
 the men and women who 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.270
 practice are upright for us the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.549
 peace the wound will take time to 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.689
 heal 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.490
 but because we received the 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.289
 public support 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.510
 from many of our fellow followers 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.430
 and our partners we are 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.380
