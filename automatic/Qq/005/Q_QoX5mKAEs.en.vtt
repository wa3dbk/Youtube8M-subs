00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
diesel fuel into the antifreeze for some

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.600 
diesel fuel into the antifreeze for some
reason<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.240> not<00:02:09.390> very<00:02:09.420> much<00:02:09.750> but<00:02:09.780> it's

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
reason and it's not very much but it's

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.680 
reason and it's not very much but it's
noticeable<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.730> that's<00:02:11.880> just<00:02:12.000> instead<00:02:12.600> of

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
noticeable and that's just instead of

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.060 
noticeable and that's just instead of
replacing<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.260> heads<00:02:13.470> or<00:02:13.740> doing<00:02:14.010> whatever

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
replacing the heads or doing whatever

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.640 
replacing the heads or doing whatever
have<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.459> do<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.880> guess<00:02:15.780> it's<00:02:15.930> injector<00:02:16.320> cups<00:02:16.530> is

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
have to do I guess it's injector cups is

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.240 
have to do I guess it's injector cups is
what<00:02:16.770> people<00:02:17.040> say<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:18.890> I'm<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.040> going<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.190> go
