 indestructible let's talk a little bit about the 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.190
 aromatherapy there are 4 oils that your sims 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.619

 of the states of boredom and 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.369
 provides a central state I have left 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.050
 a very important spoiler for the end 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.670
 of the video it is recommended that you close the 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.310
 window if you do not want it to spoil you 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.880

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.539
 line and I with the help of sheen speed and 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.399
 maris bear we took the whole afternoon of the 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.590
 launch to discover it even 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.630
 asking for help without very fast mauro 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.149
 graham that the lips happened and he 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.890
 they had fun watching us theorize at the end 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.420
 a little bit of logic or a little bit of looking at 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.099
 game files and we get it 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.080
 sure you want to keep seeing the 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.970
 video because you've wanted it there 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.950
 behind themselves' hooligans will 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.319
 have fun using the scent of acetone 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.940
 that smells fatal for it you have no 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.000
 have to have level 10 of the skill 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.190
 would be a scientist or secret agent 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.280
 criminal in level 10 of the race and 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.989
 be stingy mean or genius as you see is 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.239
 quite difficult to bump into 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.130
 chance when using this aroma all 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.200
 in the neighborhood they will feel very uncomfortable 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.299
 for a few hours for you to do a 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.799
 idea this is the official description that 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.930
 is this pest the whirlpool 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.060
 You can not deal with a substance as 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.830
 disgusting the tubazo seems to be 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.260
 spreading through the neighborhood may 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.970
 evacuate the area 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.500
 certainly the developers 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.840
 they have to have a good time at work 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.579
 love that they add things like that and this has 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.590
 been all I had to tell about the 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.840
