00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.200
 I'm going on you've seen our painters the face of their time by 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.200
 gianfelice facchetti and you know very well 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:17.359
 obviously hyacinth to which we asked some what is what 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.140
 let's see very soon the interview we need to present 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.140
 even a little special manual we see 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.960
 beautiful photos will present this that the manual of prostitution 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.699
 intellectual here is the famous domain press conference 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.070
 but on the other hand it was a bit of a call to arms in bed we say 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.300
 what everyone 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.129
 3 paid planned multiconto bu were studying were elected for years and me 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:41.830
 he was 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.879
 valadier riello of the same sea 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.100
 it later became 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.250
 nespresso entry into the giacomo 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.190
 beautiful beautiful work that these girls made these idol be a thing in 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.420
 common to see me carefully documented work 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.540
 which in my opinion was now the 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.530
 the merit of 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.010
 in the care of attention above all details and I believe that in some 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.260
 so it is also an incitement to the society itself not to not give up and 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
 especially now the moment when some processes fade 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.720
 they are in progress they reopen 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.260
 they are reliable 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.560
 d not give up numb a step because in any case time passes but 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.670
 but you must always stay in shape, guard 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.640
 citroem a little and a half in this thing. immigrant salami to tell you about the intercar 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.109
 I adore 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.260
 to add that we are witnessing the 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.870
 curious roman mount bastard on one side the old third-party media are always 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.490
 more atalanta fans as it happens in this case 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.810
 the fan blogs there is the submerged let's say so beautiful infomotori comes from the 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.850
 low that says things eh 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.020
 objective in some way ex udc 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.070
 this I believe is somehow the positive aspect in the network in this 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.160
 case that allows some way u 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.620
 no comparison discussion groups 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.480
 that maybe they would no longer have space because I challenge them anyway 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.450
 I don't know how many and which newspapers are willing to pay for reviewing a book by 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.450
 genus no I think of Lucian's lucky book of kaos editions 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.739
 I send in print several years before he broke out du bonheur te nessuno 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.849
 never re hello understanding 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.659
 obvious that somehow the network and has the possibility of 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.319
 talk about confronting each other on such a thing 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.579
 and the same, as in politics, there is therefore a desire for a 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:37.419
 comparison that in the serp in the relevant offices often does not happen because not 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:41.919
 we are interested in being listened to here it happens for the web to drink in some way then 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:46.269
 from the net the book link contents and bait take shape in a book 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.150
 something that remains of +1 nails somehow gives us the chance to get vaccinated 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.760
 for a fan in front of a football that may always be a predappio 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:54.610
 passion 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.730
 but those who follow make sacrifices to go and see the games vaccinated in 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.070
 sense of inquiring on your own xd you don't do it yourself for some broadcasts 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.319
 way to choose what to do 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.449
 I don't even get this aspect that the type if a few hours and more and more 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:12.969
 called to have the time only from homework and to be what it was to behave 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:17.389
 good that why is right of course but also some way to have a 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.269
 his tone 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.969
 is a good one for a series of things to be re right now to follow even with 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:27.010
 these are the obligations with respect to, place the tickets where he was going to 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.440
 here those and this seems to me that tom.it organizes a good thing for 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.439
 against rightly the fan said good I want you 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:39.599
 I do what I have to but I also want to be somehow 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.119
 listened to participate I want courier that my voice be heard 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:47.059
 that it is somehow reported to be teased exact
