00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
the gaming industry is going to change

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.460 
the gaming industry is going to change
over<00:00:19.250> the<00:00:19.369> next<00:00:19.400> couple<00:00:19.730> of<00:00:19.910> years<00:00:19.970> well<00:00:20.900> we

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
over the next couple of years well we

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.450 
over the next couple of years well we
all<00:00:21.619> know<00:00:21.650> that<00:00:21.890> always<00:00:22.369> on<00:00:22.820> DRM<00:00:23.270> is<00:00:24.140> a<00:00:24.529> mistake

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
all know that always on DRM is a mistake

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.960 
all know that always on DRM is a mistake
but<00:00:26.240> guess<00:00:26.540> what<00:00:26.810> more<00:00:27.710> developers<00:00:28.250> are<00:00:28.550> going

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
but guess what more developers are going

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.409 
but guess what more developers are going
to<00:00:29.060> be<00:00:29.180> using<00:00:29.329> this<00:00:29.689> new<00:00:30.320> tactic<00:00:30.890> to<00:00:31.419> combat

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
to be using this new tactic to combat

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.090 
to be using this new tactic to combat
piracy<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:33.370> well<00:00:34.370> after<00:00:35.150> seeing<00:00:36.100> blizzards

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
piracy and well after seeing blizzards

absolute<00:00:37.970> failure<00:00:38.239> of<00:00:38.600> diablo<00:00:39.200> 3<00:00:39.550> you<00:00:40.550> I'm

absolute failure of diablo 3 you I'm

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.930 
absolute failure of diablo 3 you I'm
actually<00:00:41.120> surprised<00:00:41.630> that<00:00:41.960> anyone<00:00:42.340> would<00:00:43.340> use

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
actually surprised that anyone would use

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.350 
actually surprised that anyone would use
always<00:00:44.540> on<00:00:44.720> DRM<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:45.710> would<00:00:46.610> essentially<00:00:47.090> make

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
always on DRM and would essentially make

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.380 
always on DRM and would essentially make
the<00:00:47.660> same<00:00:47.930> exact<00:00:48.500> mistake<00:00:48.830> I'm<00:00:49.790> talking<00:00:50.330> about

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
the same exact mistake I'm talking about

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.350 
the same exact mistake I'm talking about
yay<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:51.650> new<00:00:51.830> SimCity<00:00:52.280> that<00:00:52.940> came<00:00:53.150> out

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
yay and the new SimCity that came out

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.920 
yay and the new SimCity that came out
last<00:00:53.390> week<00:00:53.810> I<00:00:54.820> know<00:00:55.820> a<00:00:56.060> lot<00:00:56.270> of<00:00:56.330> people<00:00:56.480> say

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
last week I know a lot of people say

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.620 
last week I know a lot of people say
that<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.260> solution<00:00:57.770> to<00:00:57.800> always<00:00:58.340> on<00:00:58.550> DRM<00:00:58.820> is<00:00:59.180> to

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
that the solution to always on DRM is to

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.990 
that the solution to always on DRM is to
just<00:00:59.990> not<00:01:00.260> have<00:01:00.290> it<00:01:00.740> because<00:01:01.130> we've<00:01:01.310> seen<00:01:01.730> the

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
just not have it because we've seen the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.740 
just not have it because we've seen the
problems<00:01:02.510> that<00:01:02.600> it<00:01:02.900> causes<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:04.330> it<00:01:05.330> makes<00:01:05.630> me

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
problems that it causes and it makes me

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.960 
problems that it causes and it makes me
think<00:01:06.140> that<00:01:06.229> all<00:01:06.680> these<00:01:07.100> little<00:01:07.340> developers

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
think that all these little developers

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.240 
think that all these little developers
and<00:01:08.360> publishers<00:01:08.540> that<00:01:09.350> are<00:01:09.530> all<00:01:09.799> over<00:01:10.070> the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
and publishers that are all over the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.950 
and publishers that are all over the
place<00:01:10.280> that<00:01:11.119> are<00:01:11.270> thinking<00:01:11.600> about<00:01:11.689> using

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
place that are thinking about using

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.040 
place that are thinking about using
always<00:01:12.560> on<00:01:12.770> DRM<00:01:13.120> don't<00:01:14.120> learn<00:01:14.570> from<00:01:14.600> each

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
always on DRM don't learn from each

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.080 
always on DRM don't learn from each
other<00:01:15.320> which<00:01:15.800> probably<00:01:16.460> means<00:01:16.700> that<00:01:16.850> they're

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
other which probably means that they're

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.210 
other which probably means that they're
off<00:01:17.270> in<00:01:17.570> their<00:01:17.690> own<00:01:17.870> little<00:01:18.290> sequestered

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
off in their own little sequestered

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.640 
off in their own little sequestered
world<00:01:19.460> and<00:01:19.820> don't<00:01:20.390> go<00:01:20.540> outside<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.230> bounds<00:01:21.650> of

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
world and don't go outside the bounds of

world and don't go outside the bounds of
their<00:01:21.980> building<00:01:22.480> so<00:01:23.480> always<00:01:24.409> on<00:01:24.560> DRM<00:01:24.770> what

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
their building so always on DRM what

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.460 
their building so always on DRM what
does<00:01:25.850> that<00:01:25.880> mean<00:01:26.180> that<00:01:26.479> means<00:01:26.780> that<00:01:27.290> you

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
does that mean that means that you

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.810 
does that mean that means that you
always<00:01:27.710> have<00:01:28.040> to<00:01:28.190> have<00:01:28.220> an<00:01:28.460> internet

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
always have to have an internet

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.480 
always have to have an internet
connection<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.420> always<00:01:30.170> be<00:01:30.409> connected<00:01:30.650> to

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
connection and always be connected to

connection and always be connected to
the<00:01:31.700> server<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:32.659> can<00:01:32.840> play<00:01:33.110> your<00:01:33.380> game

the server so you can play your game
even<00:01:34.190> if<00:01:34.340> it's<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.729> single<00:01:35.300> player<00:01:35.570> game<00:01:36.100> that

even if it's a single player game that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.140 
even if it's a single player game that
is<00:01:37.400> really<00:01:38.390> stupid<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.650> we've<00:01:40.490> seen<00:01:40.850> the

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
is really stupid and we've seen the

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.080 
is really stupid and we've seen the
problems<00:01:41.630> that<00:01:41.720> it<00:01:42.020> causes<00:01:42.580> gamers<00:01:43.580> cannot

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
problems that it causes gamers cannot

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.450 
problems that it causes gamers cannot
connect<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.930> server<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.799> play<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.250> game

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
connect to the server to play the game

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.880 
connect to the server to play the game
because<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:47.240> server<00:01:47.510> gets<00:01:47.810> overloaded<00:01:48.650> with

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
because the server gets overloaded with

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.969 
because the server gets overloaded with
requests<00:01:49.820> causing<00:01:50.600> crashes<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:51.820> long<00:01:52.820> long

requests causing crashes and long long
long<00:01:55.180> wait<00:01:56.180> queues<00:01:56.830> but<00:01:57.830> there's<00:01:58.369> actually<00:01:58.970> a

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
long wait queues but there's actually a

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.300 
long wait queues but there's actually a
solution<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.440> this<00:02:00.650> and<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.990> way<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.979> fact

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
solution to this and the way the fact

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.179 
solution to this and the way the fact
that<00:02:04.430> no<00:02:04.820> one<00:02:05.030> has<00:02:05.630> actually<00:02:06.189> implemented

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
that no one has actually implemented

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.429 
that no one has actually implemented
this<00:02:07.280> or<00:02:07.520> even<00:02:07.700> thought<00:02:08.239> about<00:02:08.269> it<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:09.289> my

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:09.439 
this or even thought about it to my

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.369 
this or even thought about it to my
knowledge<00:02:10.420> it's<00:02:11.420> kind<00:02:11.689> of<00:02:11.840> astounding

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
knowledge it's kind of astounding

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.860 
knowledge it's kind of astounding
because<00:02:12.739> it's<00:02:12.860> an<00:02:12.950> easy<00:02:13.099> fix<00:02:13.510> this<00:02:14.510> is<00:02:14.689> how

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
because it's an easy fix this is how

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.120 
because it's an easy fix this is how

stays on connected to that server

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.550 
stays on connected to that server
constantly<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:35.240> can<00:02:35.390> already<00:02:35.600> see<00:02:36.050> what

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
constantly so you can already see what

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.220 
constantly so you can already see what
the<00:02:36.800> problem<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.550> there<00:02:38.240> more<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.080> more

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
the problem is there more and more

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.480 
the problem is there more and more
people<00:02:39.410> are<00:02:39.710> going<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.010> connect<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.400> that

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
people are going to connect to that

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.310 
people are going to connect to that
server<00:02:40.790> till<00:02:41.120> it's<00:02:41.300> filled<00:02:41.600> with<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.930> brim

they can't do what they want to do they

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.090 
they can't do what they want to do they

side of those servers who the people
made<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.290> game<00:03:00.440> their<00:03:00.740> servers<00:03:01.220> crash<00:03:01.760> and

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
made the game their servers crash and

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.730 
made the game their servers crash and
they<00:03:02.420> need<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.690> bring<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:03.080> back<00:03:03.260> up<00:03:03.320> because

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
they need to bring it back up because

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.290 
they need to bring it back up because
they're<00:03:04.130> just<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:04.640> overloaded<00:03:05.890> so<00:03:06.970> what<00:03:07.970> here

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
they're just so overloaded so what here

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.190 
they're just so overloaded so what here
is<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.810> solution<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:10.430> solution<00:03:10.760> is<00:03:11.200> having

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
is the solution the solution is having

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.640 
is the solution the solution is having
it<00:03:12.320> more<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.860> a<00:03:12.980> revolving<00:03:13.820> door<00:03:14.080> that's<00:03:15.080> all

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
it more of a revolving door that's all

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.380 
it more of a revolving door that's all
that<00:03:15.860> they<00:03:15.950> need<00:03:16.100> to<00:03:16.220> do<00:03:16.400> all<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.180> have<00:03:17.300> the

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
that they need to do all you have the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.680 
that they need to do all you have the
game<00:03:18.140> has<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:18.440> do<00:03:18.560> is<00:03:18.770> just<00:03:18.800> log<00:03:19.550> in<00:03:19.790> it<00:03:20.000> goes<00:03:20.540> to

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
game has to do is just log in it goes to

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.920 
game has to do is just log in it goes to
the<00:03:20.750> server<00:03:21.110> pings<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.370> server<00:03:22.760> says<00:03:23.060> hey<00:03:23.480> I'm

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
the server pings the server says hey I'm

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.490 
the server pings the server says hey I'm
an<00:03:24.350> authentic<00:03:24.950> copy<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:26.360> Serb<00:03:26.540> says<00:03:26.840> yes

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
an authentic copy and the Serb says yes

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.760 
an authentic copy and the Serb says yes
you<00:03:27.680> are<00:03:27.860> on<00:03:28.430> your<00:03:29.030> way<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.620> disconnects<00:03:30.620> it

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
you are on your way and disconnects it

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.740 
you are on your way and disconnects it
from<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.010> server<00:03:31.250> that's<00:03:31.970> all<00:03:32.240> it<00:03:32.270> needs<00:03:32.600> to

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
from the server that's all it needs to

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.040 
from the server that's all it needs to
do<00:03:33.110> and<00:03:33.700> so<00:03:34.700> this<00:03:34.820> way<00:03:35.030> there's<00:03:35.570> no<00:03:35.780> wait

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
do and so this way there's no wait

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.440 
do and so this way there's no wait
queues<00:03:36.410> because<00:03:36.860> nobody<00:03:37.250> is<00:03:37.459> sitting<00:03:37.820> on<00:03:38.060> the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
queues because nobody is sitting on the

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.530 
queues because nobody is sitting on the
server<00:03:38.750> playing<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.410> game<00:03:39.740> and<00:03:40.360> like<00:03:41.360> I<00:03:41.480> said

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
server playing the game and like I said

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.350 
server playing the game and like I said
these<00:03:41.840> are<00:03:41.980> single<00:03:42.980> player<00:03:43.280> games<00:03:43.820> for<00:03:44.270> the

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
these are single player games for the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.300 
these are single player games for the
most<00:03:44.570> part<00:03:44.870> you<00:03:45.410> don't<00:03:45.620> need<00:03:45.770> to<00:03:45.830> be<00:03:46.040> connected

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
most part you don't need to be connected

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.840 
most part you don't need to be connected
to<00:03:46.580> a<00:03:46.610> server<00:03:46.910> for<00:03:47.390> a<00:03:47.450> single<00:03:48.320> player<00:03:48.709> game

that is stupid and then what happens is

that is stupid and then what happens is
we're<00:03:55.489> going<00:03:55.610> to<00:03:55.700> have<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.630> soft<00:03:57.170> the

and you more clear than that but that's
my<00:07:09.840> solution<00:07:10.050> to<00:07:10.380> always<00:07:10.740> on<00:07:10.920> DRM<00:07:11.190> you<00:07:11.850> should

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.030 
my solution to always on DRM you should

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.570 
my solution to always on DRM you should
have<00:07:12.240> a<00:07:12.270> connection<00:07:12.750> that's<00:07:13.080> always<00:07:13.680> on<00:07:13.950> but

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.580 
have a connection that's always on but

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.270 
have a connection that's always on but
you<00:07:14.730> should<00:07:14.970> never<00:07:15.180> always<00:07:15.660> be<00:07:16.140> connected<00:07:16.440> to

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280
