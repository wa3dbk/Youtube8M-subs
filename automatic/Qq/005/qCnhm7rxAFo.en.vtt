defensive<00:01:29.790> midfield<00:01:30.180> player<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.720> know

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
defensive midfield player but you know

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.240 
defensive midfield player but you know
what<00:01:31.020> I'd<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.770> model<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.130> that

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
what I'd like to see the model in that

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.859 
what I'd like to see the model in that
role<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.490> know<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.909> think<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.329> Monon<00:01:33.630> would<00:01:33.720> be

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
role you know I think the Monon would be

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.080 
role you know I think the Monon would be
pretty<00:01:34.079> good<00:01:34.259> defensive<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.920> attacking<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:36.060> I

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
pretty good defensive and attacking so I

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.880 
pretty good defensive and attacking so I
think<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.900> think<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.200> should<00:01:37.380> give<00:01:37.500> them<00:01:37.650> all<00:01:37.770> in

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
think I think we should give them all in

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.649 
think I think we should give them all in
a<00:01:37.979> go<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.310> defensive<00:01:38.790> midfield<00:01:39.180> role<00:01:39.270> and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
a go in that defensive midfield role and

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.179 
a go in that defensive midfield role and
then<00:01:40.140> see<00:01:40.320> what<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> work<00:01:40.710> around<00:01:40.950> that

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
then see what we can work around that

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.850 
then see what we can work around that
