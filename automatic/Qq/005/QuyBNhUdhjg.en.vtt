 I am bad Japanese and welcome to the 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.029
 review in a new way and good if not 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.119
 this way as always not so useful but 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.840
 good works for certain games 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.770
 Light 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.920
 will jump and well this mode is not so 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.220
 useful but it's very cool ok 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.989
 this is a mod called red wool and 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.260
 what it gives us is wool of red color 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.770
 Mother 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.350
 no, that's not a motorcycle 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.800
 because the mod is called hayden gentlemen 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.170
 doors if there is a bastard diskeeper the capon 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.700
 well it's gentlemen this way this way 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.930
 a long time ago not to 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.010
 update ban is one really old 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.080
 presumed is one as they leave it the 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.610
 update because I do not know but right now 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.379
 again then what is 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.080
 basically does that it adds doors 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.140
 of any texture to our minecraft 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.869
 is for porsche is used in the forza 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.580
 Some feet install mind they have 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.830
 that putting two modes are two monks 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.690
 and there it comes in the page ok they put them in 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.420
 your folder we have ready and it is but good 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.460
 what do the first do for 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.500
 Bad character is a bit strange 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.380
 the truth but good the castle 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.690
 basically this bookseller are three and 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.540
 three and ready and this is going to give you the ied 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.399
 in turn that already just the root 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.190
 then you put it on the envelope 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.909
 texture that you want ok suppose it is 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.810
 the earth 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.810
 a table in the cloister 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.799
 and then basically it's going to give you 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.170
 doors for anything then well 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.880
 yes if you are going to make your world whatever 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.009
 It has a world of motorcycles that you want 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.100
 what do you want to do then already with this 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.250
 you are going to give a touch to more orderly beds 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.470
 I do not know why it does something else more 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.600
 most hidden secret I do not know just 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.600
 for what you want 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.970
 so basically this is the reason 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.399
 it's very short it's not a very very very 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.380
 extensive and good is very useful 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.560
 the truth beaconing great utility 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.830
 especially for example for for the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.420
 series to do hardcore I think that 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.319
 I'm going to put it in and it's going to put this in 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.269
 where I put the door is subsystem 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.650
 piston is the most subtle imagine 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.420
 have a door of these you have everything 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.420
 covered this one 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.730
 I think you have everything covered 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.730
 the air 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.380
 on earth as well as if it were 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.290
 that they take in fast and furious is in the 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.930
 when they went to the border which is what 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.280
 more than the engine but good gentlemen this 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.290
 It was all I hope you liked the 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.100
 super short mold and you already know for 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.100
 install it nothing else they put it in their if 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.110
 they have to install soccer chapÃ­n and 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.850
 from there they put the two worlds that there are in 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.510
 the page of your mods folder and you're done 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.510
 that now 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:26.739
 to give
