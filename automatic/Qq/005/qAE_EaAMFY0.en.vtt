00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Do you want to invest in production? 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.140
 from marmitex 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.929
 then check out a special subject that 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.870
 let's introduce now to take several 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.940
 questions you and aims to first 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.439
 start a business is necessary to buy 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.180
 some materials 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.920
 we see that there are several models of 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.840
 marmitex or mars the owner of this 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.460
 distributor in sao paulo any 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.349
 difference of each one that marks a 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.109
 change of aluminum than the closing 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.450
 manual is 18 is also exiting 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.850
 quite now has aluminum closure 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.829
 machine is also more practical in them it 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.450
 well to marmitex for me to start a 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.309
 business today started in marmitex 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.570
 today what I need and how much 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.910
 required 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.020
 I think a bundle of marmitex with 100 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.440
 units two packs of fork and knife 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.390
 two packets of napkin and one pound of 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.250
 transport bag right 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.930
 I spend it with this but it's more or less 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.090
 100 to 110 reais 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.800
 Now Viviane went to visit a 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.780
 house that decided to make money as 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.640
 emitex and she chose to hit here 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.460
 which closes manually 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.350
 that same visual she delivers more than 20 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.110
 meals per day 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.180
 It takes a lot of work to pack 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.830
 It's very simple every single pot of three 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.960
 minutes quickly 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.479
 and why did you decide to do more vtex 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.640
 because mine worked in the restaurant with 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.380
 My mother-in-law did not work right. 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.600
 then I decided to do at home because they do not 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.170
 you needed to invest how many 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.229
 in the beginning it was 250 buy the pots and 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.320
 food and return the return came 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.500
 less than a month 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.540
 and how much does each marmitex have to 8 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.380
 and the 9 with salad and the streets comes with 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:48.260
 dessert and what is the monthly billing 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:51.710
 is 3 thousand and the profit of 50 processes 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:56.150
 liked the tip so let's start one 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:59.000
 business investment and 350 real date 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:03.200
 bill about 3 thousand per month 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.280
 wants to know the profit is not 50% with the return 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.280
 very quickly
