okay now that we are all experts on what
prostate<00:00:04.680> glands<00:00:05.069> should<00:00:05.400> look<00:00:05.609> like<00:00:05.640> with

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
prostate glands should look like with

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.720 
prostate glands should look like with
this<00:00:06.690> being<00:00:07.020> relatively<00:00:07.710> normal<00:00:08.460> or

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
this being relatively normal or

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.390 
this being relatively normal or
hyperplastic<00:00:09.389> prostate<00:00:10.290> glands<00:00:10.620> within<00:00:11.070> here

hyperplastic prostate glands within here
and<00:00:11.990> this<00:00:12.990> being<00:00:13.200> cancer<00:00:13.889> all<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.519> way<00:00:15.120> up

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
and this being cancer all the way up

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.689 
and this being cancer all the way up
here<00:00:15.800> let<00:00:16.800> me<00:00:16.890> tell<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.100> about<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.279> guy<00:00:17.490> named

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
here let me tell you about a guy named

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.910 
here let me tell you about a guy named
Gleason<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.510> don't<00:00:18.840> know<00:00:19.020> who<00:00:19.199> he<00:00:19.380> was<00:00:19.619> I'm

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
Gleason I don't know who he was I'm

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.670 
Gleason I don't know who he was I'm
sorry<00:00:20.220> if<00:00:20.400> I'm<00:00:20.580> showing<00:00:20.910> him<00:00:21.060> disrespect<00:00:21.840> but

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
sorry if I'm showing him disrespect but

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.720 
sorry if I'm showing him disrespect but
every<00:00:23.400> time<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> pathologist<00:00:24.539> examines

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
every time a pathologist examines

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.640 
every time a pathologist examines
prostate<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.000> there's<00:00:27.330> cancer<00:00:27.630> he<00:00:28.349> has<00:00:28.470> to

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
prostate and there's cancer he has to

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.490 
prostate and there's cancer he has to
think<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:29.010> mr.<00:00:29.279> Gleason<00:00:29.939> not<00:00:30.570> Jackie<00:00:30.929> Gleason

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
think of mr. Gleason not Jackie Gleason

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.819 
think of mr. Gleason not Jackie Gleason
but<00:00:31.679> probably<00:00:32.130> some<00:00:32.369> guy<00:00:32.520> dr.<00:00:32.910> Gleason<00:00:33.829> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
but probably some guy dr. Gleason the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.990 
but probably some guy dr. Gleason the
Gleason<00:00:35.570> developed<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.750> system<00:00:37.290> for<00:00:38.000> grading

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
Gleason developed a system for grading

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.200 
Gleason developed a system for grading
the<00:00:39.649> prostate<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.450> for<00:00:42.450> example<00:00:43.399> then<00:00:44.399> grading

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
the prostate so for example then grading

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.430 
the prostate so for example then grading
is<00:00:45.420> from<00:00:45.690> one<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.050> five<00:00:47.180> now<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.899> tumor

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
is from one to five now if the tumor

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.760 
is from one to five now if the tumor
looks<00:00:50.340> exactly<00:00:50.789> or<00:00:51.270> almost<00:00:51.840> exactly<00:00:52.440> like

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
looks exactly or almost exactly like

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.549 
looks exactly or almost exactly like
normal<00:00:53.100> prostate<00:00:53.910> glands<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.960> give<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.320> low

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
normal prostate glands you give it a low

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.160 
normal prostate glands you give it a low
grade<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.070> give<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.430> one<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.719> tumor

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
grade to give it a one if the tumor

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.150 
grade to give it a one if the tumor
looks<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.190> terribly<00:01:00.120> undifferentiated<00:01:01.160> that

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
looks so terribly undifferentiated that

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.310 
looks so terribly undifferentiated that
you<00:01:02.280> can't<00:01:02.489> even<00:01:02.640> tell<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.120> glands<00:01:03.750> then<00:01:04.199> you

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
you can't even tell it's glands then you

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.090 
you can't even tell it's glands then you
give<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.650> five<00:01:05.119> now<00:01:06.439> that's<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.680> Gleason

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
give it a five now that's the Gleason

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.550 
give it a five now that's the Gleason
grade<00:01:08.400> one<00:01:08.790> through<00:01:09.060> five<00:01:09.290> there's<00:01:10.290> another

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
grade one through five there's another

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.969 
grade one through five there's another
thing<00:01:10.770> called<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.130> Gleason<00:01:11.369> score<00:01:11.610> however

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
thing called the Gleason score however

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.550 
thing called the Gleason score however
in<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> Gleason<00:01:14.580> score<00:01:14.659> you<00:01:15.659> add<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:16.200> to

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
in the Gleason score you add up to

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.730 
in the Gleason score you add up to
Gleason<00:01:17.189> grades<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:18.630> predominant<00:01:19.500> pattern

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
Gleason grades the predominant pattern

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.450 
Gleason grades the predominant pattern
and<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.909> secondary<00:01:21.479> pattern<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.460> therefore

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
and the secondary pattern and therefore

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.480 
and the secondary pattern and therefore
you<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.210> see<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.930> Gleason<00:01:25.409> grade<00:01:25.920> could

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
you can see that a Gleason grade could

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.630 
you can see that a Gleason grade could
now<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.939> as<00:01:27.210> high<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.540> 10<00:01:27.900> or<00:01:28.170> as<00:01:28.920> low<00:01:29.130> as<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.310> 2

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
now be as high as a 10 or as low as a 2

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.319 
now be as high as a 10 or as low as a 2
and<00:01:29.939> basically<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.350> fancy<00:01:31.860> way<00:01:32.040> of

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
and basically this is a fancy way of

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.050 
and basically this is a fancy way of
telling<00:01:33.329> your<00:01:33.600> urologist<00:01:34.310> how<00:01:35.310> nasty<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
telling your urologist how nasty the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.660 
telling your urologist how nasty the
tumor<00:01:36.450> looks<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:37.409> doesn't<00:01:37.799> tell<00:01:37.979> them<00:01:38.130> how

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
tumor looks it doesn't tell them how

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.210 
tumor looks it doesn't tell them how
nasty<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.689> tumor<00:01:40.020> infiltrates<00:01:40.740> or<00:01:40.979> whether

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
nasty the tumor infiltrates or whether

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.249 
nasty the tumor infiltrates or whether
it's<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> liver<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.659> tells<00:01:42.899> them<00:01:43.110> how

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
it's in the liver it just tells them how

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.499 
it's in the liver it just tells them how
nasty<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.799> looks<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.939> basis<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.450> that

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
nasty it looks and the basis of that

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.260 
nasty it looks and the basis of that
numbers<00:01:46.110> they<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:46.979> their<00:01:47.220> own<00:01:47.250> decisions<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
numbers they have their own decisions to

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.480 
numbers they have their own decisions to
make<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.750> let's<00:01:49.409> talk<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.770> little<00:01:49.920> bit<00:01:50.159> more

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
make so let's talk a little bit more

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.569 
make so let's talk a little bit more
about<00:01:50.729> Gleason<00:01:54.020> this<00:01:55.020> area<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:56.340> about

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
about Gleason this area is just about

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.539 
about Gleason this area is just about
normal<00:01:57.149> prostate<00:01:57.560> with<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.920> see<00:01:59.189> here

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
normal prostate with that you see here

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.050 
normal prostate with that you see here
you<00:02:00.149> could<00:02:00.360> see<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.750> nuclei<00:02:01.170> are<00:02:02.060> oriented

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
you could see the nuclei are oriented

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.249 
you could see the nuclei are oriented
nicely<00:02:03.659> at<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.619> base<00:02:05.299> like<00:02:06.299> all<00:02:06.570> along<00:02:06.960> here

they're small but here's the main thing
notice<00:02:20.510> these<00:02:21.510> cells<00:02:21.959> do<00:02:22.859> not<00:02:23.810> have<00:02:25.489> nucleoli

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
notice these cells do not have nucleoli

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.069

decision<00:03:12.030> we<00:03:12.599> have<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.019> make<00:03:13.230> if<00:03:13.859> for<00:03:14.459> example

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
decision we have to make if for example

they<00:03:15.599> looked<00:03:15.959> much<00:03:16.319> worse<00:03:16.650> than<00:03:16.919> that<00:03:16.980> then

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
they looked much worse than that then

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.789 
they looked much worse than that then
you<00:03:17.489> could<00:03:17.639> call<00:03:17.849> them<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.120> 2<00:03:18.329> or<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.569> 3<00:03:18.659> or<00:03:19.169> a<00:03:19.199> 4<00:03:19.319> or

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
you could call them a 2 or a 3 or a 4 or

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.360 
you could call them a 2 or a 3 or a 4 or
a<00:03:19.859> 5<00:03:20.629> but<00:03:21.629> this<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.290> Gleason's<00:03:23.190> one<00:03:24.290> prostate

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
a 5 but this is a Gleason's one prostate

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.260
