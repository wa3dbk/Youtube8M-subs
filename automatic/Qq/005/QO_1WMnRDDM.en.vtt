the one main complaint is that my

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.910 
the one main complaint is that my
lighting<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.389> kind<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.660> bad<00:00:09.840> when<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.380> apologize

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
for that so hopefully this one will be a

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.360 
for that so hopefully this one will be a
lot<00:00:12.870> better<00:00:13.049> i<00:00:13.200> found<00:00:13.679> some<00:00:13.830> more<00:00:13.920> settings<00:00:14.280> on

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
lot better i found some more settings on

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.770 
lot better i found some more settings on
my<00:00:14.400> camera<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.910> i<00:00:14.940> could<00:00:15.089> use<00:00:15.269> as<00:00:15.450> opposed<00:00:15.690> to

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
my camera that i could use as opposed to

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.109 
my camera that i could use as opposed to
adding<00:00:15.900> more<00:00:16.109> light<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:16.590> i<00:00:17.430> think<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:17.940> one

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
adding more light so i think this one

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.790 
adding more light so i think this one
does<00:00:18.150> feel<00:00:18.510> or<00:00:18.840> does<00:00:19.020> look<00:00:19.170> like<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.560> lot

four<00:01:40.560> corners<00:01:40.590> which<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.610> very<00:01:41.729> nice

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
four corners which is a very nice

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.170 
four corners which is a very nice
feature<00:01:42.090> which<00:01:42.390> most<00:01:42.689> knives<00:01:42.930> will<00:01:43.110> do<00:01:43.200> this

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
feature which most knives will do this

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.210 
feature which most knives will do this
now<00:01:45.180> because<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.780> g10<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.560> has<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.920> really

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
now because it is g10 it has the really

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.639 
now because it is g10 it has the really
really<00:01:47.340> tight<00:01:47.700> pocket<00:01:48.119> clip<00:01:48.590> is<00:01:49.590> this

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
if you choose to use it that way it is a

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.280 
if you choose to use it that way it is a
very<00:01:56.189> solid<00:01:57.180> pocket<00:01:57.509> clip<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.869> mean<00:01:58.020> listen<00:01:58.140> to

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
this it's a it's not going to go

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.469 
this it's a it's not going to go
anywhere<00:02:02.369> if<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.790> do<00:02:02.909> clip<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.240> anything

anywhere if you do clip it to anything

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.429 
anywhere if you do clip it to anything
now<00:02:04.640> let's<00:02:05.640> open<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.909> blade<00:02:06.090> up<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:07.229> first

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
now let's open the blade up the first

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.900 
now let's open the blade up the first
time<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.649> tell<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.950> before<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.369> open<00:02:08.729> all<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
time I tell you before I open all the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.669 
time I tell you before I open all the
way<00:02:09.000> up<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.840> has<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> really<00:02:10.379> bad

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
way up is that this has a really bad

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.570 
way up is that this has a really bad
blade<00:02:11.370> length<00:02:11.790> to

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
blade length to

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.970 
blade length to
to<00:02:12.640> handle<00:02:13.000> ratio<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:14.320> you<00:02:14.440> notice<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:14.920> it

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
to handle ratio so you notice that it

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.440 
to handle ratio so you notice that it
comes<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.250> hear<00:02:15.460> right<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:15.880> it<00:02:15.940> looks<00:02:15.970> fine<00:02:16.240> but

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
comes to hear right so it looks fine but

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.390 
comes to hear right so it looks fine but
when<00:02:16.600> you<00:02:16.750> open<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:16.990> up<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.410> got<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.160> extra

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
when you open it up you got the extra

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.610 
when you open it up you got the extra
finger<00:02:19.060> choil<00:02:19.240> here<00:02:19.510> just<00:02:20.080> like<00:02:20.170> most<00:02:20.380> spider

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
finger choil here just like most spider

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.440 
finger choil here just like most spider
codes<00:02:20.890> do<00:02:21.010> which<00:02:21.520> means<00:02:21.730> your<00:02:21.940> blade<00:02:22.150> becomes

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
codes do which means your blade becomes

codes do which means your blade becomes
just<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.840> just<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.470> three<00:02:23.710> and<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.860> half<00:02:23.890> inch

is a zero-tolerance 300 series knife and
will<00:05:38.860> sacked<00:05:39.160> up<00:05:39.250> now<00:05:39.400> this<00:05:39.580> is<00:05:39.669> about<00:05:39.850> the

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
will sacked up now this is about the

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.820 
will sacked up now this is about the
same<00:05:40.150> size<00:05:40.390> any<00:05:40.840> privacy<00:05:41.110> maybe<00:05:41.410> the<00:05:41.560> camera

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
same size any privacy maybe the camera

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.520 
same size any privacy maybe the camera
angle<00:05:42.040> but<00:05:42.240> this<00:05:43.240> may<00:05:43.419> be<00:05:43.479> tiny<00:05:44.110> bit<00:05:44.320> longer

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
angle but this may be tiny bit longer

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.520 
angle but this may be tiny bit longer
maybe<00:05:44.830> about<00:05:45.160> the<00:05:45.280> same<00:05:45.460> so<00:05:46.180> this<00:05:46.810> and<00:05:46.960> this<00:05:47.350> is

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
maybe about the same so this and this is

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.080 
maybe about the same so this and this is
a<00:05:47.650> four-inch<00:05:48.070> blade<00:05:48.250> by<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:48.550> way<00:05:48.669> because

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
a four-inch blade by the way because

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.400 
a four-inch blade by the way because
that<00:05:49.360> soil<00:05:49.600> it<00:05:49.750> makes<00:05:49.900> it<00:05:49.990> a<00:05:50.050> three<00:05:50.260> and<00:05:50.320> a<00:05:50.380> half

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
that soil it makes it a three and a half

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.450 
that soil it makes it a three and a half
inch<00:05:50.710> blade<00:05:51.010> so<00:05:52.560> but<00:05:53.560> I<00:05:53.710> finally<00:05:54.040> found<00:05:54.220> one

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
at that look at the difference in in

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.630 
at that look at the difference in in
blade<00:06:24.510> thickness<00:06:25.890> unbelievable<00:06:26.890> this<00:06:27.520> is

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
blade thickness unbelievable this is

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.020 
blade thickness unbelievable this is

this is a aceite valley so but either

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.260 
this is a aceite valley so but either
way<00:06:31.270> I<00:06:31.830> would<00:06:32.830> much<00:06:33.190> rather<00:06:33.250> wail<00:06:33.669> on<00:06:33.700> this<00:06:34.060> one

my entire collection to leave on an
emergency<00:06:42.730> situation<00:06:43.560> this<00:06:44.560> would<00:06:44.710> be<00:06:44.740> it<00:06:44.950> I

all right so any rate uh maybe maybe

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.480 
all right so any rate uh maybe maybe
some<00:06:53.350> specs<00:06:53.620> on<00:06:53.770> this<00:06:53.890> like<00:06:54.130> that<00:06:54.280> it<00:06:54.370> was<00:06:54.460> a
