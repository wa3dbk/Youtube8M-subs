to<00:00:57.909> separate<00:00:58.359> it<00:00:58.539> with<00:00:58.690> my<00:00:58.839> finger<00:00:59.289> and

00:00:59.309 --> 00:00:59.319 
to separate it with my finger and

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:02.189 
to separate it with my finger and
roughly<00:01:00.039> wrong<00:01:00.460> throw<00:01:00.850> my<00:01:01.510> hair<00:01:01.780> with<00:01:02.050> my

roughly wrong throw my hair with my

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.520 
roughly wrong throw my hair with my
finger<00:01:02.620> and<00:01:03.180> i'm<00:01:04.180> just<00:01:04.420> going<00:01:04.659> to<00:01:04.720> braid<00:01:05.500> it

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
finger and i'm just going to braid it

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.640 
finger and i'm just going to braid it
and<00:01:06.430> this<00:01:06.909> is<00:01:07.060> really<00:01:07.270> simple<00:01:07.630> anyone<00:01:08.080> can<00:01:08.260> do

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
and this is really simple anyone can do

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.240 
and this is really simple anyone can do
it<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:10.330> nothing<00:01:10.570> fancy<00:01:10.960> just<00:01:11.290> parting<00:01:12.070> two

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
it it's nothing fancy just parting two

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.930 
it it's nothing fancy just parting two
three<00:01:13.470> partitions<00:01:14.470> i<00:01:14.620> guess<00:01:14.830> and<00:01:15.130> just

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
three partitions i guess and just

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.180 
three partitions i guess and just
braided<00:01:16.510> you<00:01:17.260> can<00:01:17.470> bring<00:01:17.680> it<00:01:17.800> any<00:01:17.920> way<00:01:18.160> you

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
braided you can bring it any way you

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.940 
braided you can bring it any way you
want<00:01:19.800> and<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:22.690> tighter<00:01:23.020> you<00:01:23.200> braid<00:01:23.740> your<00:01:23.920> hair

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
want and the tighter you braid your hair

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.300 
want and the tighter you braid your hair
the<00:01:24.790> more<00:01:25.680> wavy<00:01:26.680> your<00:01:27.220> hair<00:01:27.460> will<00:01:27.760> be<00:01:27.790> and<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
the more wavy your hair will be and the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.100 
the more wavy your hair will be and the
loose<00:01:30.940> loser<00:01:31.840> i<00:01:31.900> guess<00:01:32.230> the<00:01:32.940> less<00:01:33.940> away<00:01:34.870> via

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
loose loser i guess the less away via

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.890 
loose loser i guess the less away via
will<00:01:35.290> be<00:01:35.500> so<00:01:35.920> if<00:01:36.280> you<00:01:36.520> want<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:37.000> have<00:01:37.600> like<00:01:37.840> a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
will be so if you want to have like a

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.610 
will be so if you want to have like a
more<00:01:38.230> intense<00:01:39.180> effect<00:01:40.180> definitely<00:01:40.750> make<00:01:41.410> sure

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
more intense effect definitely make sure

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.610 
more intense effect definitely make sure
you<00:01:41.910> tighten<00:01:42.910> it<00:01:43.330> really<00:01:43.720> really<00:01:43.900> well<00:01:44.170> and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
you tighten it really really well and

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.810 
you tighten it really really well and
you<00:01:45.460> can<00:01:45.610> also<00:01:45.820> pair<00:01:46.660> your<00:01:46.930> hair<00:01:47.140> into<00:01:47.820> four

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
you can also pair your hair into four

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.420 
you can also pair your hair into four
sections<00:01:49.440> depending<00:01:50.440> on<00:01:50.770> how<00:01:50.980> much<00:01:51.130> hair<00:01:51.400> you

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
sections depending on how much hair you

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.100 
sections depending on how much hair you
have<00:01:51.850> or<00:01:52.950> how<00:01:53.950> tiny<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:55.120> wave<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:55.600> want<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:55.960> to

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
have or how tiny the wave you want it to

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.170 
have or how tiny the wave you want it to
be<00:01:56.730> so<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:59.290> really<00:01:59.770> up<00:01:59.890> to<00:02:00.160> you<00:02:00.190> i<00:02:00.700> just<00:02:00.760> want

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
be so it's really up to you i just want

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.180 
be so it's really up to you i just want
some<00:02:01.450> really<00:02:01.870> big<00:02:02.710> and

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
some really big and

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.570 
some really big and
sure<00:02:04.370> waves<00:02:04.700> so<00:02:05.510> and<00:02:06.320> i'm<00:02:06.860> going<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.250> try<00:02:07.490> to

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
sure waves so and i'm going to try to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.750 
sure waves so and i'm going to try to
braid<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:08.270> all<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:10.310> way<00:02:10.430> to<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.760> end<00:02:12.520> so<00:02:13.520> that

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
braid it all the way to the end so that

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.920 
braid it all the way to the end so that
even<00:02:14.300> my<00:02:14.920> ends<00:02:15.920> will<00:02:16.520> have<00:02:17.000> some<00:02:17.300> kind<00:02:17.570> of<00:02:17.660> wave

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
even my ends will have some kind of wave

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.220 
even my ends will have some kind of wave
to<00:02:18.230> it<00:02:22.090> now<00:02:23.090> i'm<00:02:23.210> going<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.570> move<00:02:23.720> on<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:23.930> this

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
to it now i'm going to move on to this

just start braiding you want to do this

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.490 
just start braiding you want to do this
while<00:02:57.890> your<00:02:58.100> hair<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.490> still<00:02:58.810> pretty<00:03:01.030> wet<00:03:02.500> so

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
while your hair is still pretty wet so

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.790 
while your hair is still pretty wet so
that<00:03:03.740> when<00:03:04.490> your<00:03:04.760> hair<00:03:05.000> dries<00:03:05.570> up<00:03:05.930> in<00:03:06.320> the

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
that when your hair dries up in the

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.860 
that when your hair dries up in the
braids<00:03:07.190> it<00:03:07.550> will<00:03:07.959> maintain<00:03:08.959> that<00:03:09.850> that<00:03:10.850> way<00:03:11.060> so

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
braids it will maintain that that way so

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.440 
braids it will maintain that that way so
second<00:03:12.530> um<00:03:12.680> heat<00:03:13.900> kind<00:03:14.900> of<00:03:15.610> burning<00:03:16.610> effects<00:03:17.300> I

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
is really easy and usually the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.229 
is really easy and usually the
hairstyles<00:03:28.040> die<00:03:28.220> too<00:03:28.430> they're<00:03:28.940> really<00:03:29.209> easy

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.130 

it's<00:04:08.170> just<00:04:08.470> try<00:04:08.830> to<00:04:08.890> breathe<00:04:09.280> it<00:04:09.580> out<00:04:09.900> a<00:04:10.900> way

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.010 

just<00:04:24.610> like<00:04:24.760> that<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.150> take<00:04:25.360> a<00:04:25.390> rubber<00:04:25.630> band

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020

just like that and take a rubber band
just<00:04:26.350> tie<00:04:26.620> it<00:04:26.790> and<00:04:28.230> that's<00:04:29.230> pretty<00:04:29.830> much<00:04:30.010> it

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
just tie it and that's pretty much it

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.740 
just tie it and that's pretty much it
and<00:04:30.700> just<00:04:31.090> leave<00:04:31.360> the<00:04:31.690> rest<00:04:31.930> to<00:04:32.850> your<00:04:33.850> air<00:04:34.180> just

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
and just leave the rest to your air just

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.860 
and just leave the rest to your air just
let<00:04:35.170> it<00:04:35.290> air<00:04:35.470> dry<00:04:35.500> or<00:04:36.130> if<00:04:37.000> you<00:04:37.150> want<00:04:37.450> to<00:04:37.630> speed

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
let it air dry or if you want to speed

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.470 
let it air dry or if you want to speed
up<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:38.170> process<00:04:38.440> you<00:04:38.980> can<00:04:39.010> blow<00:04:39.700> dry<00:04:39.970> it<00:04:40.000> but

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
up the process you can blow dry it but

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.170 
up the process you can blow dry it but
it<00:04:40.960> kind<00:04:41.230> of<00:04:41.290> defeats<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.680> purpose<00:04:41.830> of<00:04:42.430> like

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
it kind of defeats the purpose of like

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.270 
it kind of defeats the purpose of like
no<00:04:43.420> heat<00:04:43.890> so<00:04:45.090> um<00:04:46.090> that's<00:04:46.480> it<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:47.200> I<00:04:47.740> will<00:04:48.010> see

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280
