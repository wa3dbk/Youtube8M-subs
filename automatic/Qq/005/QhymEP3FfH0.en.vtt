pins or just try and see what the camera
shown<00:00:15.809> there<00:00:16.800> it's<00:00:17.670> just<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:18.029> piece<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.660> wire

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
shown there it's just a piece of wire

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.070 
shown there it's just a piece of wire
sorry<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:19.980> not<00:00:20.039> focusing<00:00:20.550> right<00:00:21.080> anyway

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
sorry it's not focusing right anyway

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.189 
sorry it's not focusing right anyway
just<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.650> wire<00:00:22.830> that's<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.970> half<00:00:24.630> circle<00:00:24.869> cross

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
just a wire that's a half circle cross

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.810 
just a wire that's a half circle cross
section<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.619> just<00:00:25.800> pulled<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.070> over<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.400> itself

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
section I just pulled it over on itself

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.140 
section I just pulled it over on itself
you<00:00:27.240> stick<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.539> through<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.750> hole<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:29.150> shaft

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
you stick it through a hole in the shaft

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.700 
you stick it through a hole in the shaft
of<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.390> bulb<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.929> then<00:00:31.920> they<00:00:32.070> bend<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.690> back

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
of the bulb and then they bend it back

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.790 
of the bulb and then they bend it back
so<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:35.579> part

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
so this part

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.200 
so this part
it<00:00:38.550> was<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.379> essentially

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.110 

so<00:00:43.780> you<00:00:43.870> just<00:00:43.990> take<00:00:44.140> a<00:00:44.200> pair<00:00:44.380> of<00:00:44.410> pliers<00:00:44.470> and

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
so you just take a pair of pliers and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.160 
so you just take a pair of pliers and
flat<00:00:46.620> but<00:00:47.620> these<00:00:47.830> are<00:00:48.010> so<00:00:48.220> old<00:00:48.250> you<00:00:48.820> know

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
flat but these are so old you know

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.400 
flat but these are so old you know
thirteen<00:00:50.170> years<00:00:50.320> old<00:00:50.440> now<00:00:50.620> that<00:00:51.010> they're<00:00:52.410> no

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
thirteen years old now that they're no

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.370 
thirteen years old now that they're no
rusty<00:00:54.100> on<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.250> outside<00:00:54.580> they're<00:00:54.970> pretty<00:00:55.380> beat

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
rusty on the outside they're pretty beat

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.800 
rusty on the outside they're pretty beat
up<00:00:56.410> and<00:00:57.220> so<00:00:57.610> by<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:57.880> time<00:00:57.940> I<00:00:58.120> pushed<00:00:58.450> them<00:00:58.600> out

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
up and so by the time I pushed them out

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.130 
up and so by the time I pushed them out
this<00:00:59.440> way<00:01:00.510> they're<00:01:01.510> all<00:01:01.629> chewed<00:01:01.900> up<00:01:02.020> in

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
this way they're all chewed up in

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.600 
this way they're all chewed up in
mangled<00:01:02.590> and<00:01:02.739> so<00:01:03.010> you<00:01:03.070> probably<00:01:03.340> want<00:01:03.580> to

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
mangled and so you probably want to

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.800 
mangled and so you probably want to
replace<00:01:03.700> those<00:01:04.150> if<00:01:05.110> you<00:01:05.260> can<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:10.390> crappy<00:01:10.690> old

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
replace those if you can this crappy old

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.050 
replace those if you can this crappy old
ones<00:01:11.050> in<00:01:11.229> and<00:01:11.830> also<00:01:12.160> it's<00:01:12.340> kind<00:01:12.520> of<00:01:12.550> I'm<00:01:12.910> going

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
ones in and also it's kind of I'm going

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:30.060 
ones in and also it's kind of I'm going
to<00:01:13.180> get<00:01:13.300> these<00:01:13.420> things<00:01:13.479> out<00:01:20.040> push<00:01:21.040> them<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:29.070> you

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
to get these things out push them so you

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.440 
to get these things out push them so you
can<00:01:30.280> get<00:01:30.430> grab<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.759> other<00:01:30.880> side<00:01:31.119> and<00:01:31.300> now

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
can get grab the other side and now

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.320 
can get grab the other side and now
pulling<00:01:31.899> this<00:01:32.970> someone<00:01:33.970> came<00:01:34.090> out<00:01:34.180> real

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
pulling this someone came out real

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.469 
pulling this someone came out real
easily<00:01:34.540> but<00:01:35.320> uh<00:01:35.729> typically<00:01:36.729> took<00:01:36.910> me<00:01:37.060> longer

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
easily but uh typically took me longer

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.120 
easily but uh typically took me longer
than<00:01:37.660> that<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.110> much<00:01:38.680> trying<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:38.979> show<00:01:39.070> you

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
than that so much trying to show you

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.940 
than that so much trying to show you
that<00:01:39.280> part<00:01:39.460> and<00:01:40.330> then<00:01:40.660> we're<00:01:40.869> going<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.140> take

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
that part and then we're going to take

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:50.520 
that part and then we're going to take
off<00:01:42.100> these<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.970> lower<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:49.180> lower<00:01:49.990> steering

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
off these the lower the lower steering

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.969 
off these the lower the lower steering
one<00:01:50.680> and<00:01:51.570> then<00:01:52.570> I'm<00:01:52.960> going<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.200> loosen<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.830> top

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
one and then I'm going to loosen the top

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.560 
one and then I'm going to loosen the top
one<00:01:54.310> well<00:01:54.909> actually<00:01:54.970> I'll<00:01:55.180> take<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.390> nut<00:01:55.540> off

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
one well actually I'll take the nut off

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.660 
one well actually I'll take the nut off
but<00:01:55.869> it's<00:01:56.020> it'll<00:01:56.740> still<00:01:56.920> be<00:01:57.040> in<00:01:57.070> there<00:01:57.220> fairly

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
but it's it'll still be in there fairly

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.429 
but it's it'll still be in there fairly
securely<00:01:58.060> then<00:01:58.869> you<00:01:58.960> take<00:01:59.140> off<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.320> bottom

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
securely then you take off the bottom

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.250 
securely then you take off the bottom
and<00:01:59.650> I'll<00:01:59.770> show<00:02:00.010> you<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:01.299> trick<00:02:01.720> that<00:02:01.900> Parker

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
and I'll show you the trick that Parker

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:10.800 
and I'll show you the trick that Parker
CKY<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:06.130> you're<00:02:06.939> sticking<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:09.510> piece<00:02:10.510> of<00:02:10.660> metal

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
CKY and you're sticking a piece of metal

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.960 
CKY and you're sticking a piece of metal
the<00:02:11.019> handle<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:11.530> tool<00:02:11.769> in<00:02:12.070> here<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:12.880> then

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
the handle to a tool in here and then

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.400 
the handle to a tool in here and then
jack<00:02:13.180> up<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.450> car<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.750> then<00:02:13.840> popping<00:02:14.049> it<00:02:14.260> off

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
jack up the car and then popping it off

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.100 
jack up the car and then popping it off
I<00:02:14.799> actually<00:02:15.489> worked<00:02:15.820> great<00:02:16.030> for<00:02:16.060> me<00:02:16.239> I<00:02:16.570> didn't

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
want to shoot that cotter pin thing

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.220 
want to shoot that cotter pin thing
because<00:02:24.280> they<00:02:24.370> give<00:02:24.700> me<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:24.820> hassle<00:02:25.209> last<00:02:25.900> times
