 And I went to live around properly yet but I'm not counting last year to 50 this

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:35.540
 It is why are rumbling that Tteyuu far people have done a lot of live

 Well, it's an artist who is doing something like that. 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.870
 There is no 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.360
 One such artist 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.980
 Singer-songwriter of a woman named Yes beyond Ms. Ayumi Hara 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.510

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.100

 The end of last year to the refined tea Mecha brackets eMusic video 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.050

 Though in I'm doing with Well Rio 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:25.320
 It says that the other party is praise of the duet 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:29.970
 Even though I'm a better human beat young I amazing it is boxer of you 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:35.930
 Well it's real if you get a look at him 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:40.120
 It is that very different men who are doing something while eating something sweet I real 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:45.190
 It's a human beat boxer and it's really cool 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:50.490
 In Well Though happened I saw the video on mercenary Ayumi 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:54.479
 I became a fan in one shot is I also are wondering that Sho's 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.010
 The story is back, but it is Ayumi's 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:03.820
 In January of this year 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:09.970
 I went to Tokyo if I had a chat with Dora's Iwasaki Natsumi. 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:13.920
 a The live of that Ayumi's live is good just in its own spare time 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:18.100
 It was a little bit new because it was there, but it came in 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.720
 Though it is a shop called Bruce Dog Cafe in Roppongi 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.280
 Well as I entered 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:29.840
 And was it about the end of the 1st stage ? 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.650
 Oh, I heard a little bit and after that a break came in and it was between breaks 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.270
 Well let me do something like greetings 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.930
 I'm the head sushi I'm good at 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:45.280
 Second stage starting from now 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:49.750
 I'd like to talk a little bit if you can take a picture 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.870
 It's was to say just for the interview with the Iwasaki 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:58.210
 I have all my camera awareness and tripods 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:02.920
 I got a little ok and I was allowed to shoot 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.760
 Singer -songwriter without a special session vol 1 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.700
 Live 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:13.860
 Weibo-san with a male singer-songwriter 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:17.700
 Though it was a session it is also better Tteyuu this on pot's 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.160
 The voice is so soft and the guitar is good too 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.580
 And in front of a man 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:27.150
 I also like this person I like 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:33.900
 Even live itself was fun anyway 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:35.069
 That's a bar that's not really that big, so it's a part of the audience 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.170
 I mean 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:45.360
 We like our customers so we enjoyed it so much 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:51.780
 It was a lot of fun because it felt like a loss if I had to enjoy it 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:55.950
 The same special session vol 2 will be coming on Saturday, April 4 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.290
 It seems to be held at Roppongi Glue Dog Cafe 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:04.010
 Oh yeah 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:07.750
 There is no so-called admission fee or ticket-like thing, so it's a throwing change style 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:13.180
 Also I think many Well those who Zonchi but the Tteyuu tipping is 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.110
 Oh, I 've had one live and it's been a lot of fun today. 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.320
 For example 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:24.450
 If you think it is okay to pay around 3,000 yen, you can pay 3,000. 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:27.780
 Today and Chorin only 500 yen if you If it were not also do such 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.200
 You can pay it-if you don't have to pay already 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:36.120
 It's styles, such as that 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:39.990
 So , for example, an artist with a hat goes around a customer 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:47.040
 Say get directly put money guy also You There 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:48.020
 Tea in there, was put him et al. Long cocktail glass to each table at the time that I went 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.250
 Become lean 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:57.800
 It was a form like putting money and putting it away. 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:59.270
 But I think I that really feel free to go because when that Oh you like on the way entered in the middle 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:05.340
 I can go home 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:11.730
 I think that in Could kana Bailly said in feeling to go to the glance and I Well a drink 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:19.889
 In the first element that I entered in the second stage about one hour I had it 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:25.330
 Because it edits in the form like the digest version for about 6 minutes, it is what atmosphere 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:31.750
 I think I can see the figure I enjoy so much, so say goodbye if you like 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:34.230
 It was a selfish advertisement that there will be another live by Mr. Akira Hirohara 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.230
 Well then
