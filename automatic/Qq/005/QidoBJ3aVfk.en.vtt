goes<00:02:11.849> up<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.450> down<00:02:12.560> front<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.739> back<00:02:14.010> upward

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
goes up and down front and back upward

goes up and down front and back upward
arm<00:02:14.790> swivel<00:02:15.330> which<00:02:16.139> is<00:02:16.260> another<00:02:16.499> thing<00:02:16.769> I

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
arm swivel which is another thing I

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.239 
arm swivel which is another thing I
think<00:02:17.370> I've<00:02:17.459> said<00:02:17.549> it<00:02:17.669> before<00:02:17.700> but<00:02:18.120> usually

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:19.249 
think I've said it before but usually

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:20.510 
think I've said it before but usually
the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
the

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.970 
the
the<00:02:20.820> joy<00:02:21.300> my<00:02:21.450> haircuts<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.440> one<00:02:22.650> actually

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
the joy my haircuts this one actually

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.770 
the joy my haircuts this one actually
goes<00:02:23.100> straight<00:02:23.490> down<00:02:23.730> into<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.060> arms<00:02:24.450> oval

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
goes straight down into the arms oval

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.110 
goes straight down into the arms oval
which<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.050> pretty<00:02:25.260> cool<00:02:25.500> but<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.760> problem

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
which is pretty cool but the problem

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.790 
which is pretty cool but the problem
sometimes<00:02:27.570> is<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:28.200> kind<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.470> leaves<00:02:28.620> it

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
sometimes is it kind of leaves it

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.180 
sometimes is it kind of leaves it
exposed<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:30.120> kind<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.570> away<00:02:31.530> from<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
exposed so it's kind of away from the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.640 
exposed so it's kind of away from the
this<00:02:32.730> this<00:02:33.240> ball<00:02:33.480> join<00:02:33.750> right<00:02:33.990> now<00:02:34.140> right<00:02:34.470> here

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
this this ball join right now right here

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.440 
this this ball join right now right here
so<00:02:34.860> if<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.040> can<00:02:35.160> kind<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.460> see<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:36.300> can

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
so if you can kind of see you can

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.800 
so if you can kind of see you can
totally<00:02:36.780> tell<00:02:36.960> where<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.710> joint<00:02:38.010> is

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
totally tell where the the joint is

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.850 
totally tell where the the joint is
compared<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.020> one<00:02:40.230> which<00:02:40.380> is<00:02:40.410> actually

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
compared to this one which is actually

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.280 
compared to this one which is actually
closer<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.670> joint<00:02:41.970> if<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.080> made<00:02:43.260> any

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
closer to the joint if that made any

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.570 
closer to the joint if that made any
sense<00:02:43.500> guys<00:02:44.390> so<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.660> does<00:02:45.840> turn<00:02:46.800> 360<00:02:47.280> degrees

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
sense guys so that does turn 360 degrees

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.020 
sense guys so that does turn 360 degrees
right<00:02:48.030> there<00:02:48.740> one<00:02:49.740> piece<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.280> articulation<00:02:50.880> at

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
right there one piece of articulation at

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.410 
right there one piece of articulation at
the<00:02:51.120> elbow<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.780> just<00:02:52.440> go<00:02:52.590> up<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:52.950> down<00:02:53.420> then

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
the elbow that just go up and down then

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.880 
the elbow that just go up and down then
we<00:02:54.510> got<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.780> little<00:02:54.900> wraps<00:02:55.200> because<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.770> know

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
this is really what made the figure is

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
this is really what made the figure is
just<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.490> this<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.150> way<00:03:12.300> I<00:03:12.710> mean<00:03:13.710> he<00:03:14.550> looks

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
figure is and then there's a piece of

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.710 
figure is and then there's a piece of

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
the fists with the tape make the figure

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.500 
the fists with the tape make the figure
that's<00:03:32.160> just<00:03:32.400> me<00:03:32.610> personally<00:03:32.640> though<00:03:33.270> because

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
that's just me personally though because

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.880 
that's just me personally though because
there's<00:03:33.720> nothing<00:03:33.990> else<00:03:34.110> really<00:03:34.440> going<00:03:34.740> on

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
there's nothing else really going on

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.230 
there's nothing else really going on
with<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.160> figure<00:03:35.430> other<00:03:35.580> than<00:03:35.850> that<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.180> the

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
with the figure other than that and the

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.830 
with the figure other than that and the
head<00:03:36.420> sculpt<00:03:37.370> so<00:03:38.370> we<00:03:38.490> got<00:03:38.670> chest<00:03:39.240> articulation

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
head sculpt so we got chest articulation

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.770 
head sculpt so we got chest articulation
goes<00:03:40.020> up<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.380> down<00:03:41.180> standard<00:03:42.180> DC<00:03:42.540> Universe

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
goes up and down standard DC Universe

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.690 
goes up and down standard DC Universe
Classics<00:03:42.990> stuff<00:03:43.560> that's<00:03:43.980> some<00:03:44.130> stuff<00:03:44.520> in

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
Classics stuff that's some stuff in

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.290 
Classics stuff that's some stuff in
there<00:03:44.820> it<00:03:44.940> looks<00:03:45.120> like<00:03:46.190> so<00:03:47.190> that's<00:03:48.000> cool

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
there it looks like so that's cool

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.390 
there it looks like so that's cool
though<00:03:48.510> I'll<00:03:48.780> just<00:03:48.930> have<00:03:49.110> them<00:03:49.200> like<00:03:49.350> this<00:03:49.530> not

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
though I'll just have them like this not

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.590 
though I'll just have them like this not
gonna<00:03:50.520> be<00:03:50.640> displaying<00:03:51.060> your<00:03:51.150> figures<00:03:51.450> like

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
gonna be displaying your figures like

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.580 
gonna be displaying your figures like
that<00:03:51.660> are<00:03:51.990> you<00:03:52.670> so<00:03:53.670> waste<00:03:54.450> joint<00:03:54.810> then<00:03:55.290> we<00:03:55.380> got

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
that are you so waste joint then we got

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.400 
that are you so waste joint then we got
the<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.550> DC<00:03:57.330> Universe<00:03:57.690> joints<00:03:58.020> right<00:03:58.140> here

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
the the DC Universe joints right here

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.950 
the the DC Universe joints right here
that<00:03:58.560> goes<00:03:58.590> up<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.310> down<00:04:00.800> side<00:04:01.800> to<00:04:01.920> side<00:04:02.960> we

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
that goes up and down side to side we

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.740 
that goes up and down side to side we
got<00:04:04.140> that<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:05.160> above-the-knee<00:04:05.940> swivel<00:04:06.600> right

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
got that the above-the-knee swivel right

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.530 
got that the above-the-knee swivel right
here<00:04:07.050> so<00:04:07.290> that<00:04:07.410> turns<00:04:07.650> 360<00:04:08.310> degrees<00:04:08.970> one<00:04:09.270> piece

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
here so that turns 360 degrees one piece

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.340 
here so that turns 360 degrees one piece
of<00:04:09.690> articulation<00:04:10.380> at<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.860> knee<00:04:11.840> goes<00:04:12.840> up<00:04:13.110> and

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
of articulation at the knee goes up and

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.330 
of articulation at the knee goes up and
down<00:04:14.720> it<00:04:15.720> someday<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.290> hope<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.680> DC<00:04:16.980> Universe

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
down it someday I hope the DC Universe

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.010 
down it someday I hope the DC Universe
joints<00:04:17.670> you<00:04:17.790> know<00:04:17.820> they<00:04:18.120> can<00:04:18.239> add<00:04:18.510> so<00:04:18.870> much

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
joints you know they can add so much

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.500 
joints you know they can add so much
articulation<00:04:19.770> of<00:04:19.859> these<00:04:20.040> just<00:04:20.390> since<00:04:21.390> they

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
articulation of these just since they

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.730 
articulation of these just since they
already<00:04:21.600> have<00:04:21.840> this<00:04:21.989> good<00:04:22.230> mold<00:04:22.530> and

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
already have this good mold and

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.930 
already have this good mold and
everything<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:23.190> everyone's<00:04:23.520> not<00:04:23.700> really

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
everything and everyone's not really

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.340 
everything and everyone's not really
having<00:04:24.210> too<00:04:24.300> many<00:04:24.390> problems<00:04:24.510> with<00:04:24.870> they<00:04:25.140> can

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
having too many problems with they can

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.290 
having too many problems with they can
just<00:04:25.500> make<00:04:25.650> more<00:04:25.920> figures<00:04:26.640> but<00:04:26.850> if<00:04:27.000> they<00:04:27.150> just

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
just make more figures but if they just

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.330 
just make more figures but if they just
added<00:04:27.780> some<00:04:28.250> just<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.370> little<00:04:30.050> bit<00:04:31.050> of<00:04:31.340> more

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
added some just a little bit of more

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.650 
added some just a little bit of more
articulation<00:04:32.820> here

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
articulation here

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.680 
articulation here
a<00:04:33.690> good<00:04:34.290> sentence<00:04:34.620> just<00:04:35.610> added<00:04:36.000> some<00:04:36.450> more

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
a good sentence just added some more

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.660 
a good sentence just added some more
articulation<00:04:37.290> here<00:04:37.740> it'd<00:04:37.830> be<00:04:37.920> so<00:04:38.250> much<00:04:38.310> nicer

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
articulation here it'd be so much nicer

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.940 
articulation here it'd be so much nicer
so<00:04:39.600> if<00:04:39.690> you<00:04:39.750> can<00:04:39.840> see<00:04:39.960> right<00:04:40.140> here<00:04:40.170> if<00:04:40.740> they

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
so if you can see right here if they

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.100 
so if you can see right here if they
added<00:04:41.160> a<00:04:41.610> piece<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.330> articulation<00:04:42.900> they<00:04:42.990> have

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
added a piece of articulation they have

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.200 
added a piece of articulation they have
a<00:04:43.140> swivel<00:04:43.530> below<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.220> knee<00:04:44.340> as<00:04:44.580> well<00:04:44.610> as<00:04:44.970> above

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
a swivel below the knee as well as above

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.530 
a swivel below the knee as well as above
the<00:04:45.330> knee<00:04:45.450> right<00:04:45.900> here<00:04:46.230> would<00:04:46.320> be<00:04:46.470> so<00:04:46.740> nice<00:04:47.540> as

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
the knee right here would be so nice as

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.020 
the knee right here would be so nice as
you<00:04:48.660> can<00:04:48.720> see<00:04:48.930> we<00:04:49.050> got<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.290> feet<00:04:49.850> which<00:04:50.850> is<00:04:50.880> a

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
you can see we got the feet which is a

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.570 
you can see we got the feet which is a
grayish<00:04:51.870> color<00:04:51.960> for<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:52.470> toenails<00:04:52.980> right

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
grayish color for the toenails right

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.670 
grayish color for the toenails right
here<00:04:53.880> and<00:04:54.000> then<00:04:54.120> it<00:04:54.240> has<00:04:54.270> foot<00:04:55.110> articulation

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
here and then it has foot articulation

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.270 
here and then it has foot articulation
which<00:04:55.800> goes<00:04:56.070> down<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:56.850> up<00:04:57.000> down<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.720> up<00:04:58.280> right

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
which goes down and up down and up right

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.590 
which goes down and up down and up right
there<00:04:59.580> and<00:04:59.790> then<00:04:59.880> we<00:04:59.970> got<00:05:00.150> looks<00:05:00.930> like<00:05:00.990> little

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
there and then we got looks like little

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.300 
there and then we got looks like little
crotch<00:05:03.600> cross<00:05:04.140> hatches<00:05:04.620> right<00:05:04.800> there<00:05:05.010> for<00:05:05.220> the

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
crotch cross hatches right there for the

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.400 
crotch cross hatches right there for the
foot<00:05:05.520> and<00:05:05.670> it<00:05:05.730> has<00:05:05.850> pegs<00:05:06.120> split<00:05:06.600> or<00:05:06.720> not<00:05:06.900> no<00:05:07.170> peg

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
foot and it has pegs split or not no peg

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.230 
foot and it has pegs split or not no peg
in<00:05:07.500> the<00:05:07.530> back<00:05:07.770> if<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:08.610> could<00:05:08.730> see<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.210> outline

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
in the back if you could see the outline

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.040 
in the back if you could see the outline
see<00:05:09.930> that<00:05:10.700> that's<00:05:11.700> where<00:05:11.910> a<00:05:11.940> cape<00:05:12.150> would<00:05:12.300> go<00:05:12.510> so

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
see that that's where a cape would go so

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.440 
see that that's where a cape would go so
they<00:05:13.320> use<00:05:13.440> some<00:05:13.710> custom<00:05:14.130> from<00:05:14.400> where<00:05:14.610> they

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
they use some custom from where they

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.210 
they use some custom from where they
would<00:05:15.600> have<00:05:15.690> used<00:05:15.900> a<00:05:16.020> cape<00:05:16.260> but<00:05:16.890> other<00:05:17.010> than

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
would have used a cape but other than

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.690 
would have used a cape but other than
that<00:05:17.310> guys<00:05:17.700> this<00:05:17.940> figure<00:05:18.540> is<00:05:18.630> so<00:05:18.990> sick

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
that guys this figure is so sick

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.740 
that guys this figure is so sick
definitely<00:05:20.700> recommend<00:05:20.820> getting<00:05:21.240> them<00:05:21.450> even

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
definitely recommend getting them even

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
if you don't collect DC Universe was

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.280 
if you don't collect DC Universe was
just<00:05:23.280> a<00:05:23.370> cool<00:05:23.550> figure<00:05:23.820> to<00:05:24.030> have<00:05:24.210> and<00:05:24.540> he's
