00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.330
 my very first episode of 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.480
 wrestlemania three matches that's quasi 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.950
 the road to wrestlemania from a canal 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.840
 I got it in the video yesterday 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.360
 announced it as he calls it in 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.490
 Rematch is coming, what exactly is that 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.680
 Principle and everything you can do yesterday 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.970
 video nachgucken link is in the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.980
 description to the video 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.900
 how it works and we become 10 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.330
 make matches and the first match is 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.250
 annett eger king sting 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.830
 that's a great me which I am very very 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:37.340
 would like to see me and start with me 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:40.320
 this match you became the tourism 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.989
 jasmin yes but I can not stop 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.680
 get it differently because it goes with 31 itself 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.329
 yes not 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.399
 and that's a human because i'm on 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.520
 want to see every case because eat two 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.520
 Two of the biggest names in the wwe icons 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.170
 who are never in a wwe or 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.109
 stood opposite the restaurant opposite 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.230
 and a match I definitely 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.350
 would like to see and for me it would be one 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.189
 perfect match for that pretty much 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:14.850
 could end up with their careers 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:16.409
 in my opinion and the thing 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:24.140
 dominates me in these chains handles 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:24.140
 very good and so on 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.780
 so good 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.850
 so 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:59.470
 Expected maybe he'll pick up 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:02:02.950
 one does not wait that way either way 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.960
 unsightly in the monastery of undertaker yes 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.050
 the construction could be like that 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.080
 example sting sheet defeated and so 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.540
 next and then the undertaker comes yes 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.480
 You never stood over me and then 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.430
 join each other this year 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.770
 at aurora gray announce that the 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.620
 next against each other and virtually 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.840
 Time and match is because you eat 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.090
 cool match end so pretty much 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.070
 a cool career end for both 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.260
 the undertaker as on the sting and 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.990
 both make their last match 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.780
 Both are then on the counter 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.080
 end careers 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.330
 and yes that would be a great dream for me 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.180
 match for me a match, as already located 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.670
 for a few years already want to see 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.739
 and I hope that someday in the 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.510
 Reality will be implemented someday 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.190
 Of course, depending on whether it is 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.350
 is still next year at all 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.230
 or not yes still a match denies 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.269
 Me next, because the next one is 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.570
 with and it is also perfect for 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.750
 wrestlemania 32 because it is in texas the 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:11.680
 undertaker comes from texas whom it 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.540
 know and 400,000 possibly 1000 people 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.200
 to end his career 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.420
 that was great and I would like too 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.459
 maybe fly there but maybe 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.040
 is it feasible maybe and you 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:28.209
 do not like because that would be 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:34.230
 very cool if there is a nice match 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:37.590
 could end so genitive now 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.590
 beautiful the little ones ii 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:04:01.260
 nice blow of sting and really great 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:03.150
 and nice articles like yours 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.860
 opinion he that the this match 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.290
 maybe times will be implemented in the 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.140
 reality writes times in the comments 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.790
 it would interest me if that 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.600
 really realized 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:23.820
 So I would be happy about that and 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:28.520
 yes undertaker shows now the end 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:33.290
 will or get the shock slam perfect 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:38.510
 he shows it simply and now 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:42.770
 rip and the catapult touch villiger 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.770
 works perfect 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:05:04.640
 sting is still kicking out so montana tech i 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:12.720
 strikes so well against it 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:13.320
 so and now undertaker shows what he does 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.070
 has on it 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.620
 He shows why he is the phenomenon 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.270
 Of course, that's too bad that the streak 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:27.420
 it has to be broken so you just have to say that 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:30.450
 for me still a thing where 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.580
 I say this because I say to fault 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.780
 today and I want my opinion 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.780
 probably always stay 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:58.840
 well and now that leaves well and that 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.570
 was the last red and now the one 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.110
 undertaker with the hells gate with the 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:09.820
 hells gate and plaster thing on sting there 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:14.789
 that 's what undertaker wins 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:17.979
 match this battle 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:22.330
 despite this ketch finish, sting could 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:27.240
 still click out and then of course 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:30.669
 eventually the heart money someday 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.870
 Here you can see r knocking off when I am 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:34.300
 Today, not such a relative happen 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.310
 I think it will be in a row and 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.229
 then the bar gets the thing or something 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.340
 let's see you will see so I would 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:42.789
 like to see this match 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.979
 It was a nice rematch for me 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:45.789
 it needs one thing for you that stands 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:47.259
 gold of the 10th 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:50.139
 Write comments wants me 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:53.070
 interested and yes then she must be in 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.070
 the next follow it
