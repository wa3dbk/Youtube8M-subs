00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.340
 while the snow falls on the banks of the river 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.910
 the deer eat as if it were their 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.700
 last dinner 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.590
 with temperatures that border on 0 a 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.439
 low pressure front coming 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.050
 of the Arctic has hit the humid air 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.630
 unleashing the storm 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.460
 the winter has just begun and in the 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.099
 Northern Canada are usually very long 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.230
 this is the province of alberta partly 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.829
 mountainous partly flat but totally 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.829
 wild 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.430
 it gets its name from luis garo lines 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.070
 alberta daughter of the queen victoria of 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.650
 england and is a fertile land with a 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.610
 great past of mountain hunters 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.610
 trappers and lumberjacks 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.420
 the expert hunter jim benton has left 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.520
 to the south your Michigan house to travel 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.740
 up to canada on this annual pilgrimage 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.970
 to hunt the huge deer of tail 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.590
 white living in manitoba 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.570
 Saskatchewan and Alberta 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.210
 he calls his campaign against the deer 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.740
 White-tailed Canadians and Jim are passing 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.780
 almost half of November hunting 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.860
 giants worthy of the record books 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.860
 in the central provinces 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.520
 I would normally throw myself away all day 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.830
 sitting at the post hunting deer 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.840
 white tail but I had installed the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.790
 edge of a crop field and there's 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.460
 a lot of activity so I've decided that 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.900
 I'm going to dedicate myself to recognize the terrain 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.500
 last night it was snowing so I'm 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.500
 looking for footprints 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.960
 right there is a path 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.700
 the bellowing of white-tailed deer 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.649
 Canadians is in November at 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.350
 Central provinces of Saskatchewan and 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.350
 Alberta can be very cold and snowy 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.410
 the hunters who come to Canada 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.110
 they prefer it to be cold during the 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.910
 bellows as low temperatures 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.590
 keep the deer moving and 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.600
 increase the possibility of locating a 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.509
 giant during the few hours of light 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.239
 on a wintry day in the north 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.459
 when changing the station they also change 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.709
 the places where they feed and when 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.689
 this happens the deer patterns 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.849
 they also change so what I'm going to 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:23.980
 try is to find where they pass 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.510
 the females find the trails by 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.879
 those who arrive to these fields of 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.709
 alfalfa and consider changing position 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.709
 you can not be afraid of change 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.010
 north of alberta the prairies and 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.620
 plains begin to intersperse with the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.360
 boreal forest agriculture this 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.670
 area focuses mostly on the forage 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.030
 for cattle and much of the fields 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.950
 what are here are alfalfa alfalfa 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.019
 it is a plant that is still green 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.000
 until well into winter and it's like 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.769
 a magnet for the deer that uses the 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.769
 adjacent forests to hide 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.390
 if this is what I was looking for this 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.160
 trail is used by deer that arrive 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.260
 the field of conservation program 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.440
 reservations there will be movement at least 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.200
 of females but if there are traces of 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.390
 females there will also be males 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.190
 do not miss this hunting adventure in 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.260
 canada next in territory 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.260
 wild is here in esp / n 2
