00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:12.840
 so I left here as I feel 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.070
 a writer of short stories with the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.070
 my motor form 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.060
 I like short stories 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.680
 I like the sense of control that 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.840
 I can have on the tongue on 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.220
 story structure like the fact 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.680
 which you can really experience then 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.300
 play with the stories of the novel though 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.040
 I missed a very beautiful thing that is 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.710
 that of becoming attached to a character 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.900
 having a sofia hero was for me 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.670
 this thing here first of all for me 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.100
 because I lived there for four years 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.079
 trying to tell it 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.600
 and then as a literary project ie 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.810
 the idea of building a character 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.810
 complex and in-depth literary 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.460
 at night leo takes you to explore the 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.860
 outskirts track paths between vegetable gardens 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.270
 abusive depots of tramways airports 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.740
 railway farmhouses abandoned factories 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.600
 since he discovered you grew up 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.220
 in a residential village it is 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.330
 self-proclaimed your guide to the city 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.330
 of the twentieth century 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.500
 in the middle of a dark road leo binds 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.790
 streetlight scooter takes you by the hand and 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.580
 takes you into the old factory 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.400
 of gas through a hole in the wall has 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.380
 dug by the copper thieves who come to you 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.790
 to look for the pieces of recovery i 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.040
 asks what the huge one was for 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.990
 rust skeleton and he instead of 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.610
 answer the question defiantly 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.610
 if you are able to climb 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.380
 from up there 40 meters above the ground 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.240
 you realize for the first time that the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.270
 northern suburbs of Milan is a tangle 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.789
 of binary railways run over the 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.869
 viaducts next to the factories 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.509
 shimmer under the streetlights before 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.039
 branch off into the dark leotti surrounds the 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.950
 shoulders with one arm two pairs of legs 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.989
 the gasometer will think in the void 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.379
 Ferris wheel and milan but your 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.379
 park
