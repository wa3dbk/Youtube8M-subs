00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.030 
one shot in this time but let's say you
don't<00:02:52.180> make<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.390> if<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:53.350> don't<00:02:53.560> pick<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.830> up<00:02:53.920> as

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
don't make it if you don't pick it up as

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.110 
don't make it if you don't pick it up as
long<00:02:54.100> as<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.430> don't<00:02:54.580> pick<00:02:54.670> them<00:02:54.790> up<00:02:54.910> they'll

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
long as you don't pick them up they'll

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.310 
long as you don't pick them up they'll
be<00:02:55.239> still<00:02:55.450> laying<00:02:55.660> there<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.050> you<00:02:56.140> basically

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
be still laying there so you basically

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.680 
be still laying there so you basically
can<00:02:56.680> go<00:02:56.800> in<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.040> slap<00:02:57.310> one<00:02:57.580> it'll<00:02:58.269> drop<00:02:58.480> it

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
can go in and slap one it'll drop it

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.900 
can go in and slap one it'll drop it
don't<00:02:58.870> pick<00:02:59.050> it<00:02:59.080> up<00:02:59.290> then<00:02:59.860> you<00:02:59.950> die<00:03:00.160> come<00:03:00.760> back

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
don't pick it up then you die come back

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.100 
don't pick it up then you die come back
in<00:03:01.090> it'll<00:03:01.360> still<00:03:01.570> be<00:03:01.660> sitting<00:03:01.870> there<00:03:01.989> you

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
in it'll still be sitting there you

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.390 
in it'll still be sitting there you
could<00:03:02.230> do<00:03:02.290> this<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.530> few<00:03:02.560> times<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.220> then

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
could do this a few times and then

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.070 
could do this a few times and then
you'll<00:03:03.580> get<00:03:03.730> all<00:03:03.880> five<00:03:04.120> right<00:03:04.150> there<00:03:04.330> that

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
you'll get all five right there that

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.690 
you'll get all five right there that
make<00:03:05.230> sense<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.680> hope<00:03:05.860> so<00:03:06.070> it's<00:03:06.310> not<00:03:06.400> leaving

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
make sense I hope so it's not leaving

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.190 
make sense I hope so it's not leaving
the<00:03:06.760> comments<00:03:07.060> are<00:03:07.150> clarifying<00:03:07.570> then<00:03:08.110> the

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.550 
and I I think I'm waited about 20 25
minutes<00:04:06.250> before<00:04:06.820> at<00:04:07.060> spawn<00:04:07.420> so<00:04:07.720> spawn<00:04:08.290> here
