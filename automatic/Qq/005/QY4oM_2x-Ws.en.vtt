no<00:00:04.170> but<00:00:04.380> it's<00:00:04.500> not<00:00:04.650> true<00:00:04.859> I<00:00:05.009> mean<00:00:05.130> I<00:00:05.279> think<00:00:05.640> what

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
no but it's not true I mean I think what

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.579 
no but it's not true I mean I think what
happens<00:00:06.150> is<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.420> storylines<00:00:06.899> change<00:00:07.290> and

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
happens is the storylines change and

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:08.990 
happens is the storylines change and
they<00:00:07.919> want<00:00:08.130> something<00:00:08.309> new<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.849> something

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
they want something new and something

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.120 
they want something new and something
different<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.110> so<00:00:10.650> they<00:00:10.740> make<00:00:10.920> creative

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
different and so they make creative

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.620 
different and so they make creative
decisions<00:00:11.280> but<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:11.940> was<00:00:12.030> nice<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.420> come<00:00:12.450> back
