matters<00:03:01.600> but<00:03:02.140> I<00:03:02.320> usually<00:03:02.500> just<00:03:02.739> do<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.190> first

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
matters but I usually just do the first

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.229 
matters but I usually just do the first
one<00:03:03.850> first<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:05.350> second<00:03:05.769> one<00:03:05.920> second<00:03:06.519> so

I'm going to and notice this screen

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.630 
I'm going to and notice this screen
guard<00:03:09.910> actually<00:03:10.390> has<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.630> little<00:03:10.810> hole<00:03:11.550> but<00:03:12.550> I'm

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
guard actually has a little hole but I'm

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.819 
guard actually has a little hole but I'm
not<00:03:12.850> going<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.060> mess<00:03:13.239> with<00:03:13.480> that<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.650> what<00:03:14.799> I

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
not going to mess with that so what I

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.160 
not going to mess with that so what I
usually<00:03:15.130> do<00:03:15.519> is<00:03:15.549> I<00:03:16.000> basically<00:03:16.150> just<00:03:16.540> lined<00:03:17.019> it

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
usually do is I basically just lined it

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:25.740 
usually do is I basically just lined it
up<00:03:17.320> with<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:20.140> home<00:03:20.380> button<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:25.510> way

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
up with the home button and that way

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.199 
up with the home button and that way
it'll<00:03:26.079> work<00:03:26.440> but<00:03:26.709> let<00:03:26.860> me<00:03:26.890> first<00:03:26.980> peel<00:03:27.940> off<00:03:28.180> the

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
it'll work but let me first peel off the

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.539 
it'll work but let me first peel off the
side<00:03:28.810> wand<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:30.430> way<00:03:30.670> it's<00:03:31.060> Tennyson<00:03:32.549> now

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
side wand that way it's Tennyson now

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:34.920 
side wand that way it's Tennyson now
when<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:33.820> peel<00:03:34.060> it<00:03:34.090> off<00:03:34.360> make<00:03:34.720> sure<00:03:34.750> you're

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
when you peel it off make sure you're

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.009 
when you peel it off make sure you're
doing<00:03:35.230> it<00:03:35.709> in<00:03:36.040> an<00:03:36.190> environment<00:03:36.820> that's<00:03:37.019> not

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
doing it in an environment that's not

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.370 
doing it in an environment that's not
too<00:03:38.230> dusty<00:03:38.739> because<00:03:39.130> this<00:03:39.549> side<00:03:39.850> is<00:03:40.380> adhesive

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
too dusty because this side is adhesive

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.120 
too dusty because this side is adhesive
so<00:03:42.160> any<00:03:42.610> dust<00:03:43.000> or<00:03:43.299> what<00:03:44.079> have<00:03:44.320> you<00:03:44.350> will<00:03:44.860> get

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
so any dust or what have you will get

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.509 
so any dust or what have you will get
stuck<00:03:45.430> on<00:03:45.670> there<00:03:45.820> easily<00:03:46.320> so<00:03:47.320> all<00:03:47.769> I<00:03:47.799> do<00:03:47.980> now<00:03:48.489> is

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
stuck on there easily so all I do now is

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.590 
stuck on there easily so all I do now is
try<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.150> line<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.480> up<00:03:49.780> with<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:51.880> home<00:03:52.209> screen

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
try to line it up with the home screen

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.380 
try to line it up with the home screen
and<00:03:52.900> notice<00:03:53.730> it's<00:03:54.730> already<00:03:55.769> sort<00:03:56.769> of<00:03:56.829> on<00:03:57.010> there

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
and notice it's already sort of on there

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.640 
and notice it's already sort of on there
so<00:03:58.390> what<00:03:58.570> I<00:03:58.600> do<00:03:58.690> now<00:03:59.049> is<00:03:59.079> I<00:03:59.620> just<00:03:59.680> use<00:04:00.190> my<00:04:01.650> card

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
so what I do now is I just use my card

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.550 
so what I do now is I just use my card
and<00:04:03.040> just<00:04:03.400> sort<00:04:03.610> of<00:04:03.760> push<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:05.320> push<00:04:06.310> it

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
and just sort of push it and push it

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.850 
and just sort of push it and push it
until<00:04:09.720> there's<00:04:11.549> not<00:04:12.549> much<00:04:12.820> bubble

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
until there's not much bubble

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.330 
until there's not much bubble
and<00:04:14.980> you<00:04:15.850> know<00:04:15.970> with<00:04:16.450> practice<00:04:17.130> you'll<00:04:18.130> get

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
and you know with practice you'll get

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.120 
and you know with practice you'll get
better<00:04:18.549> at<00:04:18.850> it<00:04:19.290> and<00:04:20.290> for<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:20.620> sake<00:04:20.829> of<00:04:20.859> this

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
better at it and for the sake of this

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.480 
better at it and for the sake of this
video<00:04:21.340> I'm<00:04:21.850> just<00:04:21.940> going<00:04:22.150> to<00:04:22.270> keep<00:04:22.450> it<00:04:22.630> short

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
video I'm just going to keep it short

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:30.630 
video I'm just going to keep it short
and<00:04:24.490> not<00:04:24.670> try<00:04:25.000> to<00:04:25.030> be<00:04:26.550> too<00:04:27.550> perfect<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:29.640> you

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
and not try to be too perfect and you

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.510 
and not try to be too perfect and you
know<00:04:30.760> with<00:04:31.300> practice<00:04:31.720> again<00:04:32.050> it<00:04:32.290> was<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:33.280> can

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
know with practice again it was you can

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:41.720 
know with practice again it was you can
get<00:04:33.730> out<00:04:34.030> all<00:04:34.450> the<00:04:34.630> bubbles<00:04:34.810> and<00:04:39.450> so<00:04:40.450> it's<00:04:40.750> not

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
get out all the bubbles and so it's not

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.180 
get out all the bubbles and so it's not
it's<00:04:42.730> not<00:04:42.820> perfectly<00:04:43.420> line<00:04:43.780> but<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.830> basic

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
it's not perfectly line but the basic

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.220 
it's not perfectly line but the basic
idea<00:04:45.310> is<00:04:45.580> there<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:46.650> you<00:04:47.650> know<00:04:48.400> just<00:04:49.230> try-try

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
idea is there and you know just try-try

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.510 
idea is there and you know just try-try
do<00:04:50.860> it<00:04:51.100> yourself<00:04:51.520> and<00:04:51.870> you<00:04:52.870> know<00:04:52.960> hopefully

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
do it yourself and you know hopefully

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.159 
do it yourself and you know hopefully
you<00:04:54.520> know<00:04:54.610> it'll<00:04:55.030> be<00:04:55.150> a<00:04:55.300> very<00:04:55.780> streamlined

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
you know it'll be a very streamlined

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.280 
you know it'll be a very streamlined
process<00:04:56.830> after<00:04:57.040> a<00:04:57.220> few<00:04:57.460> times<00:04:57.640> so<00:04:58.390> anyways<00:04:59.080> the

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
process after a few times so anyways the

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.080 
process after a few times so anyways the
basic<00:04:59.620> idea<00:04:59.919> again<00:05:00.490> guys<00:05:00.730> is<00:05:02.669> you<00:05:03.669> know<00:05:03.790> just

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
basic idea again guys is you know just

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.050 
basic idea again guys is you know just
get<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.230> screen<00:05:05.470> guard<00:05:05.710> and<00:05:06.010> then<00:05:06.460> use<00:05:07.030> a

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
get the screen guard and then use a

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.970 
get the screen guard and then use a
credit<00:05:07.330> card<00:05:07.510> and<00:05:07.810> push<00:05:08.080> out<00:05:08.290> try<00:05:08.560> to<00:05:08.620> push<00:05:08.830> out

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
credit card and push out try to push out

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.170
