00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
have liked it to charge versus having to

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.630 
have liked it to charge versus having to
use<00:03:47.569> for<00:03:48.569> double-a<00:03:49.050> batteries<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.519> is

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
why but um yeah this was actually really

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.390 
why but um yeah this was actually really
easy<00:05:38.610> you<00:05:39.330> basically<00:05:39.539> just<00:05:39.810> roll<00:05:40.260> it<00:05:40.470> on

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.360 
easy you basically just roll it on
and<00:05:41.490> whoops<00:05:42.180> don't<00:05:42.780> want<00:05:42.900> to<00:05:42.960> get<00:05:43.080> dirty<00:05:43.370> um

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
and whoops don't want to get dirty um

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.879

you rope it on and you just roll on a
few<00:05:47.190> times<00:05:47.400> just<00:05:47.699> so<00:05:48.060> you<00:05:48.120> don't<00:05:48.300> have<00:05:48.479> any

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540

streaks<00:05:49.259> and<00:05:49.590> I<00:05:50.009> was<00:05:50.160> actually<00:05:50.310> surprised

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
streaks and I was actually surprised

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.640

because<00:05:51.180> it<00:05:51.479> didn't<00:05:51.810> leave<00:05:51.960> any<00:05:52.169> streaking

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
because it didn't leave any streaking

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270
