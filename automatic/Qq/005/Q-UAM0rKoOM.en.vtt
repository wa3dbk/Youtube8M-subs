00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.450
 this is the point selector that serves 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.240
 to select the basic points or 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.890
 utilities the flexible points or 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.960
 decoration 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.970
 note that the points are drawn in 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.220
 paris in the sector 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.859
 the red drawings are the points 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.680
 flexible and gray designs 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.240
 we have decorative points and the basic or 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.460
 utilities 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.770
 when you take the point selector 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.649
 to select a flexible point that 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.020
 you want to use ice and also the selector 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.570
 from point to point 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.600
 button to activate the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.030
 flexible in red you can generate 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.020
 by selector a little to the left or 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.440
 to the right 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.960
 depending on how you want the point 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.000
 to select the gray dots you want 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.180
 use the dot length selector 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.980
 again but this time it should be 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.049
 between 0 and 5 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.280
 depending on the outcome you will 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.280
 want to get from the point 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.979
 the basic sewing points were 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.729
 also called utility points 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.360
 among them are the straight zig zag points 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.030
 of invisible sheath and a lot of gizzard 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.270
 most of your seams will be made 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.520
 with the straight stitching on the needle plate 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.189
 you will find lines that serve as 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.509
 guides to help you guide the fabric in 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.820
 right direction 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.640
 depending on how much you want to stop 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.610
 edge in the seam the most 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.920
 used are one centimeter and one 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.110
 centimeter and a half that are here for 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.479
 start sewing lay the fabric 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.899
 on sharing and lowering and the lever 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.040
 sinner steps on the dildo pedal and does 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.110
 some points 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.020
 press the rewind lever to 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.570
 down and make some points back 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.940
 the points were stuck and not 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.280
 they neglected 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.660
 release lever a setback and the machine 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.660
 will sew forward again 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:22.690
 do the same to finish 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:27.310
 stitch to remove the seam from the 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:30.010
 turn the steering wheel toward you. 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.250
 until the needle is in the 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.940
 high and continues to spin until the needle 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.459
 start going down again 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.070
 raise your shoe and remove your 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.640
 machine to cut lines 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.920
 pulls down the leading sneaker 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.950
 to the left side of the back of the machine 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.380
 and pass the cut wire to use the room 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.660
 this way the lines stayed with the 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.850
 ideal length and did not leave the 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.610
 position to start a new 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.530
 zig zag stitching is also used 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.290
 to make the point signed in 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.390
 machine applications 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.550
 the width of the zig zag field must be 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.350
 regulated in accordance with the appearance 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.420
 do you want to give to the project? 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.760
 the length of how much must be the smallest 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.739
 possible so that you can not 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.650
 see the fabric between the stitches 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.290
 multipurpose point and design is used 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.739
 usually to be seen and to do 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.350
 serving patches put a fabric 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.540
 as reinforcement in the inside out to shallow 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.600
 stabilize work 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.360
 stitch over the center of the tear now 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.550
 stitch again on each side of the tear 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.769
 to ensure it will not unconfigure 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.050
 to make a patch 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.580
 place a flap over the hole of the 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.540
 fabric 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.400
 sew around the flap and finish off 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.530
 use the narrowest point if you 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.530
 prefer that the seam is stronger 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.550
 flexible stitches are used 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.380
 mainly for knitting and 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.870
 elastic tissues such as those 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.810
 used to make knitted t-shirts 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.390
 of cotton beachwear and washing the 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.180
 Flexible stitches include straight stitching 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.090
 elastic the rick here the type point 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.460
 overlock inclined to external point 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.920
 feather and elastic stitch of basting 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.890
 let's take a closer look at some of these points 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.560
 face see the elastic point of basting 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.530
 makes a posture and the finish at the same 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.690
 time is great for sewing fabrics 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.420
 which require that the 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.120
 company elasticity make 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:44.960
 seam at the edge of the fabric and cut the 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.000
 excess fabric when you finish 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.580
 the weather is great for applying a 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.560
 elastic in beach fashion with lingerie and 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.780
 even in children's clothing 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.090
 pass the elastic through the hole of the 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.970
 Sneaker bringing back the 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.790
 hold the tip of the elastic with 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.590
 one hand and pull the other side with the other 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.800
 hand toward you 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.780
 pulling on the elastic while sewing the 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.300
 will follow the elasticity of the 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.300
 elastic fabric in final result 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.920
 negative points are used 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.230
 mainly to decorate their 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.720
 works with the wide variety of 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.730
 lines and colors you can 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.560
 transform the appearance of dots 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.050
 also combining points 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.870
 you can create nozzle effects between 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.630
 mails and in some other decorations 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.730
 utilitarian and flexible points can be 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.700
 used as decorative dots 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.230
 let's see some of these points 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.660
 with a thicker line 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.670
 such as for example stitching you 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.870
 you'll be able to create a beautiful 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.940
 increasing point 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.980
 do not forget to use a needle 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.360
 thick so the line passes through it 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.790
 more easily 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.450
 the last between the screen not sticky and 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:04.430
 stitching to remove tissue cutting stabilizer 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.690
 around the point with a pair of scissors to 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.690
 fine needle embroidery 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:17.940
 you can also sew on ribbons 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:20.560
 and edges use polyester rayon line 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.020
 to match the brightness similar to the 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.090
 of the tape 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.460
 try making new point combinations 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.100
 and different clinicians 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:35.080
 perfect in the decoration of your home clothes 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:37.630
 and handicrafts will earn several points 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.120
 look totally different if you 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:43.690
 use thicker line on the coil as 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:46.510
 an embroidery line could crochet fill to 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.350
 cop out and sew the wrong side of 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.500
 job 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:54.450
 the result will be a beautiful 3D way 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.450
 on the right side of work
