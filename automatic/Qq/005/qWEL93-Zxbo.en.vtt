hi<00:00:00.269> everyone<00:00:00.480> this<00:00:00.570> is<00:00:00.810> Nathan<00:00:01.079> with<00:00:01.199> the

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:01.290 
hi everyone this is Nathan with the

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.439 
hi everyone this is Nathan with the
e-book<00:00:01.500> reader<00:00:01.740> comm<00:00:02.220> for<00:00:02.970> this<00:00:03.090> review<00:00:03.330> I

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
e-book reader comm for this review I

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:04.910 
e-book reader comm for this review I
thought<00:00:03.659> I'd<00:00:03.750> go<00:00:03.899> ahead<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:04.110> do<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.410> comparison

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
thought I'd go ahead and do a comparison

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.039 
thought I'd go ahead and do a comparison
between<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.190> Kobo<00:00:05.580> aura<00:00:05.759> HD<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.660> Kobo

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
between the Kobo aura HD and the Kobo

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.129 
between the Kobo aura HD and the Kobo
Glo<00:00:07.099> so<00:00:08.099> obviously<00:00:08.670> both<00:00:09.090> devices<00:00:09.660> from<00:00:09.750> Kobo

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
Glo so obviously both devices from Kobo

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.589 
Glo so obviously both devices from Kobo
there<00:00:10.590> are<00:00:10.800> like<00:00:11.070> 95%<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.030> same<00:00:12.269> they<00:00:12.450> got

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
there are like 95% the same they got

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.600 
there are like 95% the same they got
like<00:00:12.809> basically<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.380> same<00:00:13.500> software<00:00:13.920> there

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
like basically the same software there

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.039 
like basically the same software there
is<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.759> few<00:00:15.030> subtle<00:00:15.210> differences<00:00:15.690> though<00:00:15.839> so

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
is a few subtle differences though so

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.359 
is a few subtle differences though so
I'm<00:00:16.170> gonna<00:00:16.320> go<00:00:16.410> ahead<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.830> point<00:00:17.039> those<00:00:17.250> out

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
I'm gonna go ahead and point those out

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.220 
I'm gonna go ahead and point those out
to<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.640> right<00:00:17.670> here<00:00:17.940> okay<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.840> first

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
to you right here okay so the first

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.439 
to you right here okay so the first
thing<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.710> with<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.070> front<00:00:20.310> lighting<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:21.240> just

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
thing is with the front lighting it just

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.310 
thing is with the front lighting it just
looks<00:00:21.660> different<00:00:21.810> when<00:00:22.170> they're

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
looks different when they're

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.040 
looks different when they're
side-by-side<00:00:22.580> this<00:00:23.580> one<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.269> Kobo<00:00:24.480> Glo<00:00:24.570> looks

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
side-by-side this one the Kobo Glo looks

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.080 
side-by-side this one the Kobo Glo looks
a<00:00:25.199> little<00:00:25.320> bit<00:00:25.529> brighter<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.640> light<00:00:26.670> just

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
a little bit brighter the light just

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.640 
a little bit brighter the light just
looks<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.390> little<00:00:27.420> bit<00:00:27.660> brighter<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.140> kind<00:00:28.590> of

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
looks a little bit brighter I kind of

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.450 
looks a little bit brighter I kind of
like<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.640> light<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.869> Kobo<00:00:31.289> or<00:00:31.920> HD<00:00:32.430> a

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
like the light on the Kobo or HD a

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
like the light on the Kobo or HD a
little<00:00:32.610> better<00:00:32.850> though<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.059> can't<00:00:33.329> really

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
little better though you can't really

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.870 
little better though you can't really
see<00:00:33.719> any<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.380> brighter<00:00:34.860> areas<00:00:35.309> along<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
see any of the brighter areas along the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.819 
see any of the brighter areas along the
bottom<00:00:36.149> or<00:00:36.390> anything<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:37.260> seems<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.680> like

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
bottom or anything it seems to be like

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.830 
bottom or anything it seems to be like
it's<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.250> little<00:00:38.460> bit<00:00:38.550> more<00:00:38.730> uniform<00:00:39.030> it's

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
it's just a little bit more uniform it's

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.930 
it's just a little bit more uniform it's
not<00:00:39.989> quite<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.260> bright<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.739> said<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.760> as

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
not quite as bright like I said so as

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.940 
not quite as bright like I said so as
far<00:00:42.120> as<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.570> screen<00:00:43.140> resolution<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.800> one's

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
far as the screen resolution this one's

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.139 
far as the screen resolution this one's
got<00:00:44.100> higher<00:00:44.280> screen<00:00:44.520> resolution<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.030> got

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
got higher screen resolution it's got

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.130 
got higher screen resolution it's got
the<00:00:45.210> bigger<00:00:45.420> screen<00:00:45.600> size<00:00:45.690> we've<00:00:46.020> got

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the bigger screen size we've got

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.170 
the bigger screen size we've got
six-point<00:00:46.559> ATM<00:00:46.800> screen<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.550> has<00:00:47.640> got<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> six

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
six-point ATM screen this has got a six

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.750 
six-point ATM screen this has got a six
inch<00:00:48.360> screen<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.050> one's<00:00:49.230> got<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.760> 1440

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
inch screen so this one's got the 1440

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.060 
inch screen so this one's got the 1440
by<00:00:50.789> 1080<00:00:51.390> resolution<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:52.410> one's<00:00:52.649> got<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
by 1080 resolution this one's got the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.240 
by 1080 resolution this one's got the
what<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.670> 1024<00:00:54.510> by<00:00:54.690> seven<00:00:55.140> fifty<00:00:55.410> eight<00:00:55.590> so

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
what is it 1024 by seven fifty eight so

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.709 
what is it 1024 by seven fifty eight so
we<00:00:56.370> get<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> little<00:00:56.610> bit<00:00:56.789> more<00:00:57.030> pixel<00:00:57.390> density

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
we get a little bit more pixel density

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.090 
we get a little bit more pixel density
on<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:57.930> one<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.649> kind<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.859> hard<00:00:58.920> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
on this one but it's kind of hard to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.830 
on this one but it's kind of hard to
tell<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> guess<00:00:59.430> both<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.449> them<00:01:00.539> look<00:01:00.660> really

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
tell I guess both of them look really

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.090 
tell I guess both of them look really
good<00:01:00.960> they<00:01:01.170> guess<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.500> one<00:01:01.620> does<00:01:01.800> look<00:01:01.829> a

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
good they guess this one does look a

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.070 
good they guess this one does look a
little<00:01:02.399> bit<00:01:02.550> crisper<00:01:03.000> than<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.480> you

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
little bit crisper than this one so you

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.899 
little bit crisper than this one so you
can't<00:01:04.320> kind<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.890> can't<00:01:05.100> see<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> little<00:01:05.519> bit<00:01:05.700> of

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
can't kind of can't see a little bit of

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.219 
can't kind of can't see a little bit of
a<00:01:06.000> difference<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> hard<00:01:06.689> thing<00:01:06.869> though<00:01:07.020> is

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
a difference the hard thing though is

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.320 
a difference the hard thing though is
getting<00:01:07.830> these<00:01:08.010> two<00:01:08.250> font<00:01:08.549> sizes<00:01:08.790> set<00:01:09.119> up<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
getting these two font sizes set up the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.940 
getting these two font sizes set up the
same<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> different<00:01:10.770> screen

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
same so with the different screen

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.590 
same so with the different screen
resolution<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.610> don't<00:01:11.760> think<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> fonts<00:01:12.479> are

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
resolution I don't think the fonts are

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.750 
resolution I don't think the fonts are
you<00:01:12.689> exactly<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.320> same<00:01:13.500> size<00:01:13.760> looking

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
you exactly the same size looking

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.980 
you exactly the same size looking
closely<00:01:14.970> these<00:01:15.270> ones<00:01:15.479> look<00:01:15.509> pretty<00:01:15.810> darn

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
closely these ones look pretty darn

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.390 
closely these ones look pretty darn
close<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.439> same<00:01:16.619> size<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.070> think<00:01:17.189> this

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
close to the same size so I think this

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.399 
close to the same size so I think this
will<00:01:17.520> be<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> good<00:01:17.850> comparison<00:01:18.299> I've<00:01:19.110> got<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
will be a good comparison I've got the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.899 
will be a good comparison I've got the
same<00:01:19.619> book<00:01:19.830> loaded<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:20.369> as<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.580> see<00:01:20.790> you

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
same book loaded here as you can see you

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.910 
same book loaded here as you can see you
the<00:01:21.000> same<00:01:21.180> font<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.290> same<00:01:22.500> everything's

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the same font and the same everything's

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.870 
the same font and the same everything's
tuned<00:01:23.159> -<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:24.000> comparable<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:26.340> ends

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
tuned - so it's comparable the this ends

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.359 
tuned - so it's comparable the this ends
here<00:01:27.000> ends<00:01:27.810> up<00:01:27.930> here<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.920> right<00:01:29.189> here

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
here ends up here like just right here

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.490 
here ends up here like just right here
where<00:01:29.549> says<00:01:29.759> slow<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.020> we've<00:01:31.170> getting

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
where says slow and and so we've getting

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.100 
where says slow and and so we've getting
all<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.979> extra<00:01:32.390> real<00:01:33.390> estate<00:01:33.600> here<00:01:33.810> as<00:01:33.900> far

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
all this extra real estate here as far

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.870 
all this extra real estate here as far
as<00:01:34.170> comparing<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> Kobo<00:01:35.460> Glo

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
as comparing it to the Kobo Glo

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.520 
as comparing it to the Kobo Glo
you<00:01:36.299> see<00:01:36.630> my<00:01:36.780> other<00:01:36.900> comparison<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
you see my other comparison with the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.960 
you see my other comparison with the
Kindle<00:01:37.799> paperwhite<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.310> difference<00:01:38.610> wasn't

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
Kindle paperwhite the difference wasn't

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.569 
Kindle paperwhite the difference wasn't
really<00:01:39.210> as<00:01:39.570> significant<00:01:40.560> because<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.070> Kindle

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
really as significant because the Kindle

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.740 
really as significant because the Kindle
paperwhite<00:01:41.670> doesn't<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.450> dead

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
paperwhite doesn't have all this dead

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.660 
paperwhite doesn't have all this dead
space<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.409> headers<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.159> footers<00:01:44.220> like

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
space with the headers and footers like

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.700 
space with the headers and footers like
the<00:01:44.790> Kobo<00:01:45.240> does<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.659> really<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.439> Kindle

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
the Kobo does so really the Kindle

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.770 
the Kobo does so really the Kindle
almost<00:01:47.100> fits<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.399> as<00:01:47.610> much<00:01:47.790> text<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
almost fits just as much text on the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020 
almost fits just as much text on the
screen<00:01:49.020> has<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.470> Kobo<00:01:50.100> aura<00:01:50.250> HD<00:01:50.729> even<00:01:50.970> though

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
screen has the Kobo aura HD even though

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.609 
screen has the Kobo aura HD even though
it's<00:01:51.180> got<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> bigger<00:01:51.630> screen<00:01:51.990> size<00:01:52.020> here<00:01:52.500> so

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
it's got the bigger screen size here so

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.440 
it's got the bigger screen size here so
let<00:01:53.250> me<00:01:53.310> go<00:01:53.430> ahead<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.670> tweak<00:01:54.030> with<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.299> light

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
let me go ahead and tweak with the light

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.850 
let me go ahead and tweak with the light
settings<00:01:54.810> here<00:01:54.990> just<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.320> show<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.500> some<00:01:55.770> of

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
settings here just to show you some of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.550 
settings here just to show you some of
the<00:01:55.950> differences<00:01:56.399> with<00:01:56.640> them<00:01:57.479> both<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.530> them

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the differences with them both of them

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.039 
the differences with them both of them
right<00:01:58.770> now<00:01:58.829> are<00:01:59.009> set<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.640> maximum<00:02:00.210> one<00:02:00.840> thing

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
right now are set to maximum one thing

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.539 
right now are set to maximum one thing
with<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> or<00:02:01.619> HD<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.189> gotta<00:02:02.310> hit<00:02:02.430> that

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
with the or HD is you gotta hit that

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.160 
with the or HD is you gotta hit that
little<00:02:02.759> icon<00:02:03.060> up<00:02:03.210> there<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.570> menu<00:02:03.840> systems

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
little icon up there the menu systems

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.270 
little icon up there the menu systems
mostly<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.590> same<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> little<00:02:05.100> bit

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
mostly the same but it's a little bit

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.950 
mostly the same but it's a little bit
different<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.030> Kobo<00:02:06.270> Glo<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.630> brightness

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
different on the Kobo Glo the brightness

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.210 
different on the Kobo Glo the brightness
indicator<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.439> always<00:02:07.649> down<00:02:07.799> here<00:02:07.829> at<00:02:08.129> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
indicator is always down here at the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.900 
indicator is always down here at the
bottom<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:08.879> we<00:02:09.660> can

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
bottom so we can

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.400 
bottom so we can
a<00:02:09.940> head<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.330> just<00:02:10.510> adjust<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:11.050> that's<00:02:11.230> way

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
a head and just adjust it that's way

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.630 
a head and just adjust it that's way
where<00:02:11.650> this<00:02:11.800> one<00:02:11.980> we<00:02:12.100> need<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.250> bring<00:02:12.460> it<00:02:12.580> up

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
where this one we need to bring it up

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.840 
where this one we need to bring it up
from<00:02:12.910> up<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.330> top

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.920 

so<00:02:18.850> here's<00:02:19.120> both<00:02:19.450> about<00:02:19.780> 50%<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:22.420> Kobo

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
so here's both about 50% the Kobo

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.810 
so here's both about 50% the Kobo
doesn't<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.500> Kobo<00:02:23.980> doesn't<00:02:24.280> given<00:02:24.550> a

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
doesn't that Kobo doesn't given a

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.780 
doesn't that Kobo doesn't given a
percentage<00:02:25.450> whereas<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:27.280> one<00:02:27.460> does<00:02:27.610> but

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
percentage whereas the this one does but

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.610 
percentage whereas the this one does but
this<00:02:27.910> percentage<00:02:28.630> doesn't<00:02:28.990> update<00:02:29.170> when<00:02:29.530> you

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
this percentage doesn't update when you

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.530 
this percentage doesn't update when you
adjust<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:30.160> you<00:02:30.220> still<00:02:30.400> says<00:02:30.550> 56<00:02:31.030> unless<00:02:31.390> I

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
adjust it so you still says 56 unless I

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.360 
adjust it so you still says 56 unless I
slide<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:31.990> but<00:02:32.440> if<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:32.590> use<00:02:32.620> these<00:02:32.890> little<00:02:32.950> deals

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
slide it but if I use these little deals

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.850 
slide it but if I use these little deals
it<00:02:33.580> doesn't<00:02:33.850> update<00:02:34.000> still<00:02:34.420> so<00:02:34.600> sighs<00:02:34.900> 53%<00:02:35.680> but

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
it doesn't update still so sighs 53% but

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.040 
it doesn't update still so sighs 53% but
so<00:02:36.730> I<00:02:36.760> think<00:02:36.850> we're<00:02:37.090> both<00:02:37.210> roughly<00:02:37.660> about<00:02:37.750> half

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
so I think we're both roughly about half

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.320 
so I think we're both roughly about half
half<00:02:38.740> right<00:02:38.980> there<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.310> Kobo<00:02:39.610> Glo<00:02:39.640> does<00:02:40.120> still

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
half right there the Kobo Glo does still

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.570 
half right there the Kobo Glo does still
assume<00:02:40.720> like<00:02:40.900> it's<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.140> little<00:02:41.320> bit<00:02:41.580> brighter

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
assume like it's a little bit brighter

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.830 
assume like it's a little bit brighter
let's<00:02:42.880> go<00:02:42.970> ahead<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.360> turn<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.630> light<00:02:43.810> off

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
let's go ahead and turn the light off

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.240 
let's go ahead and turn the light off
just<00:02:44.290> so<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.530> can<00:02:44.620> get<00:02:44.770> an<00:02:44.830> idea<00:02:44.920> what<00:02:45.190> it

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
just so you can get an idea what it

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.760 
just so you can get an idea what it
looks<00:02:45.280> like<00:02:45.490> with<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.760> light<00:02:45.940> off

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.350 

all<00:02:50.770> right<00:02:50.980> so<00:02:51.190> both<00:02:51.400> devices<00:02:51.700> they<00:02:52.030> do<00:02:52.090> look

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
all right so both devices they do look

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.750 
all right so both devices they do look
good<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.780> for<00:02:53.350> nighttime<00:02:53.680> reading<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.430> Kobo

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
good and for nighttime reading the Kobo

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.220 
good and for nighttime reading the Kobo
Glo<00:02:54.790> does<00:02:55.270> it's<00:02:55.510> gonna<00:02:55.660> have<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.870> different

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
Glo does it's gonna have a different

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.630 
Glo does it's gonna have a different
color<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.740> this<00:02:56.890> one<00:02:57.070> that's<00:02:57.250> just<00:02:57.490> a

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
color to it this one that's just a

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.120 
color to it this one that's just a
slight<00:02:58.090> more<00:02:58.450> yellowish<00:02:59.410> in<00:02:59.620> tone<00:02:59.800> it<00:02:59.950> seems

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
slight more yellowish in tone it seems

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.010 
slight more yellowish in tone it seems
like<00:03:00.340> this<00:03:00.520> is<00:03:00.640> just<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.910> slight<00:03:01.210> bluer<00:03:01.570> in<00:03:01.810> tone

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
like this is just a slight bluer in tone

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.660 
like this is just a slight bluer in tone
so<00:03:02.290> there's<00:03:03.010> definitely<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.400> slight

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
so there's definitely a slight

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.980 
so there's definitely a slight
difference<00:03:04.030> with<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.270> front<00:03:04.480> lights<00:03:04.660> I<00:03:04.780> think

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
difference with the front lights I think

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.840 
difference with the front lights I think
that<00:03:05.140> probably<00:03:05.440> goes<00:03:05.650> if<00:03:06.130> we<00:03:06.280> had<00:03:06.370> two<00:03:06.490> couple

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
that probably goes if we had two couple

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.100 
that probably goes if we had two couple
glows<00:03:07.000> comparing<00:03:07.600> them<00:03:07.690> side<00:03:07.720> by<00:03:07.990> side

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
glows comparing them side by side

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.480 
glows comparing them side by side
there's<00:03:08.470> probably<00:03:08.740> a<00:03:08.800> slight<00:03:09.070> difference<00:03:09.400> in

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
there's probably a slight difference in

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.280 
there's probably a slight difference in
the<00:03:09.550> tone<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:09.970> glow<00:03:10.570> light<00:03:10.780> with<00:03:10.900> them<00:03:11.080> too

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
the tone of the glow light with them too

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.170 
the tone of the glow light with them too
so<00:03:11.560> I<00:03:11.740> think<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.250> all<00:03:12.370> just<00:03:12.550> sorta<00:03:12.790> depends

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
so I think that all just sorta depends

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.960 
so I think that all just sorta depends
on<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.959> individual<00:03:14.680> device<00:03:14.980> itself<00:03:15.430> we<00:03:15.880> go

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
on the individual device itself we go

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.040 
on the individual device itself we go
ahead<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.209> show<00:03:16.330> a<00:03:16.360> couple<00:03:16.660> other<00:03:16.870> different

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
ahead and show a couple other different

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.630 
ahead and show a couple other different
font<00:03:17.470> there<00:03:17.980> are<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.070> couple<00:03:18.220> of<00:03:18.310> different

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
font there are a couple of different

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.610 
font there are a couple of different
light<00:03:18.820> adjustments<00:03:19.420> here<00:03:19.660> let's<00:03:20.410> go<00:03:20.530> ahead

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
light adjustments here let's go ahead

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.740 
light adjustments here let's go ahead
and<00:03:20.800> go<00:03:20.920> all<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.160> way<00:03:21.190> down<00:03:21.400> to<00:03:21.550> minimum<00:03:24.750> so

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
and go all the way down to minimum so

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.270 
and go all the way down to minimum so
yeah<00:03:25.959> definitely<00:03:26.170> brighter<00:03:26.650> on<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:26.890> Kobo<00:03:27.250> Glo

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
yeah definitely brighter on the Kobo Glo

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.400 
yeah definitely brighter on the Kobo Glo
than<00:03:27.610> it<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:27.790> on<00:03:27.820> the<00:03:28.060> Kobo<00:03:28.330> or<00:03:28.480> HD<00:03:28.900> as<00:03:28.959> far<00:03:29.320> as

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
than it is on the Kobo or HD as far as

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.990 
than it is on the Kobo or HD as far as
the<00:03:29.500> minimum<00:03:29.830> brightness<00:03:29.980> thing

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.160 

so<00:03:37.000> yeah<00:03:37.240> the<00:03:37.510> one<00:03:37.750> thing<00:03:37.900> some<00:03:38.140> people

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
so yeah the one thing some people

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.050 
so yeah the one thing some people
complained<00:03:38.650> about<00:03:38.710> with<00:03:39.010> this<00:03:39.190> is<00:03:39.400> being<00:03:39.640> the

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
complained about with this is being the

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.640 
complained about with this is being the
Kobo<00:03:40.270> Glo<00:03:40.360> is<00:03:40.690> that<00:03:40.840> it<00:03:40.900> was<00:03:40.990> too<00:03:41.170> bright<00:03:41.440> a

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
Kobo Glo is that it was too bright a

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.470 
Kobo Glo is that it was too bright a
little<00:03:41.920> bit<00:03:42.040> when<00:03:42.280> you're<00:03:42.370> reading<00:03:42.520> it<00:03:42.700> at

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
little bit when you're reading it at

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.850 
little bit when you're reading it at
night<00:03:43.840> with<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.260> brightness<00:03:44.620> turned<00:03:44.650> all

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
night with the brightness turned all

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.590 
night with the brightness turned all
weird<00:03:45.010> on<00:03:45.100> so<00:03:45.310> definitely<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.790> Kobo<00:03:46.030> or<00:03:46.210> HD

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
weird on so definitely the Kobo or HD

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.870 
weird on so definitely the Kobo or HD
has<00:03:46.720> a<00:03:46.750> little<00:03:47.020> bit<00:03:47.140> more<00:03:47.290> of<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.560> dim<00:03:48.340> tune<00:03:48.640> it

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
has a little bit more of a dim tune it

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.610 
has a little bit more of a dim tune it
dimness<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:49.930> then<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.590> Kobo<00:03:51.040> Glo<00:03:51.070> does

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
dimness to it and then the Kobo Glo does

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.690 
dimness to it and then the Kobo Glo does
so<00:03:53.620> let's<00:03:53.800> get<00:03:53.920> these<00:03:54.040> lights<00:03:54.280> all<00:03:54.520> the<00:03:54.610> way

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
so let's get these lights all the way

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.420 
so let's get these lights all the way
back<00:03:54.880> up<00:03:55.560> so<00:03:56.560> we<00:03:56.710> can<00:03:56.830> see<00:03:56.980> them<00:03:57.130> again<00:03:57.220> I'll

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
back up so we can see them again I'll

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.130 
back up so we can see them again I'll
turn<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.670> light<00:03:57.820> back<00:03:57.970> on<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:58.630> we'll<00:03:58.750> go<00:03:58.870> over

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
turn the light back on and we'll go over

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.240 
turn the light back on and we'll go over
a<00:03:59.290> couple<00:03:59.440> of<00:03:59.710> the<00:03:59.800> other<00:03:59.980> software

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
a couple of the other software

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.600 
a couple of the other software
differences<00:04:01.000> there<00:04:01.480> is<00:04:01.510> a<00:04:01.630> much<00:04:01.870> like<00:04:02.170> I<00:04:02.290> said

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
differences there is a much like I said

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.130 
differences there is a much like I said
we've<00:04:03.610> got<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.910> same<00:04:04.060> sort<00:04:04.330> of<00:04:04.360> fun<00:04:04.600> obviously

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
we've got the same sort of fun obviously

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.560 
we've got the same sort of fun obviously
same<00:04:05.380> photo<00:04:05.620> sort<00:04:06.010> of<00:04:06.070> fun<00:04:06.280> Sega<00:04:06.640> lections<00:04:07.180> you

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
same photo sort of fun Sega lections you

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.900 
same photo sort of fun Sega lections you
can<00:04:07.690> come<00:04:07.870> in<00:04:08.020> here<00:04:08.130> fine-tune<00:04:09.130> exactly<00:04:09.700> like

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
can come in here fine-tune exactly like

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.910 
can come in here fine-tune exactly like
you<00:04:10.030> can<00:04:10.150> see<00:04:10.270> I<00:04:10.300> had<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:10.510> get<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.750> flop<00:04:10.959> higher

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
you can see I had to get the flop higher

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.590 
you can see I had to get the flop higher
on<00:04:12.130> this<00:04:12.220> one<00:04:12.400> just<00:04:12.610> to<00:04:12.670> get<00:04:12.820> it<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:12.940> match<00:04:13.330> that

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
on this one just to get it to match that

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
on this one just to get it to match that
one<00:04:13.720> just<00:04:13.900> because<00:04:14.140> of<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.380> screen

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
one just because of the screen

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.740 
one just because of the screen
resolution<00:04:14.770> differences<00:04:15.430> I<00:04:15.489> guess<00:04:15.700> as<00:04:16.239> far<00:04:16.570> as

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
resolution differences I guess as far as

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.449 
resolution differences I guess as far as
that<00:04:16.900> goes<00:04:16.959> we<00:04:17.260> also<00:04:17.440> go<00:04:17.650> obviously<00:04:17.739> go<00:04:18.100> into

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
that goes we also go obviously go into

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.069 
that goes we also go obviously go into
the<00:04:18.579> advanced<00:04:18.880> settings<00:04:19.269> so<00:04:19.690> if<00:04:19.780> you<00:04:19.870> wanted

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
the advanced settings so if you wanted

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.140 
the advanced settings so if you wanted
to<00:04:20.140> make<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.500> font<00:04:20.709> darker<00:04:21.250> you<00:04:21.700> can<00:04:21.730> go<00:04:21.940> ahead

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
to make the font darker you can go ahead

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.610 
to make the font darker you can go ahead
and<00:04:22.360> just<00:04:22.540> adjust<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:23.080> weight<00:04:23.230> of<00:04:23.380> it<00:04:23.500> right

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
and just adjust the weight of it right

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.050 
and just adjust the weight of it right
here<00:04:23.830> apparently<00:04:24.340> I<00:04:24.550> didn't<00:04:24.730> hit<00:04:24.820> that<00:04:24.970> one

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
here apparently I didn't hit that one

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.890 
here apparently I didn't hit that one
good<00:04:25.210> enough<00:04:27.060> so<00:04:28.060> yeah<00:04:28.240> that's<00:04:28.600> one<00:04:28.750> cool

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
good enough so yeah that's one cool

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.120 
good enough so yeah that's one cool
thing<00:04:29.080> about<00:04:29.169> colors<00:04:29.530> you<00:04:29.650> can<00:04:29.770> adjust<00:04:30.010> the

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
thing about colors you can adjust the

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.370 
thing about colors you can adjust the
weight<00:04:30.340> so<00:04:30.640> I<00:04:30.669> make<00:04:31.060> it<00:04:31.090> nice<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.360> dark<00:04:31.720> you

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
weight so I make it nice and dark you

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.420 
weight so I make it nice and dark you
can<00:04:32.530> tell<00:04:32.680> right<00:04:32.710> here<00:04:32.919> in<00:04:32.980> the<00:04:33.040> preview<00:04:33.370> that

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
can tell right here in the preview that

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.620 
can tell right here in the preview that
it's<00:04:33.580> going<00:04:33.669> to<00:04:33.730> be<00:04:33.820> darker<00:04:34.150> we<00:04:34.270> go<00:04:34.419> ahead<00:04:34.510> and

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
it's going to be darker we go ahead and

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.530 
it's going to be darker we go ahead and
fly<00:04:34.870> that<00:04:35.640> and<00:04:36.640> you<00:04:36.820> can<00:04:36.970> make<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.180> text<00:04:37.360> a

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
fly that and you can make the text a

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.700 
fly that and you can make the text a
little<00:04:37.600> bit<00:04:37.840> darker<00:04:38.110> it's<00:04:38.230> gets<00:04:38.380> a<00:04:38.440> little<00:04:38.620> bit

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
little bit darker it's gets a little bit

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.500 
little bit darker it's gets a little bit
rougher<00:04:38.980> that<00:04:39.130> way<00:04:39.250> but<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:39.580> can<00:04:39.700> find<00:04:40.210> tuna

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
rougher that way but you can find tuna

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.020 
rougher that way but you can find tuna
with<00:04:40.630> these<00:04:40.780> sharpness<00:04:41.340> so<00:04:42.340> one<00:04:42.669> thing<00:04:42.880> I'm

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
with these sharpness so one thing I'm

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.510 
with these sharpness so one thing I'm
noticing<00:04:43.180> here<00:04:43.540> I'm<00:04:43.660> kind<00:04:43.840> of<00:04:43.870> at<00:04:43.990> an<00:04:44.110> angle

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
noticing here I'm kind of at an angle

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.500 
noticing here I'm kind of at an angle
viewing<00:04:45.520> these<00:04:45.669> two<00:04:45.880> devices<00:04:46.090> with<00:04:46.390> this

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
viewing these two devices with this

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.740 
viewing these two devices with this
review<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.919> Cobos<00:04:48.250> glow<00:04:48.760> screen<00:04:49.210> is<00:04:49.690> a

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
review and the Cobos glow screen is a

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.570 
review and the Cobos glow screen is a
little<00:04:50.110> bit<00:04:50.229> fuzzier<00:04:50.710> in<00:04:50.890> appearance<00:04:51.280> when

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
little bit fuzzier in appearance when

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.670 
little bit fuzzier in appearance when
you're<00:04:51.700> kind<00:04:51.910> of<00:04:52.000> looking<00:04:52.180> at<00:04:52.300> an<00:04:52.510> angle<00:04:52.900> the

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
you're kind of looking at an angle the

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.230 
you're kind of looking at an angle the
Kobo<00:04:54.010> or<00:04:54.190> HD<00:04:54.610> is<00:04:54.669> a<00:04:54.760> little<00:04:54.910> bit<00:04:55.000> clearer

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
Kobo or HD is a little bit clearer

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.790 
Kobo or HD is a little bit clearer
you're<00:04:55.780> not<00:04:55.870> gonna<00:04:55.960> be<00:04:56.050> reading<00:04:56.229> an<00:04:56.380> angle<00:04:56.710> so

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
you're not gonna be reading an angle so

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.600 
you're not gonna be reading an angle so
I<00:04:56.860> don't<00:04:57.040> know<00:04:57.100> if<00:04:57.160> that<00:04:57.280> makes<00:04:57.400> much

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
I don't know if that makes much

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.730 
I don't know if that makes much
difference<00:04:57.640> but<00:04:58.320> something<00:04:59.320> to<00:04:59.380> do<00:04:59.500> with<00:04:59.620> the

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
difference but something to do with the

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.890 
difference but something to do with the
Kobo<00:04:59.919> or<00:05:00.220> HD<00:05:00.820> screen<00:05:01.060> does<00:05:01.360> other<00:05:01.810> than

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
Kobo or HD screen does other than

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.170 
Kobo or HD screen does other than
obviously<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:02.830> increased<00:05:03.460> resolution<00:05:03.729> it

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
obviously the increased resolution it

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.640 
obviously the increased resolution it
does<00:05:04.330> seem<00:05:04.540> a<00:05:04.570> little<00:05:04.660> bit<00:05:04.870> clearer<00:05:05.290> it<00:05:05.500> seems

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
does seem a little bit clearer it seems

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.530 
does seem a little bit clearer it seems
like<00:05:05.770> the<00:05:05.890> light<00:05:06.070> layers<00:05:06.310> just<00:05:06.400> a<00:05:06.700> tad<00:05:07.240> clear

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
like the light layers just a tad clear

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.690 
like the light layers just a tad clear
or<00:05:07.660> two<00:05:07.810> I'm<00:05:07.990> not<00:05:08.140> entirely<00:05:08.380> sure<00:05:08.530> but<00:05:08.950> it

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
or two I'm not entirely sure but it

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.010 
or two I'm not entirely sure but it
definitely<00:05:10.060> does<00:05:10.210> just<00:05:10.540> have<00:05:10.660> a<00:05:10.690> little<00:05:10.930> bit

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
definitely does just have a little bit

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.500 
definitely does just have a little bit
more<00:05:11.169> of<00:05:11.260> a<00:05:11.350> clearer<00:05:11.590> look<00:05:12.190> to<00:05:12.430> it<00:05:12.550> so<00:05:12.729> as<00:05:13.300> far

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
more of a clearer look to it so as far

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.000 
more of a clearer look to it so as far
as<00:05:13.570> the<00:05:13.780> reading<00:05:14.020> features<00:05:14.410> go<00:05:14.590> I<00:05:14.620> mean<00:05:14.919> you

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010

of basic exact software I mean like I

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.239 
of basic exact software I mean like I
said<00:06:53.990> there's<00:06:54.229> a<00:06:54.259> couple<00:06:54.439> of<00:06:54.680> subtle

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
differences like the lighting power here

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.839 
differences like the lighting power here
you<00:06:57.199> can<00:06:57.349> have<00:06:57.409> it<00:06:57.469> the<00:06:58.009> light<00:06:58.159> indicator<00:06:58.639> at

down<00:07:08.419> here<00:07:08.599> anyway<00:07:08.839> The<00:07:09.499> Cove<00:07:09.649> or<00:07:09.800> HD<00:07:10.129> it<00:07:10.219> just

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:10.399 
down here anyway The Cove or HD it just

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:13.389 
down here anyway The Cove or HD it just
leaves<00:07:10.849> it<00:07:10.969> clear<00:07:11.209> so<00:07:11.860> as<00:07:12.860> you<00:07:12.919> can<00:07:13.039> see<00:07:13.189> the

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:13.399 
leaves it clear so as you can see the

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:14.860 
leaves it clear so as you can see the
black<00:07:13.669> spot<00:07:13.939> gets<00:07:14.120> added<00:07:14.389> down<00:07:14.479> here<00:07:14.689> with

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:14.870 
black spot gets added down here with

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.149 
black spot gets added down here with
that<00:07:15.020> one<00:07:15.169> if<00:07:15.289> you<00:07:15.319> want<00:07:15.589> that<00:07:15.740> on<00:07:15.860> you<00:07:16.039> don't

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:16.159 
that one if you want that on you don't

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:18.249 
that one if you want that on you don't
have<00:07:16.279> to<00:07:16.370> have<00:07:16.459> it<00:07:16.550> on<00:07:16.669> of<00:07:16.819> course<00:07:16.849> so<00:07:17.839> there's

00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:18.259 
have to have it on of course so there's

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:19.629 
have to have it on of course so there's
just<00:07:18.349> a<00:07:18.529> couple<00:07:18.649> subtle<00:07:19.129> differences<00:07:19.580> between

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:19.639 
just a couple subtle differences between

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:20.980 
just a couple subtle differences between
the<00:07:19.999> software<00:07:20.389> there's<00:07:20.569> nothing<00:07:20.810> really

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:20.990 
the software there's nothing really

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.959 
the software there's nothing really
software<00:07:21.860> wise<00:07:22.069> that's<00:07:22.339> gonna<00:07:22.490> make<00:07:22.669> you<00:07:22.819> lean

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:22.969 
software wise that's gonna make you lean

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:24.850 
software wise that's gonna make you lean
over<00:07:23.180> one<00:07:23.509> device<00:07:23.749> over<00:07:24.080> the<00:07:24.199> other<00:07:24.499> I<00:07:24.620> mean

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:24.860 
over one device over the other I mean

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.529 
over one device over the other I mean
the<00:07:25.399> both<00:07:25.520> Kobo<00:07:25.789> e-reader<00:07:25.819> both<00:07:26.360> have

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:26.539 
the both Kobo e-reader both have

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:27.939 
the both Kobo e-reader both have
basically<00:07:26.839> same<00:07:27.110> features<00:07:27.469> it's<00:07:27.680> basically

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:27.949 
basically same features it's basically

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:30.579 
basically same features it's basically
just<00:07:28.729> the<00:07:28.819> screen<00:07:29.120> the<00:07:29.839> added<00:07:30.110> being<00:07:30.319> real

00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:30.589 
just the screen the added being real

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:31.809 
just the screen the added being real
estate<00:07:30.830> with<00:07:30.949> a<00:07:31.009> screen<00:07:31.249> you<00:07:31.279> get<00:07:31.520> on<00:07:31.699> the

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:31.819 
estate with a screen you get on the

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:33.249 
estate with a screen you get on the
Cobell<00:07:32.089> or<00:07:32.149> HD<00:07:32.479> obviously<00:07:32.839> got<00:07:32.959> the<00:07:32.990> different

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:33.259 
Cobell or HD obviously got the different

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:35.290 
Cobell or HD obviously got the different
home<00:07:33.349> screen<00:07:33.589> a<00:07:33.740> few<00:07:33.770> subtle<00:07:34.759> differences<00:07:35.089> but

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:35.300 
home screen a few subtle differences but

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.790 
home screen a few subtle differences but
basically<00:07:36.110> I<00:07:36.139> mean<00:07:36.379> you<00:07:36.499> get<00:07:36.620> the<00:07:36.709> high

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 
basically I mean you get the high

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.709 
basically I mean you get the high
resolution<00:07:36.979> screen<00:07:37.459> the<00:07:37.639> more<00:07:37.759> content<00:07:38.240> more

00:07:38.709 --> 00:07:38.719 
resolution screen the more content more

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:40.389 
resolution screen the more content more
text<00:07:39.080> on<00:07:39.199> screen<00:07:39.349> and<00:07:39.770> that's<00:07:39.860> basically<00:07:40.219> this

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:40.399 
text on screen and that's basically this

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:42.730 
text on screen and that's basically this
difference<00:07:40.999> between<00:07:41.270> these<00:07:41.360> two<00:07:41.539> devices<00:07:41.740> the

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:42.740 
difference between these two devices the

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.540 
difference between these two devices the
width<00:07:43.639> on<00:07:43.849> the<00:07:44.120> Koho<00:07:44.539> or<00:07:45.529> HD<00:07:46.069> is<00:07:46.219> a<00:07:46.249> little<00:07:46.459> bit

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:46.550 
width on the Koho or HD is a little bit

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.010 
width on the Koho or HD is a little bit
thicker<00:07:46.789> because<00:07:46.969> it's<00:07:47.180> got<00:07:47.330> this<00:07:47.449> contoured

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.020 
thicker because it's got this contoured

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.779 
thicker because it's got this contoured
back<00:07:48.259> where<00:07:48.560> your<00:07:48.919> fingers<00:07:49.310> kind<00:07:49.430> of<00:07:49.580> go<00:07:49.639> into

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:49.789 
back where your fingers kind of go into

00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:52.749 
back where your fingers kind of go into
this<00:07:49.969> groove<00:07:50.209> right<00:07:50.240> here<00:07:51.099> otherwise<00:07:52.099> the

00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:52.759 
this groove right here otherwise the

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:55.209 
this groove right here otherwise the
devices<00:07:53.240> are<00:07:53.389> the<00:07:53.479> same<00:07:53.689> basic<00:07:54.560> hardware<00:07:55.069> I

00:07:55.209 --> 00:07:55.219 
devices are the same basic hardware I

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:57.429 
devices are the same basic hardware I
mean<00:07:55.490> you've<00:07:55.639> got<00:07:55.789> the<00:07:55.909> same<00:07:56.229> processor<00:07:57.229> we've

00:07:57.429 --> 00:07:57.439 
mean you've got the same processor we've

00:07:57.439 --> 00:07:57.640 
mean you've got the same processor we've
got

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:57.650 
got

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.189 
got
the<00:07:57.740> same<00:07:57.919> micro<00:07:58.250> SD<00:07:58.550> card<00:07:58.790> slot<00:07:58.850> so<00:07:59.389> saving

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:00.199 
the same micro SD card slot so saving

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:03.250 
the same micro SD card slot so saving
touchscreen<00:08:00.680> technology
