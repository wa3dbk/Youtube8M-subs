 population demand in the developed world 

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:05.670
 very limited but the number of inhabitants 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.330
 poor countries increases 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.789
 rapid pace 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:10.129
 according to the Washington

 population statistics of less than 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.829
 in two years on our planet will 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.679
 live seven billion people

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.570
 land increases by 1 billion every 12 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:28.039
 years old 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.310
 although people have been flying the planet for millions of years 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.439
 their number reached first 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.890
 billion only the beginning of the nineteenth century 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.420
 in sub-saharan Africa the birth rate is always 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.370
 was a century 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.640
 and now there is a decline in mortality

 fight against the epidemic aids and malaria 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.490
 bears fruit according to forecasts 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.790
 the next 40 years the population of africa 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.790
 grow to 1 billion in full 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.800
 and now asks 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.989
 in nigeria for every woman accounted for

 average of 7 half children 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.390
 today 80 percent of all children 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.450
 the world live in africa and asia 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.250
 so extensive not to produce on 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.340
 segment of the population needs schools 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.120
 hospitals and eventually 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.470
 the workplace has always been a very good day 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.410

 most difficult problems to be 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.930
 to solve developing countries for luganchan 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.310

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.340
 not extinguished the state of them

 population size including 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.750
 educated people but they year 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.759
 purchase of shares 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.969
 meanwhile in developed countries 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.719
 fertility remains low especially in 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.200
 Europe and the Far East the smallest 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.420
 population growth in taiwan 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.340
 on average one child for each 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.590
 woman among the causes of declining fertility 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.119
 called factors such as migration 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.460
 population in cities and high 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.910
 public education 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.000
 two of the most populous 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.210
 countries of the world china and india soon 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.119
 swap places 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.639
 the very fight against even slightly 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.249
 so on the height of the twenties 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:14.229
 of our century that is quite soon 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:16.359
 India will come out on top by number 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.439
 residents beating China 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:19.919
 providing the population with food 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.820
 nutrition remains a challenge 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.570
 but as the hop hop cows in the world 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.570
 the result is not a food shortage lunch 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.529
 on your account of this instrumentation 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:32.689
 lusin here's europe is fan half 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:33.409
 population of developing 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.349
 countries lives by definition 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.419
 World Bank in the conditions of 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:38.220
 of poverty 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.760
 less than two dollars a day per person and this 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.110
 the group is rapidly growing demographers 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.570
 warn that such a trend 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.320
 especially in africa 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.689
 cause a rush of population in cities 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.439
 and those can turn into bad 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:52.229
 managed megacities with 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:54.689
 vast pockets of poverty and slums
