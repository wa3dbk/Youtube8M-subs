rotation<00:01:07.500> around<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.760> should<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.030> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
rotation around so you should have a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.880 
rotation around so you should have a
little<00:01:09.240> bit<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.510> extra<00:01:09.720> hair<00:01:09.990> hanging<00:01:10.290> out<00:01:10.439> and
