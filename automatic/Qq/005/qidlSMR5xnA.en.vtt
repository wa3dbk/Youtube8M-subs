00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:02.659 

okay<00:00:01.469> next<00:00:01.650> we'll<00:00:01.890> talk<00:00:02.010> about<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.310> closure

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
okay next we'll talk about the closure

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.150 
okay next we'll talk about the closure
property<00:00:03.000> and<00:00:03.480> I'll<00:00:03.899> state<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.620> property<00:00:04.950> and

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
property and I'll state the property and

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.920 
property and I'll state the property and
write<00:00:05.339> it<00:00:05.460> down<00:00:05.609> and<00:00:05.910> then<00:00:06.060> I<00:00:06.089> will<00:00:06.390> elaborate

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
write it down and then I will elaborate

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.350 
write it down and then I will elaborate
on<00:00:06.990> it<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.379> little<00:00:07.529> bit<00:00:07.740> it<00:00:08.370> simply<00:00:08.790> says<00:00:09.000> this

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
on it a little bit it simply says this

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.030 
on it a little bit it simply says this
if<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.769> B<00:00:11.010> are<00:00:11.309> real<00:00:11.490> numbers<00:00:12.049> then<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.349> plus

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
if a and B are real numbers then a plus

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:24.019 
if a and B are real numbers then a plus
B<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:15.350> unique<00:00:16.350> real<00:00:16.680> number<00:00:21.170> if<00:00:22.550> a<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.730> B<00:00:23.880> are

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
B is a unique real number if a and B are

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.480 
B is a unique real number if a and B are
real<00:00:24.060> numbers<00:00:24.240> then<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.990> plus<00:00:25.350> B<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.949> unique

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
real numbers then a plus B is a unique

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.509 
real numbers then a plus B is a unique
real<00:00:26.760> number<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.750> same<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.109> true<00:00:28.140> for

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
real number and the same is true for

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.260 
real number and the same is true for
multiplication<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.699> times<00:00:30.439> B<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:32.270> unique

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
multiplication a times B is a unique

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:44.270 
multiplication a times B is a unique
real<00:00:33.600> number

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.460 

and<00:00:44.970> it<00:00:45.060> doesn't<00:00:45.330> sound<00:00:45.540> like<00:00:45.690> that's<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.140> very

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
and it doesn't sound like that's a very

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.140 
and it doesn't sound like that's a very
big<00:00:46.650> deal<00:00:46.920> all<00:00:47.130> it's<00:00:47.310> saying<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.790> that<00:00:47.940> if<00:00:48.030> you

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
big deal all it's saying is that if you

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.780 
big deal all it's saying is that if you
add<00:00:48.390> two<00:00:48.720> numbers<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.530> end<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.580> real

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
add two numbers you end up with a real

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.970 
add two numbers you end up with a real
number<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:51.480> an<00:00:51.570> answer<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.080> if<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.800> multiply

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
number for an answer and if you multiply

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.600 
number for an answer and if you multiply
two<00:00:53.790> numbers<00:00:54.000> two<00:00:54.540> real<00:00:55.020> numbers<00:00:55.580> then<00:00:56.580> you

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
two numbers two real numbers then you

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.600 
two numbers two real numbers then you
end<00:00:56.880> up<00:00:57.030> with<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> real<00:00:57.570> number<00:00:57.960> for<00:00:58.140> an<00:00:58.380> answer

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
end up with a real number for an answer

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.430 
end up with a real number for an answer
but<00:00:59.610> it<00:00:59.730> also<00:00:59.880> says<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> sum<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.140> two

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
but it also says that the sum of two

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.040 
but it also says that the sum of two
numbers<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:02.090> unique<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.660> means<00:01:03.870> there's

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
numbers is unique that means there's

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.280 
numbers is unique that means there's
only<00:01:04.199> one<00:01:04.710> number<00:01:05.090> that<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.300> sum<00:01:06.690> of<00:01:06.930> any

only one number that is the sum of any

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.290 
only one number that is the sum of any
two<00:01:07.410> other<00:01:07.740> particular<00:01:08.160> numbers<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.850> the

two other particular numbers and the

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.580 
two other particular numbers and the
same<00:01:09.479> thing<00:01:09.690> is<00:01:09.840> true<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.140> multiplication

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
same thing is true for multiplication

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.609 
same thing is true for multiplication
there's<00:01:11.040> only<00:01:11.190> one<00:01:11.750> real<00:01:12.750> number<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.470> the

property<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:19.550> mathematician<00:01:20.550> would<00:01:20.729> say<00:01:21.060> that

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
property a mathematician would say that

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.960 
property a mathematician would say that
the<00:01:21.720> set<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:21.990> real<00:01:22.290> numbers<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.920> closed<00:01:23.520> over

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the set of real numbers is closed over

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.020 
the set of real numbers is closed over
addition<00:01:24.660> and<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.890> closed<00:01:26.430> over

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
addition and is closed over

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.150 
addition and is closed over
multiplication<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:28.440> what<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.710> means<00:01:28.890> is

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
multiplication and what that means is

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.130 
multiplication and what that means is
that<00:01:29.550> if<00:01:29.789> you're<00:01:29.880> doing<00:01:29.940> addition<00:01:30.750> or<00:01:30.960> you're

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
that if you're doing addition or you're

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.050 
that if you're doing addition or you're
doing<00:01:31.410> multiplication<00:01:31.740> then<00:01:32.310> real<00:01:32.610> numbers

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
doing multiplication then real numbers

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.260 
doing multiplication then real numbers
will<00:01:33.270> do<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.630> job<00:01:33.869> if<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.649> add<00:01:34.800> two<00:01:35.190> numbers

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
will do the job if you add two numbers

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.969 
will do the job if you add two numbers
then<00:01:36.270> your<00:01:36.660> answer<00:01:37.050> will<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> real<00:01:37.649> number

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
then your answer will be a real number

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.190 
then your answer will be a real number
you<00:01:38.009> won't<00:01:38.369> end<00:01:38.580> up<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.759> something<00:01:39.330> outside

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
you won't end up with something outside

multiplying<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> mathematician<00:02:03.210> would

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
multiplying so the mathematician would

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.179 
multiplying so the mathematician would

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
say the set of real numbers is closed

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.670 
say the set of real numbers is closed

multiplication and the point here to
understand<00:02:10.500> now<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.070> not<00:02:11.310> everything<00:02:12.120> is

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
understand now is that not everything is

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.780 
understand now is that not everything is
addition<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.650> multiplication<00:02:13.739> work<00:02:14.610> this

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
addition and multiplication work this

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.729 
addition and multiplication work this
way<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:15.030> not<00:02:15.390> everything<00:02:15.810> does<00:02:16.019> square<00:02:16.530> roots

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
way but not everything does square roots

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.190 
way but not everything does square roots
for<00:02:16.980> example<00:02:17.370> here's<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.910> square<00:02:18.269> root<00:02:18.450> what<00:02:19.110> if

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
for example here's a square root what if

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.590 
for example here's a square root what if
I<00:02:19.320> take<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.680> square<00:02:19.860> root<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.400> negative<00:02:21.000> seven

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
I take the square root of negative seven

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.620 
I take the square root of negative seven
negative<00:02:21.920> seven<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.070> real<00:02:23.310> number<00:02:23.630> but

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
negative seven is a real number but

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.350 
negative seven is a real number but
square<00:02:25.049> rooting<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.620> doesn't<00:02:26.489> give<00:02:26.790> me<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:27.030> real

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
square rooting it doesn't give me a real

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.990 
square rooting it doesn't give me a real
number<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:28.260> answer<00:02:28.680> here<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:28.980> not<00:02:29.489> anything

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
number the answer here is not anything

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.380 
number the answer here is not anything
that's<00:02:30.660> on<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:30.989> number<00:02:31.440> line<00:02:31.820> you<00:02:32.820> can't<00:02:33.090> find

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
that's on the number line you can't find

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.680 
that's on the number line you can't find
any<00:02:33.810> number<00:02:34.350> anywhere<00:02:34.890> here<00:02:35.480> that<00:02:36.480> when<00:02:36.660> you

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
any number anywhere here that when you

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.610 
any number anywhere here that when you
square<00:02:37.079> it<00:02:37.350> will<00:02:37.799> give<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.220> negative<00:02:38.790> seven

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
square it will give you negative seven

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.509 
square it will give you negative seven
the<00:02:40.620> answer<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:42.350> not<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.739> real<00:02:44.160> number

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
the answer to this is not a real number

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.280 
the answer to this is not a real number
it's<00:02:44.730> literally<00:02:45.209> off<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.989> number<00:02:46.260> line

it's literally off of the number line

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.990 
it's literally off of the number line
it's<00:02:46.620> something<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.070> we<00:02:47.160> call<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.400> complex

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
it's something that we call a complex

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.360 
it's something that we call a complex
number<00:02:48.329> or<00:02:48.510> an<00:02:48.780> imaginary<00:02:49.290> number<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.829> we

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
number or an imaginary number and we

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.460 
number or an imaginary number and we
touch<00:02:51.120> on<00:02:51.269> those<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.450> little<00:02:51.780> bit<00:02:51.930> toward<00:02:52.349> the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
touch on those a little bit toward the

that's<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.240> associative<00:03:58.840> property<00:04:01.740> and<00:04:03.870> then

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
that's the associative property and then

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.280 
that's the associative property and then
the<00:04:04.990> third<00:04:05.170> one<00:04:05.320> here<00:04:05.530> if<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.830> equals<00:04:06.370> K<00:04:06.880> and<00:04:07.290> K

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
the third one here if a equals K and K

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.610 
the third one here if a equals K and K
equals<00:04:08.800> seven<00:04:09.280> then<00:04:10.060> a<00:04:10.390> equals<00:04:10.840> seven<00:04:11.170> that's

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
equals seven then a equals seven that's

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.949 
equals seven then a equals seven that's
an<00:04:11.920> example<00:04:12.280> of<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.880> transitive<00:04:13.570> property

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.990 

now<00:04:16.959> these<00:04:17.109> ideas<00:04:17.440> should<00:04:17.859> all<00:04:18.310> make<00:04:18.700> sense

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
now these ideas should all make sense

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.270 
now these ideas should all make sense
all<00:04:19.239> of<00:04:19.270> these<00:04:19.510> properties<00:04:19.900> of<00:04:20.290> numbers<00:04:20.650> that

all of these properties of numbers that
we've<00:04:21.459> gone<00:04:21.609> over<00:04:21.669> and<00:04:22.090> if<00:04:22.180> these<00:04:22.300> ideas<00:04:22.720> are

we've gone over and if these ideas are

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.650 
we've gone over and if these ideas are
obvious<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:23.590> you<00:04:23.950> then<00:04:24.370> that's<00:04:24.580> good<00:04:24.970> if<00:04:25.330> you

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
obvious to you then that's good if you

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.180 
obvious to you then that's good if you
understand<00:04:26.230> these<00:04:26.410> ideas<00:04:26.830> then<00:04:27.070> you

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
understand these ideas then you

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.250 
understand these ideas then you
understand<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.700> basics<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:28.390> how<00:04:28.720> numbers

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
understand the basics of how numbers

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.470 
understand the basics of how numbers
work<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:29.860> if<00:04:30.370> any<00:04:30.550> of<00:04:30.669> these<00:04:30.820> ideas<00:04:31.180> don't

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
work and if any of these ideas don't

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.060 
work and if any of these ideas don't
make<00:04:31.930> sense<00:04:32.230> then<00:04:32.500> you<00:04:32.530> need<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:32.860> get<00:04:32.980> those

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
make sense then you need to get those

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.740 
make sense then you need to get those
straightened<00:04:33.460> out<00:04:33.550> before<00:04:33.790> we<00:04:34.120> continue<00:04:34.630> with

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
straightened out before we continue with

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.260 
straightened out before we continue with
the<00:04:34.870> course<00:04:35.220> these<00:04:36.220> are<00:04:36.400> these<00:04:36.669> are<00:04:36.790> basic

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
the course these are these are basic

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.780 
the course these are these are basic
foundational<00:04:38.050> ideas<00:04:38.440> that<00:04:38.620> we<00:04:38.740> assume<00:04:39.250> to<00:04:39.550> be

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
foundational ideas that we assume to be

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.520 
foundational ideas that we assume to be
true<00:04:40.090> as<00:04:40.390> we<00:04:40.690> go<00:04:40.900> through<00:04:41.200> the<00:04:41.320> course

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
true as we go through the course

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.860 
true as we go through the course
developing<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:42.700> the<00:04:43.000> rest<00:04:43.210> of<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.450> theories

of<00:04:44.020> algebra<00:04:44.410> that<00:04:44.440> we'll<00:04:44.680> work<00:04:44.860> through<00:04:45.160> in

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
of algebra that we'll work through in
