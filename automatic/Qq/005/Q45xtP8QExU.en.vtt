00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.109
 we come back to this race in 6th place 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.029
 grenoble received Montpellier from 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.070
 Montpellier exit fifteen ago 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.470
 days of this top 6 after their setback to 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.130
 home facing the racing metro need to 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.340
 reassure yourself 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.140
 quickly it's good to watch the chef 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.400
 of orchestra was back the half 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.800
 opening ceremony françois 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.230
 trin-duke was holding the strong man 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.640
 as she reminds her manager 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.560
 fabien galthié the strong man of 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.029
 montpellier frédéric viard we read it 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.350
 in the press we talked a lot about it 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.870
 there were a lot of expectations around 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.640
 duca françois trinh duke 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.710
 yes but he himself isabelle a French 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.360
 was expecting a lot from this match of his 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.250
 tenure and see it from elsewhere 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.649
 in the locker room we felt he was 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.880
 already very concentrated almost too much 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.110
 concentrated to see what was going on 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.219
 on the lawn god knows if we do the 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.840
 things well on the grenoble side for 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.100
 deconcentrate the opponents but 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.960
 look at the face of françois trin-duc 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.399
 and yet this start of match there 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.290
 sees the first balloons grenoble and 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.489
 the balloons returned to the Montpellier 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.230
 who were playing in white creevy who can 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.079
 serve all praise a first opponent 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.239
 cleared it resists shaun plating 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.760
 sowerby and here is the match data 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.500
 given and the Montpellier go 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.330
 attack at all-va excess is there 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.010
 to make the most of their balloon even 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.479
 if on arrival this action will give 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.960
 not much since combezou is done 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.119
 resume 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.580
 but mister carbonare comes back on the 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.080
 shaun sowerby plating at the shoulder on 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.790
 Toulouse is not enough for the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.400
 destabilize and it will be yellow card is 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.460
 to hit him and here are the people of Grenoble 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.590
 who end up at 14 against 15 barely 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.060
 ten minutes after the start of the match and 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.560
 montpellier will enjoy it behind on 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.360
 the penalty we choose the key a 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.100
 succession of balloons worn for 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.780
 fulgence ouedraogo on arrival who 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.310
 desire who tears the defense 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.760
 Grenoble the ball out by benoît 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.320
 Paillaugue 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.880
 for françois trin-duc and more person 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.830
 facing the international opener and the 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.060
 here that flattens the first try of this 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.200
 match we play since little bit 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.060
 less than a quarter of an hour 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.800
 and here is montpellier opening the brand 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.200
 with this beautiful load from the beginning 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.790
 captain fulgence ouedraogo and the 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.740
 relay behind françois trin-duc 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.119
 no one to come to defend on 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.550
 the international opener ah that he's good 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.539
 to hold and play at home and 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.550
 it's 7 to 0 not enough to reassure 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.750
 the bench and the staff of grenoble and 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.729
 yet grenoble sometimes has some 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.590
 balloons through stewart 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.560
 the opener this long pass to the foot 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.060
 for waqaseduadua who does not capture this 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.120
 nerd so eventually he gets it back and 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.650
 flattens on actually slows down 8 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.769
 takes time to recover the balloon 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.180
 before he touches the ground 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.830
 it flattens and yet the test will only be 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.880
 not given to the video the cost of this 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.870
 quarter in art comes a first 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.730
 penalty he had seen some 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.350
 moments before he let play 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.640
 the advantage valentin run in offer 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.709
 so the first points to grenoble 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.410
 three minutes after the test marked by 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.329
 Montpellier to return to 3 to 7 in front 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.280
 there are still all rented toulouse that 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.660
 it takes several times each time 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.250
 Grenoble to get by and god 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.540
 know and god knows if the staff 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.280
 Montpellier is not satisfied 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.780
 it's a beautiful gesture song because 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.040
 that his team dominates on occasions 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.430
 again with toulouse that can 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.110
 serve 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.120
 fulgence ouedraogo but on arrival he 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.829
 there is not really much realism 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.329
 on the Montpellier side still no 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.680
 points scored while there is a big 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.820
 domination one is very often in the 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.799
 22 meters from Grenoble with this balloon 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.090
 go tomorrow combezou who fixes me maybe 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.010
 not enough for beret and 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.350
 the arrival eberhard price and this balloon that 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.610
 will finally go into touch a 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.430
 new opportunity for 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.599
 Montpellier 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.209
 a new opportunity that only gives 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.629
 nothing even though even though the diocese and site 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.980
 hulu struggles to give the advantage to 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.390
 his team and to break that defense 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.129
 Grenoble large wood lot that are 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.719
 dominated in melee but that happens when 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.950
 even to pick up some balloons the 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:24.780
 talent of shaun sowerby who can the 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.040
 go out for florian ninard not often 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.870
 established this season but who 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.430
 retrieve this balloon drives the defense 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.239
 montpelliéraine is not held so he 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.189
 will go win a few meters 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.459
 additional recovered just before the 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:33.629
 line 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.620
 a new opportunity for 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.849
 Grenoble who carry in them come 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.019
 not often in this part of the field 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.150
 in the first period 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.019
 on arrival there will be no test the 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.849
 a penalty 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.620
 nevertheless for grenoble a penalty that 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.139
 will be transformed by valentin run 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.730
 years and suddenly grenoble returns to 1,617 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.200
 in the 37th minute will even have one last 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.639
 attempt in the first period 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.560
 for valentin current that he will give nothing 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.359
 and so that's 7 6 at the break no 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.620
 what to reassure the years - fabien galthié 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.760
 especially since his team has dominated 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.169
 revenge in the second half but now 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.280
 this is the reverse scenario to the first 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.349
 period a few radio balloons at work 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.090
 to Montpellier who benefits from it with 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.980
 Toulon or once he has his 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.389
 business card a beautiful skin mail on 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.889
 florian ninard the ball behind who is going 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.150
 go up to audrin but blow of 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.090
 Cardona sir whistle that massive 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.199
 and a penalty for this ruckus of all 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.389
 must then that's hand and is open 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:17.159
 on the face of florian are a few 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.229
 moments later the same kick 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:22.380
 from stewart recover again by toulouse 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.690
 and 1 and 2 3 opponents miles on 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.400
 buttocks and behind the pass for your 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.050
 mute the woman's password to your eve and 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.000
 the interior return unfortunately not 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.020
 very well assured some balloons certainly 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.699
 for the people of Montpellier but 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.139
 balloons that on the other hand does not give 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.220
 points behind because there will be a 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.780
 penalty when we see the beautiful 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.130
 work of all look is able so 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.599
 to push his opponents but to 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.669
 to circumvent that too is to beat 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.169
 do not put pass fan and return 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.250
 interior less well assured there will be 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.199
 still behind a penalty 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.630
 he will even have two breasts almost in 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.070
 the stride for benoît paillaugue is 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.930
 his last he'll go out soon after but 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.430
 he allows his team at the hour of play 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.659
 to lead very seated behind there 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.270
 will have that kicking for stewart 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:59.039
 Grenoble side a pure bustos moyano 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.870
 go back to the place of poiu for purpose and 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.190
 moments later and at once 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.110
 final whistle French trin-duke can 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.840
 swing this big balloon into his grandstand 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.400
 team just won 16 to 9 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.960
 first loss to Grenoble since May 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.460
 2011 at the lesdiguières stadium because he had 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.990
 lost against clermont we put in the stadium 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.030
 alps and the four lost points 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.500
 by the Montpellier against racing 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.930
 are finally recovering it was well worth 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.940
 bise 2 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.710
 Grenoble yeah would be the 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.020
 consequences to the ranking look 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.120
 montpellier finds the top 6 at the expense 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.669
 of perpignan 3 points difference between 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.229
 they both clubs the top 6 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.419
 we call you a qualifier for 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.310
 the final stages and the next cup 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.440
 from Europe a very nice operation so 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.240
 for the teammates of françois 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.430
 trin-duke fifteen days after the setback 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.080
 in the face of racing just listen to 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.630
 sensations of the international opener to 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.889
 michel macurdy's microphone yeah that's 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.270
 unfortunate to say but it's true that the 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.680
 second half against racing when 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.090
 even positive via a nice reaction 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.100
 even if we lose the match and today 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.470
 we were going to look for him in 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.300
 Difficult conditions 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.860
 here we can see when and character 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.960
 and it's really important for the end 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.479
 of season which is excellent interesting 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.250
 and inevitably it's the values ​​when 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.660
 even though they are they have removed 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.349
 the sensations for you today 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.849
 well, that produced a game we went 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.800
 scared and then personally 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:16.139
 it's and good things less 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:19.919
 good at taking the benchmarks of 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:22.940
 montpellier is so happy it's done 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:25.260
 good to play that's for sure thank you 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.150
 France who finds the smile again 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.530
 true that he played very little with the 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.229
 blue during the tournament a frustration 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.789
 imagine it erased by this successful return 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.639
 we're going to see again in pallets are 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:37.949
 effect the essay that illustrates well the 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:40.020
 the important video and international to 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:41.430
 montpellier with here the charge of the 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.280
 captain and third line 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.760
 ouedraogo and that pierces over several 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.310
 meters 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.409
 Benoît's quick release 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.940
 paillaugue for the other blue precisely 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:52.710
 the other international françois trin-duc 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.909
 while he did not ask me to pray 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.240
 knew he had ants in them 

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:55.830
 legs 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.599
 the shortest way well it's more 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.729
 right simply French trin-duc 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:01.620
 who is pleased and who inscribes the 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:04.380
 only try of this meeting a 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:08.990
 pallet stewed by Thomas at Glavany 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.990
 Here is Montpellier who finds the top 6
