00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.149 
what do you think of the format thus far
okay<00:02:44.590> look<00:02:46.150> format<00:02:47.230> it's<00:02:48.230> really<00:02:48.650> good<00:02:48.859> in

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
okay look format it's really good in

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.240 
okay look format it's really good in
theory<00:02:50.030> as<00:02:50.239> as<00:02:51.019> well<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.709> design<00:02:52.010> of<00:02:52.159> any

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
theory as as well the design of any

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.740 
theory as as well the design of any
system<00:02:52.579> there's<00:02:52.939> always<00:02:53.060> those<00:02:53.239> degenerate

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
system there's always those degenerate

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.210 
system there's always those degenerate
cases<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.349> it<00:02:54.409> seems<00:02:54.590> like<00:02:54.739> we're<00:02:54.889> gonna<00:02:54.980> just

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
cases and it seems like we're gonna just

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.220 
cases and it seems like we're gonna just
keep<00:02:55.280> having<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.790> happen<00:02:55.970> which<00:02:56.359> is<00:02:56.389> if

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
keep having it happen which is if

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.289 
keep having it happen which is if
players<00:02:57.560> down<00:02:57.829> Oh<00:02:58.069> -<00:02:58.129> there's<00:02:58.579> a<00:02:58.639> really<00:02:58.909> clear

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
players down Oh - there's a really clear

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.599 
players down Oh - there's a really clear
reward<00:02:59.689> -<00:03:00.620> just<00:03:00.799> eliminating<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.459> because

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
reward - just eliminating it because

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:02.979 
reward - just eliminating it because
everyone<00:03:01.939> makes<00:03:02.030> more<00:03:02.239> money<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:02.659> think<00:03:02.750> if

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
everyone makes more money I think if

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.349 
everyone makes more money I think if
that<00:03:03.019> makes<00:03:03.799> more<00:03:03.950> money<00:03:04.159> was<00:03:04.340> removed<00:03:04.670> in

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
that makes more money was removed in

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:06.429 
that makes more money was removed in
some<00:03:05.599> way<00:03:05.750> or<00:03:05.930> maybe<00:03:06.079> there<00:03:06.230> was<00:03:06.319> like<00:03:06.409> a

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:06.439 
some way or maybe there was like a

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.960 
some way or maybe there was like a
bounty<00:03:06.829> for<00:03:07.040> winning<00:03:07.370> in<00:03:07.489> a<00:03:07.549> series<00:03:07.849> or

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
bounty for winning in a series or

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.300 
bounty for winning in a series or
something<00:03:08.239> like<00:03:08.329> that<00:03:08.980> we<00:03:09.980> might<00:03:10.099> see<00:03:10.280> a

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
something like that we might see a

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.800 
something like that we might see a
little<00:03:10.430> more<00:03:10.579> variety<00:03:10.760> but<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.209> have<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:11.599> have<00:03:11.780> a

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
little more variety but I have I have a

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.390 
little more variety but I have I have a
feeling<00:03:12.199> that<00:03:12.290> it's<00:03:12.440> going<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.739> be<00:03:12.829> everyone

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
feeling that it's going to be everyone

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.800 
feeling that it's going to be everyone
choosing<00:03:13.699> puff<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.150> then<00:03:14.239> everyone<00:03:14.540> choosing
