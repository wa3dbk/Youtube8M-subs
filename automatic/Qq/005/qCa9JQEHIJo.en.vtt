dead cows so what I can do then I could
meditate<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:31.349> an<00:00:32.009> hour<00:00:32.960> now<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.649> cows<00:00:34.860> would

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
meditate for an hour now the cows would

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.750 
meditate for an hour now the cows would
respawn<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:39.170> could<00:00:40.170> kill<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.559> cows<00:00:40.739> once<00:00:41.370> again

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
respawn I could kill the cows once again

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.569 
respawn I could kill the cows once again
I<00:00:42.180> need<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.290> see<00:00:43.469> how<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.860> fairly<00:00:44.430> quickly

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
I need to see how this fairly quickly

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.470 
I need to see how this fairly quickly
would<00:00:45.360> enable<00:00:45.780> me<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.140> make<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:47.480> significant

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
would enable me to make a significant

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.569 
would enable me to make a significant
sum<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.690> money<00:00:48.840> simply<00:00:49.410> by<00:00:49.710> meditating<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
sum of money simply by meditating and

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.430 
sum of money simply by meditating and
them<00:00:51.120> by<00:00:52.430> slaughtering<00:00:53.430> cows<00:00:54.949> like<00:00:55.949> it

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
them by slaughtering cows like it

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.220 
them by slaughtering cows like it
however<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.710> patch<00:00:59.010> 105<00:00:59.670> something<00:01:00.300> that

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
however in patch 105 something that

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.509 
however in patch 105 something that
didn't<00:01:01.680> immediately<00:01:02.280> make<00:01:02.789> sense<00:01:03.120> was<00:01:04.369> put<00:01:05.369> in

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
didn't immediately make sense was put in

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.240 
didn't immediately make sense was put in
there<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:06.689> was<00:01:06.869> called<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> bovine<00:01:07.710> Defense

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
there it was called the bovine Defense

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.420 
there it was called the bovine Defense
Force<00:01:09.979> um

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
Force um

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.640 
Force um
we<00:01:13.060> should<00:01:13.270> be<00:01:13.420> able<00:01:13.510> to<00:01:13.720> see<00:01:13.870> what<00:01:14.140> move<00:01:14.440> on

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
we should be able to see what move on

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.670 
we should be able to see what move on
defense<00:01:14.980> forces<00:01:15.400> pretty<00:01:15.790> soon<00:01:16.030> yeah<00:01:16.630> we<00:01:17.560> have

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
defense forces pretty soon yeah we have

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.030 
defense forces pretty soon yeah we have
a<00:01:17.710> level<00:01:18.340> 27<00:01:19.030> course<00:01:19.450> coming<00:01:19.810> in<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.710> history

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
a level 27 course coming in the history

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.430 
a level 27 course coming in the history
to<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.540> thumb<00:01:25.810> she's<00:01:26.200> out<00:01:26.530> here<00:01:28.110> now<00:01:29.110> he<00:01:29.170> isn't

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
to the thumb she's out here now he isn't

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.760 
to the thumb she's out here now he isn't
the<00:01:29.680> strongest<00:01:29.950> monster<00:01:31.380> but<00:01:32.380> he<00:01:32.710> is

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
the strongest monster but he is

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.969 
the strongest monster but he is
definitely<00:01:34.530> harder<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:35.650> kill<00:01:35.830> than<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:36.130> cow

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
definitely harder to kill than the cow

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.800 
definitely harder to kill than the cow
significant<00:01:38.979> so<00:01:39.280> would<00:01:39.940> you<00:01:40.119> get<00:01:40.570> away<00:01:40.660> from

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
significant so would you get away from

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.430 
significant so would you get away from
his<00:01:41.170> charge<00:01:44.940> now<00:01:45.940> I<00:01:45.970> might<00:01:46.330> be<00:01:46.509> able<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:46.780> kill

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
his charge now I might be able to kill

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.050 
his charge now I might be able to kill
him<00:01:47.590> he<00:01:47.740> writes<00:01:47.950> me<00:01:48.160> I<00:01:48.190> didn't<00:01:48.580> quite<00:01:48.850> expect

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
him he writes me I didn't quite expect

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.630 
him he writes me I didn't quite expect
that<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:51.310> we'll<00:01:51.640> see<00:01:51.820> how<00:01:51.910> it<00:01:51.940> goes<00:01:53.280> he<00:01:54.280> does

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
that but we'll see how it goes he does

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.859 
that but we'll see how it goes he does
not<00:01:54.880> like<00:01:55.210> fire<00:01:55.570> and<00:01:55.930> I<00:01:56.020> haven't<00:01:56.320> even<00:01:56.440> welcome

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
not like fire and I haven't even welcome

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.260 
not like fire and I haven't even welcome
yeah<00:01:58.869> I<00:01:58.899> might<00:01:59.380> be<00:01:59.680> able<00:01:59.800> to<00:01:59.979> kill<00:02:00.250> this<00:02:00.490> this

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
yeah I might be able to kill this this

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:09.770 
yeah I might be able to kill this this
court

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.640 

yeah<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:12.580> bovine<00:02:13.030> Defense<00:02:13.420> Force<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:14.020> dead<00:02:14.500> so

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
yeah the bovine Defense Force is dead so

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.009 
yeah the bovine Defense Force is dead so
here<00:02:17.650> we<00:02:17.800> have<00:02:17.830> another<00:02:18.069> court<00:02:18.720> when<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:19.750> kill

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
here we have another court when I kill

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.979 
here we have another court when I kill
that<00:02:20.170> court<00:02:20.470> another<00:02:20.860> court<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.370> spawning<00:02:22.000> so

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
that court another court is spawning so

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.979 
that court another court is spawning so
presumably<00:02:23.709> I<00:02:24.069> would<00:02:24.580> get<00:02:24.880> an<00:02:25.120> endless<00:02:25.750> line

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
presumably I would get an endless line

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.320 
presumably I would get an endless line
of<00:02:26.050> course<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.860> fight<00:02:27.569> when<00:02:29.790> when<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:30.819> kill

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
of course to fight when when I kill

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330 
of course to fight when when I kill
these<00:02:31.540> four<00:02:31.780> cows<00:02:32.050> now<00:02:32.739> let's<00:02:32.920> see<00:02:33.069> if<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.310> can

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
these four cows now let's see if I can

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.979 
these four cows now let's see if I can
make<00:02:33.880> this<00:02:34.750> court<00:02:35.140> into<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:36.099> village<00:02:36.430> here<00:02:36.989> or

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
make this court into the village here or

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.900 
make this court into the village here or
over<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.900> north<00:02:40.900> guardian<00:02:41.519> neff<00:02:42.519> guardian

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
over to the north guardian neff guardian

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.440 
over to the north guardian neff guardian
soldiers<00:02:43.330> I<00:02:47.730> don't<00:02:48.730> know<00:02:48.819> if<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.120> can<00:02:49.269> make<00:02:49.390> it

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
soldiers I don't know if you can make it

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.479 
soldiers I don't know if you can make it
across<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:50.019> bridge<00:02:50.200> yeah<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.769> Napoleon

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
across the bridge yeah the Napoleon

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.070 
across the bridge yeah the Napoleon
soldiers<00:02:51.880> are<00:02:52.030> actually<00:02:52.299> firing<00:02:52.540> nothing<00:02:52.720> up

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
soldiers are actually firing nothing up

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.559 
soldiers are actually firing nothing up
so<00:02:53.739> let's<00:02:53.890> see<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.340> court<00:02:54.670> versus<00:02:55.269> milk

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
so let's see a court versus milk

so let's see a court versus milk
Guardian<00:02:56.110> soldiers<00:02:57.299> if<00:02:58.299> he<00:02:58.510> can<00:02:58.690> indeed<00:02:58.959> cross

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
Guardian soldiers if he can indeed cross

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.780 
Guardian soldiers if he can indeed cross
the<00:02:59.440> bridge<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.920> looks<00:03:00.130> like<00:03:00.220> he<00:03:00.430> has<00:03:00.579> some

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
the bridge it looks like he has some

they<00:03:30.690> are<00:03:30.900> of<00:03:31.050> course<00:03:31.260> not<00:03:31.860> able<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.580> damage<00:03:32.730> it

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
they are of course not able to damage it

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.180 
they are of course not able to damage it
very<00:03:33.450> effectively<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:34.560> there<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.040> have<00:03:35.099> it

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
very effectively so there you have it

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.640 
very effectively so there you have it
the<00:03:36.000> bovine<00:03:36.330> Defense<00:03:36.630> Force<00:03:36.900> if<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.380> defeat

World Court another spawns I would

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.390 
World Court another spawns I would
probably<00:03:40.380> have<00:03:40.650> been<00:03:40.680> able<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:41.069> kill<00:03:41.220> the

probably have been able to kill the
second<00:03:41.760> court<00:03:42.060> as<00:03:42.209> well<00:03:43.040> maybe<00:03:44.040> there's<00:03:44.370> an

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
second court as well maybe there's an

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.220 
second court as well maybe there's an
endless<00:03:44.790> line<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.120> course<00:03:45.450> lining<00:03:46.080> up<00:03:46.170> to

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
endless line of course lining up to

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.750 
endless line of course lining up to
defend<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:47.130> cows<00:03:47.760> but<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:49.340> pretty<00:03:50.340> interesting

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
defend the cows but a pretty interesting

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.120 
defend the cows but a pretty interesting
interesting<00:03:51.500> solution<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.739> problem<00:03:53.099> that

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
interesting solution to the problem that

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
interesting solution to the problem that
doesn't<00:03:53.549> make<00:03:53.910> sense<00:03:54.269> but<00:03:55.250> it's<00:03:56.250> fun<00:03:56.880> and

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
doesn't make sense but it's fun and

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.819 
doesn't make sense but it's fun and
that's<00:03:57.360> what<00:03:57.599> matters<00:03:58.730> strengthened<00:03:59.730> over
