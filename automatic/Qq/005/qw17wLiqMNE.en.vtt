00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 Hey, I've shot youtube combos in this 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.310
 occasion is I have a very special video 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.859
 because here I will make a collaboration 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.090
 with my friend Jorge Aguilera maybe already 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.950
 I have seen its ups channel 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.230
 requintos and chords guitar more or less 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.170
 similar to mine we are going to take out the song 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.570
 of ariel camacho the brute is going to be 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.690
 the requintos here I leave the link for 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.970
 go and check it 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.170
 and with me, let's see what the 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.340
 chords and the lyrics let's start perfect the 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.340
 creation is around if greater 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.850
 Y 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.179
 we find a valseado rhythm 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:44.449
 classic that you know and if not 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:46.929
 they should already know cha cha cha cha 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.929
 cha 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.290
 let's use the chords if their 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.890
 second that is being sustained its 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:03.760
 third that is me and a few minors 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.760
 E flat minor and E flat minor 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.659
 we begin with the accompaniment in the 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:19.619
 melody that people try I tried 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:23.960
 I tried the intendant to stop 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:27.750
 stop to understand entente 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:32.420
 I tried to understand that they try to have 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.420
 stop pretend to understand 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.800
 no no no no 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.420
 and there goes the lyrics 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:48.939
 and you miss it 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:53.740
 I save it and another enjoys it 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:57.630
 it happens to you to believe you more astute if they go 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:03.420
 wandering the streets is by brute 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.420
 look at yourself today is turned into a mockery 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:14.040
 now you love me I do not want anymore 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.480
 that you want I can not do things 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.430
 your way 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:24.040
 and do not hug me I know the crutches 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.790
 and they stir me up they do not squeeze me and you 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.790
 I want 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:35.870
 and despite the bad taste you left me 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:40.819
 Hate you, I'm not interested, start the chord 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:43.790
 the choir did not finish the love alone it 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:47.330
 it was your hands but I think I 'm 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.840
 better than when I was by your side 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:54.530
 however, your heart wants to return to 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:58.700
 start what is already finished the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.370
 truth that I never knew your good side 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.820
 and by mistake 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.959
 you told me I love you I was the one who 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:12.310
 wrong the rain try by came to a 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.310
 Mule turned out 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.270
 then the one that you should not learn with me 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.740
 Jorge Jorge Aguilera is already repeating the 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.069

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.630
