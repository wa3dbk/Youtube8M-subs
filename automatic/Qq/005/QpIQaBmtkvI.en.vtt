00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.600
 we realized 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.600
 to 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.540
 do not 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.200
 how about youtube friends we are in a 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.630
 Minecraft gameplay and good guys 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.599
 this time I bring you the review mont a 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.119
 quite short way very short but very 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.990
 really useful that is too useful 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.230
 for minecraft in survival or in 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.050
 what you want in the subtle nickname and already 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.210
 it's worth it and what is it about that I 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.930
 mode is about being able to select your 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.480
 picture or your painting and finally and not have 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.120
 to be putting and putting one behind 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.030
 another until the paint comes out that 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.399
 you want 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.039
 how it is done, well, very simple 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.980
 you put your picture for example this does not 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:01.040
 like because here you see a picture for 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.379
 then for 44 blocks and then point 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.140
 You zoom in and right click and you go to 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.869
 see painting good so you put me bar 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.460
 painting with here I have been as you see 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.560
 been tested many times this is me 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.130
 has done at night because then he does not 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.020
 I had the mod 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.340
 so investigate a little director 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.500
 and I bring them to you so that you do not 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.320
 have to do all that process already 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.020
 just with watching the video because they are already here 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.090
 with bar beijing they put it in and then 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.670
 is here you select the boxes that 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.920
 because they can fit there or they can 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.800
 select yourselves so that 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.700
 put them on the plane I always like the 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.850
 of the zombies I like when 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.420
 walker emitting waltz and you have to arrive 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.280
 it does not open equal one of 41 fingers 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.950
 for example that month it moved away again that 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.289
 damn monkey and well with the click 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.079
 right it went suddenly and with again and you 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:56.020
 you would be one like this and there it is 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:59.049
 as a very very parent entity since it does not 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.789
 you have to be what you went through in a 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.970
 minute right now you do it in five 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.460
 seconds passes 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.650
 you had to put tran 43 pictures and that 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.350
 it was very very very heavy so well then 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.980
 with this mode it is very simple you can 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.510
 put the squares these here would be 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.790
 one of one and then I get one of one 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.540
 but he wants to teach them another so 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.300
 I do not like bar petting and I will not 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.780
 he 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:31.280
 this one is uglier but well then 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.280
 to teach them that here is there came the 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:40.910
 4 which does not fit very well so 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:44.290
 marked again and yes gentlemen sir nor the 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.290
 children I did not just scratch 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:54.310
 selected to be as it says 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:57.160
 someone I know symmetrically 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.250
 and you are like this is super super super 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.830
 cool here would be one of two 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.980
 example a doing it came out and again 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.050
 will break and ting and you're 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.980
 example we put the first one that we do not have 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.159
 here but there it is 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.200
 very very superior very superior and very useful 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:18.379
 this mod 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.580
 I have it there so let's change what 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:24.769
 right click and bar 20 out give it a 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.620
 very strong blow environment and that's what 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:32.120
 we are going to put this white one that never 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.250
 it is known that these are things but good 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.840
 You already saw how 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.150
 that this mountain is very short and very useful 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.550
 short but very useful indeed that 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.470
 I have nothing else to do and I hope 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.050
 that you liked it and how you saw already 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.140
 decorate my house which I just did 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.380
 a moment ago it seemed they are already devoted 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.900
 the Korean one and it was very very very 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.530
 father then if they want I will teach them to 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.860
 do these these windows since then 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.600
 They have very much liked me and I will teach them to 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.840
 do them if you want to teach them 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.849
 and then I will make them in a video 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.030
 an extra material or something like that for 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:16.030
 teach them how those windows are made 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.859
 ok and you know if they liked it like 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.910
 favorites and really share that I 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.070

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.710

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.860
