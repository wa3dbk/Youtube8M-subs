00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
record for the record so many people

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.160 
record for the record so many people
think<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:34.910> was<00:02:35.209> a<00:02:35.239> woman<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:35.840> they

changed<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.660> voice<00:02:38.840> actor<00:02:39.349> because<00:02:39.769> I<00:02:39.800> think

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
changed the voice actor because I think

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.949 
changed the voice actor because I think
it<00:02:40.040> was<00:02:40.130> originally<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.670> woman<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.690> sounded
