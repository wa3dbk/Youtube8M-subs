00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello everyone today in my recipes we are going to 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.410
 learn to ride anything 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.530
 we have to follow a series of tricks 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.410
 before putting on the cream 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.750
 we have put in the cream jar 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.579
 to ride 10 minutes before doing it 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.340
 in the freezer so he had that 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:26.099
 cold blow you can also put the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.890
 where you are going to beat the and mount it 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.259
 you can put it 5 or 10 minutes before 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.930
 also in the fridge and then we need 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:39.200
 the cream and the sugar we need 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.200
 we put the cream in the bowl 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.520
 and we beat it at minimum speed 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.730
 one 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.310
 Minutillos like that 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:56.390
 and we are going to add sugar 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.390
 little by little 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:07.080
 the ideal proportion to mount the cream 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:12.580
 200 milliliters of 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:18.850
 of cream about 5 tablespoons of sugar 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:21.850
 for 250 we would put 6 tablespoons 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.730
 It is convenient not to mount a lot of cream to the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.740
 time 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.480
 if you have to do a lot of whipped cream 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.480
 for a cake or whatever 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.600
 his thing is to make this step several times 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.600
 instead of putting a liter of cream 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.870
 remember that when we have all the 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:50.680
 sugar exposed in the cream we can not 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:53.700
 stop debating and it will take time to assemble 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.700
 about 3 or 4 minutes 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.900
 the trick for swimming to the mountain and 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.610
 is very good is that it is all cold 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.320
 if the cream is at temperature 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.460
 environment will cost us a lot 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.130
 that is mounted and that the jar is in the 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.390
 refrigerator is also going to be one of the 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.220
 keys to get them mounted too 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.860
 we have to take into account so that 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:29.500
 dessert because not everyone needs that 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:32.890
 be mounted at all then according to him 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.770
 the dessert that we are going to make then 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.170
 we are left 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.960
 and nothing friends here I'm riding the 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.190
 cream for good strawberries with sugar 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.190
 and cream until soon
