00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.410
 The Nokia Lumia 1020 is of course 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.150
 just announced he is in some 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.740
 even makes it available 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.210
 why not seen him in the Netherlands 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.480
 live display wait until the stores 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.010
 lies 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.869
 pleasure on the ifa is the perfect choice 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.829
 opportunity to attribute it in 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.689
 hold hands 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.829
 i have a lake in my hands he sees 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.710
 of the folk it actually looks like one 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:25.060
 lumia 920 is almost no difference 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.769
 and actually if you hold it in your hand 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.140
 there is also relatively little difference and find 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.300
 now leave 30 positive for me a lot 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.680
 thicker camera, of course, and that 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.230
 is something that you don't really notice when you 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.330
 working with the device 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.320
 generally also in terms of weight is not 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.030
 much heavier 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.320
 but this is not much heavier 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.440
 just that bomb on the back 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.360
 well that is of course reasonable 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.220
 small sacrifice for such a good camera 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.960
 and other devices such as the galaxy s4 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.079
 zoom that also a good camera we who 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.190
 you have to sacrifice a lot more for that 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.810
 of the camera is of course normal 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.660
 windows phone runs windows phone 8 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.980
 with the ember update all that looks 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.810
 just look like windows phone 8 there 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.160
 always looks like we are the applications 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.179
 added including the pro cam with 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.379
 person has to stand up 

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:07.960
 it is of course important for that 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.390
 that camera he just turns and sits quickly 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.560
 in that snapdragon s4 plus processor 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.509
 I still wish him and push come on 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.799
 process every week and drove cores 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.229
 the screen is a four and a half inches 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.569
 amoled screen it looks nice it 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.249
 is a 720 p hd screen slightly higher than 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:22.869
 720 p is resolution 

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:24.969
 it comes with pure lotion plus which makes the 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.039
 letter written is slightly higher about it 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.810
 overall screen just looks very nice 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.280
 to be it is an amoled screen beautiful 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.959
 colors may not be that vivid 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.789
 Ash from Samsung but always just whole 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.649
 nice screen come at most important 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.689
 points of this nokia lumia 1020 and it 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.609
 Of course you see the camera camera 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.369
 large complainant side has ox1 or flash 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:44.289
 has a normal flash and a resolution 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.149
 of no less than 41 megapixels 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.560
 it does not mean that you mix an event 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.729
 can shoot with camera 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.590
 he has a sensor that is round and like 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.329
 you take a 16 may 9 photos then it becomes 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.189
 used another part of it and as 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.840
 you shoot a 4 by 3 photos through the 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.870
 highest right resolution where your photo 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.310
 can shoot is 38 megapixels 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.930
 but the device even shoots normally 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.160
 photos in 5 megapixels 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.200
 thereby thereby downsizing those photos 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.060
 uses more pixels of information than 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.550
 that delivers a pixel output 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.020
 so that those pixels just get better 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.920
 we need to see how those photos look 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.030
 of course see it as one 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.260
 full review but at first 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.010
 face just looks very good in you 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.110
 from 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.000
 certainly on the screen here there is also one 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.720
 very whole extensive camera app in it 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.060
 device 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.800
 nokia pro can meet that socially you are one 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.630
 little can see here you can 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.170
 set shutter speeds that is so you can 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.850
 and it worked with the ring 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.410
 I like them just fine and end mill 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.090
 therefore the camera is just a lot 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.680
 allow extended months because 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.030
 of course especially important is it 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.070
 this camera just a really bad one 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.170
 resolution and therefore those pixels together 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.670
 to take much better photos 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.440
 also includes optical image stabilization 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.540
 also in the dark to slightly 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.550
 take better pictures 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.350
 He is what we like from the 920 and the 925 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.430
 knowing it was pretty impressive 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.440
 they assume that not with this 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.000
 device itself agree to the pictures 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.720
 not really what my point of this 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.460
 phone 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.650
 otherwise just a good windows phone 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.180
 but yes it is at the same level 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.700
 as last year 's winners 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.010
 and yes we have advanced a year now 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.900
 android market natural year on 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.430
 the job market will get soon 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.630
 natural major update and minute from 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.700
 still stands still 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.650
 they were already waiting for a major update 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.050
 from microsoft were quad-core processor 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.489
 supports become full hd screens and 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.680
 such is just not here 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.690
 really a lumia 920 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.860
 then certainly one in the very good camera 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.800
 Highly recommended for anyone wanting a good one 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.640
 want a camera phone and just none 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.640
 compromises will do
