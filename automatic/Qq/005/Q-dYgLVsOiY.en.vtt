00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.789
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:07.089
 This theme is 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.769
 This will stabilize the Chiquita 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.849
 I would like to introduce you to the three tips 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.011
 I want to do Chiquita now and practice Chiquita 

00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:21.420
 Some people say that they are working 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.760
 I think, but it does not go well during 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.990
 A lot of people having trouble that it is not stable 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.940
 I think I wonder if I do this time 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.910
 In terms of being able to stabilize the Chiquita 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.760
 I summarized three points that I want you to be aware of 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.970
 How to beat this video 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.989
 I do not introduce it, but such things are other videos 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.760
 Because I will introduce the details of how to strike 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.399
 Please refer to that for reference 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.290
 Then, the tips to stabilize the Chiquita in three points 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.470
 The first point I want to introduce 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.250
 The first point is the back swing 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.689
 Make your backswing smaller 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.020
 When I pull this too much 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.961
 It's more than I thought the ball pulled a little 

00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:17.560
 I can not cope with long time 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.579
 I also hit the impact 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.399
 I hope it rubs well but the back swing is 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.829
 The bigger the ball, the more the ball 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.939
 Because the possibility of hitting is high 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.469
 I made my swing bigger and pushed it out in front of me 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.189
 Because there is a possibility, the one who is not stable first 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.249
 If you take the back swing small and compact 

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:44.139
 Because you can get a stable impact 

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:58.799
 At first please make the back swing compact 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.819
 By making the back swing smaller 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.869
 First of all, it becomes stronger against ball changes 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.759
 It is faster than I thought it was higher than I thought 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.239
 Deep or deeper than I thought 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.410
 After all back swing against the change of the ball 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.310
 It is difficult to cope with large and small backswing 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.950
 In a feeling of oddity for a little change 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.409
 It's very important because it comes to fit 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.150
 The second point is the point 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.430
 The second point is more than speed 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.180
 Please try to emphasize the spin Pretty Chikita does not enter 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.989
 When I hear a story that says "Please take a look" 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.909
 It's common to try to get too fast 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.360
 It feels like you're stuck in the net 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.959
 There are quite a few people who say that they make an over mistake 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.079
 In order to stabilize first, apply a firm rotation 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.701
 The sense of stability by making arcs is 

00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:59.730
 It will increase so much 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.409
 Please practice Chikita with emphasis on rotation 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.890
 Even if you don't throw a ball so fast, you say Chikita 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:16.680
 It is quite effective 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.840
 Focus on spin as much as possible 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.629
 The third point I think that stability will increase 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.599
 The direction of the swing is served by the opponent 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.500
 In the case of the lower rotation system, it seems like a little scoop up 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.390
 It feels like it makes the arc high 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.420
 Please try Chikyeta by doing so 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.230
 It will be stable Conversely, the other party's serve 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.060
 In the case of upper class, hold down a little 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.430
 Like taking the top of the ball 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.499
 It will be easier to hold in the image by clicking on it. 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.129
 Even though the rotation is up rotation 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.870
 I get a mistake when I scoop up 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.569
 Be sure to make sure while reading the rotation of the serve 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.879
 The swing of the Chiquita by rotation is also little by little 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.170
 Please try to change the basic system is lower 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.439
 Make an arc as you rescue 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.930
 When upper class serve comes, hold it down a little 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:39.410
 It becomes stable by chikita 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.010
 Stabilize the Chiquita 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.510
 We introduced three tips 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.170
 I explained it by quite basic things 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.570
 If you just do it, you can not be conscious 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.450
 I think that there is quite a lot, so by all means practice Chikita 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.570
 Please try to be conscious when you 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.420
 Thank you very much
