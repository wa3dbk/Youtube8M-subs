dome<00:00:40.650> was<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> game<00:00:41.339> I<00:00:42.680> first<00:00:43.680> found<00:00:43.890> me<00:00:44.010> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
dome was in the game I first found me to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.320 
dome was in the game I first found me to
clone<00:00:44.489> second<00:00:45.949> so<00:00:46.949> I<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.760> start<00:00:47.970> looking<00:00:48.180> at

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
clone second so I just start looking at

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.960 
clone second so I just start looking at
it<00:00:48.479> and<00:00:49.199> so<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:49.799> going<00:00:49.979> the<00:00:50.190> bridge<00:00:50.460> back<00:00:50.820> and

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
it and so it's going the bridge back and

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.270 
it and so it's going the bridge back and
forth<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.600> someone<00:00:52.530> was<00:00:52.680> controlling<00:00:52.860> it

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
forth like someone was controlling it

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.539 
forth like someone was controlling it
obviously<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:55.070> was<00:00:56.070> like<00:00:56.220> puzzled<00:00:58.430> when<00:00:59.430> you

00:00:59.539 --> 00:00:59.549 
obviously I was like puzzled when you

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:00.649 
obviously I was like puzzled when you
first<00:00:59.729> saw<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.879> ghost<00:01:00.119> what<00:01:00.330> did<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.540> think

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
first saw the ghost what did you think

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.359 
first saw the ghost what did you think
it<00:01:00.809> was<00:01:00.930> going<00:01:01.080> on<00:01:01.940> um<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.330> thought<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.839> was<00:01:03.989> like

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
it was going on um I thought it was like

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.280 
it was going on um I thought it was like
somehow<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.460> made<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> clone<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.299> was<00:01:06.450> walking<00:01:06.990> far

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
somehow I made a clone I was walking far

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.249 
somehow I made a clone I was walking far
but<00:01:07.530> inside<00:01:07.920> like<00:01:08.070> moving<00:01:08.310> back<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.640> forth<00:01:09.259> so

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
but inside like moving back and forth so

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.779 
but inside like moving back and forth so
I<00:01:10.320> figure<00:01:10.680> they're<00:01:11.039> somehow<00:01:13.399> from<00:01:14.399> a<00:01:14.759> 4<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> 3

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
I figure they're somehow from a 4 a 3

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.609 
I figure they're somehow from a 4 a 3
something<00:01:17.990> there<00:01:18.990> are<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.079> lot<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.289> people<00:01:19.500> who

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
something there are a lot of people who

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.969 
something there are a lot of people who
think<00:01:19.829> that<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.219> ghosts<00:01:20.520> are<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.670> like

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
think that the ghosts are just like

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.160 
think that the ghosts are just like
undeleted<00:01:22.979> data<00:01:23.219> or<00:01:23.549> some<00:01:23.850> kind<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.170> glitch

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
undeleted data or some kind of glitch

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.590 
undeleted data or some kind of glitch
store-bought<00:01:25.740> something<00:01:26.340> but<00:01:26.579> you<00:01:27.119> know<00:01:27.270> I

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
store-bought something but you know I

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.560 
store-bought something but you know I
think<00:01:27.899> in<00:01:28.109> this<00:01:28.229> particular<00:01:28.710> case<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.420> was

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
think in this particular case it it was

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.029 
think in this particular case it it was
it<00:01:31.049> seemed<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> was<00:01:31.710> being<00:01:31.859> controlled

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
it seemed like it was being controlled

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:33.440 
it seemed like it was being controlled
by<00:01:32.280> someone<00:01:32.640> because<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.880> mean<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.210> first

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
by someone because I mean it first

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.149 
by someone because I mean it first
spawns<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.869> hemorrhage<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.469> then<00:01:34.649> it<00:01:34.950> goes

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
spawns on hemorrhage and then it goes

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.580 
spawns on hemorrhage and then it goes
into<00:01:35.490> forge<00:01:35.820> mode<00:01:36.030> first<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.539> all<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.810> then<00:01:37.320> it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
into forge mode first of all and then it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.919 
into forge mode first of all and then it
just<00:01:37.799> flies<00:01:37.979> straight<00:01:38.429> over<00:01:38.789> to<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:38.999> and<00:01:39.240> then

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
just flies straight over to you and then

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:42.020 
just flies straight over to you and then
what<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.109> think<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.590> even<00:01:41.369> more<00:01:41.640> convincing

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
what I think is even more convincing

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.429 
what I think is even more convincing
because<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.359> all<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.719> I<00:01:42.929> could<00:01:43.079> accept

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
because like all that I could accept

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.609 
because like all that I could accept
that<00:01:43.710> as<00:01:44.249> possibly<00:01:44.880> bling<00:01:45.270> being<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.289> a

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
that as possibly bling being just like a

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.910 
that as possibly bling being just like a
glitch<00:01:46.979> or<00:01:47.159> something<00:01:47.490> but<00:01:48.479> when<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.049> find<00:01:49.409> that

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
glitch or something but when I find that

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.950 
glitch or something but when I find that
is<00:01:50.100> pretty<00:01:50.399> convincing<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:51.359> me<00:01:51.390> at<00:01:51.600> least<00:01:51.719> that

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
is pretty convincing to me at least that

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.620 
is pretty convincing to me at least that
this<00:01:52.770> seems<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.700> be<00:01:53.729> being<00:01:54.060> controlled<00:01:54.450> by

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
this seems to be being controlled by

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.919 
this seems to be being controlled by
someone<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.109> that<00:01:55.259> when<00:01:56.039> it<00:01:56.130> flies<00:01:56.340> over<00:01:56.609> it<00:01:57.600> it

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
someone is that when it flies over it it

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.719 
someone is that when it flies over it it
stands<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:58.789> your<00:01:59.789> new<00:02:00.119> custom<00:02:00.689> made<00:02:01.670> part<00:02:02.670> of

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
stands on your new custom made part of

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.510 
stands on your new custom made part of
the<00:02:02.789> map<00:02:02.999> and<00:02:03.329> then<00:02:03.780> not<00:02:04.170> only<00:02:04.200> does<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.799> like

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
the map and then not only does it like

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.570 
the map and then not only does it like
walk<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.079> starts<00:02:07.350> jumping<00:02:07.859> from

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
walk on to it but it starts jumping from

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.230 
walk on to it but it starts jumping from
the<00:02:08.759> gap<00:02:09.920> there's<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.009> gap<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.610> item<00:02:11.850> that

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
the gap there's a gap on that item that

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.660 
the gap there's a gap on that item that
you<00:02:12.330> made<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.840> jumps<00:02:13.200> from<00:02:13.470> one<00:02:14.370> piece<00:02:14.640> of

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
you made and it jumps from one piece of

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.250 
you made and it jumps from one piece of
