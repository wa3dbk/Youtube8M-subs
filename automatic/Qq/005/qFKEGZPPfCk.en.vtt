00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
you go all films I don't think if we

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.650 
you go all films I don't think if we
both<00:00:35.579> know<00:00:35.820> we'll<00:00:36.030> make<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:38.210> they<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.420> hear

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
both know we'll make it they can hear

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.369 
both know we'll make it they can hear
you<00:00:39.840> gonna<00:00:40.290> share<00:00:41.270> the<00:00:42.270> figure<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.050> probably

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
you gonna share the figure so probably

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.250 
you gonna share the figure so probably
really<00:00:43.950> does<00:00:44.190> not<00:00:44.460> close<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:45.480> one's<00:00:45.719> only<00:00:45.899> 30

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
really does not close that one's only 30

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.420 
really does not close that one's only 30
are<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.680> prevail

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.310 

like<00:00:52.030> you<00:00:52.210> even<00:00:52.240> have<00:00:52.540> to<00:00:52.630> make<00:00:52.840> it<00:00:52.990> to<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:53.170> top

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
like you even have to make it to the top

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.590 
like you even have to make it to the top
they'll<00:00:53.560> like<00:00:53.740> that<00:00:53.770> yes<00:00:54.070> you<00:00:54.220> made<00:00:54.430> it<00:00:54.600> 10

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
they'll like that yes you made it 10

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.690 
they'll like that yes you made it 10
yards<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:59.440> you<00:00:59.590> made<00:00:59.770> it<00:00:59.800> dan<00:01:00.100> yards<00:01:00.430> from<00:01:00.580> the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
yards if you made it dan yards from the

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.430 
yards if you made it dan yards from the
DA<00:01:00.850> vanilla<00:01:01.180> you<00:01:01.360> could<00:01:01.540> shoot<00:01:01.720> that<00:01:01.989> become

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
DA vanilla you could shoot that become

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.560 
DA vanilla you could shoot that become
like<00:01:02.920> absolutely<00:01:03.430> 30<00:01:03.790> yards<00:01:04.089> down<00:01:04.270> for<00:01:04.479> the

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
like absolutely 30 yards down for the

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:41.980 
like absolutely 30 yards down for the
day

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:02:22.449 

awesome

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.119 

830<00:02:24.019> we're<00:02:25.019> trying<00:02:25.409> to<00:02:25.560> give<00:02:25.739> him<00:02:25.860> some<00:02:26.069> time

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
830 we're trying to give him some time

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.149 
830 we're trying to give him some time
as<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:27.030> gets<00:02:27.209> dark<00:02:27.480> they'll<00:02:27.989> get<00:02:28.230> more<00:02:28.409> relaxed

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
as it gets dark they'll get more relaxed

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.670 
as it gets dark they'll get more relaxed
then<00:02:30.150> maybe<00:02:30.299> we<00:02:30.420> can<00:02:30.480> sneak<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.110> for<00:02:31.319> a<00:02:31.379> shot

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
then maybe we can sneak in for a shot

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.890 
then maybe we can sneak in for a shot
but<00:02:32.310> they're<00:02:32.519> pretty<00:02:32.760> long<00:02:33.030> ways<00:02:33.299> away<00:02:33.329> still

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
but they're pretty long ways away still

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.229 
but they're pretty long ways away still
there<00:02:34.049> probably<00:02:34.349> close<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.849> over<00:02:35.849> a<00:02:36.180> hundred

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
there probably close to over a hundred

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.599 
there probably close to over a hundred
yards<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.530> we've<00:02:37.650> got<00:02:37.799> to<00:02:37.890> try<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.159> close<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
yards so we've got to try and close the

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:50.300 
yards so we've got to try and close the
crowd<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:45.480> how<00:02:45.659> far<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.079> it<00:02:48.470> 149<00:02:49.470> yards<00:02:49.950> from

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
crowd and how far is it 149 yards from

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:59.860 
crowd and how far is it 149 yards from
us<00:02:50.400> right<00:02:50.670> now

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.040 

it's<00:03:00.870> very<00:03:01.170> exciting<00:03:02.240> we<00:03:03.240> spotted<00:03:03.600> them<00:03:03.870> when

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
it's very exciting we spotted them when

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.810 
it's very exciting we spotted them when
we're<00:03:04.200> coming<00:03:04.470> in<00:03:04.710> from<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.040> runway<00:03:05.280> over
