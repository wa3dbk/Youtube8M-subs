McDonald's<00:00:21.820> and<00:00:22.829> the<00:00:23.829> reason<00:00:24.160> why<00:00:24.279> this<00:00:24.340> is

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
McDonald's and the reason why this is

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.310 
McDonald's and the reason why this is
amber<00:00:24.849> Galt<00:00:25.060> instead<00:00:25.419> of<00:00:25.540> brick<00:00:25.720> boys<00:00:25.960> is

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
amber Galt instead of brick boys is

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.260 
amber Galt instead of brick boys is
because<00:00:26.739> we<00:00:27.279> didn't<00:00:27.520> really<00:00:27.700> think<00:00:27.910> that<00:00:28.029> this

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
because we didn't really think that this

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.549 
because we didn't really think that this
was<00:00:29.259> that<00:00:30.189> important<00:00:30.730> to<00:00:30.880> put<00:00:31.000> on<00:00:31.149> brick<00:00:31.329> boys

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:31.559
