00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.620
 jury for this recently that is the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.380
 second part of our test the smartphone 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.849
 As a desktop replacement, the keyboard is the keyboard 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.460
 is connected with bluetooth 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.910
 this is the mouse as well 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.449
 bluetooth and here we have already 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.390
 our calculator 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.650
 practically the smartphone a sony xperia 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.939
 z this red cable that you see 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.130
 NHL cable on these screens 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.660
 connected here is a start places 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.920
 I always come back here when I'm on 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.079
 the house back and can be here with 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.030
 multitasking we visit the me 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.530
 like to wait that now 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.690
 main screen I use my apps 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.879
 I started here on google 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.770
 clique I can enter something 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.410
 the keyboard sometimes needs one 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.539
 little but all in all , maria 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:57.480
 Viola that's no problem because 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.460
 wifi works very limited 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.270
 unfortunately when mouse and keyboard 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.949
 are connected 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.960
 that's the biggest problem and that's why 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.850
 I have to test it, too 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.409
 cancel again because so 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.700
 It does not work what you do now 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.100
 the service is great 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.530
 up here the status bar and here 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.000
 on the right is the main app 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.350
 practically as I think 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.939
 mac also set up here with the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.860
 job I have on my right and above 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.869
 here status bar i can always go here 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.810
 again with the mouse, of course 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.759
 call the notifications 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.049
 i have on my my most important 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.460
 apps i can call whats app here 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.079
 operate with the keyboard 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.740
 they wanted to make me up here 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.150
 click music and yes things start the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.340
 I would like to say it again briefly 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.869
 I would work with the browser 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.640
 have such a kind of tabbed browsing once 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.430
 I like to live here 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.570
 So I want to come back again 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.710
 tabbed browsing where I am completely outside 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.200
 can choose or close here 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.860
 and can add new tips 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.469
 Of course, all that if nothing 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.009
 Wi-Fi is available and that's great 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:06.399
 synonymous, of course, have the problem that the 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.599
 resolution is not particularly high 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.120
 that's why a little one does not 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.650
 when I call individual web pages 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.940
 the presentation is very wide and it 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.989
 would have to be a bit smaller, it is 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.099
 make a little more fun 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.099
 but also with the mouse 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.170
 the game works i really can 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.700
 cooperate well here even phone 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.280
 Out of here I can do music I do not have 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.019
 Everything desktop pc do too 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.910
 does google have the here 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.709
 possibility actually microsoft 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.819
 to beat and cheat me for the 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.920
 advise to do that 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.180
 Maybe at 5, that's what we get 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.640
 need a better support for 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.269
 Input output devices and a better 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.160
 presentation 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.019
 I think it's quite interesting actually 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.860
 another alternative to mac 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.450
 and windows and maybe google stands 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.040
 We will look at this score 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.250
 thanks for watching jÃ¼rgen condense 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.250
 yourself
