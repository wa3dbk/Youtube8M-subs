00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.390 
when comparing wait for these two phones
this<00:04:36.600> one<00:04:36.780> actually<00:04:36.930> comes<00:04:37.199> in<00:04:37.440> at<00:04:37.650> five<00:04:38.130> point

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
this one actually comes in at five point

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.180 
this one actually comes in at five point
eight<00:04:38.580> nine<00:04:38.760> ounces<00:04:39.180> or<00:04:39.300> 167<00:04:40.290> grams<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:40.830> this

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
eight nine ounces or 167 grams and this

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.370 
eight nine ounces or 167 grams and this
comes<00:04:41.460> in<00:04:41.610> at<00:04:41.729> six<00:04:42.270> point<00:04:42.479> five<00:04:42.780> three<00:04:43.110> ounces

comes in at six point five three ounces

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.260 
comes in at six point five three ounces
or<00:04:43.530> 185<00:04:44.280> grams<00:04:44.490> so<00:04:44.760> this<00:04:44.970> is<00:04:45.090> obviously

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.370 
definitely tell it if you look at them
you<00:04:48.210> know<00:04:48.300> if<00:04:48.389> you<00:04:48.449> put<00:04:48.600> them<00:04:48.720> on<00:04:49.050> top<00:04:49.229> of<00:04:49.290> one

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
you know if you put them on top of one

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.710 
you know if you put them on top of one
another<00:04:49.470> you<00:04:50.250> see<00:04:50.430> that<00:04:50.610> it<00:04:50.699> is<00:04:50.850> marginally

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
another you see that it is marginally

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.129 
another you see that it is marginally
thinner<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:53.040> 930<00:04:53.400> is<00:04:53.669> slightly<00:04:54.510> longer<00:04:54.840> but

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
thinner the 930 is slightly longer but

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.439 
thinner the 930 is slightly longer but
with<00:04:55.740> wise<00:04:56.010> there's<00:04:56.639> not<00:04:56.760> a<00:04:56.790> lot<00:04:56.940> in<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:57.180> and

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
with wise there's not a lot in it and

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.100 
with wise there's not a lot in it and
obviously<00:04:58.910> on<00:04:59.910> top<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:00.360> thickness<00:05:00.870> you<00:05:00.990> can

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
obviously on top and thickness you can

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.659 
obviously on top and thickness you can
see<00:05:01.229> that<00:05:01.320> the<00:05:01.380> 920<00:05:01.830> is<00:05:01.860> slightly<00:05:02.190> thicker<00:05:02.430> so

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
see that the 920 is slightly thicker so

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.820 
see that the 920 is slightly thicker so
this<00:05:03.150> is<00:05:03.300> definitely<00:05:03.479> the<00:05:03.720> slimmer<00:05:04.260> nicer

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
this is definitely the slimmer nicer

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.580 
this is definitely the slimmer nicer
newer<00:05:05.250> phone<00:05:05.580> but<00:05:06.510> is<00:05:06.660> a<00:05:06.690> really<00:05:07.080> really<00:05:07.380> nice
