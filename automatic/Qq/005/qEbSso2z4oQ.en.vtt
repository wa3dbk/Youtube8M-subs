questions<00:00:02.720> differing<00:00:03.720> only<00:00:03.840> slightly<00:00:04.290> from

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529

the<00:00:04.560> Greeks<00:00:04.830> were<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.580> Roman<00:00:05.850> theaters<00:00:06.180> which

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
the Greeks were the Roman theaters which

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.360 
the Greeks were the Roman theaters which
were<00:00:06.720> often<00:00:06.899> freestanding<00:00:07.589> rather<00:00:07.980> than<00:00:08.160> part

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
were often freestanding rather than part

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.950 
were often freestanding rather than part
of<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.550> Hill<00:00:08.700> sign<00:00:08.730> so<00:00:09.389> what<00:00:09.540> are<00:00:09.630> we<00:00:09.690> comparing

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
of a Hill sign so what are we comparing

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.320 
of a Hill sign so what are we comparing
we're<00:00:10.200> comparing<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.769> Greeks<00:00:11.059> to<00:00:12.059> Roman

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
we're comparing the Greeks to Roman

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.459 
we're comparing the Greeks to Roman
theaters<00:00:12.599> now<00:00:12.719> wait<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.929> min<00:00:13.019> we<00:00:13.110> can't<00:00:13.259> do<00:00:13.380> that

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
theaters now wait a min we can't do that

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.379 
theaters now wait a min we can't do that
we<00:00:13.590> can<00:00:13.740> compare<00:00:14.250> people<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.700> theaters<00:00:15.150> so

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
we can compare people to theaters so

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.960 
we can compare people to theaters so
either<00:00:16.020> we're<00:00:16.379> going<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.560> fix<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:16.830> by<00:00:17.130> well

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
either we're going to fix this by well

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.920 
either we're going to fix this by well
we're<00:00:18.060> probably<00:00:18.210> gonna<00:00:18.390> fix<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.690> by<00:00:18.750> making

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
we're probably gonna fix it by making

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.570 
we're probably gonna fix it by making
this<00:00:19.109> Greeks<00:00:19.470> theaters<00:00:19.980> right<00:00:20.189> comparing

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
this Greeks theaters right comparing

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.859 
this Greeks theaters right comparing
fevers<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.060> theaters<00:00:21.359> but<00:00:21.390> let's<00:00:21.630> just<00:00:21.689> see

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
fevers to theaters but let's just see

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.000 
fevers to theaters but let's just see
what<00:00:21.990> happens<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.439> we're<00:00:22.590> looking<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.920> make

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
what happens so we're looking to make

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.370 
what happens so we're looking to make
the<00:00:23.100> comparison<00:00:23.519> equal<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:23.880> get<00:00:24.000> rid<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.150> a

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
the comparison equal we can get rid of a

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.839 
the comparison equal we can get rid of a
let's<00:00:25.380> look<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.560> big<00:00:25.740> differing<00:00:26.220> only<00:00:26.400> slightly

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
let's look a big differing only slightly

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.970 
let's look a big differing only slightly
from<00:00:27.150> Greek<00:00:27.359> theaters<00:00:27.720> Roman<00:00:28.410> theaters<00:00:28.740> were

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
from Greek theaters Roman theaters were

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.439 
from Greek theaters Roman theaters were
often<00:00:29.340> freestanding<00:00:29.730> rather<00:00:30.029> than<00:00:30.150> part<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.390> a

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
often freestanding rather than part of a

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.700 
often freestanding rather than part of a
hillside<00:00:30.720> yep<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.170> now<00:00:31.289> we're<00:00:31.439> comparing

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
hillside yep so now we're comparing

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.959 
hillside yep so now we're comparing
Greek<00:00:31.980> theaters<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.399> Roman<00:00:32.700> theaters

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
Greek theaters to Roman theaters

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.790 
Greek theaters to Roman theaters
importantly<00:00:33.719> we're<00:00:33.899> also<00:00:34.020> not<00:00:34.230> introducing

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
importantly we're also not introducing

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.380 
importantly we're also not introducing
any<00:00:34.920> new<00:00:35.280> errors<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> sentence<00:00:36.090> which<00:00:36.270> is

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
any new errors to the sentence which is

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.959 
any new errors to the sentence which is
critical<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.040> be<00:00:38.040> looks<00:00:38.250> pretty<00:00:38.460> solid<00:00:38.640> let's

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
critical so be looks pretty solid let's

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.910 
critical so be looks pretty solid let's
look<00:00:39.059> at<00:00:39.180> sea<00:00:39.360> differing<00:00:40.200> only<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
look at sea differing only in the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.799 
look at sea differing only in the
slightest<00:00:41.489> where's<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.000> coming<00:00:42.149> from<00:00:42.270> from

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
slightest where's that coming from from

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.270 
slightest where's that coming from from
the<00:00:42.930> Greeks<00:00:43.200> where<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.500> Roman<00:00:43.620> okay<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:43.980> same

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the Greeks where the Roman okay so same

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.590 
the Greeks where the Roman okay so same
error<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:44.879> we're<00:00:45.090> also<00:00:45.180> adding<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
error and see we're also adding the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.959 
error and see we're also adding the
slightest<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.200> doesn't<00:00:46.890> do<00:00:47.039> anything<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
slightest that doesn't do anything the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.819 
slightest that doesn't do anything the
Greeks<00:00:48.239> differed<00:00:48.780> only<00:00:49.020> slightly<00:00:49.469> from<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
Greeks differed only slightly from the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.650 
Greeks differed only slightly from the
Romans<00:00:50.160> okay<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.670> now<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.910> comparison<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
Romans okay so now the comparison is the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.209 
Romans okay so now the comparison is the
same<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.140> now<00:00:52.320> we've<00:00:52.710> done<00:00:52.890> we've<00:00:53.039> made<00:00:53.190> a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
same but now we've done we've made a

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.470 
same but now we've done we've made a
commis<00:00:53.579> wise<00:00:53.760> because<00:00:53.969> now<00:00:54.059> we've<00:00:54.180> got<00:00:54.329> two

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
commis wise because now we've got two

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.810 
commis wise because now we've got two
complete<00:00:54.840> sentences<00:00:55.160> with<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> comma<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.610> also

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
complete sentences with a comma and also

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
complete sentences with a comma and also
doesn't<00:00:57.030> make<00:00:57.120> sense<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.390> say<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
doesn't make sense to say that the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.240 
doesn't make sense to say that the
Greeks<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.289> Romans<00:00:58.350> were<00:00:58.770> freestanding

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
Greeks and Romans were freestanding

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.709 
Greeks and Romans were freestanding
rather<00:00:59.640> than<00:00:59.820> part<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.180> hillside<00:01:00.480> so

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
rather than part of a hillside so

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.330 
rather than part of a hillside so
actually<00:01:01.350> getting<00:01:01.500> rid<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.219> making

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
actually getting rid of this and making

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.860 
actually getting rid of this and making
it<00:01:02.489> Greeks<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.879> Romans<00:01:02.940> rather<00:01:03.449> than<00:01:03.629> just

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
it Greeks and Romans rather than just

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.479 
it Greeks and Romans rather than just
the<00:01:04.019> theaters<00:01:04.379> actually<00:01:05.100> makes<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.339> confusing

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the theaters actually makes it confusing

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.859 
the theaters actually makes it confusing
tues<00:01:05.909> there's<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.180> lot<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.420> things<00:01:06.630> wrong<00:01:06.810> with

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
tues there's a lot of things wrong with

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.080 
tues there's a lot of things wrong with
date<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.979> greek<00:01:08.159> theater<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.580> different<00:01:09.030> from

date the greek theater is different from
the<00:01:09.240> roman<00:01:09.540> theater<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.840> only<00:01:10.020> slightly<00:01:10.350> where

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the roman theater is only slightly where

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.010 
the roman theater is only slightly where
they<00:01:11.340> were<00:01:11.400> often<00:01:11.880> freestanding<00:01:12.479> rather<00:01:12.840> than

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
they were often freestanding rather than

they were often freestanding rather than

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
part of a hill set so we're changing the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.520 
part of a hill set so we're changing the
sentence<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.540> bit<00:01:15.689> we<00:01:15.810> are<00:01:15.960> comparing<00:01:16.350> the

sentence a bit we are comparing the
right<00:01:16.650> things<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.040> then<00:01:17.159> we<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.460> weird

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
right things and then we have this weird

right things and then we have this weird
awkward<00:01:18.299> where<00:01:18.630> they<00:01:18.930> phrase<00:01:19.680> which<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.130> don't

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
awkward where they phrase which we don't

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.980 
awkward where they phrase which we don't
