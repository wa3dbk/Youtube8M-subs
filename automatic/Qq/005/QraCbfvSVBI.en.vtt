00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:08.549
 [Music] 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:11.969
 something is very wrong the 65 deaths what 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:14.039
 confirm and nobody can deny it but 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.920
 this party height say it already 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.330
 the terrible thing of the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.119
 situations that have already been naturalized 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.060
 the weekends especially 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.329
 long and even more during the holidays 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.849
 accidents happen and worse yet they are 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.640
 officially regarded as an average 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.449
 acceptable although we are talking about 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.039
 lives blinded irreversible damages the 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.649
 four deaths of the weekend of 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.440
 Christmas with the awfulness of the figure already 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.239
 They do not scare, nor do they impress 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.030
 dozens of injured some of them 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.140
 serious as a result of more accidents 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.059
 of transit something is very wrong in light 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.129
 of the facts it would seem that we 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.410
 we face an impossible situation of 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.750
 control as if it were a 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.600
 plague that advances over us for the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.190
 which there is no cure but the analysis of 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.010
 situation shows that the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.900
 causes are much more controllable and 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.590
 that the sinister result of deaths and 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.609
 wounded 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.920
 solution if all the social actors 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:18.719
 fulfill our responsibility 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.030
 the death of the two young policemen in 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.640
 capayan show as an accumulation of 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.189
 breaches and responsibilities we 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.719
 put in tragic situations a 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.270
 collective that does not comply with the service 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.299
 and leaves people walking by on the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.590
 the route the police controls 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.109
 insufficient or non-existent that 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.539
 time arrested a murderer who 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.939
 drunk driving a car that 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.709
 causes an accident and ends with the 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.069
 life of two young people who started 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:49.020
 retrace a new stage in their lives 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:51.599
 a chain of responsible people that should 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.440
 answer for what is their responsibility and that 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:55.210
 they did not meet 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.450
 the prevention and education tasks 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.250
 road for some reason are failing and 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.680
 unfortunately they stay in the middle of 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.900
 way and does not mean that all the 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.350
 responsibility of the authorities 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.320
 for motorcyclists and motorists 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.480
 are co-actors of this reality and although 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.430
 the deaths are incomprehensible and 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.930
 accidents are still related 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.570
 with behaviors practically 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.720
 self-destructive how to drive a motorcycle 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.490
 drunk or without helmet 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.380
 the tragic results of the 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.420
 transit would be avoided if as a society 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.690
 we were more willing to accept 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.210
 the laws norms and controls that seek 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.790
 protect our lives provisions 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.370
 as simple and decisive as using a 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.290
 safety belt that sometimes they do 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.860
 the difference between a scare and a 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.050
 tragedy 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.870
 justice will also have to review 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.540
 some situations and even if it is governed by 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.550
 hard letter standards read the situation 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.070
 social emergency that we go through with 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.910
 commitment will have to make you rethink 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.890
 his role can not be killer behaviors like 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.870
 that of the conductor of capayÃ¡n be 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.660
 awarded with penalties that do not impose a 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.040
 prison day when what was taken away is 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.720
 as irreplaceable and unique as life 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.400
 as a society we are so immature that 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.590
 we keep adding in the counter 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.540
 deaths and spending tens of thousands of 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.580
 weights in caring for wounded people 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.070
 probably never recover the 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.290
 full capacity and that 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.320
 will have to settle for celebrating that 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.470
 they are still alive the contempt for 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.180
 own life and more serious still the others not 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.730
 may have been installed so 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.550
 definitive to the point that we can not as 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.340
 society to reverse it 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.970
 only a great social commitment can 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.000
 achieve meanwhile we are very bad and 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.039
 we will continue like this 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.039
