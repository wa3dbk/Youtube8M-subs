00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.149
 ch'ti 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.959
 this time it's a comic that we go 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:13.969
 imagine elements to use will be 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:17.730
 certainly and messages not bad yes 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.740
 so I think it will be a comic and 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.460
 more precisely a comics of 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.100
 Super hero 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.619
 it will be in a dark mood and 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.930
 heavy like a famous bat 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.840
 however he will be separated from everything 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.579
 multiverse as v for vendetta or 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.339
 watchmen 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.859
 history takes place in 2035 in the usa 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:40.769
 in the city of silicone pitt 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.960
 this city was born from the silicon valley 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.850
 by dint of gaining importance 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.699
 she ended up swallowing the cities 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.440
 around which 136 the mans super 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.449
 industrial powers she is 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.429
 totally irregular is the place of 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.129
 all the moral excesses financial and 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:00.719
 environmental 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.359
 the main actors of this dystopia 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.540
 are the cobra group consisting of the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.700
 collaboration of three industry media 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.250
 worse security a group of ways to 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.649
 security and private police studs 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.950
 media an information distributor and 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.750
 means of communication and sweet between a 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.189
 technology research center 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.219
 mechanical and biological 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.409
 of course power and money their 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:28.170
 allows to easily corrupt in 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.000
 this city lives the eye of lohan a 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.369
 activist politician who fights 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.549
 openly the cobra group by 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.200
 manifestations of sabotage and 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.420
 citizen education 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.880
 during a sabotage miss lloyd will be 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.189
 captured rather than martyred 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.380
 he implants him the subject of a 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.020
 experimentation 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.069
 a computer virus for the brain 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.319
 human during a press conference 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:59.020
 lloyd will kill the mayor as well as several 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.780
 militants of his party before fleeing 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.000
 little by little he will manage to take the 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.189
 control over the virus and will visit 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.049
 account that the latter has mutated he is 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.479
 now able to transmit by the 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.760
 word of mouth that the listeners are 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.269
 forced to execute sought by the 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.120

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.849
 ea of ​​his former group he will take 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.459
 when new no miss their signifier 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.310
 the total a rattlesnake 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.760
 because his power acts according to him as a 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.610
 poison 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.040
 he wears no disguise only 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.739
 one- eyed glasses a scarf and 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.959
 peace and a jacket 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.000
 his goal is simple to bring down the 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.769
 cobra group as well as all those who 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.019
 keep the silicone pitt in its 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.850
 state of decadence as a politician 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.300
 activists he wants to change the society 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.740
 by his actions 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.710
 that's how it is not an example of 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.650
 defect and is ready to kill his power 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.390
 is not absolute indeed his voice can 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.880
 push a person to perform a 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.530
 immediate action but he does not control 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.100
 for as much the person which limits 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.150
 actions must reach 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.090
 specific results 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.660
 he must multiply one or 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.660
 several people 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.630
 it's the sonatu he's not very strong 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.390
 and do not know how to fight but he is 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.150
 smart tactical and patient his 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.940
 nemesis and of course the cobra 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.530
 however other people will try 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.780
 to thwart his plans as to 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.500
