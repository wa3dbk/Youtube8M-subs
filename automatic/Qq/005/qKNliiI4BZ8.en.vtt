00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:08.260
 Yes Now I would like to lecture the folding of the cage Hatsuru of Tteyuu Orihazu Lumpur is 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.840
 Let's see 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:15.660
 Unlike ordinary chord 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.660
 Saddle is open like sense 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.010
 Tsuruta 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.440
 Such as if resting 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.310
 Kanji 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.770
 I have a form 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.910
 This should be 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:32.720
 I would like to know how to break this 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.720
 Well then 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.390
 If you're the one who can play the strings, it's already here 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.800
 It is up to this state 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.450
 Verbally 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.350
 Turn into a triangle again by a triangle 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:55.700
 In the form of a bag 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:58.350
 It is up to the place that was once again a more cumbersome bag cage open it up to the open place in a bag shape 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.010
 I'm going to go with an ordinary moat crane 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.710
 from here 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:08.430
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:11.159
 I'm going to fold into this inside, but in the case of a mistake, the point is different from here 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.649
 Well , let 's start from here 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.649
 Both sides are open to the other side 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.310
 A while ago 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.060
 If the reverse 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.790
 Here 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.200
 To open earlier gold situation 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.200
 Open me first 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.630
 Is it ok 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.080
 In order to weave the part of the feather from here 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.420
 Is not this one 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:46.990
 Above in accordance with the center line of the middle of the lower 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.990
 I am 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.119
 Similarly it This is mon back 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.119
 It is because 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.290
 Small triangle 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.069
 It feels like it 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:17.540
 There is a corner in the middle 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:19.170
 Now I 'm going to put feathers from here, so this is the corner of this 2 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.300
 Good or bad 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.330
 Even if it is an individual 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.230
 Better to the face 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.350
 The 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:34.120
 Nde but bran feather do If you do not match the law light facing 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:39.560
 Well then let's just leave the way to head occasionally 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:42.660
 It is how to get off in that case but yes left 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.400
 Wings since come 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.870
 There is a lot of jealousy 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.870
 At first thought 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.550
 Feathers to the line below 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.550
 I love you 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.980
 I have one 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:14.030
 It will be in this state 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:16.700
 The I think that here in the mountains there is another Yamafutatsu mountain is better if there one one, but in the first one of the mountain 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.280
 Together 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:25.870
 Please creased 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.870
 Have a second feather to match the first eye mountain line 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:42.349
 Now from this state I do not have this feather in half size 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.349
 In addition, I think to the outside 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.400
 So this time 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.880
 Yes 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.520
 This crease size is the same as this size 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.400
 County of 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.360
 Open 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.360
 Now I have inside 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.010
 It is the husband in the pool Roh under the tools of body parts 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.820
 In the rest of the eco 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:35.860
 The rest is end 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:39.060
 In this state, which has had operations by pinching middle et al strange the Saddle 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.620
 The rest of the largest spacer moiety 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.630
 Inside good 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.630
 I feel like I'm folded 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:54.870
 This is also a fan 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.870
 I think I can 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.680
 Well, it is difficult to explain in words, but 8 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.800
 It entered the equally 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.440
 In a serpentine manner 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.440
 If there is a crease like war, there is no problem 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.070
 And so on the other side 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.870
 Bring 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:23.040
 First of all 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:23.040
 Good to put the wings out to the bottom line 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:31.420
 Two mountains Oh in this state 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.670
 I think there is a first eye here 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.210
 With the 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:39.110
 We went together 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.110
 To reach 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.470
 Or this 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.849
 In the open state 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.070
 From the open state 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:09.280
 Hmm 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.750
 It is the same treasure as the public 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.750
 Same width as inside 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.479
 Say from home 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.009
 Last of the 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.460
 Habot 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:23.460
 Overwhelmed 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.420
 This is symmetrical 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:33.270
 Fan 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.270
 Many when it is 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:38.889
 It's almost complete if you get here 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:46.180
 this 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:50.469
 It is this part of the left since said that the head relative to the orientation of the earlier wing towards to head Well to the left 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:55.499
 Around half of this break 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:55.499
 Just half hungry 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:01.380
 Part of face 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.380
 to raise 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.100
 I like 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:11.060
 I 'm sewing like this 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.060
 It took dim hand 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.790
 For the time being entered 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:26.320
 Face was finished eh in this 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.320
 It feels like 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:32.600
 This is 

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:34.750
 It is a complete form of the cage should 

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.960
 Of like this 

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:43.050
 I think I can make a crane 

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.050
 Yes, it is more than how to fold a tooth crane
