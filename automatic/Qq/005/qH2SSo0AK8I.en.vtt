the<00:02:35.390> entire<00:02:35.750> rest<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:37.160> room<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.670> just

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
the entire rest of the room so it just

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.580 
the entire rest of the room so it just
opens<00:02:38.240> everything<00:02:38.630> up<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.140> then<00:02:39.260> this<00:02:39.410> is

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
opens everything up and then this is

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.410 
opens everything up and then this is
also<00:02:39.770> a<00:02:39.980> good<00:02:40.310> mirror<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.880> get<00:02:41.030> ready<00:02:41.240> in

touch up the original color which I
really<00:03:31.520> like<00:03:31.700> just<00:03:32.510> because<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:33.020> more<00:03:33.290> I<00:03:33.650> get

stuff in this room like the more I get

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.780 
stuff in this room like the more I get
like<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:35.900> painting<00:03:36.350> hung<00:03:36.590> or<00:03:36.920> just<00:03:37.370> like<00:03:37.489> stuff

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
like a painting hung or just like stuff

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.050 
like a painting hung or just like stuff
filling<00:03:38.330> it<00:03:38.450> in<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:39.350> more<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.610> wall<00:03:40.790> color

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
filling it in the more the wall color

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.150 
filling it in the more the wall color
just<00:03:41.209> kind<00:03:41.450> of<00:03:41.510> fades<00:03:41.720> away<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:42.470> so<00:03:42.739> I<00:03:42.769> think<00:03:43.040> a

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
just kind of fades away and so I think a

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.560 
just kind of fades away and so I think a
light<00:03:43.459> neutral<00:03:43.820> might<00:03:44.000> just<00:03:44.180> be<00:03:44.269> a<00:03:44.300> good<00:03:44.480> one

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
light neutral might just be a good one

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.000 
light neutral might just be a good one
to<00:03:44.720> stick<00:03:44.900> with<00:03:45.050> especially<00:03:45.530> since<00:03:45.709> I've<00:03:45.800> got

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
to stick with especially since I've got

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.820 
to stick with especially since I've got
palm<00:03:46.220> going<00:03:46.670> in<00:03:46.790> now<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:48.200> all<00:03:48.320> kinds<00:03:48.650> of<00:03:48.709> stuff

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
palm going in now and all kinds of stuff

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.229

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
to sit on it like wait a month and think

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.050 
to sit on it like wait a month and think
about<00:04:13.070> it<00:04:13.190> every<00:04:13.400> day<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.790> then<00:04:13.880> make<00:04:14.030> a

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
about it every day and then make a

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.280 
about it every day and then make a
decision<00:04:14.269> because<00:04:14.660> that's<00:04:14.840> what<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.080> sheets

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
decision because that's what the sheets

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.810 
decision because that's what the sheets
were<00:04:15.470> for<00:04:15.680> me<00:04:15.769> I<00:04:15.800> wasn't<00:04:16.070> sure<00:04:16.280> if<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.459> wanted<00:04:16.640> to

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
were for me I wasn't sure if I wanted to

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.430 
were for me I wasn't sure if I wanted to
do<00:04:17.000> white<00:04:17.209> or<00:04:17.450> if<00:04:17.540> I<00:04:17.600> wanted<00:04:17.900> to<00:04:17.989> stay<00:04:18.169> with<00:04:18.200> a

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
do white or if I wanted to stay with a

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.920 
do white or if I wanted to stay with a
colored<00:04:18.830> sheet<00:04:19.160> or<00:04:19.489> what<00:04:20.060> but<00:04:20.299> then<00:04:20.480> I<00:04:20.510> decided

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
colored sheet or what but then I decided

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.380 
colored sheet or what but then I decided
that<00:04:21.290> I<00:04:21.769> would<00:04:21.890> go<00:04:22.130> with<00:04:22.280> white<00:04:22.580> because<00:04:23.030> I<00:04:23.180> am

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
that I would go with white because I am

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.240
