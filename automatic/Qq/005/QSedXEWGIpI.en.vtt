00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.950
 player 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.270
 a former big magic player 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.640

 3 euros in a cache that's more 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.600
 seen the state but look at that and 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.660
 apparently there was they take 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.070
 really care about their ps2 games and that I 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.750
 think it's a very good point 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.600
 like when I 'm going to show the last 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.960
 times xbox games an island and where the home 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.790
 miu 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.740
 the ch came to watch when I got them 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.780
 found in a state close to new 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.460
 I was really happy it's always 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.200
 nice to have super good players 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.630
 being his collection 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.820
 unfortunately as I buy at 99% 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.930
 used games but I want to put 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.520
 my entire video game collection is 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.430
 not necessarily in an irreproachable state 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.050
 game what I mean by that is that 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.420
 when I know it's a camp it's a 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.920
 game I had at Christmas and where I 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.770
 personally purchased 9 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.600
 I can tell you that even after 10 15 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.080
 years old he is still in a close state 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.800
 new 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.080
 look look for example the zelda 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.640
 oracle of seasons look at the state on me 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.620
 offered it to christmas he did not move a 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.480
 inch at the state level because me 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.480
 I am a person who cares for 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.190
 huy to take with tweezers this 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.550
 note wondering to look at the 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.900
 video to I explode 180 360 games what I 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.520
 mean by that is that I carry 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.320
 is that the box you can 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.990
 easily there you can easily the 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.220
 change so it's not a problem 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.750
 after knows when it's boxes 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.750
 hardcopy is much more fragile 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:46.050
 I should not smash people in 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.030
 cardboard wood because these series 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.130
 filled replaceable so that's it over 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.680
 for weekly purchases this week 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.780
 a good week with a big collector 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.780
 a boxed console full of small 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:01.350
 games and and so here is this site we go

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.760
 passion the borderlands 2 I can you 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.169
 to say that it's been a while since 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.380
 I had more that feeling when I

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.470
 work and to be able to play my game 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.910

 it's true but I catch up with 

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.560
 catches up 

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.240
 must say that I play at so much 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.950
