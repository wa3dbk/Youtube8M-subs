welcome everyone again and now we're
testing<00:00:38.839> the<00:00:39.050> loopy<00:00:39.379> Essex<00:00:39.920> 4s<00:00:40.280> cross<00:00:40.609> on<00:00:40.879> the

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
testing the loopy Essex 4s cross on the

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.779 
testing the loopy Essex 4s cross on the
snow<00:00:41.780> test<00:00:42.140> track<00:00:42.440> it's<00:00:42.829> very<00:00:43.100> muddy<00:00:43.399> snow

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
snow test track it's very muddy snow

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.540 
snow test track it's very muddy snow
today<00:00:44.149> and<00:00:44.510> we<00:00:44.989> were<00:00:45.109> gaining<00:00:45.289> with<00:00:46.129> a<00:00:46.159> small

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
today and we were gaining with a small

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.860 
today and we were gaining with a small
test<00:00:46.850> here<00:00:48.370> just<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.640> have<00:00:49.820> a<00:00:49.850> lane<00:00:50.120> change<00:00:50.149> in

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
test here just to have a lane change in

00:00:50.870 --> 00:01:04.010 
test here just to have a lane change in
the<00:00:51.079> midsummer<00:00:51.409> fear<00:00:52.159> of<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.399> snow

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.500 

so<00:01:04.350> well<00:01:04.590> I'm<00:01:04.710> searing<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.310> not<00:01:05.670> much<00:01:06.300> is

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
so well I'm searing it not much is

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.360 
so well I'm searing it not much is
happening<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.500> see<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.890> gathered<00:01:08.190> like

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
happening but we see we gathered like

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.220 
happening but we see we gathered like
was<00:01:08.550> 50<00:01:08.940> kilometers<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.630> were<00:01:09.720> still<00:01:09.960> made

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
was 50 kilometers and were still made

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.760 
was 50 kilometers and were still made
the<00:01:10.410> main<00:01:10.560> change

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.750 

this<00:01:14.770> is<00:01:14.920> round<00:01:15.220> here

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
this is round here

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.410 
this is round here
it's<00:01:16.030> very<00:01:16.240> slippery<00:01:16.540> and<00:01:16.750> also<00:01:17.260> quite<00:01:17.530> icy

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
it's very slippery and also quite icy

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.690 
it's very slippery and also quite icy
because<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.540> Sun<00:01:19.810> has<00:01:20.140> made<00:01:20.950> it<00:01:21.100> very<00:01:21.130> wet

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
because the Sun has made it very wet

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.090 
because the Sun has made it very wet
actually<00:01:22.630> today<00:01:22.930> and<00:01:23.290> now<00:01:23.500> it's<00:01:23.680> freezing

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
actually today and now it's freezing

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.250 
actually today and now it's freezing
again<00:01:24.370> this<00:01:25.030> car<00:01:25.270> can<00:01:25.420> really<00:01:25.630> be<00:01:25.840> a<00:01:26.080> lot<00:01:26.200> of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
again this car can really be a lot of

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.500 
again this car can really be a lot of
fun<00:01:26.530> in<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.010> snow<00:01:27.070> because<00:01:27.460> it<00:01:27.880> also<00:01:28.090> has<00:01:28.360> the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
fun in the snow because it also has the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.140 
fun in the snow because it also has the
all-wheel<00:01:28.960> drive<00:01:29.170> which<00:01:29.470> directs<00:01:29.980> the<00:01:30.490> talk

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
all-wheel drive which directs the talk

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.990 
all-wheel drive which directs the talk
to<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.540> back<00:01:31.690> wheels<00:01:31.930> so<00:01:32.650> you<00:01:32.710> also<00:01:33.550> got<00:01:33.880> the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
to the back wheels so you also got the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:02:13.410 
to the back wheels so you also got the
neck<00:01:34.180> is<00:01:34.420> spinning

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.770 

he<00:02:14.420> is<00:02:14.480> more<00:02:14.690> loose<00:02:14.990> reading<00:02:15.440> reading<00:02:16.780> seeing

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
he is more loose reading reading seeing

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.190 
he is more loose reading reading seeing
a<00:02:17.870> One<00:02:18.020> Direction<00:02:18.050> very<00:02:18.680> hard

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
a One Direction very hard

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.040 
a One Direction very hard
and<00:02:20.650> we<00:02:20.770> see<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.160> steering<00:02:21.580> wheel<00:02:22.050> comes

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
and we see that the steering wheel comes

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.070 
and we see that the steering wheel comes
kind<00:02:23.380> of<00:02:23.530> back<00:02:23.709> automatically

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.500 

so<00:02:30.080> sometimes<00:02:30.590> have<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:31.040> let<00:02:31.790> Steven<00:02:32.269> feel

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
so sometimes have to let Steven feel

00:02:32.510 --> 00:03:03.200 
so sometimes have to let Steven feel
flow<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.319> bit<00:02:33.590> itself

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.530 

you<00:03:04.210> can<00:03:04.360> either<00:03:04.510> chose<00:03:04.960> the<00:03:05.500> auto<00:03:06.190> mode<00:03:06.610> on

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
you can either chose the auto mode on

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.070 
you can either chose the auto mode on
the<00:03:07.690> snow<00:03:07.930> mode<00:03:08.170> on<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.250> spot<00:03:09.520> post<00:03:10.420> snow<00:03:10.810> and

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
the snow mode on the spot post snow and

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.100 
the snow mode on the spot post snow and
sport<00:03:11.470> mode<00:03:12.360> Livermore<00:03:13.360> target<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.960> back

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
sport mode Livermore target the back

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.990 
sport mode Livermore target the back
wheels<00:03:14.500> but<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.310> sport<00:03:15.700> mode<00:03:17.460> will<00:03:18.460> also<00:03:18.790> let

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
wheels but the sport mode will also let

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.910 
wheels but the sport mode will also let
you<00:03:19.180> know<00:03:20.280> it<00:03:21.300> in<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:22.570> snow<00:03:22.870> mode<00:03:23.170> there's

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
you know it in the snow mode there's

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.320 
you know it in the snow mode there's
more<00:03:24.160> power<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:24.610> back<00:03:24.760> wheels<00:03:25.000> as<00:03:25.120> well

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
more power to the back wheels as well

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:33.480 
more power to the back wheels as well
but<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.440> e<00:03:26.470> speed<00:03:27.070> brakes<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.180> car<00:03:32.490> automatic

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
but the e speed brakes the car automatic

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.220 
but the e speed brakes the car automatic
mode<00:03:36.390> controlling<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.510> torque<00:03:37.810> from<00:03:38.140> the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
mode controlling the torque from the

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.910 
mode controlling the torque from the
front<00:03:38.590> wheel<00:03:38.800> to<00:03:38.980> protect<00:03:39.340> weeds<00:03:39.610> on<00:03:39.880> its<00:03:40.030> own

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
front wheel to protect weeds on its own

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.220 
front wheel to protect weeds on its own
usually<00:03:41.920> got<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.760> front<00:03:43.060> wheel<00:03:43.300> traction<00:03:43.630> and

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
usually got the front wheel traction and

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.270 
usually got the front wheel traction and
then<00:03:44.980> got<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.790> maximum<00:03:46.270> to<00:03:46.570> 50%<00:03:47.560> in<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:47.890> front

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
then got a maximum to 50% in the front

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.480 
then got a maximum to 50% in the front
and<00:03:48.430> 50%<00:03:49.090> in<00:03:49.240> the<00:03:49.330> real
