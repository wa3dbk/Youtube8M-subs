00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.580
 brown screen printer is a company 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.939
 clearly regiomontana started in March 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.890
 of 2006 with what was silkscreen 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.460
 exclusively starting with an octopus 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.140
 simple manual and bone were as 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.710
 arriving clients you have to 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.649
 work or work we do not dedicate ourselves to 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.320
 what is this the design and development of 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.329
 textile garments focused on clothes for 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.620
 modes we do what the stamping is 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.380
 I was going to carry stone finishes 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.070
 sequins 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.600
 I am the embroidery application already passes 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.000
 different areas everything 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.820
 textile derivatives I have applied what 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.960
 is in brown screen mode you see in the 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.050
 need to enter the area of 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.060
 sublimation because in the market it starts 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.300
 to exist the sublimated garments there 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.010
 greater customer demand and we have to 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.590
 supply and then there comes a time in 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.800
 the one that enter or you stay out of the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.920
 market when brawn of the need for 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.869
 manufacture garments with sublimation 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.180
 we started to see the types of equipment that 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.190
 come market and the inputs that each 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.500
 one required and in your case how 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.020
 feasible was to bring them here to the company 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.729
 because then you have if you bring a 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.280
 team you have to bring people and 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.680
 you have to see how you are going to supply 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.420
 for at a certain time that the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.830
 costs in which we were to incur the 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.900
 manufactured moment a garment we 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.869
 transmit be competitive us 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.600
 we use the plotter air are surcolor efe 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.060
 770 the company that uses this equipment 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.860
 for being more functional and providing more 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.600
 quality and speed when working 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.119
 one piece takes around like 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.740
 three minutes other techniques already in 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.930
 silkscreen it would take about 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.530
 about 10-15 minutes per window choice 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.900
 refillable cartridge is that it reduces your 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.790
 ink as you will see are not some equipment that 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.640
 give from 9 to 11 inks to de rossi nothing 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.590
 more to 4 that's very practical since it does not 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.989
 we have to compact the cartridges that are 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.360
 they raise us both the cost and it is 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.410
 better so 4 we started to get there 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.750
 more clients that we are working 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.209
 as crazy to get the productions 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.400
 we like it because we like us the 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.800
 final product and the customer is left 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.900
 happy because he likes the garment like 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.380
 he stayed and he likes the finished one he likes 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.390
 the colors then it's something nice 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.410
 see your finished product and make it 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.410
 competitive company
