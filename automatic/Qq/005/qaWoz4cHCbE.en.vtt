00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.500
 who also welcome you back and 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.500
 we will comment on the lego movie 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.560
 good and we get the longest ad 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.810
 of the world the lego movie in which 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.400
 the directors and writers filardi 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.980
 christopher miller responsible for 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.910
 rain of hamburgers try to do what 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.190
 impossible to create a movie based on 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.230
 plastic blocks and so brings us the 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.180
 history of emmett a simple figurine 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.100
 of lego who suddenly finds out that 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.110
 is the chosen one and must join a group 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.320
 of rebels to prevent the evil 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.769
 Mr. business use the rubber to fix the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.769
 world 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.700
 and what functions is this curious 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.280
 history will be at the height of fame 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.120
 of the lego blocks that inspired him 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.560
 well this is my opinion in just 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.960
 10 points 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.659
 no good 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.090
 point number 1 the animation is excellent 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.580
 and of course these 21st century heights 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.140
 being of greater surprise the merit of 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.729
 team is that they decided to give the 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.860
 movie the appearance of stop motion 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.619
 as if it had actually been filmed 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.300
 with pieces of lego which give it a 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.940
 very original flavor to the 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.610
 movie 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.100
 point number 2 has some characters 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.290
 It seems incredible when it comes to figures 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.240
 of the ego but everyone has his personality 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.980
 your motivations and at the end of the 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.260
 story we end up wanting the a 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.990
 everyone 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.450
 point number 3 gives us a nice message 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.610
 and very much in accordance with the philosophy of 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.460
 ego is to be creative to let run 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.110
 our ideas and just play 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.140
 Sincerely, every child, regardless of 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.050
 age needs that 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.690
 point number 4 has a great sense of 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.520
 humor one does not stop laughing is one of 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.140
 those movies in which one can not 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.649
 laugh a joke because you are already 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.049
 losing two others on screen 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.150
 point number 5 the central theme of the 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:17.209
 movie everything is amazing everything 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.209
 they are composed by sound paterson joshua 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.769
 bartomÃ©u and lisa harrington and les 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.490
 I guarantee they will stay in the 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:29.110
 head for weeks 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.200
 all amazing 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.810
 yes 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.629
 Point number 6 is a real movie 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:42.200
 FAMILIAR children will enjoy 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:46.550
 heaps adults maybe more 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.560
 point 7 appears batman and is the best 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.470
 batman in the history of cinema 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.660
 point number 8 the dubbing that as I have already 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.720
 said at some point is not part of the 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.580
 film itself but at the same time it is part 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.160
 of the movie and this time actually 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.319
 it is very well you can see that the actors of 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.060
 voice are really enjoying so much 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.060
 as we of the characters 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.010
 point number 9 the final segment that 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.950
 should be the climax very intense to a 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.780
 very intense movie however a 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.390
 revelation and the introduction of more 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.940
 characters kills all the rhythm I had 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.400
 and also introduces and resolves a new 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.830
 conflict that feels totally foreign 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.450
 everything we were seeing is something 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.010
 that I really think it could be 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.530
 work and resolve in a very 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.530
 different and with much better results 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.430
 you decide if it's good or bad 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.709
 and point melodies is a very good ad 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.209
 realized tells a beautiful story 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.040
 and it has a nice message it's very 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.010
 fun and everything but after all 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.540
 it's an ego announcement and although for me 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.700
 it was easy to forget about this and 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.500
 just enjoy the movie can 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.019
 also be that you can not avoid 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.819
 feel that that is not right and in 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.880
 reality is something very personal and only 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.130
 you can decide 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.170
 in summary although you can not argue 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.570
 that this tape is nothing more than a product 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.700
 of marketing the truth I enjoyed it 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.590
 heaps and I'm sure you guys 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.020
 They will enjoy the same piles is 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.300
 quick is fun and it shows that the 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.820
 they did really love the laymen 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.280
 as much as we can also 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.440
 ensure that we have a safe here 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.670
 contender to Oscar for best movie 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.670
 animated for 2014 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.590
 and that was it with the lego movie 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.419
