00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.420
 plus 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.190
 good hello blocked third part of 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.349
 the news reviews of minecraft 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.630
 1.5 you will remember that we had commented 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.449
 that there was a new piece the hopper that 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.449
 allowed to form pipes apart from its 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.700
 main use that was to put things inside 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.379
 of the inventory of other blocks and that 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.349
 there was a new block that was the 

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:31.789
 signal buyer one of whose uses was 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.579
 take out the amount of objects that were 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.500
 within an inventory of an object with 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.079
 the hoppers we can make pipes in 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.550
 horizontally and vertically down 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.670
 Well, one of the new features 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.100
 What comes is that both the dispensers 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.840
 as in the new droppers they can be 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.079
 mounted looking up or towards 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.079
 down 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.230
 combined with the ability er drop 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.120
 of putting objects in the inventory of 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.940
 another object when you receive a pulse of 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.580
 sign if you drop you're piled 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.080
 up and one on top of the other all 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.520
 looking up when they receive a 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:12.730
 pulse in signal will happen in the first 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.590
 object that they take from their inventory to 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.509
 drop air that have just above 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.719
 you just have to form a column of 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.359
 reston torches like the one you have to 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:26.060
 and give you a signal with a very simple clock 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:27.560
 with the one you have there and each time 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.600
 receive pulse will go moving an object 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.020
 upwards 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.990
 At the end of that pipe there may be a 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.320
 hoppers pipe like the one we have 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.310
 down a chest 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.909
 a hopper to load a trolley 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.440
 very simple load it and there is a moment 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.120
 has said a clock do not give 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.550
 what is that there is down there 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.250
 Well, that's a new kind of clock 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.500
 what can be done now with the palms 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.940
 the hoppers hoppers 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.070
 remember that you could combine with it 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.310
 with the signal comparator to see 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.540
 when there was an object inside good 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.770
 just connect a few hoppers 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.770
 forming a closed circuit 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.890
 and leave a single object in one of the 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.680
 hoppers so that it goes through all 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.599
 the hoppers 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.069
 from that moment of that group of 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.120
 hoppers happen to behave like a 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.069
 sequencer if we put a comparator of 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.329
 signal in each of the curves every time 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.180
 that the object happens because some of the 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:40.389
 hoppers will generate a pulse that you do 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.269
 a group of two hoppers it will have 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:44.799
 a frequency of two because it's going to move 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.450
 the object of one hopper to the other each 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.520
 every tic 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.349
 what are you doing a group of four is going to have 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.599
 a frequency of four or each 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.550
 four tics is going to give a pulse what do you do 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.660
 a group of ten makes a frequency of 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.800
 about two seconds 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:04.340
 in order so that we can serve this 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.800
 super simple super cheap watches and 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.660
 other pieces of rest electronics 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.420
 although until now they were very complicated 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.980
 of doing you will have seen something similar to 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.750
 these two circuits in many of my 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.030
 creations are the trimmers of 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.940
 pulses basically convert a 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.270
 lever on a button 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.280
 depending on which of the two has more delay 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.800
 the repeater of the block or the repeater 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.710
 piston you can make the pulse 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.700
 cause when you lower the lever or 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.800
 when the swayze 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.730
 well, these circuits are pretty 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.349
 Easy to do with drop persie hoppers 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.190
 with the advantage added that by not having 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.200
 a piston 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.170
 there is not a moving part therefore they are 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.070
 less harmful to the server causes 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.120
 less lag 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:53.549
 basically there is a drop er 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.680
 and a hopper that will return the object 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:59.159
 to drop er 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.650
 if we want to make a detector that jumps 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:05.459
 when we lift the lever 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.890
 let's use the design on the right the 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.200
 red block is there for the rocker 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.420
 receive energy indirectly because 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.830
 if it's not going to happen like the circuit 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.950
 the left 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.590
 Even though 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.960
 the torches of the drones are not 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.540
 they turn us off as you can see the 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.970
 of the drop persie goes off it goes off because 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.830
 is energized at high energy level 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.410
 and that means that it will give energy 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.470
 indirectly to the hoppers that are 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.230
 playing with him with which the hopper is 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.050
 receiving energy will not pick up 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.880
 objects if a hopper tries to get into 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.080
 possible falls over but the drop air already 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.210
 has put the object inside his 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.580
 inventory with which until you do not 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.790
 lower the lever is going to stay the object 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.290
 stuck in that hopper then what 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.670
 we are going to do is state is going to be the 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.060
 first of a loop that will return the 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.340
 object to the drop air and in the second hopper 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.200
 which is neither the first nor the third 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.270
 which are those that are blocked by the 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.120
 energy of the broker we are going to place a 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.680
 signal comparer then in the 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.150
 moment they raised the lever the 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.040
 object gets stuck in the first 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.020
 hopper the moment we lower the 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.450
 lever goes through all the hoppers of 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.720
 back the router goes through the one that has 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.510
 the sensor and we cause the pulse 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.260
 there we would have a fall detector 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.420
 signal 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.930
 simple like the detector of 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:30.090
 signal rise is simply 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.250
 we raise the lever the drop air receives 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.290
 energy indirectly stuffs the object to 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:38.220
 the hopper the hopper causes pulse through 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:42.660
 of the signal comparator and returns from 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:44.510
 new to the drop is pushed by the hopper 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:48.490
 there I am playing a little with 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:51.639
 signal comparators as you can see 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:54.819
 they go igniting in sequence aft 2ยบ 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.680
 3rd 2nd 2nd and you can not see it but the 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:57.950
 first it also turns on what happens 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.690
 is 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.280
 until not lowering the lever is going to 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.960
 get stuck in the first then not 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.960
 It has many utilities 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.660
 now let's make another circuit 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:14.220
 quite useful that is a rs flick flock 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.560
 basically it's a circuit that is going to 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.680
 stay on or off when 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.750
 press a button until we press the 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.250
 opposite button that will turn it off if 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.040
 I was on or on if I was 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.930
 off 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.300
 it's a state machine has two 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.950
 states state has been seeing when 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.840
 press a button we forced to 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.190
 changes state to when we press another 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.450
 button we force it to change state 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:40.400
 of how we do it 2 drop ers 2 hoppers 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:43.520
 in front of the exit of the drop ers 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.320
 pointing to the opposite opposite each 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.350
 Once a signal reaches one of the 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.470
 dropper is going to spit let's say the 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.640
 object to the hopper that has in front that 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.320
 will put the object to the next 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.390
 dropper and it's going to stay there 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.590
 where a signal comparator goes to 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.590
 extract signal from that drop 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.660
 I'm seeing you this saying and the truth 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.510
 the point of fall is quite random 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:11.110
 could be used to make a 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.110
 random number generator 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:18.930
 Well I leave you for now with the review of 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:21.030
 Minecraft 1.5 news you already know if 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.620
 you liked the video and you want it 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.350
 keep not to lose it subway to 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:29.280
 foxes if you liked it like if not os 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:30.750
 he liked dislike commented me that if you 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.360
 subscribe we will get notice that 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.950
 when they make more videos like this 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.380
 suggestions requests whatever it is already 

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:40.910
 you know how they work this see you in 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.910
 the next video see you later
