00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
has still not taken place the Bible is

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.950 
has still not taken place the Bible is
clear<00:04:46.590> that<00:04:46.850> that<00:04:47.850> event<00:04:48.060> will<00:04:48.720> take<00:04:48.750> place

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
before the second coming of Christ I

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.080 
before the second coming of Christ I
believe<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:52.530> Bible<00:04:52.920> supports<00:04:53.460> that<00:04:53.610> it<00:04:53.910> will

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
believe the Bible supports that it will

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.120 
believe the Bible supports that it will
take<00:04:54.390> place<00:04:54.720> before<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.560> tribulation<00:04:55.800> period

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
take place before the tribulation period

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.340 
take place before the tribulation period
begins<00:04:56.850> which<00:04:57.450> is<00:04:57.660> known<00:04:57.990> as<00:04:58.320> a

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
begins which is known as a

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.820 
begins which is known as a
pre-tribulation<00:04:59.220> rapture<00:05:00.620> whatever<00:05:01.620> your

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
pre-tribulation rapture whatever your

pre-tribulation rapture whatever your

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
belief is regarding the rapture it's

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.080 
belief is regarding the rapture it's
still<00:05:03.780> coming<00:05:04.290> and<00:05:04.550> since<00:05:05.550> most<00:05:05.760> Bible

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
still coming and since most Bible

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.910 
still coming and since most Bible

myself<00:05:08.630> believe<00:05:09.630> this<00:05:09.990> indeed<00:05:10.770> could<00:05:11.190> be<00:05:11.400> the

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
myself believe this indeed could be the

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.450 
myself believe this indeed could be the
last<00:05:11.610> generation<00:05:12.480> it<00:05:12.660> is<00:05:13.110> only<00:05:13.500> logical<00:05:13.860> to

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
last generation it is only logical to

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.790 
last generation it is only logical to
expect<00:05:14.640> the<00:05:15.030> raptures<00:05:15.510> take<00:05:15.720> place<00:05:16.050> at<00:05:16.320> any

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
expect the raptures take place at any

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.510 
expect the raptures take place at any
moment<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:18.810> only<00:05:19.080> question<00:05:19.290> left<00:05:19.830> to<00:05:20.220> answer

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
moment the only question left to answer

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.960 
moment the only question left to answer
is<00:05:20.880> how<00:05:20.910> long<00:05:21.300> is<00:05:21.600> a<00:05:21.660> biblical<00:05:21.990> generation

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
is how long is a biblical generation

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.420 
is how long is a biblical generation
