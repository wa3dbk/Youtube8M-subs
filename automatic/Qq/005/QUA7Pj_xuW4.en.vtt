00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:15.269
 the bike guys today more tips 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.980
 and we're going to talk about 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.990
 acceleration control 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.000
 Many people think that the accelerator is 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.800
 to make the bike honda forward but 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.080
 it's nothing like that it's for 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.150
 balance the bike control grip and 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.900
 many other things neither with me I go 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.900
 show you 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.980
 for all the tips is always very 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.510
 It is important for us to understand 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.269
 our mistake and when we talk about 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.399
 acceleration control the main error 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.769
 It's when you 're inclined to be 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.230
 very rough with throttle and wheel 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.809
 skid and you end up falling for it 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.329
 there are techniques for how you dosage as 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.809
 you get the most out of the bike without running 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.809
 scratchs 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.760
 The first tip is that the use of 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.990
 accelerator has to be progressive what 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.600
 means this 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.250
 we never pull it at once 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.950
 unless you are in a straight line 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.229
 and have full control that the march 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.060
 that you are engaged will not do with 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.060
 that the bike in pine is about to turn to 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.630
 behind giving 100% mode in a straight line . 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.460
 foot 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.460
 If you accelerate, you'll walk to 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.590
 there is no risk the great 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.440
 accelerator problem is when you have 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.350
 a little incline or a lot and you are 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.259
 gross you go from zero to one hundred percent 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.149
 with much speed to the point of the wheel 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.149
 skid and you lost control 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.640
 people think that when they are 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.070
 they should not accelerate and it is 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.720
 just the opposite when you are 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.759
 Inclined you have much more 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.770
 dirigibility love gets much more 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.880
 stable if you have accelerating 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.399
 But we 're not talking about 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.380
 Maximum power we 're talking about him 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.020
 as you enter the curve and so 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.330
 that you tilt within your area 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.030
 the tolerance comfort you have 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.100
 we accelerate again and open the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.860
 accelerator gradually 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.760
 softness is how you drive curves and 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.760
 makes accelerating 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.100
 because the acceleration technique is so 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.200
 important I would say that one of the two 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.990
 most important aspects of the piloting 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.150
 because through the accelerator that people 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.700
 knows how much we can tip and the 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.710
 How much you have to stick to a great 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.750
 The result of this is that when you 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.530
 accelerate you're pressing the tire 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.470
 against the asphalt and you can at 11 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.360
 orientation and creating sensitivity 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.000
 we feel you have adhesion or if you 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.710
 is on the verge of losing and doing 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.940
 that it is progressive rather than a 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.940
 fright you fly out 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.629
 many believe that people slide 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.269
 when we are accelerating leaning 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:10.900
 because the area of contact between the tire 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.859
 Asphalt decreases noticeably however 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.079
 the opposite 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.030
 When we stand, it 's a small 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.310
 area of â€‹â€‹the tire that came in contact with 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.900
 asphalt when we go pouring this 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.299
 contact area increases 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.280
 still because it slides because the 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.810
 motorcycle was made to copy the 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.599
 imperfections when she is standing 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.879
 when you go tilting the scale and 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.430
 the flares have difficulty copying the 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.650
 imperfections and especially the 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.349
 correlation with the accelerator is to receive 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.379
 energy was given the impetus of 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.989
 and that's why we end up pushing the 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.970
 tire out instead of down is 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.970
 a matter of gravity vector 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.970
 That is why the conclusion of this question 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.890
 acceleration versus curve and we 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.410
 understand that as soon as people 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.360
 People open the throttle gently. 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.590
 you will grow acceleration with 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.140
 softness 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.690
 while you 're putting the bike on its feet 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.459
 acceleration increases and you only reach 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.510
 100% throttle 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.510
 if you are 100% 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.789
 I'm sure you liked the tip.
