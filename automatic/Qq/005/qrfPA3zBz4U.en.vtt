a<00:00:57.059> fish<00:00:57.980> as<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.370> see<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> fish

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
a fish as you can see this is a fish

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.979 
a fish as you can see this is a fish
this<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.680> made<00:01:02.219> very<00:01:02.609> simply<00:01:03.090> by<00:01:03.690> first

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
this is made very simply by first

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.020 
this is made very simply by first
starting<00:01:04.140> off<00:01:04.559> with<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> plate<00:01:05.280> then<00:01:06.000> you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
starting off with a plate then you

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.899 
starting off with a plate then you
folded<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.950> made<00:01:08.189> these<00:01:08.549> things

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
folded it and then you made these things

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.210 
folded it and then you made these things
you<00:01:09.119> cut<00:01:09.420> bits<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:09.960> cut<00:01:10.409> picks<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:10.920> here

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
you cut bits out cut picks out here

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.660 
you cut bits out cut picks out here
they'd<00:01:11.939> used<00:01:12.320> something<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.590> scratch<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
they'd used something to scratch in the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.710 
they'd used something to scratch in the
design<00:01:15.530> here<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.860> made<00:01:17.430> little<00:01:17.610> eyes<00:01:17.939> then

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
design here and made little eyes then

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.920 
design here and made little eyes then
you<00:01:18.930> put<00:01:19.920> glaze<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.820> glazed<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.689> put

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
you put glaze you glazed it you put

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.670 
you put glaze you glazed it you put
additional<00:01:22.470> glazes<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.970> glaze<00:01:24.330> blues<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
additional glazes on glaze blues and

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.249 
additional glazes on glaze blues and
then<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.340> put<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> process<00:01:27.450> we<00:01:28.049> can

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
then you put it in the process we can

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.760 
then you put it in the process we can
have<00:01:28.500> some<00:01:28.829> abstract<00:01:29.460> designs<00:01:29.850> also<00:01:30.409> like<00:01:31.409> I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
have some abstract designs also like I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.620 
have some abstract designs also like I
will<00:01:31.920> show<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.460> piece<00:01:32.759> which<00:01:33.600> has

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
will show you this piece which has

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.929 
will show you this piece which has
started<00:01:34.590> who<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:36.530> kind<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.860> bottle<00:01:38.460> which

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
started who is a kind of bottle which

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.920 
started who is a kind of bottle which
was<00:01:38.970> made<00:01:39.540> from<00:01:40.400> ceramics<00:01:41.400> clay<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.810> is

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
was made from ceramics clay and this is

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.240 
was made from ceramics clay and this is
a<00:01:43.020> cost<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.979> has<00:01:44.159> been<00:01:44.399> cast<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.530> then<00:01:46.530> you

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
a cost it has been cast and then you

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.840 
a cost it has been cast and then you
have<00:01:47.729> different<00:01:48.860> kinds<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.920> colors<00:01:50.369> applied

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
have different kinds of colors applied

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.880 
have different kinds of colors applied
to<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.210> different<00:01:51.630> kinds<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.020> ceramic<00:01:52.530> colors

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
to it different kinds of ceramic colors

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.020 
to it different kinds of ceramic colors
first<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.939> basic<00:01:54.329> color<00:01:54.570> then<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.140> different

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
first the basic color then the different

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.580 
first the basic color then the different
bits<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.299> color<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.869> give<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.170> an<00:01:58.290> additional

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
bits of color to give it an additional

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.469 
bits of color to give it an additional
attraction<00:01:59.180> and<00:02:00.180> then<00:02:00.420> by<00:02:01.079> using<00:02:02.090> this<00:02:03.090> this

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
attraction and then by using this this

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.080 
attraction and then by using this this
would<00:02:03.719> normally<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.530> been<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.829> simple<00:02:05.250> this

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
would normally have been a simple this

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.290 
would normally have been a simple this
round<00:02:06.719> bit<00:02:07.320> would<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.340> been<00:02:08.520> without<00:02:08.879> these

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
round bit would have been without these

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.080 
round bit would have been without these
extent

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
extent

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.110 
extent
would<00:02:10.840> have<00:02:10.989> been<00:02:11.230> just<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.709> cap<00:02:11.980> for<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.580> bottle

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
would have been just a cap for a bottle

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.250 
would have been just a cap for a bottle
or<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.300> jar<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:14.620> would<00:02:14.830> be<00:02:15.040> but<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:16.510> artist<00:02:17.020> has

another totally different kind of
headpiece<00:02:22.810> by<00:02:23.800> adding<00:02:24.489> these<00:02:24.790> bits<00:02:25.690> here<00:02:26.010> and

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
headpiece by adding these bits here and

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.559 
headpiece by adding these bits here and
this<00:02:27.459> raised<00:02:28.060> raised<00:02:28.800> design<00:02:29.800> Syria<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.910> then

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
this raised raised design Syria and then
