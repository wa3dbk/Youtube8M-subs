 hd 500d pds as the newest collection 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.940
 the company hegel design 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:24.410
 ebd s stands for direct belt drive system 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.529
 and says nothing other than that one 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:32.239
 Timing belt in which he uses these substances 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:35.739
 used among other things, that ensures 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.739
 for a very quiet operating noise 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.260
 the hd 510 will be delivered 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.839
 Exclusively as a kit clear thing 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:52.100
 that the shapely cabins hood 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:54.199
 already painted as standard is the 2 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.979
 blood meat head rotor is head 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:01.879
 completely made in metal 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:05.089
 Blood halves are one piece the red one 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:09.380
 head central piece is protected and becomes 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.540
 on the rotors clamped the 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.200
 ball bearing staggered discs with 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.750
 Customers are also made of metal 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.930
 and by means of y connectors with the dizziness 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.549
 Slices inside ring connected 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.880
 All fine mechanical parts are 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:29.539
 not only high-precision manufactured but 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.729
 also optically a pasture just german 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.840
 engineering because someone had a lot 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:39.320
 fun in mechanical engineering to the scope of delivery 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:43.630
 The kids are also home and 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.630
 tail rotor blades made of carbon fiber 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:54.399
 the central component of the chassis is the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.840
 aluminum cage so to speak the cell 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.500
 where did the helicopter come from? 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.320
 got leg name 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.870
 for the transmission of high torques 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.560
 has the in the first gear stage 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:13.870
 working timing belt a height of 18 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.300
 mm are the two timing belt wheels 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.000
 also made of aluminum 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:24.010
 crazy very light and extremely stable 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.790
 little control sits in one 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.280
 expulsion of alu kicks and ensures 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.030
 a lock of staggering slices 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.840
 outer ring here the controlling boss 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.560
 controller 111 to our combo 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:45.160
 He is combined with a jail 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.550
 whether 2 for the data transmission of the 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.520
 graupner hot receiver gr 16 is with 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:55.770
 A humming signal cable with the meat 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.420
 system icon connected 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.209
 The icon flight system is distributed 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.820
 also about the company hd league ob 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.549
 the corresponding combos 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:12.970
 including this system available 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:17.170
 represents ideal for the motorization of the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:21.970
 hg 500 is the control eac office 600 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:29.170
 stroke 09 1 14 pohl motor with the 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:30.610
 specific speed 930 kv used 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.989
 can be 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:40.329
 6 s lipo battery with a capacity up to 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:44.200
 a maximum of 5,000 milliliters both 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:47.470
 the stock plate of the controller as 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.579
 also the motor carrier are made of aluminum 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:54.060
 made and have readings as the 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:57.060
 act as a cooling rib 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.739
 the whole construction is like that 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.110
 created that different 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.739
 drives with different under 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.170
 can be used 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:12.790
 in the whole metal sheet holders of the 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:16.780
 rotors sit with plastic inserts 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.229
 which leaves cfk worked perfectly 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.229
 become 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.780
 the entire rear rotor via timing belt 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.580
 it is powered by aluminum 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:33.370
 built up and have extremely play 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.150
 That makes for a very good book 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.150
 performance 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.720
 the hd 500 offers a very wide greta 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:53.850
 Spectrum is always very good 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.830
 pleasant because clear is very energy efficient 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.430
 the fly with low speed 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.710
 Here we are at about 1750 rpm 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.750
 on the head 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:09.010
 in our test model associations rest 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:14.580
 his sls lipo battery 6 s with one 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.580
 capacity of 4,400 milliamp hours 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.639
 are about seven minutes flight time 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.020
 with the high speed of 2500 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.020
 turns still possible 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.140
 Overall, the hd 500 can be said 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:41.100
 cells dbs is a completely successful 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:43.560
 The construction system is equally convincing 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.200
 how the processing as well as the 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.980
 kit compilation including the 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.990
 manual 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.830
 Everything fits perfectly here 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.830
 together
