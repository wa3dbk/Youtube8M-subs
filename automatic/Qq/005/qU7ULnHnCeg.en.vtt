Coleman's exponent fact x2 10 it's a

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.920 
Coleman's exponent fact x2 10 it's a

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
all types of conditions camping

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.040 
all types of conditions camping
it's<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:22.759> pitch<00:00:23.759> from<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.000> inside<00:00:24.390> tent<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:24.930> we

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
it's a pitch from the inside tent so we

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.960 
it's a pitch from the inside tent so we
have<00:00:25.140> an<00:00:25.259> internal<00:00:25.710> structure<00:00:26.040> with<00:00:26.730> all<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
have an internal structure with all the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.700 
have an internal structure with all the
poles<00:00:27.150> internally<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.079> then<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.349> external

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
poles internally and then this external

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.769

fly<00:00:29.040> sheet<00:00:29.340> pull<00:00:29.550> over<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.790> top<00:00:30.029> which<00:00:30.540> gives

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
fly sheet pull over the top which gives

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.319 
fly sheet pull over the top which gives
great<00:00:31.079> wind<00:00:31.590> repellency<00:00:32.160> windlass<00:00:33.030> she<00:00:33.149> just

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
great wind repellency windlass she just

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.240 
great wind repellency windlass she just
flows<00:00:33.540> over<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.870> top<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.260> here<00:00:34.470> making<00:00:35.160> it

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
flows over the top of here making it

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.479 
flows over the top of here making it
nice<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.430> comfortable<00:00:35.730> inside<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.340> says

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
nice and comfortable inside so it says

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.799

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
well so you can enter from from either

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.060 
well so you can enter from from either
side<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:35.010> tent<00:01:36.530> inside<00:01:37.530> here<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> actual

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
side of the tent inside here the actual

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.700 
side of the tent inside here the actual
sleeping<00:01:38.520> area<00:01:38.910> this<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.870> as<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.290> said<00:01:40.470> pitch

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
sleeping area this is as we said pitch

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.200 
sleeping area this is as we said pitch
from<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.010> inside<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.880> separate<00:01:42.150> from

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
from the inside so it's separate from

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.450 
from the inside so it's separate from
the<00:01:42.450> external<00:01:42.750> fly<00:01:43.110> sheet<00:01:43.410> making<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.310> great

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
the external fly sheet making it great

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.380 
the external fly sheet making it great
for<00:01:44.520> ventilation

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
for ventilation

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.210 
for ventilation
I<00:01:45.600> can<00:01:45.750> circulate<00:01:45.990> nicely<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.980> also

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
I can circulate nicely this also

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.650 
I can circulate nicely this also
