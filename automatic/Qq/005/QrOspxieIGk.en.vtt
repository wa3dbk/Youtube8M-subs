00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 
I know that's a careful distinction an

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:39.540 
I know that's a careful distinction an
appetizer<00:06:37.770> infers<00:06:38.770> that<00:06:38.800> that's<00:06:39.190> something

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
appetizer infers that that's something

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.300
