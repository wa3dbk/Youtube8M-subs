00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.550 
the settings right now a bit quite fast
and<00:03:14.360> you<00:03:14.480> can<00:03:14.600> also<00:03:14.720> see<00:03:14.960> that<00:03:14.990> it<00:03:15.170> comes<00:03:15.350> with

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
and you can also see that it comes with

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.190 
and you can also see that it comes with
the<00:03:15.680> Play<00:03:15.890> Store<00:03:16.160> now<00:03:16.460> the<00:03:16.970> settings<00:03:17.600> you<00:03:17.990> see

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.780 
the Play Store now the settings you see
that<00:03:18.320> it<00:03:18.410> is<00:03:18.470> really<00:03:18.800> similar<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.640> the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
that it is really similar to the

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.390 
that it is really similar to the
original<00:03:20.210> as<00:03:20.900> five<00:03:21.200> it<00:03:21.410> has<00:03:21.590> everything<00:03:22.040> in

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
original as five it has everything in

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.030 
original as five it has everything in
the<00:03:22.520> same<00:03:22.730> categories<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:23.720> basically<00:03:24.380> all<00:03:24.830> of

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
the same categories and basically all of

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.460 
the same categories and basically all of
the<00:03:25.160> same<00:03:25.400> settings<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.930> now<00:03:27.050> let's<00:03:27.290> take<00:03:27.440> a

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
the same settings and now let's take a

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.500 
the same settings and now let's take a
quick<00:03:27.770> look<00:03:28.010> at<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.310> camera<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.210> really

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
quick look at a camera and it really

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.350 
quick look at a camera and it really
seems<00:03:29.750> like<00:03:29.870> he<00:03:29.990> 13-megapixel<00:03:31.180> unlike<00:03:32.180> the

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
seems like he 13-megapixel unlike the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.720 
seems like he 13-megapixel unlike the
other<00:03:32.600> clones<00:03:33.080> that<00:03:33.410> they<00:03:33.980> lie<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.400> they<00:03:34.490> kind

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
other clones that they lie and they kind

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.160 
other clones that they lie and they kind
of<00:03:34.790> look<00:03:35.000> like<00:03:35.030> eight<00:03:35.420> but<00:03:35.720> I'm<00:03:35.780> gonna<00:03:35.959> have<00:03:36.110> to

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
of look like eight but I'm gonna have to

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.810 
of look like eight but I'm gonna have to
test<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.920> be<00:03:37.070> sure<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.520> you<00:03:37.580> can<00:03:37.700> see

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
test that to be sure and you can see

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.699 
test that to be sure and you can see
that<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.060> also<00:03:38.240> takes<00:03:38.570> a<00:03:38.690> quick<00:03:38.870> picture<00:03:39.560> as

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
that it also takes a quick picture as

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.199 
that it also takes a quick picture as
soon<00:03:39.920> as<00:03:40.070> touch<00:03:40.370> it<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:40.880> shutter<00:03:41.120> is

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
soon as touch it and the shutter is

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.000 
soon as touch it and the shutter is
quite<00:03:41.450> fast<00:03:41.780> it<00:03:42.080> really<00:03:42.380> looks<00:03:42.620> like<00:03:42.709> they

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
quite fast it really looks like they

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.280 
quite fast it really looks like they
were<00:03:43.190> able<00:03:43.459> to<00:03:43.670> copy<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.360> basically<00:03:44.780> every

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
were able to copy it basically every

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.400
