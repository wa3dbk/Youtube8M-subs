00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
it's very similar to the same and pretty

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.240 
it's very similar to the same and pretty
much<00:01:04.320> doing<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> same<00:01:04.710> thing<00:01:04.920> I'm<00:01:05.010> holding

much<00:02:14.940> anyways<00:02:15.780> that's<00:02:16.590> pretty<00:02:16.830> much<00:02:16.920> wrapping

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370

I'm<00:02:57.750> not<00:02:57.900> really<00:02:58.019> sure<00:02:58.140> what<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.950> reasoning

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
I'm not really sure what the reasoning

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.460 
I'm not really sure what the reasoning
behind<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.760> one<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.090> but<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.049> know<00:03:01.079> if<00:03:01.349> they

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
behind that one is but you know if they

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.630 
behind that one is but you know if they
could<00:03:01.650> fix<00:03:01.829> that<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.250> would<00:03:02.340> be<00:03:02.370> much

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
could fix that that would be much

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.699 
could fix that that would be much
appreciated<00:03:03.079> I'm<00:03:04.079> not<00:03:04.230> really<00:03:04.349> trying<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.620> get

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709
