a whole bunch of my kit that's why I

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.100 
a whole bunch of my kit that's why I
skipped<00:08:03.070> out<00:08:03.220> on<00:08:03.250> it<00:08:03.550> but<00:08:03.699> I<00:08:04.240> will<00:08:04.570> go<00:08:04.780> back<00:08:04.810> and

double check because if they do I will

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.050 
double check because if they do I will
get<00:08:06.639> that<00:08:06.669> and<00:08:07.030> put<00:08:07.240> that<00:08:07.300> in<00:08:07.510> my<00:08:07.600> kit<00:08:07.840> as<00:08:08.020> well
