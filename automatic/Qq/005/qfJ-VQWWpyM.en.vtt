see where this is leaping then I found

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.039

like<00:01:19.229> what<00:01:19.740> he's<00:01:20.549> proposing<00:01:20.820> already<00:01:21.590> so

like what he's proposing already so

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.530 
like what he's proposing already so
that's<00:01:22.770> my<00:01:22.950> first<00:01:22.979> point<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.090> very<00:01:24.299> good

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that's my first point it's a very good

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.780 
that's my first point it's a very good
story<00:01:24.840> okay<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.560> may<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.770> been<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.250> little

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
story okay there may have been a little

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.219 
story okay there may have been a little
point<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> middle<00:01:27.570> where<00:01:27.720> was<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> little

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
point in the middle where was a little

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.249 
point in the middle where was a little
on<00:01:28.380> an<00:01:28.530> event<00:01:29.070> oh<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:29.659> then<00:01:30.659> suddenly<00:01:31.049> it

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
on an event oh but then suddenly it

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.289 
on an event oh but then suddenly it
picks<00:01:31.500> up<00:01:31.650> again<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:32.280> very<00:01:32.729> gripping

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
picks up again and it's very gripping

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.210 
picks up again and it's very gripping
almost<00:01:33.689> all<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> way<00:01:34.110> through<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.590> mean<00:01:35.070> this

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
almost all the way through I mean this

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.429 
almost all the way through I mean this
is<00:01:35.280> one<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.909> few<00:01:36.240> books<00:01:36.600> where<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.229> had

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
is one of the few books where I had

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.249 
is one of the few books where I had
absolutely<00:01:37.710> no<00:01:38.189> clue<00:01:39.000> how<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.020> end

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
absolutely no clue how is going to end

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.740 
absolutely no clue how is going to end
so<00:01:40.680> while<00:01:40.950> still<00:01:41.250> being<00:01:41.280> realistic<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.509> also

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
so while still being realistic it's also

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.929 
so while still being realistic it's also
quite<00:01:43.079> unpredictable<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.399> same<00:01:44.610> kind<00:01:44.850> of

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
quite unpredictable in the same kind of

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.100 
quite unpredictable in the same kind of
way<00:01:45.140> my<00:01:46.140> second<00:01:46.680> point<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.840> why<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.899> my

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
way my second point is that why is my

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.940 
way my second point is that why is my
second<00:01:49.470> point<00:01:50.869> my<00:01:51.869> second<00:01:52.320> point<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.680> that

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
it's very immersive okay maybe there's

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.370

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810

beautifully<00:02:18.810> written<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.410> could<00:02:19.860> almost<00:02:20.010> have

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
beautifully written I could almost have

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.430 
beautifully written I could almost have
forgotten<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:20.940> plot<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:21.780> read<00:02:22.260> this

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
language in it okay maybe everyone wrote

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.660 
language in it okay maybe everyone wrote
like<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> eighteen<00:02:28.950> hundreds<00:02:29.370> but

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
like this in the eighteen hundreds but

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.339 
like this in the eighteen hundreds but
that<00:02:29.849> doesn't<00:02:30.090> make<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.420> less<00:02:30.599> of<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.050> pleasure

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
that doesn't make it less of a pleasure

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.190 
that doesn't make it less of a pleasure
to<00:02:31.620> read<00:02:31.769> okay<00:02:32.459> maybe<00:02:32.790> sometimes<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.599> sentences

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
to read okay maybe sometimes a sentences

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.770 
to read okay maybe sometimes a sentences
are<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.410> little<00:02:34.800> bit<00:02:35.099> long<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.610> her<00:02:36.390> words<00:02:36.599> a

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
are a little bit long and her words a

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.110 
are a little bit long and her words a
little<00:02:36.900> bit<00:02:37.140> old<00:02:37.349> but<00:02:37.650> if<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.459> take<00:02:38.700> your<00:02:38.730> time

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
little bit old but if you take your time

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.449 
little bit old but if you take your time
to<00:02:39.360> read<00:02:39.599> it<00:02:39.780> through<00:02:40.019> then<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:41.099> shouldn't<00:02:41.340> be

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
to read it through then it shouldn't be

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.670 
to read it through then it shouldn't be
any<00:02:41.489> problem<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.060> understand<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.780> final<00:02:43.349> thing

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
any problem to understand a final thing

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.039 
any problem to understand a final thing
is<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:44.069> Austin's<00:02:44.580> mastery<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.569> language

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
is that Austin's mastery of language

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.320 
is that Austin's mastery of language
also<00:02:46.260> means<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.700> book<00:02:47.880> like<00:02:48.299> this

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
also means that in a book like this

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.380 
also means that in a book like this
which<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:49.019> quite<00:02:49.349> like<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.190> drama<00:02:50.610> she<00:02:51.150> still

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
which is quite like a drama she still

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.479 
which is quite like a drama she still
manages<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.840> insert<00:02:52.290> quite<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.650> lot<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.040> comedy

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
manages to insert quite a lot of comedy

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.729 
manages to insert quite a lot of comedy
in<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.790> way<00:02:54.180> mr.<00:02:54.420> Bennett<00:02:54.840> behaves<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.650> a

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
romance is very well written and it's

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.630 
romance is very well written and it's
also<00:03:06.959> funny<00:03:07.319> now<00:03:08.310> if<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:09.269> don't<00:03:09.810> like

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640

also funny now if you don't like
romances<00:03:12.470> dismiss<00:03:13.470> everything<00:03:13.680> I've<00:03:14.250> said<00:03:14.489> so

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
romances dismiss everything I've said so

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.729 
romances dismiss everything I've said so
far<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:15.360> will<00:03:15.540> not<00:03:15.660> like<00:03:15.930> this<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.470> will<00:03:16.620> be

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
far you will not like this it will be

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.400 
far you will not like this it will be
wrong<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.190> say<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.780> Jane<00:03:18.780> Austen<00:03:19.230> was

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
wrong to say that Jane Austen was

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.379 
wrong to say that Jane Austen was
targeting<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.220> female<00:03:20.609> audience<00:03:21.030> because<00:03:21.359> I

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
targeting a female audience because I

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:22.699 
targeting a female audience because I
think<00:03:21.690> in<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.900> eighteen<00:03:22.170> hundreds<00:03:22.590> you

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
think in the eighteen hundreds you

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.160 
think in the eighteen hundreds you
didn't<00:03:22.950> really<00:03:23.130> have<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.670> concert<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.690> concept

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
didn't really have a concert the concept

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.099 
didn't really have a concert the concept
of<00:03:25.400> target<00:03:26.400> audience<00:03:26.880> but<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.750> think<00:03:27.989> it's

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
of target audience but I think it's

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.890 
of target audience but I think it's
still<00:03:28.290> fair<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.829> assume<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.209> girls<00:03:30.209> tend<00:03:30.690> to

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
still fair to assume that girls tend to

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.870 
still fair to assume that girls tend to
like<00:03:31.049> this<00:03:31.290> more<00:03:31.530> than<00:03:31.560> boys<00:03:32.010> do<00:03:32.340> but<00:03:32.730> that

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
like this more than boys do but that

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.340 
like this more than boys do but that
shouldn't<00:03:33.120> stop<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.389> from<00:03:33.510> reading<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.170> just

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
shouldn't stop you from reading it just

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.960 
shouldn't stop you from reading it just
because<00:03:34.560> you're<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.739> boy<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:35.160> mean<00:03:35.549> he'll<00:03:35.790> I

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
because you're a boy I mean he'll I

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.910 
because you're a boy I mean he'll I
liked<00:03:36.239> it<00:03:36.450> what<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:36.989> just<00:03:37.230> need<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.560> keep<00:03:37.709> in

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
liked it what you just need to keep in

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.129
