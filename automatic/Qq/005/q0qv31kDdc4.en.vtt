00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the best for this project now you can

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.639 
the best for this project now you can
use<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> yarn<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.940> only<00:00:51.059> has<00:00:51.329> 20%<00:00:51.690> wool<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.500> it

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
use a yarn that only has 20% wool in it

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.560

however<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.520> color<00:00:53.730> will<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:53.969> be<00:00:54.270> quite<00:00:54.539> as

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
however the color will not be quite as

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.380 
however the color will not be quite as
vibrant<00:00:55.110> before<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.250> begin<00:00:56.610> cut<00:00:57.149> two<00:00:57.360> pieces

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390

to rest for another 2 minutes be careful

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.900 
to rest for another 2 minutes be careful
because<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.909> yarn<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.329> water<00:02:06.869> might<00:02:07.200> be<00:02:07.380> hot

because the yarn and water might be hot
after<00:02:08.910> 2<00:02:09.090> minutes<00:02:09.390> place<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.690> yarn<00:02:09.959> back<00:02:10.289> into

in the kool-aid

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.180 
in the kool-aid
so<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.360> enhance<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:52.080> with<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.290> few<00:02:52.650> drops<00:02:52.709> of

I like to place my work in the container
now<00:03:08.519> but<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.360> could<00:03:09.569> do<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.720> later

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
now but you could do it later

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.670 
now but you could do it later

small amounts of kool-aid over a few
inches<00:03:16.019> of<00:03:16.350> yarn<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:17.630> might<00:03:18.630> need<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.959> press

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
inches of yarn you might need to press

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.020 
inches of yarn you might need to press
it<00:03:19.380> into<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.709> yarn<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.160> get<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.549> to<00:03:20.670> absorb

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
it into the yarn to get it to absorb

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.100 
it into the yarn to get it to absorb
nicely<00:03:22.610> I'm<00:03:23.610> moving<00:03:24.060> on<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.480> next<00:03:24.870> color

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
nicely I'm moving on to the next color

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.880 
nicely I'm moving on to the next color
now<00:03:26.390> it's<00:03:27.390> quite<00:03:27.660> fine<00:03:27.900> if<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.230> colors<00:03:28.560> touch

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
now it's quite fine if the colors touch

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.039 
now it's quite fine if the colors touch
as<00:03:29.190> they<00:03:29.940> will<00:03:30.120> blend<00:03:30.360> into<00:03:30.510> each<00:03:30.630> other

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
as they will blend into each other

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.500 
as they will blend into each other
however<00:03:32.040> if<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.549> don't<00:03:32.790> want<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:33.209> muddy<00:03:33.450> brown

however if you don't want a muddy brown
color<00:03:34.140> to<00:03:34.260> form<00:03:34.590> in<00:03:34.709> between<00:03:35.010> your<00:03:35.160> colors<00:03:35.519> try

color to form in between your colors try

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.880 
color to form in between your colors try
to<00:03:36.360> move<00:03:36.600> along<00:03:36.870> according<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.530> order<00:03:37.860> of

to move along according to the order of
the<00:03:38.160> rainbow<00:03:38.579> such<00:03:39.180> as<00:03:39.360> red<00:03:39.570> orange<00:03:40.230> yellow

green blue and purple
once<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.930> are<00:03:42.959> done<00:03:43.079> wrap<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.100> plastic<00:03:44.220> wrap

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
once you are done wrap the plastic wrap

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.640 
once you are done wrap the plastic wrap
around<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.209> yarn<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.570> best<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:45.930> can<00:03:46.170> I<00:03:46.410> do

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
around the yarn the best you can I do

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.740 
around the yarn the best you can I do
like<00:03:47.010> my<00:03:47.190> colors<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.579> blend<00:03:47.910> into<00:03:48.239> each<00:03:48.390> other

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
like my colors to blend into each other

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.960 
like my colors to blend into each other
so<00:03:48.959> I'm<00:03:49.079> going<00:03:49.530> quickly<00:03:49.739> with<00:03:50.160> this<00:03:50.370> but<00:03:50.940> you

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
so I'm going quickly with this but you

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.000 
so I'm going quickly with this but you
can<00:03:51.329> be<00:03:51.450> more<00:03:51.660> careful<00:03:52.109> and<00:03:52.290> keep<00:03:52.769> them

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
can be more careful and keep them
