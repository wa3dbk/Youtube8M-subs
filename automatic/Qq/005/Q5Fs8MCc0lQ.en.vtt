00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
which was why the reason that we

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.810 
which was why the reason that we
actually<00:01:06.960> imposed<00:01:07.560> if<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.890> could<00:01:08.070> call<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.430> a

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
actually imposed if I could call it a
