 [Music] 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.740
 are their third Central American games 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.260
 and wants them to be the best 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.570
 the siren fernanda gonzález is the letter 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.460
 strong Mexican swimming having 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.919
 the possibility of contesting up to 7 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.900
 tests for it trusts that these 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:21.900
 be the most unforgettable of your career 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.600
 the looks in the aquatic center 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.000
 target figure it gonzález 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.310
 just smile and enjoy being at home 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.989
 she is sure that the public will encourage her 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.120
 in each of the tests in which 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.150
 compete in what will be high days 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.380
 physical load, however, it is said list 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.060
 to face it 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.280
 The truth is that I am prepared to 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.470
 that's not the first time that happens to me 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.480
 I say it's very different to bring that same 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.980
 burden of proofs in a national that in 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.140
 a competition like some games 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.510
 Central Americans since the level is 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.620
 different or does not have that margin 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:04.760
 error or that reserve margin here are 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.410
 the tests with everything and then that's that 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.780
 is going to be interesting and difficult not 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.729
 I say the base of the training I bring 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.920
 I'm training in the best teams 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.740
 for a year and a half of the best 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.330
 teams of the world with one of the best 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.080
 coaches of the world then I do not have 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.450
 why because suffering it not the athlete 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.200
 is inscribed in 50 and 100 free meters 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.259
 50 meters of butterfly 50 100 and 200 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.420
 meters torso and 200 meters combined 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.060
 It is also contemplated for 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.340
 Free and combined relays despite this 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.259
 warns that it will be day by day where 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.820
 they need the tests that finally 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.800
 the truth will take part 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.530
 that it is difficult to post 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.720
 medals I still need to see a part 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.760
 of strategy and choose well the tests 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.350
 and choose according to the days the 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.330
 tests that prove if I'm going to swim what 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.310
 tests not of those who signed up 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.410
 So we also have the problem of 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.300
 relay 4 for 200 that I die of desire 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.009
 to swim the real thing that is to that 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:06.050
 test is one of the safest golds 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:08.090
 for mexico and good or I aspire to go down 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.150
 my times of truth that I hope that 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.070
 this wind and the north leave for 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.770
 for the competition and do not come anymore 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.020
 because if the wind is a very very factor 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.730
 important also to be able to lower the 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.830
 times to be able to have some marks in 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.420
 swim against the wind because you 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.150
 change the technique of the arms is 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.870
 they whip in the water and others 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.630
 resistance 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.790
 the swimmer and flat try their 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.070
 times attribute him his stay of a 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.320
 year and a half florida where he trains with 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.239
 the American swim team does not 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.550
 However, the nest is competitive with the 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.780
 who carries claims that you can not take 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.430
 the competition lightly 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.930
 the whole team I think is very 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.209
 heavy venezuela colombia cuba cuba 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.040
 it also brings other good people then 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.100
 Well, I think we have to 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.110
 be aware of their countries and be 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.450
 pending of all of them to not trust us 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.870
 from nobody and not trusting us not to trust the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.170
 the rest 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.180
 we have very important factors in favor 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.489
 we have the public we have that we know 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.110
 the pool for many years and 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.170
 well all these factors we have 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.780
 what to use in favor of everything that gives 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.610
 the capital of 24 years and who disputes 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.950
 his third Central American games 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.230
 start Saturday activities with their 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.810
 first eliminations in the 50 meters 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.849
 torso that of happening would be disputing 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.950
 his first medals at night from 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.200
 the aquatic complex of reform laws 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.060
 a place to expect to receive the 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.920
 support from Veracruz for 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.170
 become one of the athletes 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.860
 that more preseas contribute to the delegation 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.750
 Aztec 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.520
 I see them super well we attract a 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.560
 ambientazo between women and men 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.940
 we have very very good atmosphere very good 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.370
 vibrates many jokes and teasing teasing 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.020
 healthy taunts and all that between us 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.900
 the truth is that he is very very father 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:01.570
 from veracruz alejandro rodríguez hijo 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.570
