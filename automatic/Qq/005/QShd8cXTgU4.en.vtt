00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.060
 the personal dance activity actually 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.939
 born from the experience of dancing with the 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.009
 stars clearly after several 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.739
 initions I really realized 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.119
 how the dance manages to change 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.500
 mentally and physically a person 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.160
 which comes from another kind of experience 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.590
 professional I joined people 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.690
 with whom I made a career with 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.090
 this in the environment clearly in the 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.110
 dance world they share with me 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.180
 the same passion marco 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.230
 above all they share in the same 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.640
 message and that is what we want to do 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.360
 go through the dance 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.370
 yes it is true that you can learn to dance 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.400
 to move a step in a given 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.380
 space at a certain time but the 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.229
 change happens when we succeed 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.560
 to connect our emotions to the gesture to the 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.970
 movement there that there is real change 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.970
 it is the real magic of this activity 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.479
 personal senses enter directly into 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.210
 attunement with the student is formed 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.800
 this symbiosis and a true e 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.750
 own team there is a couple like 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.300
 could be the couple from 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.380
 competition even though 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.979
 the student is at a very high level 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.660
 beginners say on a level 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.720
 this is established immediately 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.610
 mechanism for which there is a harmony e 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.930
 it feels practically the same 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.610
 student level or better 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.590
 probably to the student to feel at the 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.240
 same level as the teacher and therefore 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.659
 very different as an approach compared to 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.840
 a collective teaching course 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.840
 traditional 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.510
 I believe the activity of the personal right 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.580
 it is very useful for the student because he is 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.820
 a 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.830
 direct work on the possibilities on 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.280
 potential of the person you have 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.560
 in front therefore it is dedicated to the person 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.980
 to its own specific characteristics 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.950
 everyone can have a predisposition for 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.950
 something rather than another 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.410
 can have more pace you can have less 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.250
 coordination can be more flexible 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.990
 it can be more dynamic I believe that 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.390
 is appropriate to dedicate to the activity with the 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.670
 personal dancer two hours a week 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.610
 at least because one has the possibility of 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:08.090
 memorize everything that comes 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.430
 studied during a lesson and 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.170
 stop it in mind the personal body 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.910
 he was new and a new figure 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.160
 professional born to give 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.410
 opportunity for anyone 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.160
 to those who have never danced before 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.690
 experiences in the dance world to be able to 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.370
 dance with your teacher with the 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.290
 his own teacher and so he starts short 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.790
 this path that then becomes a real one 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.790
 and own fever for the dance 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.810
 the experience of beautiful sorrento 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.150
 because I met new people 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.820
 everyone is a fabulous environment 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.430
 together we also dance the idea of 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.830
 elections the collective morning is a lot 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.970
 nice then the new approach to tango 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.310
 that I had never done 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.500
 so all very nice my dance 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.850
 favorite is probably the sauce 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.009
 as they are temperamentally 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.110
 but then I learned to appreciate rumba 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.000
 which I initially detested because it had 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.740
 all these very feminine versions 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.569
 instead I consider myself 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.330
 masculine idea in dancing ways 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.039
 compressed an agent has passed 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.900
 the initial embarrassment because clearly 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:13.110
 for those who have never danced you are of 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.090
 in short, one person and then three 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.979
 uncertain ends in those are all good 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.979
 nice you create a beautiful friendship 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.449
 and I prepare myself but it is the only one 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.729
 while they sing palermo, I recommend it 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.740
 immediately after I ask you is not fake 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.500
 as good as it looks, it seems won but it is there 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.020
 a cake after michael just barely 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.000
 maria finished between one dance and another 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.460
 we go to the eating that can of cake 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.409
 and so we end up beautiful sweets i 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.659
 treacherous even now the ballads are not there 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:03.050
 I no longer need to be light thanks to 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:03.050
 all 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.319
 bad 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:26.589
 no 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:06.940
 these Easter let me do because the 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:08.949
 Reform does not know unfortunately mascara 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.349
 we must carry ourselves but we can stay there 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:14.379
 we will do marine without having no less than 

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:16.780
 he will be very sad for this not 

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:18.800
 I know he won't be able to make some liquid 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:22.659
 I say while two themes 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.659
 his relatives bye bye
