00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
with these to loathe her shoulder and

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.420 
with these to loathe her shoulder and
high<00:02:47.629> threshold<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.769> make<00:02:49.040> this<00:02:49.220> them

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
high threshold to make this them

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.140 
high threshold to make this them
completely<00:02:49.940> white<00:02:50.359> like<00:02:50.750> this<00:02:51.069> and<00:02:52.150> this

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
completely white like this and this

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.849 
completely white like this and this
doesn't<00:02:53.540> do<00:02:53.659> much<00:02:53.840> just<00:02:54.170> I<00:02:54.440> guess<00:02:54.709> the

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
doesn't do much just I guess the

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.099 
doesn't do much just I guess the
background<00:02:55.659> crap

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
background crap

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.520 
background crap
we'll<00:02:57.769> keep<00:02:57.859> it<00:02:58.010> around<00:02:58.220> here<00:02:58.639> and<00:02:59.409> I<00:03:00.409> don't

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
we'll keep it around here and I don't

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.190 
we'll keep it around here and I don't
fiddle<00:03:00.980> with<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.340> blur<00:03:01.519> amount<00:03:01.819> just<00:03:02.209> yet<00:03:02.840> so

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
fiddle with the blur amount just yet so

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.410 
fiddle with the blur amount just yet so
first<00:03:03.769> of<00:03:03.889> all<00:03:03.980> double<00:03:04.549> click<00:03:04.700> on<00:03:04.819> this<00:03:05.060> and

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
first of all double click on this and

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.839 
first of all double click on this and
it's<00:03:06.049> just<00:03:06.230> fiddle<00:03:06.859> around<00:03:06.980> with<00:03:07.159> these<00:03:07.370> again

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
it's just fiddle around with these again

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.020 
it's just fiddle around with these again
let's<00:03:08.629> make<00:03:08.720> sure<00:03:08.870> this<00:03:09.139> sim<00:03:09.530> is<00:03:09.859> in<00:03:10.220> all<00:03:10.670> white

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
let's make sure this sim is in all white

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.460 
let's make sure this sim is in all white
that's<00:03:11.810> your<00:03:12.230> main<00:03:12.769> goal<00:03:13.189> I<00:03:13.579> guess<00:03:14.450> so<00:03:15.170> then

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
that's your main goal I guess so then

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.229 
that's your main goal I guess so then
you've<00:03:15.620> um<00:03:15.739> ticket<00:03:16.159> when<00:03:16.340> you<00:03:16.819> think<00:03:17.090> you've

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
you've um ticket when you think you've

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.780 
you've um ticket when you think you've
drawn<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:17.599> right<00:03:17.629> I<00:03:18.049> guess<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:19.129> then<00:03:19.669> you're

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
drawn it right I guess and then you're

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.839 
drawn it right I guess and then you're
sure<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.209> have<00:03:20.389> this<00:03:20.629> jagged<00:03:21.379> around<00:03:22.010> jagged

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
sure to have this jagged around jagged

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.520 
sure to have this jagged around jagged
lions<00:03:23.269> I<00:03:23.419> guess<00:03:23.599> around<00:03:24.109> this<00:03:24.739> outline<00:03:25.280> so<00:03:25.940> to

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
lions I guess around this outline so to

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.649 
lions I guess around this outline so to
UM<00:03:27.530> take<00:03:28.160> those<00:03:28.370> away<00:03:28.519> I<00:03:28.669> guess<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.329> can<00:03:29.480> just

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
UM take those away I guess you can just

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.659 
UM take those away I guess you can just
fit<00:03:29.870> around<00:03:29.959> this<00:03:30.319> bar<00:03:30.769> but<00:03:31.310> if<00:03:31.430> you're

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
fit around this bar but if you're

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.589 
fit around this bar but if you're
completely<00:03:32.030> good<00:03:32.299> for<00:03:32.569> your<00:03:33.049> sim<00:03:33.769> as<00:03:33.889> a<00:03:33.919> bit

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
completely good for your sim as a bit

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:40.300 
completely good for your sim as a bit
what's<00:03:35.599> called<00:03:38.139> see-through<00:03:39.139> I<00:03:39.260> guess<00:03:39.590> so

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
what's called see-through I guess so

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.860 
what's called see-through I guess so
dump<00:03:40.699> it<00:03:40.819> out<00:03:40.940> at<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.060> top<00:03:41.299> just<00:03:41.540> put<00:03:41.750> it

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
dump it out at the top just put it

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.460 
dump it out at the top just put it
around<00:03:41.959> here<00:03:42.319> because<00:03:42.620> your<00:03:42.769> sin<00:03:43.180> becomes<00:03:44.470> so

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
around here because your sin becomes so

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.890 
around here because your sin becomes so
I<00:03:45.500> know<00:03:45.650> we<00:03:45.889> put<00:03:46.040> around<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:47.030> blur<00:03:47.269> amount

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
I know we put around the blur amount

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:55.020 
I know we put around the blur amount
right<00:03:48.229> here<00:03:49.750> here<00:03:51.909> and<00:03:52.909> yeah<00:03:53.720> so<00:03:54.199> that's<00:03:54.379> good

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
right here here and yeah so that's good

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.580 
right here here and yeah so that's good
so<00:03:56.030> now<00:03:56.239> you<00:03:56.299> import<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.139> background<00:03:59.049> so<00:04:00.049> for

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
so now you import the background so for

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.809 
so now you import the background so for
my<00:04:00.709> backgrounds<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:01.549> have<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:03.819> random

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
my backgrounds and have a random

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.629 
my backgrounds and have a random
sampling<00:04:05.239> piano<00:04:05.810> in<00:04:06.199> the<00:04:06.290> background<00:04:06.680> now

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
sampling piano in the background now

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.719 
sampling piano in the background now
what<00:04:07.819> you<00:04:07.940> do<00:04:08.180> is<00:04:08.709> you<00:04:09.709> put<00:04:09.979> this<00:04:10.220> at<00:04:10.669> the

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:10.729 
what you do is you put this at the

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:14.680 
what you do is you put this at the
bottom<00:04:11.169> one<00:04:12.169> has<00:04:12.379> some<00:04:12.560> volume<00:04:12.949> in<00:04:13.099> it<00:04:13.690> let's

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
bottom one has some volume in it let's

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.310 
bottom one has some volume in it let's
remove<00:04:15.109> it

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.010 

all<00:04:20.320> right<00:04:20.440> so<00:04:21.419> this<00:04:22.419> is<00:04:22.480> what<00:04:22.780> it<00:04:22.900> would<00:04:22.960> look

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
all right so this is what it would look

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.750 
all right so this is what it would look
like<00:04:25.230> well<00:04:26.230> this<00:04:26.320> seems<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.800> bit<00:04:26.830> spasticated

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
like well this seems a bit spasticated

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.120 
like well this seems a bit spasticated
at<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.120> background<00:04:28.570> all<00:04:29.290> right<00:04:29.440> I'll<00:04:29.710> choose

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
at the background all right I'll choose

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:38.730 
at the background all right I'll choose
a<00:04:30.400> video<00:04:31.950> so<00:04:32.950> let's<00:04:33.280> see<00:04:34.620> this<00:04:35.620> one<00:04:37.500> it's<00:04:38.500> a<00:04:38.590> bit

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
a video so let's see this one it's a bit

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.120 
a video so let's see this one it's a bit
random<00:04:38.919> I<00:04:39.310> don't<00:04:39.490> really<00:04:39.669> care<00:04:40.150> so<00:04:40.950> play<00:04:41.950> from

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
random I don't really care so play from

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.990 
random I don't really care so play from
the<00:04:42.250> game<00:04:42.400> beginning<00:04:45.270> yep<00:04:47.070> it's<00:04:48.070> actually<00:04:48.550> you

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
the game beginning yep it's actually you

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.409 
the game beginning yep it's actually you
know<00:04:49.060> just<00:04:49.090> a<00:04:49.419> picture<00:04:50.400> but<00:04:51.400> it<00:04:52.180> does

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
know just a picture but it does

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.770 
know just a picture but it does
something<00:04:52.720> with<00:04:52.990> movies<00:04:53.380> so<00:04:54.510> that's<00:04:55.510> how<00:04:55.720> you
