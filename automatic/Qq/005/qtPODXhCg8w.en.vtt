00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.230
 confirmation it runs from all sides 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.500
 and seems to have fun with the beautiful 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.500

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.260
 horse confidence 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.310

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.490
 the father who is manager manager of the 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.360
 has a lot of evidence for the 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.489

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.660
 quite something and I feel we 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.270
 is evolving 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.970

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.229
 movements of the official tests 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.030
 animals exchange together and in sequence 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.830
 for evaluation of jurors 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.619
 one of the most important characteristics 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.160
 and the elegance of prisoners in the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.590
 walk 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.590
 besides it is clear in the beauty and style 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.700
 but the paulista zaga is a race of cell 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.370

 work today to be used in sport in 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.960
 I have been using sports since I entered 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.650
 in it the sports that it is to do with that 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.680
 animal 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.660
 the animals are considered true 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.250
 athletes in a workout routine 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.290
 the mat that is made in days 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.430
 intercalates has the objective of 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.500
 strengthen the musculature of the collected 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.870
 to achieve a high level is made 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.710
 supplementation of horses with creatine 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.630
 or effect 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.480
 the product is mixed with the feed and 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.130
 used before and during the tests 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.480
 they work along with the treadmill 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.880
 very well with our product that the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.980
 creatine that creatine provides a powerful 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.720
 of very large muscle contraction and 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.250
 along with exercise it goes 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.740
 promote an increase in muscle mass 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.540
 on these horses good performance of the 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.120
 resources is also related to the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.280
 one step of quality makes 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.960
 It's all the difference when you walk here. 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.100
 the air you see the pasture 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.810
 first quality 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.510

 here you will have a a green pasture 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.590
 an abundance pasture a passage of 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.060
 quality is not good for us to start 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.040
 to talk about supplementation before 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.350
 start talking about the base of the horse 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.989
 so here in bjc they cherish a lot for 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.260
 Basic part of Horse Feed 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.910
 that the part of grazing with all these 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.590
 animal care can 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.160
 express the best of the characteristics 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.880
 inside the track 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.550
 this very important partnership because the 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.870
 people have animals with good genetics and 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.600
 nobody just gets nowhere 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.260
 so it is good and partners like fine gold
