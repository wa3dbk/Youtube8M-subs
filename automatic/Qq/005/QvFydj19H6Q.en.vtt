00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
fully installed as you see here it has a

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.580 
fully installed as you see here it has a
black<00:01:45.880> tip<00:01:46.180> not<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.540> carbon<00:01:46.870> fiber<00:01:47.110> tip<00:01:47.350> and

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
black tip not the carbon fiber tip and

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.610 
black tip not the carbon fiber tip and
in<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.310> catalogs<00:01:48.790> and<00:01:49.210> online<00:01:49.570> they<00:01:50.380> say

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
in the catalogs and online they say

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.920 
in the catalogs and online they say
carbon<00:01:51.040> fiber<00:01:51.220> tip<00:01:51.460> comes<00:01:51.640> with<00:01:51.880> which<00:01:52.420> I

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
carbon fiber tip comes with which I

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.830 
carbon fiber tip comes with which I
thought<00:01:53.800> so<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:54.580> we<00:01:54.970> call<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.240> company<00:01:55.540> and

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
thought so and we call the company and

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.290 
thought so and we call the company and
they<00:01:56.770> do<00:01:56.830> not<00:01:57.070> use<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.550> carbon<00:01:57.760> fiber<00:01:58.030> tip

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
they do not use the carbon fiber tip

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.620 
they do not use the carbon fiber tip
which<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.410> confusing<00:01:59.950> but<00:02:00.460> on<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.450> bright

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
which is confusing but on the bright

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.170 
which is confusing but on the bright
side<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:02.680> piece<00:02:02.950> right<00:02:03.130> here<00:02:03.190> this<00:02:04.120> is

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
side this piece right here this is

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.530 
side this piece right here this is
carbon<00:02:04.690> fiber<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.760> this<00:02:06.760> is<00:02:07.060> still<00:02:07.270> carbon

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
carbon fiber and this is still carbon

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.150 
carbon fiber and this is still carbon
fiber<00:02:07.750> so<00:02:09.510> I'm<00:02:10.510> happy<00:02:11.320> with<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:11.860> gives<00:02:12.070> the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
fiber so I'm happy with it it gives the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.550 
fiber so I'm happy with it it gives the
bike<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.340> nice<00:02:12.550> sound<00:02:12.820> and<00:02:13.140> I'll<00:02:14.140> let<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.410> guys
