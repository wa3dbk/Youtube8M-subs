00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.170
 this video i'm going to show you how 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.090
 I use dry hay 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.949
 I mainly use shampoo 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.600
 dry presented in the form of powder 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.769
 but be careful if you do not have 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.779
 shampoo is that you can the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.300
 replace very well with starch from 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.180
 corn is simply maize 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.530
 or so as the baby now 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.630
 you have one of these three 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.520
 products so maÃ¯zena such as for baby 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.290
 or dry shampoo i will show you 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.860
 how to apply it then this is 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.239
 that they can 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.219
 do not have too much reflex to put 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.539
 directly to the roots on pain of 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.820
 you find the hair all white and 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.110
 not succeed in eliminating it taken from 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.809
 simply in the hollow of your 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.760
 hand a small amount 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.360
 divide it all that way and you 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.120
 go come mass and your roots like 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.670
 these ones lift them air well 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.280
 enough your scalp and you go 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.560
 see as the fat is going to be 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.290
 absorbed and your hair will pick up 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.250
 life 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.170
 do not hesitate to renew the application 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.990
 several times by always taking a 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:22.890
 large quantity is installed on the hands 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:24.270
 and we come to threaten the roots the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.619
 dry shampoo can also be applied 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.750
 in the evening before going to bed 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.909
 the like that the effect will be even more 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.070
 faded so at night my you go to sleep 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.960
 you proceed in their own way which I 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.759
 told you by massaging your 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.590
 roots by spreading the product well 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.240
 you move in the morning when you 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.770
 will wake up your hair well 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.899
 will be much larger than 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.649
 the bei and they're going to be mostly 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:50.840
 a lot cleaner here that's it 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.070
 yes that's how water makes 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.070
 all bulky 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.070
