00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.929
 I love being around again 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:05.640
 today for you a little video mac 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.940
 basics how can I be great with this 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.299
 utility onyx my system faster 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.969
 clean up the plate and clean 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.770
 Start faster and have problems 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.470
 that's exactly what I show you today 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:25.770
 once very short and crisp much fun 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.570
 So we load the program once 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.170
 under for it we give once at google 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.539
 tonics 1 for mac there we have to go once 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.320
 know which system we are on 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.640
 have computers if you do not want that 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.499
 is below in the description once 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.870
 Described as her the version of 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:49.070
 a computer figures out when I'm 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.070
 the 10.8 that I download now 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:01:00.449
 there is the download already done 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:04.350
 double click and then I have here too 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.680
 nothing I draw now in turn 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:14.060
 the program folder I 'm easy 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:18.080
 open a new window and move here 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.160
 that in the programs 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.890
 That 's it because that's it 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.430
 That's why I replaced it 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.620
 now anyway for you 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.070
 that's it already, now I can 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.900
 here 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.900
 to throw out this hard drive again 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.200
 and I can do that here and now 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:47.640
 nothing about the now I can here too 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.120
 nothing about the search looking to open 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.120
 I open 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.000
 Today in this case, you say that 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.610
 he can not open it because it is not 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.740
 from a certified developer 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:10.739
 then you can once about apple 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:14.040
 system settings security and then 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:17.489
 Of course, once in general would have to 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.290
 You can open the stations once 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.780
 must not be any restrictions 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.459
 adjust so that you install the 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.459
 so on in the text 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.860
 Now you carry once password 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.250
 and then you click once too 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:42.410
 continue now the hard drive 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:42.410
 keep checking this we do not need 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.540
 that took a little moment 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.190
 Finished then you have several here 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.860
 possibilities for users who are themselves 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.770
 not so good I recommend the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.800
 automate point 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.660
 everything is executed here once 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.410
 important is 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.030
 you can check now if 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.260
 Do it once a month for 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.920
 I recommend the following 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.760
 put that in principle anything 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.250
 would put 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.260
 Displaying the folder contents wants you like this 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.120
 leave because you probably do 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.740
 maybe even set yourself 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.390
 I have to look like the individual folders 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.900
 should 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.180
 accordingly, you need here 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.360
 actually just hagen this set 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.970
 then he pushes on run and that 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.730
 can then circa comes on the computers 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.010
 but can take some time so if you 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.050
 do something on the computer in time 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.830
 then you want to move the couch too 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.270
 later because he now has all the programs 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.310
 will close that is now synonymous times 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.340
 say he will be running all the programs 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.680
 close and to the point so 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.930
 everything has done and then makes 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.200
 the reboot 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.330
 and then these things come into force 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.500
 It may be that the new state is longer 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.390
 needs as usual because, so to speak, everything 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.600
 partly reset was the get 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.790
 one as a user not with up to that 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.760
 he needs longer on the first reboot 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.340
 and he will also be around a bit 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.380
 be slower because he once the 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.840
 spot leitindex it is if you are here 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.050
 addiction is the index lead with that 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.820
 faster and then sets the 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.860
 new and that can be a whole 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.860
 it is done well and 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:42.190
 you start this here 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:43.900
 and now the optimization begins 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.050
 but when it is completed then 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.380
 he had the please to start you new 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.240
 I already made and then starts 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.990
 now here's the spot next 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.390
 to build up times 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.950
 we are not waiting for that because here 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.610
 is at home as well now 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:03.010
 can perform as well as cleaned 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.180
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.590
 If so, then give me the thumb 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.830
 high or write me like one 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.000
 comment below the video that should be 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.680
 maybe once a month 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.930
 make depending on how many on the computer 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:19.170
 works then the computer runs in the 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.170
 usually faster and better and so on
