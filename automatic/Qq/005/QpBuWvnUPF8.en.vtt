00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.530 

finally<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.860> formula<00:01:48.340> is<00:01:48.369> complete<00:01:48.820> add<00:01:49.090> the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
finally the formula is complete add the

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.230 
finally the formula is complete add the
cure<00:01:49.810> to<00:01:49.840> cancer<00:01:49.930> now<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.520> mix<00:01:51.760> these<00:01:51.940> two

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
cure to cancer now to mix these two

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.660 
cure to cancer now to mix these two
chemicals<00:01:52.750> and

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
chemicals and

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.789 
chemicals and
rhys<00:01:55.299> those<00:01:55.689> two<00:01:55.990> chemicals<00:01:56.470> create<00:01:56.710> the

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
rhys those two chemicals create the

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.120 
rhys those two chemicals create the
basics<00:01:57.159> for<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.340> high<00:01:57.549> explosive<00:01:57.700> don't<00:01:58.360> you

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
basics for a high explosive don't you

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.440 
basics for a high explosive don't you
that's<00:02:00.130> not<00:02:00.340> possible<00:02:00.369> with<00:02:00.909> my<00:02:01.090> level

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
that's not possible with my level

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.630 
that's not possible with my level
intellect<00:02:01.869> then<00:02:02.530> how<00:02:02.740> about<00:02:02.890> you<00:02:03.159> stop<00:02:03.430> before

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
intellect then how about you stop before

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.219 
intellect then how about you stop before
you<00:02:03.820> make<00:02:03.880> another<00:02:04.030> dangerous<00:02:04.689> invention

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
you make another dangerous invention

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.410
