00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
so here we are with the new Inazuma 250

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.020 
so here we are with the new Inazuma 250
this<00:00:13.259> bike<00:00:13.559> has<00:00:13.799> been<00:00:13.829> designed<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.579> meet<00:00:14.789> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
this bike has been designed to meet the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.019 
this bike has been designed to meet the
demand<00:00:15.360> for<00:00:15.690> cost-effective<00:00:16.500> reliable

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
demand for cost-effective reliable

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.089 
demand for cost-effective reliable
transport<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.900> we've<00:00:19.140> worked<00:00:19.320> very<00:00:19.470> hard<00:00:19.710> on

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
transport so we've worked very hard on

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.490 
transport so we've worked very hard on
the<00:00:20.189> fuel<00:00:20.429> efficiency<00:00:20.689> the<00:00:21.689> comfort<00:00:22.259> and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
the fuel efficiency the comfort and

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.579 
the fuel efficiency the comfort and
reliability<00:00:23.449> but<00:00:24.449> we<00:00:24.900> wanted<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.320> do<00:00:25.439> this

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:25.589 
reliability but we wanted to do this

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.249 
reliability but we wanted to do this
without<00:00:25.800> cutting<00:00:26.310> corners<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.900> level<00:00:28.169> of

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
without cutting corners so the level of

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.259 
without cutting corners so the level of
