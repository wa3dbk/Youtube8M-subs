interesting<00:00:40.589> maybe<00:00:41.589> even<00:00:41.829> radical<00:00:42.010> things

going<00:00:42.879> on<00:00:43.000> down<00:00:43.659> below<00:00:43.989> on<00:00:44.140> this<00:00:44.260> 430<00:00:44.800> I<00:00:45.190> think

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
going on down below on this 430 I think

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.979 
going on down below on this 430 I think
it's<00:00:45.699> really<00:00:45.879> important<00:00:46.390> to<00:00:46.449> remember<00:00:46.570> just

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
it's really important to remember just

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.340 
it's really important to remember just
how<00:00:47.290> well<00:00:47.800> this<00:00:48.579> type<00:00:48.940> of<00:00:48.970> boat<00:00:49.390> works<00:00:50.019> and<00:00:50.290> all

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
how well this type of boat works and all

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.740 
how well this type of boat works and all
sorts<00:00:50.649> of<00:00:50.710> levels<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:52.000> it<00:00:52.120> really<00:00:52.299> is<00:00:52.420> to<00:00:52.600> do

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
sorts of levels and it really is to do

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.310 
sorts of levels and it really is to do
with<00:00:53.229> levels<00:00:53.650> the<00:00:54.369> aft<00:00:55.089> cabin<00:00:55.390> here<00:00:55.780> pushes<00:00:56.170> up

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
with levels the aft cabin here pushes up

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.590 
with levels the aft cabin here pushes up
the<00:00:56.530> deck<00:00:57.339> level<00:00:57.729> till<00:00:57.909> you<00:00:58.000> get<00:00:58.180> tremendous

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
the deck level till you get tremendous

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.869 
the deck level till you get tremendous
and<00:00:59.110> elevated<00:00:59.589> views<00:00:59.890> but<00:01:00.549> of<00:01:00.640> course<00:01:00.820> you

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
and elevated views but of course you

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.179 
and elevated views but of course you
don't<00:01:01.059> have<00:01:01.330> that<00:01:01.570> in<00:01:01.750> almost<00:01:01.869> climb<00:01:02.320> up<00:01:02.949> and

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:03.189 
don't have that in almost climb up and

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:04.560 
don't have that in almost climb up and
down<00:01:03.280> to<00:01:03.549> the<00:01:03.670> flybridge<00:01:04.030> every<00:01:04.239> time<00:01:04.390> there's

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
down to the flybridge every time there's

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.830 
down to the flybridge every time there's
no<00:01:04.689> separation<00:01:05.680> it's<00:01:05.829> all<00:01:06.009> here<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.689> all<00:01:07.689> you

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
no separation it's all here and all you

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.630 
no separation it's all here and all you
have<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.079> contend<00:01:08.470> with<00:01:08.530> a<00:01:08.770> few<00:01:08.979> gentle<00:01:09.340> steps

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
have to contend with a few gentle steps

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.240 
have to contend with a few gentle steps
up<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:10.509> down<00:01:10.659> into<00:01:11.079> the<00:01:11.170> saloon<00:01:11.470> it's<00:01:11.979> a<00:01:12.100> boat

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
up and down into the saloon it's a boat

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.550 
up and down into the saloon it's a boat
that<00:01:12.400> feels<00:01:12.759> very<00:01:13.119> connected<00:01:14.110> between<00:01:14.229> all

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
that feels very connected between all

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.880 
that feels very connected between all
the<00:01:14.650> different<00:01:14.950> areas<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:17.259> you<00:01:17.320> only<00:01:17.619> have<00:01:17.710> to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
the different areas so you only have to

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.200 
the different areas so you only have to
look<00:01:18.040> around<00:01:18.159> you<00:01:18.430> to<00:01:18.579> see<00:01:18.729> that<00:01:18.909> this<00:01:19.030> is<00:01:19.180> a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
look around you to see that this is a

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.050 
look around you to see that this is a
broom<00:01:19.509> for<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.290> 21st<00:01:20.799> century<00:01:21.060> completely

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
broom for the 21st century completely

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.780 
broom for the 21st century completely
different<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.659> boats<00:01:22.869> of<00:01:23.680> old<00:01:23.920> but<00:01:24.640> what<00:01:24.729> I

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
different to the boats of old but what I

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.580 
different to the boats of old but what I
really<00:01:25.060> like<00:01:25.270> about<00:01:25.300> this<00:01:25.750> is<00:01:25.960> it<00:01:26.080> still<00:01:26.320> works

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
really like about this is it still works

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.520 
really like about this is it still works
on<00:01:26.830> a<00:01:26.860> practical<00:01:27.370> level<00:01:27.550> 2<00:01:28.030> so<00:01:28.659> this<00:01:29.229> Shaye's

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
on a practical level 2 so this Shaye's

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.160 
on a practical level 2 so this Shaye's
for<00:01:29.770> instance<00:01:30.100> might<00:01:30.340> seem<00:01:30.729> to<00:01:30.850> be<00:01:31.170> bit

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
for instance might seem to be bit

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.960 
for instance might seem to be bit
decadent<00:01:32.710> but<00:01:32.830> actually<00:01:33.159> it's<00:01:33.520> quite<00:01:33.700> well

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
decadent but actually it's quite well

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.810 
decadent but actually it's quite well
designed<00:01:34.180> you've<00:01:34.540> got<00:01:35.220> storage<00:01:36.220> under<00:01:36.610> here

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
designed you've got storage under here

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.350 
designed you've got storage under here
these<00:01:38.159> pull<00:01:39.159> out<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:39.580> slide<00:01:39.820> across<00:01:40.030> so<00:01:40.299> you

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
these pull out and slide across so you

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.340 
these pull out and slide across so you
can<00:01:40.510> use<00:01:40.659> them<00:01:40.810> with<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.909> dining<00:01:42.909> table<00:01:43.390> and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
can use them with the dining table and

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.090 
can use them with the dining table and
storage<00:01:44.830> as<00:01:45.010> well<00:01:45.220> behind<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:47.380> headrest<00:01:47.830> here

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
storage as well behind the headrest here

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.910 
storage as well behind the headrest here
nice<00:01:48.520> practical<00:01:49.180> touch<00:01:49.420> there

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
nice practical touch there

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.980 
nice practical touch there
overhead<00:01:51.920> handrail<00:01:52.370> here<00:01:52.540> if<00:01:53.540> should<00:01:53.840> you

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
overhead handrail here if should you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.890 
overhead handrail here if should you
need<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:54.910> it's<00:01:55.910> retained<00:01:56.240> its<00:01:56.420> practical

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
need it so it's retained its practical

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.950 
need it so it's retained its practical
edge<00:01:57.520> from<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.730> from<00:01:59.120> the<00:01:59.180> boats<00:01:59.390> of<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.600> past

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
edge from the from the boats of the past

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.260 
edge from the from the boats of the past
but<00:02:00.350> it's<00:02:00.680> bought<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.580> styling<00:02:01.970> into<00:02:02.150> the

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
but it's bought the styling into the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.210 
but it's bought the styling into the
21st<00:02:02.660> century<00:02:03.050> I<00:02:03.080> think<00:02:03.290> two<00:02:03.380> really<00:02:03.770> nice<00:02:04.580> mix

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
21st century I think two really nice mix

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.250 
21st century I think two really nice mix
you<00:02:07.220> can<00:02:07.340> see<00:02:07.550> yet<00:02:07.850> more<00:02:08.030> evidence<00:02:08.420> of<00:02:08.570> 21st

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
you can see yet more evidence of 21st

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.190 
you can see yet more evidence of 21st
styling<00:02:09.830> here<00:02:10.430> in<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.760> owners<00:02:11.000> cabin<00:02:11.420> in<00:02:12.170> the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
styling here in the owners cabin in the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.680 
styling here in the owners cabin in the
form<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.620> this<00:02:12.770> chain<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.850> personally<00:02:14.540> think

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
form of this chain I personally think

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.300 
form of this chain I personally think
this<00:02:14.870> is<00:02:14.990> a<00:02:15.020> bit<00:02:15.260> indulgent

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
this is a bit indulgent

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.350 
this is a bit indulgent
for<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.460> boat<00:02:16.610> like<00:02:16.760> this<00:02:16.910> but<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.210> doesn't

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
for a boat like this but it doesn't

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.480 
for a boat like this but it doesn't
really<00:02:17.540> matter<00:02:18.050> room<00:02:18.440> can<00:02:18.680> build<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.220> or

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
really matter room can build you this or
