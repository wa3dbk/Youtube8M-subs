00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.330
 It has been the best group in the state 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.780
 the whole theater must test 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.570
 designed with a social content 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.730
 it's a critical theater 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.730
 everything is questioned in the future 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.330
 contemporary society 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.080
 the work from the beggar because it represents that 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.940
 the critic 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.180
 to the power 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.550
 and oppression 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.490
 to the town 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.640
 the power 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.010
 stop 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.520
 a coexistence the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.820
 a state has nothing to choose a single person 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.829
 It has a social and political content 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.009
 in this 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.349
 a kind of genre efe 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.349
 call epic theater 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.739
 in which 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.439
 efe the story is put in question 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.149
 or it's about seeing in a different way 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:22.149
 in the part of the premises of dialectical materialism 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.960

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:10.869
 with a sense in a social sense 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:15.339
 when I see the reaction of the people 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.519
