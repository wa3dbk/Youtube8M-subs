00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.649

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.910
 green thumb 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.630
 thank you welcome to the daily 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.160
 the channel 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.230
 I am your fish host and I will bring you 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.230
 also the news from last week 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.580
 arjan is based on research at some 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.630
 the idea for offers means well i am 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.099
 actually quite curious so 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.310
 let's just listen to it 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.960
 first fact today is anatidae phobia 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.520
 or the fear that you are being observed 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.870
 being the one I have never had 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.640
 heard I did not know it could 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.670
 but apparently some people have it 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.800
 in the world who suffer from one 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.140
 yes and and fear called anna the idea 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.200
 for who and what you write is ayana 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.640
 tedef obj 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.260
 and that is the fear that you 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.210
 is being observed by a de and me 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.590
 don't understand why you would ever be scared 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.969
 that you ge 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.680
 yes that you are being observed by a de 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.969
 but apparently people are bothered by it 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.980
 and it seems horribly annoying to me 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.230
 because yes if you pass by or you five 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.699
 runs there are simply a de so 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.470
 if you pass by that must really be 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.750
 hell for those people there are 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.070
