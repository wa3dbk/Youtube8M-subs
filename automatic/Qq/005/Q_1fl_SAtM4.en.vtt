decider controller the SciTech x 65 F

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.330 
decider controller the SciTech x 65 F
does<00:00:09.000> not<00:00:09.389> have<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:09.960> profile<00:00:10.469> for<00:00:10.710> what<00:00:10.950> more

thunder<00:00:11.670> yet<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.300> when<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.259> try<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.469> map<00:00:13.799> the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
thunder yet so when you try to map the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.519 
thunder yet so when you try to map the
throttle<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.120> game<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.660> game<00:00:15.690> screws

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
throttle to the game the game screws

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.439 
throttle to the game the game screws
itself<00:00:16.920> up<00:00:17.160> like<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.580> comes<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> point<00:00:18.180> where

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
itself up like it comes to a point where

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.599 
itself up like it comes to a point where
you<00:00:18.570> try<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.810> you've<00:00:19.800> trying<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.100> map<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.520> and

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
you try to you've trying to map it and

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.790 
you try to you've trying to map it and
it<00:00:20.760> just<00:00:20.789> doesn't<00:00:21.150> work<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.539> go<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.720> 100%<00:00:22.170> it

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
it just doesn't work you go to 100% it

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.679 
it just doesn't work you go to 100% it
sticks<00:00:23.160> at<00:00:23.310> 150<00:00:23.939> percent<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.359> go<00:00:24.449> all<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.600> way

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
sticks at 150 percent you go all the way

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.920 
sticks at 150 percent you go all the way
back<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.050> goes<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.289> minus<00:00:25.470> 50%<00:00:26.300> some<00:00:27.300> outside

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
back it goes to minus 50% some outside

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.470 
back it goes to minus 50% some outside
the<00:00:28.670> horrible<00:00:29.670> zone<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.000> then<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.269> try<00:00:30.449> to

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the horrible zone and then you try to

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.240 
the horrible zone and then you try to
fly<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.170> doesn't<00:00:31.439> work<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.009> I

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
fly with it and doesn't work and I

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.440 
fly with it and doesn't work and I
looked<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.700> internet<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.090> didn't<00:00:33.300> really

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
looked on the internet I didn't really

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.389 
looked on the internet I didn't really
find<00:00:33.630> anybody<00:00:33.899> who<00:00:34.530> actually<00:00:34.710> had<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> solution

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
find anybody who actually had a solution

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.010 
find anybody who actually had a solution
for<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.640> thing<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.000> ended<00:00:36.239> up<00:00:36.360> figuring

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
for this thing but I ended up figuring

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.229 
for this thing but I ended up figuring
it<00:00:37.290> out<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.500> my<00:00:37.649> own<00:00:37.680> by<00:00:38.579> some<00:00:38.790> really<00:00:39.059> dumb

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
it out on my own by some really dumb

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.900 
it out on my own by some really dumb

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
luck and I'll show you guys how to do

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.779 
luck and I'll show you guys how to do
that<00:00:41.969> right<00:00:42.270> now<00:00:43.040> first<00:00:44.040> what<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.430> need<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.670> do

that right now first what you need to do

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.310 
that right now first what you need to do
is<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.059> select<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.570> mean<00:00:45.840> I'm<00:00:45.960> gonna<00:00:46.110> do<00:00:46.260> this

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
is just select I mean I'm gonna do this

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.049 
is just select I mean I'm gonna do this
for<00:00:46.410> simpler<00:00:46.770> simplified<00:00:47.430> controls<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:47.969> it

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
for simpler simplified controls but it

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.150 
for simpler simplified controls but it
works<00:00:48.239> for<00:00:48.420> every<00:00:48.719> type<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.930> control<00:00:49.379> I'm

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
works for every type of control I'm

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.040 
works for every type of control I'm
selecting<00:00:50.700> simplified<00:00:51.149> controls<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.629> say<00:00:51.809> no

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
selecting simplified controls I say no

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.889 
selecting simplified controls I say no
for<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.469> mouse<00:00:52.739> look<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.309> then<00:00:53.940> just<00:00:54.449> you

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
for the mouse look and then just you

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.799 
for the mouse look and then just you
know<00:00:55.020> put<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> pitch<00:00:55.500> axes<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.719> put<00:00:57.719> it

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
know put the pitch axes in here put it

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.040 
know put the pitch axes in here put it
down<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.850> then<00:00:59.850> roll<00:01:00.030> axis<00:01:00.239> doesn't<00:01:00.840> really

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
down and then roll axis doesn't really

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.959 
down and then roll axis doesn't really
matter<00:01:01.350> because<00:01:02.250> these<00:01:02.370> things<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.820> register

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
matter because these things do register

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.660 
matter because these things do register
perfectly<00:01:03.719> fine<00:01:03.920> your<00:01:04.920> axes<00:01:05.250> I'm<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:05.489> even

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
perfectly fine your axes I'm not even

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.880 
perfectly fine your axes I'm not even
gonna<00:01:05.790> bother<00:01:06.170> here<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> problem<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
gonna bother here is the problem the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.010 
gonna bother here is the problem the
throttle<00:01:08.280> axis<00:01:08.670> when<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.299> try<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.510> register

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
throttle axis when you try to register

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.149 
throttle axis when you try to register
the<00:01:10.140> throttle<00:01:10.470> axis<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.799> don't<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.040> if<00:01:11.100> you

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
the throttle axis I don't know if you

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.560 
the throttle axis I don't know if you
can<00:01:11.310> see<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:11.610> not<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.150> can<00:01:12.270> see<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
can see it or not but as you can see the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.969 
can see it or not but as you can see the
red<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.409> don't<00:01:13.470> want<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.740> touch<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
red and I don't want to touch the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.679 
red and I don't want to touch the
microphone<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.400> red<00:01:14.549> thing<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.909> right<00:01:15.390> there

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
microphone the red thing is right there

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.510 
microphone the red thing is right there
it's<00:01:16.350> supposed<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.070> middle<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.430> I'm

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
it's supposed to be in the middle so I'm

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520 
it's supposed to be in the middle so I'm
gonna<00:01:17.640> go<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.090> zero<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:19.110> went<00:01:19.290> all<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
gonna go to the zero and it went all the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.810 
gonna go to the zero and it went all the
way<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.009> bottom<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.729> know

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
way to the bottom this is like you know

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.730 
way to the bottom this is like you know
what<00:01:21.000> actually<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.930> make<00:01:22.110> we<00:01:22.259> had<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.530> wrong

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
what actually we make we had that wrong

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.870 
what actually we make we had that wrong
so<00:01:22.979> let's<00:01:23.310> go<00:01:23.490> back<00:01:23.520> really<00:01:23.909> quick<00:01:25.369> okay<00:01:26.369> it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
so let's go back really quick okay it

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.819 
so let's go back really quick okay it
says<00:01:27.060> go<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.540> maximum<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.560> red<00:01:28.710> is

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
says go to the maximum and the red is

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.319 
says go to the maximum and the red is
right<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> right<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.670> between<00:01:29.820> I'm<00:01:30.090> gonna

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
right in the right in between I'm gonna

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.140 
right in the right in between I'm gonna
maximum<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.920> dropped<00:01:32.220> down<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.670> did<00:01:32.820> something

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
maximum it dropped down it did something

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.700 
maximum it dropped down it did something
stupid<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.750> stopped<00:01:33.960> at<00:01:34.110> zero<00:01:34.350> again

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
stupid and it stopped at zero again

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.130 
stupid and it stopped at zero again
I'm<00:01:35.070> sorry<00:01:35.310> 50%<00:01:35.909> again<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.600> says<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:36.900> okay

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
I'm sorry 50% again it says like okay

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.390 
I'm sorry 50% again it says like okay
now<00:01:37.259> go<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.619> minimum<00:01:37.920> I'm<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
now go to the minimum I'm going to the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.420 
now go to the minimum I'm going to the
minimum<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.509> goes<00:01:39.689> below<00:01:40.049> zero<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:41.100> now

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
minimum and it goes below zero and now

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.960 
minimum and it goes below zero and now
it<00:01:41.579> registers<00:01:42.060> at<00:01:42.270> some<00:01:42.509> other<00:01:42.720> area<00:01:43.200> and

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
it registers at some other area and

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.490 
it registers at some other area and
that's<00:01:44.970> not<00:01:45.210> gonna<00:01:45.420> work<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.869> way<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.079> go<00:01:46.350> it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
that's not gonna work the way to go it

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.600 
that's not gonna work the way to go it

the<00:01:51.680> throttle<00:01:52.680> adjustment<00:01:53.390> unlock<00:01:54.390> your<00:01:55.020> two

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the throttle adjustment unlock your two

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.149 
the throttle adjustment unlock your two

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
calibrate the left side pushing it

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.060 
calibrate the left side pushing it
forward<00:02:03.420> as<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.869> can<00:02:04.049> see<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.469> maximum

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070

now<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.830> lock<00:02:11.009> them<00:02:11.160> back<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.550> get

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
now you can lock them back to get

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.080 
now you can lock them back to get
and<00:02:14.750> use<00:02:15.750> them<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.110> game<00:02:16.489> the<00:02:17.489> main<00:02:17.700> reason

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
and use them in the game the main reason

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.789 
and use them in the game the main reason
why<00:02:18.239> this<00:02:18.689> is<00:02:18.840> causing<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.290> issue<00:02:19.409> is<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
why this is causing the issue is the

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.030 
why this is causing the issue is the
fact<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.989> warthunder<00:02:21.989> recognizes<00:02:22.860> these

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
fact that warthunder recognizes these

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.929 
fact that warthunder recognizes these
two<00:02:24.049> axes<00:02:25.049> as<00:02:25.290> separate<00:02:25.769> axes<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.610> when<00:02:26.819> you

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
two axes as separate axes and when you

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.520 
two axes as separate axes and when you
try<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.209> use<00:02:27.510> them<00:02:27.720> both<00:02:27.870> when<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.170> lock<00:02:28.409> them

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
try to use them both when you lock them

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.780 
try to use them both when you lock them
and<00:02:28.709> try<00:02:28.829> to<00:02:28.890> use<00:02:29.069> them<00:02:29.250> both<00:02:29.430> there's<00:02:29.640> no

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
and try to use them both there's no

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.970 
and try to use them both there's no

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
program that both of them are being used

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.759 
program that both of them are being used
for<00:02:35.610> one<00:02:36.120> reason<00:02:36.659> so<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.930> just<00:02:37.140> loses<00:02:37.379> its<00:02:37.560> mind

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
for one reason so it just loses its mind

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.280 
for one reason so it just loses its mind
but<00:02:38.310> once<00:02:38.819> you<00:02:39.000> calibrate<00:02:39.390> this<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.140> you

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
but once you calibrate this and you

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.110 
but once you calibrate this and you
don't<00:02:40.590> calibrate<00:02:41.040> anything<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.579> this<00:02:41.700> axis

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
don't calibrate anything to this axis

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.670 
don't calibrate anything to this axis
and<00:02:42.269> you<00:02:42.359> just<00:02:42.510> lock<00:02:42.689> them<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.260> can<00:02:43.439> just<00:02:43.560> use

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
and you just lock them you can just use

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.500 
and you just lock them you can just use
it<00:02:43.709> just<00:02:44.069> like<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:45.299> will<00:02:45.420> be

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
it just like that and it will be

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.780 
it just like that and it will be
perfectly<00:02:45.900> fine<00:02:46.109> thanks<00:02:46.980> for<00:02:47.040> watching<00:02:47.459> if
