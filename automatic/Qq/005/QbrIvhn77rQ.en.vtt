00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.800
 character through a character but to 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.800
 my character 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.730
 wilbur how little good I bring you a 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.710
 new tutorial in which I 'm going to 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.080
 teach how to make a farm 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.200
 seeds yes yes a seed farm 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.500
 and well I created here a super mega 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.960
 and staff are going to see her as above 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.340
 it has cost me many rivals 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.340
 let's catch here 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.429
 and I will write 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.199
 hello this super weird drawing that we 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:45.399
 it serves to fly 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:49.839
 Well, I'm going to go in and teach how 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.839
 how to make a seed farm 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:01:02.109
 let's see if I'm there 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.309
 with the peak 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.789
 no no no 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.789
 people 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.159
 good good good we have to cover is 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.310
 first we go there and we go there 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:34.479
 you see how totally dark it is not worth 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.479
 let's take bones and walk 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.850
 walk 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:44.640
 walk 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:50.620
 I in Seville, good, I will spend all 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:53.650
 the bulbs and now I go back 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.920
 and as you see , and I'm running out of 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:01.960
 leave a few so you can see how it is 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:04.840
 and let's see what effects this has 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.440
 let's take everything and now is when 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.440
 let's flip 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.460
 well I would risk saying that this is 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.500
 Useful 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:19.520
 yes yes to connect in plan 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:23.110
 factory if the industrial plan is very 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.490
 useful and good this happens because 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.490
 they need light there are not some that are 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.940
 they are here I do not know why but the letters 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:35.150
 you need this you can do it because 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.970
 pick one and jump and jump and jump and 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.550
 jump and jump 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.280
 well so far the tutorial 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.860
 how to make a seed farm and 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.560
 also of flowers because as you see I have 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.260
 a bunch of flowers stax that I'm going to 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.380
 catch everything but it's tremendous and 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.730
 tremendously useful 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.019
 look, I almost do not have 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.019

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.880

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.520

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.710

 as to explore there and nothing 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.320

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.790
