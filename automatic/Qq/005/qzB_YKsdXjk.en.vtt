first layer of what's called pellicle

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.010

it's a mucopolysaccharides layer that

presents the germs with a medium in
which<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.410> grow<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.920> that's<00:00:59.129> called<00:00:59.370> plaque

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
which to grow so that's called plaque

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.660 
which to grow so that's called plaque
and<00:01:00.359> that's<00:01:00.809> when<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> bacteria<00:01:01.829> grows<00:01:02.100> the

and that's when the bacteria grows the
plaque<00:01:02.940> develops<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.750> then<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.619> get

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
plaque develops and then you get

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.740 
plaque develops and then you get
potential<00:01:05.729> infectious<00:01:06.150> diseases<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
mechanical cleaning like normal brushing

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.649 
mechanical cleaning like normal brushing
and<00:01:22.320> flossing<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.040> then<00:01:23.490> mechanically<00:01:24.420> of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
and flossing and then mechanically of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.870 
and flossing and then mechanically of
course<00:01:24.960> getting<00:01:25.470> rid<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.770> any<00:01:25.979> food<00:01:26.340> particles

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
course getting rid of any food particles

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.310 
course getting rid of any food particles
that<00:01:26.970> are<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.119> your<00:01:27.299> teeth<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.810> might<00:01:27.960> block

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
that are in your teeth that might block

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.160 
that are in your teeth that might block
the<00:01:28.850> liquid<00:01:29.850> dance<00:01:30.030> from<00:01:30.299> getting<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.049> your

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the liquid dance from getting to your

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.249 
the liquid dance from getting to your
teeth<00:01:31.409> well<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.979> clean<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.759> first<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.390> then

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
teeth well you clean that first and then

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.140 
teeth well you clean that first and then
what<00:01:34.560> happens<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.369> liquid<00:01:35.579> dentist

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
what happens is that the liquid dentist

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.929 
what happens is that the liquid dentist
has<00:01:36.329> extremely<00:01:37.140> unique<00:01:37.500> lysozyme<00:01:38.189> enzyme

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
has extremely unique lysozyme enzyme

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.510 
has extremely unique lysozyme enzyme
that<00:01:39.390> attaches<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.380> tooth<00:01:40.590> surface<00:01:40.860> that

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
that attaches to the tooth surface that

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.120 
that attaches to the tooth surface that
then<00:01:41.759> prohibits<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.720> formation<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.530> pellicle

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
then prohibits the formation of pellicle

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.030 
then prohibits the formation of pellicle
for<00:01:44.640> over<00:01:45.090> two<00:01:45.329> days<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
for over two days so that you have a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.569 
for over two days so that you have a
extended<00:01:48.000> period<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.570> safety<00:01:49.079> now<00:01:49.590> that's<00:01:50.310> not

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
extended period of safety now that's not

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.590 
extended period of safety now that's not
repaired

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
repaired

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.840 
repaired
that's<00:01:51.899> preventative<00:01:52.619> what's<00:01:53.280> reparative

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
that's preventative what's reparative

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.380 
that's preventative what's reparative
about<00:01:54.329> liquid<00:01:54.720> dentist<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.950> actually

about liquid dentist is that it actually

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
the liquid dentists that actually then

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.410

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
the elements inside the mouth rinse so

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.730
