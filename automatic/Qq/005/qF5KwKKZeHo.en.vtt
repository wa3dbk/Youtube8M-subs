 of your maritime ships and start with the 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.570
 trolley or 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.650
 after an impressive sunrise in the 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.020

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.239
 guillermo gonzález mónica gonzález and 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.190
 leonardo bejar observed the currents 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.770
 marinas to try to look at some fish 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.050
 suddenly a group of dolphins appeared 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.479
 providing a water show to the 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.620
 natural that the crew interpreted 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.620
 like good sea 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.710
 and yes 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.680
 no no 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.780
 after a few minutes a golden fish 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.390
 keeps one of the seven hooks 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.580
 placed on the boat el mazatleco 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.980
 leonardo béjar was the one who took 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.610
 immediately the cane to set and dominate 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.610
 to the fish 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.069
 A) Yes 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.030
 why 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.799
 after a few hours another golden 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.879
 but this time it was the turn to 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.879
 mónica gonzález 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.579
 a few golds and a lot of the 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:02.140
 came but we have not had any luck with the 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.140
 stella what we look for most 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.400
 how he felt the fight with the fish 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.640
 well we enjoyed and enjoyed the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.780
 adrenaline too 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.970
 we love it and I'm super satisfied not 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.459
 I know if we all want to win the tournament 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.670
 but I do not know if it's possible with the 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.849
 pests and let's go 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.450
 no it was not bad we grabbed 6 good golden 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.000
 pieces 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.130
 which many would like many not 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.280
 they caught nothing 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.740
 I come satisfied what we do not like 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.990
 now that they did not apply it to picudo that 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.290
 is what I bet more if a weevil 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.910
 but with a golden one you can win a 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.490
 total of six fish forms that 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.620
 captured for eight hours of fishing and 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.290
 only one piece submitted to register 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.420
 on the scale the rest of the fish do not 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.430
 they were as big as the rules 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.920
 of the tournament the emotion and the adrenaline 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.010
 that the participants felt was 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:05.680
 unforgettable said they felt satisfied 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:11.290
 with the result with images and editing
