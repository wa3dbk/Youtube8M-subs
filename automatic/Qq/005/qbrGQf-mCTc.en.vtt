00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
already done it before the action as

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.600 
already done it before the action as
they<00:00:46.560> think<00:00:46.800> about<00:00:47.040> it<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.280> other<00:00:47.400> words

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
they think about it in other words

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.340 
they think about it in other words
because<00:00:47.850> although<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.540> produces<00:00:48.960> electrical

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
because although it produces electrical

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.680 
because although it produces electrical
waves<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.610> literally<00:00:50.910> learn<00:00:51.240> to<00:00:51.420> pick<00:00:51.540> up

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
waves and you literally learn to pick up

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.150 
waves and you literally learn to pick up
on<00:00:51.870> those<00:00:52.020> things<00:00:52.320> because<00:00:52.500> your<00:00:52.740> energy<00:00:53.040> is

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
on those things because your energy is

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.380 
on those things because your energy is
coordinated<00:00:53.700> with<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.820> other<00:00:54.000> person's

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
coordinated with the other person's

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.430 
coordinated with the other person's
energy<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:57.120> before<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> person<00:00:58.320> has

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
energy so the before the person has

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.830

it's a live internally I call that lot

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.369 
it's a live internally I call that lot
being<00:02:40.920> alive<00:02:41.220> internally<00:02:41.879> this<00:02:42.690> is<00:02:42.870> just<00:02:43.140> dead

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
being alive internally this is just dead

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.100 
being alive internally this is just dead
this<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.489> tension<00:02:44.940> which<00:02:45.090> blocks<00:02:45.360> energy<00:02:45.780> both

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
this is tension which blocks energy both

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.400 
this is tension which blocks energy both
that<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:47.040> block<00:02:47.340> energy<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:48.079> is<00:02:49.079> now

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
that and that block energy that is now

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.949 
that and that block energy that is now
alive<00:02:49.799> it's<00:02:50.129> like<00:02:50.310> there's<00:02:50.849> a<00:02:50.910> water<00:02:51.510> coming

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
alive it's like there's a water coming

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.890 
alive it's like there's a water coming
out<00:02:52.049> of<00:02:52.109> the<00:02:52.260> hose<00:02:52.470> going<00:02:53.099> out<00:02:53.250> here<00:02:53.750> so<00:02:54.750> what

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
out of the hose going out here so what

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.349 
out of the hose going out here so what
the<00:02:55.019> hands<00:02:55.349> are<00:02:55.470> doing<00:02:55.739> emulates<00:02:56.519> what<00:02:56.819> what's

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
the hands are doing emulates what what's

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.530 
the hands are doing emulates what what's
the<00:02:57.510> body<00:02:57.690> doing<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:59.340> whole<00:02:59.819> about<00:03:00.090> Taiji

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
the body doing and the whole about Taiji

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.449 
the body doing and the whole about Taiji
is<00:03:00.750> based<00:03:00.989> upon<00:03:01.170> this<00:03:01.680> principle<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:03.230> most

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
is based upon this principle so most

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.339 
is based upon this principle so most
instructors<00:03:05.660> around<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.750> world<00:03:06.959> sadly

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
instructors around the world sadly

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.440 
instructors around the world sadly
