00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
for that's really hard for me to believe

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.770 
for that's really hard for me to believe
because<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.520> looked<00:01:15.150> through<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.390> interview

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
because I looked through the interview

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.170 
because I looked through the interview
or<00:01:16.159> interviews<00:01:17.159> or<00:01:17.189> other<00:01:17.520> interviews<00:01:18.000> maybe

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
or interviews or other interviews maybe

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.880 
or interviews or other interviews maybe
I<00:01:18.270> didn't<00:01:18.540> hear<00:01:18.810> or<00:01:18.930> listen<00:01:19.590> attentively

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
I didn't hear or listen attentively

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.679 
I didn't hear or listen attentively
enough<00:01:20.430> but<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.700> didn't<00:01:21.060> hear<00:01:21.240> anything<00:01:21.479> about

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
enough but I didn't hear anything about

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.399

dlcs for costumes not being done and
it's<00:01:25.560> really<00:01:25.740> hard<00:01:26.009> for<00:01:26.070> me<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.310> believe<00:01:26.430> that

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
it's really hard for me to believe that

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:27.980 
it's really hard for me to believe that
