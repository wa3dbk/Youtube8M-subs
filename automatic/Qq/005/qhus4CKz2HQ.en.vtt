00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
editor alright I am loaded up the actual

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.400 
editor alright I am loaded up the actual
map<00:02:23.720> as<00:02:24.709> you<00:02:24.770> can<00:02:24.950> see<00:02:25.130> it's<00:02:25.340> very<00:02:25.430> big<00:02:26.410> the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
map as you can see it's very big the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.810 
map as you can see it's very big the
size<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.780> player<00:02:29.780> is<00:02:30.250> smaller<00:02:31.250> than<00:02:31.520> one<00:02:31.700> of

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
size of a player is smaller than one of

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.790 
size of a player is smaller than one of
those<00:02:31.940> trees<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:34.239> this<00:02:35.239> is<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.450> pretty<00:02:36.050> decent

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
those trees so this is a pretty decent

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.410 
those trees so this is a pretty decent
sized<00:02:37.519> map<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.540> am<00:02:39.230> extending<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:40.180> over<00:02:41.180> there

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420

like that so you have a GUI game and

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.289 
like that so you have a GUI game and
then<00:04:00.829> the<00:04:00.980> network<00:04:01.250> controller<00:04:01.640> split<00:04:02.000> the

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
then the network controller split the

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.680 
then the network controller split the
script<00:04:02.569> all<00:04:03.410> of<00:04:03.829> these<00:04:04.129> help<00:04:04.819> run<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.480> game

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
script all of these help run the game

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.509 
script all of these help run the game
and<00:04:07.480> when<00:04:08.480> you<00:04:08.599> complete<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.019> tutorial<00:04:09.519> you

and when you complete the tutorial you

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.729 
and when you complete the tutorial you
should<00:04:10.700> have<00:04:10.819> something<00:04:11.120> like<00:04:11.629> this<00:04:12.260> you

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
should have something like this you

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.500 
should have something like this you
won't<00:04:12.829> have<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.190> map<00:04:13.459> but<00:04:13.849> you<00:04:14.090> can<00:04:14.239> make<00:04:14.360> your

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
won't have the map but you can make your

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.240 
won't have the map but you can make your
a<00:04:14.540> map<00:04:14.810> any<00:04:15.110> way<00:04:15.290> you<00:04:15.349> want<00:04:15.680> it

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
just place the spawn points and then you

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.099 
just place the spawn points and then you
got<00:04:19.160> a<00:04:19.400> network<00:04:19.880> games<00:04:20.150> thanks<00:04:20.570> for<00:04:20.720> watching
