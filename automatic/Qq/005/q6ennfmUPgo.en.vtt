00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.939

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.969

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.870
 We are going to crush very well until we leave it 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.640

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.269
 I pray and if they prepare it, I encourage them to 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.980
 I took a picture and share it 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.560
 with me through the different networks 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.540
 social that you will find below sprint 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.700
 to make the description I'm going to go 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.349
 already marching but before leaving I'm going to 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.330
 recommend that you have the first time 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.160
 me one of my videos subscribe to me 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.319
 youtube channel because this way there 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.540
 they will lose any of the recipes that 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.180
 I hang in the future finally I 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.980
 I send a very strong hug to each one of 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:49.880
 you see us the next day 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:51.500
 until another one and the ingredients that we're going 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.260
 to need to prepare it are the 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.689
 following 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.120
 they prepare water by preparing a shake 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.920
 male milkshake since this way no 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.390
 you are going to lose any of the recipes 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.390
 that I hang in the future 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.530
 and finally I send you a very strong 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.240
 hug everyone 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.240
