00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello how are you welcome back to 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.500
 my channel today I bring you a super look 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.300
 simple that they can use for the day and 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.309
 transform it later for the night 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.889
 obviously for the day without enabling 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.109
 this but for the night with two 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.960
 products and in one step what 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.760
 transform and it was a super vibrant 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.070
 to go out at night to do some 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.060
 jobs and no cost so stay 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.949
 watching the video and practicing aesthetics 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.720
 to start this look the first thing that 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.780
 we have to do is with a prime envelope 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.120
 all the eye I already did that and the second 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.370
 is to place a neutral shadow 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.020
 in this case I will place the date 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.960
 eaters de mch 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.460
 It is a luster shade with 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.460
 golden guitar 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.000
 I want to keep the pair all the more 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.950
 simple as possible since we are going to make a 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.040
 outlined quite important in the 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.540
 lower eyelid once we have the 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:17.640
 shadow on the entire mobile eyelid 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:22.190
 we are going to place in the superciliary arch 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.190
 some shadow to give us a little light 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.079
 as a second step we are going to take a pencil 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.610
 eyeliner in this case in black and we're going 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.610
 to delineate the water line 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.370
 with that same pencil we are going to delineate the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.670
 lower eyelid well attached to the 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.670
 tabs 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:04.569
 once we delineated well with the pencil 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.569
 we're going to blow all those pencils 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.179
 and this we do so that they do not remain 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.890
 rigid lines 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.700
 and to make it a more delineated 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.700
 important 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.620
 and how we want that is important 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:26.420
 let's take cork de marc and we'll 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.420
 smoke it under that delineated 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.030
 this is a quick look the truth that 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.220
 for the day if they want to use it they can 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.580
 leave as I will show them to the 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.580
 final 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.410
 and for the night they can do the twist 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.750
 what am I going to give you now 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.450
 now let's take a half tone a 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.170
 clear tone in this case to skiing 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.170
 from the sea 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.010
 and we will smoke it if you want it 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.620
 leave alone for the day the only thing that 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.110
 they have to do is a soft blush 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.080
 some lips nude as much as possible or 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.480
 rosaditos and they are already perfect a little 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.129
 of mascara and we are now 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.950
 if they want to do what I'm going to do 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.989
 not that I 'm going to do a nucleus 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.549
 make a little bit more vibrant for the 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:27.140
 night we're going to take military and we're going to 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.110
 make a delineated above with the 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:34.370
 military to do the outlined I'm going to 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:38.030
 use the mix and miriam eyeliner of mac i'll 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.540
 to place just one droplet on my hand with 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.890
 a lainer brush but in this case in 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.490
 angle 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:50.090
 it took a bit of glitter and mixed it with 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.760
 the mix and have a medium and liner 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.660
 guitar without having to have bought 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.660
 other product 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:18.150
 well once they finished putting the 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.150
 eyeliner puts mascara 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.690
 a good cause 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.350
 a little blush in this case I'm going to 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.830
 put the mac floor power that is a 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.830
 pink 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.430
 very quiet for spring illuminator 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.650
 beige color that I really already 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.680
 I put but if we see them equally is this 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:46.169
 environment but 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:49.039
 and for the lips I will use my mac 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.039
 is this 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.240
 and this is the finished look I hope that 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.430
 you liked this is a very look 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.710
 easy to use in the office and do 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.780
 that transition from day to night can 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.940
 Raw obviously go sight 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.700
 military do all the previous steps 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.410
 they go to the office they go to work and the 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.180
 night when they want to go out they take the 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.990
 liter in the wallet a glue 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.210
 6000 million tab a local without a chair 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.580
 nor military and they go to the after oficce to 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.280
 cocktail to the scene or whatever it is that 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.890
 go to do at night and are ready 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.450
 they do not need any other step 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.160
