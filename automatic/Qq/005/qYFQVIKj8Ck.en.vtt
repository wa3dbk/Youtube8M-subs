00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello to you all angles while we are today 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.620
 I will tell you how to create 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.620
 qr codes 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.510
 let's allow this application 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.910
 link is in the description of this video 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.930
 by the way this is not an app from appstore this 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.390
 simple link 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.540
 and from the internet and site which 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.390
 called qr-codes. they lie like that 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:33.200
 the way I exported it to the screen 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.210
 go home too you can do that 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.250
 I can say about the interface 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.570
 pretty pretty simple here 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.910
 four kinds of encoding first is any 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.329
 text here you write any text and 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.089
 which you need then link to the site 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.879
 here you write a link to how and you 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:55.699
 want a site so that people would exchange 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.120
 then business card name here 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.820
 last name phone organization address and so 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.519
 further and then the last tab itself 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.890
 this sms alert here you are actually 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.070
 write your phone number or number 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.579
 what companies do you want then write 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.549
 message text let's select the view 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.290
 any text on coding any text 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:22.880
 also I would like to mention 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.430
 note that there are sizes with 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.110
 first size on 6 let's go right away 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.170
 choose 6 size it is more convenient 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.909
 and let's take an example from our site with 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:41.930
 YouTube with youtube channel and copy our 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:46.369
 link we are brothers and copy and now 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:50.509
 go to our website qr-code and then 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:54.170
 insert our link and all 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.689
 and now we write create code after which it 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.570
 there is such a beautiful cat 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.950
 over our page let's save 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.140
 data image 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.240
 and come on now I decided to tell you about 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.360
 such an application that encodes 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.330
 i.e. read barcode information 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.580
 qr-codes it looks in the appstore and you 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.200
 can by the way the link is in the description for 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.750
 this video to download this 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.230
 applications it is absolutely free she 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.300
 you really like this here 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.760
 such here by the way here also 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.620
 navigation is where you scanned 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:35.519
 this code let's go to the actual 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.739
 to this application interface like me 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.260
 said here is very simple too here 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.860
 Here is such a field where you should wear 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.200
 actually your qr code well let's add 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.660
 with this button, then our 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.390
 which we just did and after 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.569
 what we also send to the site 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.209
 youtube and that is on our channel smile 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:02.280
 Here in this way well, let's 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:07.579
 Let's write a few words in this field . 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.180
 several moves let's write the regiment 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:14.459
 all people 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.709
 and here ipad himself gave us quite a name 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.220
 then we copy this one again 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:25.380
 barcode i.e. qr-code and go to 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:28.950
 scand app and again the same 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.950
 like the first time and that's it 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.639
 scan happened and here we were given 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.950
 title 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.019
 what we just described ali shelves 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.900
 what can I say to whom it will be 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.840
 useful application it would be i 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.989
 would say useful to all well for example when 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.359
 video game overview you can insert 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.310
 picture and to him the same qr-code on 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.470
 download this game and then 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.870
 users who can see right away 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.459
 scan it and go directly to 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.040
 download this offer 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.750
 well it seems to me very useful 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.519
 function with you was full regiment 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.889
