back<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.070> 84<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.750> think<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.470> centre

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
back in 84 so I I think the the centre

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.700 
back in 84 so I I think the the centre
of<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:30.330> start<00:00:30.630> was<00:00:30.810> actually<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.439> northern

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
of the start was actually the northern

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.010 
of the start was actually the northern
part<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.040> Europe<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.520> would<00:00:32.730> say<00:00:32.910> although<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
part of Europe I would say although the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.410 
part of Europe I would say although the
first<00:00:34.290> professional<00:00:34.829> teams<00:00:35.670> were<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.090> Italy
