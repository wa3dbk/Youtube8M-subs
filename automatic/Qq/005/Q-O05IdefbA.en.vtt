00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.500
 ah 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.010
 i 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.770
 but no 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.100
 many thanks 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.470
 when I am also super grateful 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.170
 with people like the last ligue 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.140
 that I wear the shirt add 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.850
 always for the team not only with 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.510
 liqui moly with rosemary cranes with cyclone 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.850
 with we generate with seve pertany with the 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.410
 group you sign with yokohama i want 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.200
 say against the people the companies that 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.090
 they support me they trust me here they are 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.430
 the results is for them for the 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.880
 equipment for my family was a manga 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.890
 difficult a hard race actually 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.710
 we must be trying to get rid of 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.110
 always the blows that are what we 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.220
 affected the first two dates 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.800
 we always had a good car 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.530
 first dates we had a little bit with bad 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.520
 lucky I always said that to win 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.340
 a race there are three factors 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.260
 fundamentals not machine man and luck 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.570
 if the three combine has a victory 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.460
 and that's what happened today follows 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.160
 celebrate we approach in the championship 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.650
 but we loaded 30 kilos that make the 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.750
 next date and dates ahead 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.500
 are much more difficult because we are going to 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.080
 have a heavier car 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.700
 then with communication training with 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.920
 the same effort that the 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.380
 mechanics continue well preparing the car 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.760
 and I 'm sure they're doing good 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.400
 little by little we are going to shorten the 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.690
 difference to cristian in the championship 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.270
 which is that it is the pointer that takes us 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.090
 almost 20 points yes yes, that's the 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.740
 specific case of the code and molly and 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.780
 yokohama 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.150
 that are not only sponsored but 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.220
 that we use products products are from 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.949
 first quality are those that allow us 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.810
 have results like these 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.910
 yokohama is a motorcycle brand is the 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.590
 monomarca because it 's the best and rim and 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.440
 we use liqui moly because 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.240
 we consider that oil is better and it is 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.490
 the oil that allows the car to 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.860
 have a good optimal performance 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.200
 cash that does not break that is not hot 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.050
 never 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.660
 then it helps you does the homework a 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.600
 little easier we go to highlight the 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.680
 pilots are very good teams the 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.550
 the cars are pretty good 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:31.070
 I had a hard time going to the first 5 cars 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:34.340
 that made ignacio wait a bit 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:37.250
 with the safety-car we reached it missing 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.540
 6 laps or so 7 you send me 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.040
 relate on the line requires not the 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.870
 braking but I still long I get a 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.110
 little to earth from there we had to 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:47.750
 regain that lost space 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:51.020
 we recovered with two laps missing and 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.690
 we were given the option of exceeding the 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.870
 end of the straight then without thinking 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:59.240
 they said this my opportunity here is thirst 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:02.030
 I've had a clean career I'm going 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.670
 with a car without collisions and without anything 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:07.550
 fix more than a couple of stickers per 

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.810
 there is unpainted and that's that is 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.670
 important I also have careers 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.670
 clean and with victories even better
