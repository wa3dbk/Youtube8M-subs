blow dry lotion to protect my hair from
the<00:00:30.330> heat<00:00:30.480> from<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.869> blow<00:00:31.140> dryer<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:32.099> when<00:00:32.250> it

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
the heat from this blow dryer so when it

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.310 
the heat from this blow dryer so when it
comes<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.969> blow-drying<00:00:33.450> my<00:00:33.540> hair<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.809> know<00:00:33.960> it's

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
comes to blow-drying my hair I know it's

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.650 
comes to blow-drying my hair I know it's
unhealthy<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.829> start<00:00:35.760> by<00:00:35.880> drying<00:00:36.149> when<00:00:36.540> it's

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
unhealthy to start by drying when it's

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.350 
unhealthy to start by drying when it's
wet<00:00:36.930> but<00:00:37.829> when<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.520> curly<00:00:38.879> hair<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.210> is

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
wet but when you have curly hair this is

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.610 
wet but when you have curly hair this is
kind<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.660> something<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.200> deal<00:00:40.410> with

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
kind of something you have to deal with

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.920 
kind of something you have to deal with
and<00:00:40.860> what<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.399> recommend<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:42.149> blow-drying<00:00:42.629> it

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
and what I recommend is blow-drying it

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.889 
and what I recommend is blow-drying it
straight<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.219> would<00:00:44.820> recommend<00:00:45.539> using<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
straight so I would recommend using a

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.569 
straight so I would recommend using a
brush<00:00:46.110> during<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.620> process<00:00:47.129> like<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.520> am

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
brush during this process like I am

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.580 
brush during this process like I am
doing<00:00:47.789> right<00:00:48.120> now<00:00:48.600> because<00:00:48.930> it'll<00:00:49.320> cut<00:00:49.559> down

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
doing right now because it'll cut down

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.880 
doing right now because it'll cut down
your<00:00:50.010> straightening<00:00:50.460> time<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.390> lot

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
your straightening time like a lot

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.189 
your straightening time like a lot
because<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.010> won't<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.219> as<00:00:53.460> many<00:00:53.579> like

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
because you won't have as many like

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.860 
because you won't have as many like
curly<00:00:55.199> Q's<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.739> your<00:00:55.890> hair<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:57.539> won't<00:00:57.719> be

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
curly Q's in your hair and it won't be

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.500

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
as thick of a mess and so this just cuts

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.360 
as thick of a mess and so this just cuts
down<00:01:00.719> my<00:01:01.109> blow-drying<00:01:01.530> time<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:02.129> our

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
this and in the long run you're using

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.820 
this and in the long run you're using
less<00:01:09.240> heat<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.260> kind<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.650> what

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
less heat so this is kind of just what

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.950 
less heat so this is kind of just what

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.510 
hair I find this helps a lot so here
you'll<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.659> see<00:01:33.869> me<00:01:34.049> sectioning<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.829> off<00:01:34.860> and

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
you'll just see me sectioning it off and

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.920 
you'll just see me sectioning it off and
I<00:01:35.579> probably<00:01:35.909> section<00:01:36.420> off<00:01:36.509> my<00:01:36.540> hair<00:01:36.689> at<00:01:36.869> least

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
I probably section off my hair at least

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.990 
I probably section off my hair at least
like<00:01:37.170> four<00:01:37.439> times<00:01:37.680> through<00:01:38.189> or<00:01:38.520> maybe<00:01:38.549> five

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
like four times through or maybe five

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.719 
like four times through or maybe five
and<00:01:39.689> before<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:39.990> strain<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.320> always<00:01:40.770> remember<00:01:41.490> to

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
and before I strain I always remember to

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.190 
and before I strain I always remember to
spray<00:01:42.090> my<00:01:42.240> hair<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:42.390> heat<00:01:42.600> protectant<00:01:43.110> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
spray my hair with heat protectant and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.230 
spray my hair with heat protectant and
then<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.220> strainer<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.670> am<00:01:44.909> using

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
then here is the strainer I am using

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.420 
then here is the strainer I am using
which<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.869> babble<00:01:46.320> Asst<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.399> I

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
which is just a babble Asst and so I

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.850 
which is just a babble Asst and so I
usually<00:01:47.670> go<00:01:47.970> once<00:01:48.270> over<00:01:48.689> really<00:01:49.140> slow<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.680> I

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
usually go once over really slow like I

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.800 
usually go once over really slow like I
am<00:01:49.979> doing<00:01:50.189> right<00:01:50.700> now<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.270> then<00:01:51.360> I'll<00:01:51.479> go<00:01:51.659> over

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
am doing right now and then I'll go over

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.020 
am doing right now and then I'll go over
maybe<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.439> twice<00:01:52.829> more<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.640> little<00:01:53.790> bit

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
maybe like twice more just a little bit

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.090 
maybe like twice more just a little bit
faster<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.780> I'm<00:01:55.350> pretty<00:01:55.560> much<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.009> be

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
faster so I'm pretty much going to be

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.050 
faster so I'm pretty much going to be
doing<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.460> throughout<00:01:56.790> my<00:01:57.000> entire<00:01:57.469> head<00:01:58.469> and

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
doing this throughout my entire head and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.609 
doing this throughout my entire head and
it<00:02:00.060> really<00:02:00.240> doesn't<00:02:00.479> take<00:02:00.659> me<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.020> long<00:02:01.079> it

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
it really doesn't take me that long it

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.200 
it really doesn't take me that long it
depends<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.369> know<00:02:02.520> how<00:02:02.850> good<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.180> job

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
depends on you know how good of a job

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.170 
depends on you know how good of a job
I'm<00:02:03.659> doing<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:05.100> think<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.700> time<00:02:05.939> it

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
I'm doing and so I think this time it

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.330 
I'm doing and so I think this time it
took<00:02:06.329> me<00:02:06.479> like<00:02:06.719> 20-ish<00:02:07.380> minutes<00:02:07.530> to

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
took me like 20-ish minutes to

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.640 
took me like 20-ish minutes to
straighten<00:02:08.700> my<00:02:08.819> hair<00:02:09.649> so<00:02:10.649> yeah

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
pretty much just going to be doing this

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.619 
pretty much just going to be doing this
through<00:02:13.120> my<00:02:13.659> entire<00:02:14.170> head<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:15.150> it's<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.569> know
