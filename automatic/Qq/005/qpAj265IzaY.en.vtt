tread<00:02:35.670> pattern<00:02:36.090> here<00:02:36.420> at<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:37.049> back<00:02:37.260> note<00:02:37.650> as

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
tread pattern here at the back note as

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.729 
tread pattern here at the back note as
well<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.340> they<00:02:38.459> have<00:02:38.489> holes<00:02:39.120> on<00:02:39.540> either<00:02:40.320> side

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
well that they have holes on either side

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.000 
well that they have holes on either side
and<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.150> allow<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.590> included<00:02:43.590> C

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
and this is to allow the included C

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.130 
and this is to allow the included C
clamps<00:02:44.459> remember<00:02:45.000> they<00:02:45.120> include<00:02:45.480> two<00:02:45.989> of

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
clamps remember they include two of

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.120 
clamps remember they include two of
these<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.620> they<00:02:47.549> simply<00:02:48.209> get<00:02:48.540> attached<00:02:49.130> to

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
these and they simply get attached to

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.270 
these and they simply get attached to
the<00:02:50.519> wheel<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:50.850> then<00:02:51.329> to<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.810> table<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.410> you

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
the wheel and then to the table that you

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.009 
the wheel and then to the table that you
are<00:02:53.610> mounting<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:54.150> on<00:02:54.269> I<00:02:54.299> think<00:02:54.420> it's

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
are mounting it on I think it's

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.229 
are mounting it on I think it's
important<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.590> have<00:02:55.769> clamps<00:02:56.310> like<00:02:56.549> this<00:02:56.850> to

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
important to have clamps like this to

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.720 
important to have clamps like this to
hold<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.840> into<00:02:57.989> place<00:02:58.260> but<00:02:58.739> they<00:02:59.040> also<00:02:59.250> have

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
hold it into place but they also have

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.479 
hold it into place but they also have
five<00:03:00.239> suction<00:03:01.019> cups<00:03:01.260> at<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.799> bottom<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.280> here

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
five suction cups at the bottom and here

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.120 
five suction cups at the bottom and here
are<00:03:02.610> those<00:03:02.790> quick<00:03:03.299> shifters<00:03:03.870> there's<00:03:04.410> one<00:03:04.739> on

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
are those quick shifters there's one on

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.860 
are those quick shifters there's one on
the<00:03:05.430> either<00:03:05.640> side<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.480> wheel<00:03:06.629> now

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
the either side of the wheel now

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.290 
the either side of the wheel now
thankfully<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:07.590> wheel<00:03:07.860> has<00:03:08.160> feedback<00:03:09.090> which

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
thankfully this wheel has feedback which

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.420 
thankfully this wheel has feedback which
I<00:03:09.420> think<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.900> crucial<00:03:10.379> in<00:03:10.860> a

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
I think is crucial in a

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.640 
I think is crucial in a
gaming<00:03:11.790> wheel<00:03:12.000> because<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.659> gives<00:03:13.019> you<00:03:13.260> that

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
gaming wheel because it gives you that

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.830 
gaming wheel because it gives you that
sensation<00:03:14.609> of<00:03:14.700> realism<00:03:15.239> now<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.689> is

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
sensation of realism now this is

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
large a heel rest here as you can see

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.309 
large a heel rest here as you can see
has<00:04:04.950> these<00:04:05.459> grooves<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.599> by<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.870> way<00:04:07.019> when

has these grooves and by the way when

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.050 
has these grooves and by the way when
you're<00:04:07.409> using<00:04:07.739> this<00:04:08.040> I<00:04:08.340> would<00:04:08.700> either<00:04:08.790> go

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
you're using this I would either go

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.110 
you're using this I would either go
barefoot<00:04:09.629> or<00:04:09.840> aware<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:11.099> know<00:04:11.219> shoes<00:04:11.700> or

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
barefoot or aware you know shoes or

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.360 
barefoot or aware you know shoes or
sneakers<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.569> have<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:13.139> nice<00:04:13.379> rubbery<00:04:13.980> bottom

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
sneakers that have a nice rubbery bottom

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.759 
sneakers that have a nice rubbery bottom
at<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.760> bottom<00:04:14.790> there<00:04:15.239> are<00:04:15.389> five<00:04:15.750> rubber<00:04:16.260> feet

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
at the bottom there are five rubber feet

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.250 
at the bottom there are five rubber feet
now<00:04:17.010> these<00:04:17.190> aren't<00:04:17.539> super<00:04:18.539> sticky<00:04:19.139> and

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
now these aren't super sticky and

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.409 
now these aren't super sticky and
they're<00:04:19.680> not<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:20.190> thick<00:04:20.609> but<00:04:20.970> they<00:04:21.120> should

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
they're not that thick but they should

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.040 
they're not that thick but they should
work<00:04:21.690> pretty<00:04:22.049> well<00:04:22.229> on<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.800> hard<00:04:23.580> surface

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
work pretty well on a hard surface

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.980 
work pretty well on a hard surface
however<00:04:25.050> on<00:04:25.349> a<00:04:25.380> soft<00:04:25.919> surface<00:04:26.460> like<00:04:27.150> carpet<00:04:27.780> I

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
however on a soft surface like carpet I

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.810 
however on a soft surface like carpet I
don't<00:04:28.409> think<00:04:28.650> this<00:04:28.800> is<00:04:28.860> going<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:29.370> work<00:04:29.400> too

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
don't think this is going to work too

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.149 
don't think this is going to work too
well<00:04:30.000> at<00:04:30.180> all<00:04:30.360> it's<00:04:30.659> probably<00:04:30.840> going<00:04:31.260> to<00:04:31.409> slide

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:32.159 
well at all it's probably going to slide

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:35.719 
well at all it's probably going to slide
all<00:04:32.460> over<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.419> place<00:04:33.710> what<00:04:34.710> if<00:04:35.310> they<00:04:35.520> have

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
all over the place what if they have

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.730 
all over the place what if they have
designed<00:04:36.150> something<00:04:36.510> to<00:04:36.690> flip<00:04:37.080> down<00:04:37.289> to<00:04:37.530> maybe

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
designed something to flip down to maybe
