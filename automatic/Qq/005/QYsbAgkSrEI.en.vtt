00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.150
 It's me 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.070
 hello friends how are you welcome to 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.320
 channel and good guys this time 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.259
 we are talking about the wild on the o 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.450
 final version people possibly know 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.520
 that in what was the grandfather 11 but I 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.830
 I think there are quite a few wheels for 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.380
 take out the worst, as the final version of 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.910
 the 0.12 point 1 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.830
 or maybe they throw what they will give for the 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:38.199
 0.13 points 0.1 and not because well said 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.570
 who are going to live together had published in 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:45.250
 twitter that they're going to launch something like 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:48.190
 that says things in 0.13 point 10.30 point 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.559
 0 come to throw things at us and that of that 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.640
 version will no longer throw anything 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.390
 possibly it could be that the version 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.610
 end will go to the 0.30 point 1 but that 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.520
 you do not know people with the naked eye could 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.710
 be it the 0.11 point 1 , but not 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.649
 he knows or it might be that another wheel comes out 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.539
 but I no longer believe and have achieved many 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.200
 bugs that had what is the version 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:12.970
 0.12 point 1 the truth I imagine that already 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.959
 are going to launch what now for the version 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.740
 end of 0.12 point 1 but did not 

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:20.200
 know people could 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.860
 is throw the to 0.13 point 1 because they are 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.540
 posting there is something confusing what 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.580
 they are doing because I do not know what is 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.040
 happening there he was talking about 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.439
 0.13 point 1 and then talk about the 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.610
 widgets and then you're not a little 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.720
 confused of that mind what are 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.399
 doing but do not know on Friday or 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.619
 Thursday, what will they see will come out 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.170
 next update could be the 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.409
 final version people from build 11 do not know 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.970
 It tastes very good but I know and I'm sure 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.820
 that is going to launch what it is about is the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.860
 final version people 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.870
 possibly we have challenged that a 3 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.910
 percent chance that it comes out 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.890
 the propel will 11 and 98 the 97 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.920
 percent is the one that is going to come out the version 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.170
 final because they are already enough wheels are 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.230
 enough things that an walker 9 drops 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.970
 the wheels anm has added things that 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.480
 may not know if the table was waiting for us 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.630
