00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hi everyone, it's cool and we're 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.390
 found today for a new 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.950
 black guard mission and today 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.380
 I decided that room is rather fun 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.929
 because to watch with what we are going 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.410
 attacking therefore terminals adier all 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.920
 simply grenadiers nursing more 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.150
 precisely I find it's a voice 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.279
 tired and troops that we do not use 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.850
 enough and yet it's super fun you 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.630
 Go see him 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.140
 good so I ate not guarantee the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.660
 huge success of this mission I think 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.149
 we're going to succeed but that's it 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.190
 loss that I could not know it I 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.020
 could not tell you but hey we're going 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.950
 test the garnet always read fun that 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.390
 fart from everywhere that's funny this point 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:53.539
 it's fun and so I have grenadiers from 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.520
 level 1 and number 2 4 6 8 10 13 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.020
 13 win a grenadier and three 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.539
 nursing is so today we're going 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:06.380
 to be interested in a new mission that 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:11.280
 so will be tic tic level 45 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.680
 and so that's what she sees there 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.720
 what's this name that's what she 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.090
 so looks like as usual 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.590
 the little novelties are the lans 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.580
 electro bomb 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.820
 we also have two rocket launchers and one 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.470
 super cannon so there actually 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.610
 grenadiers it's pretty complicated in all 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.020
 cases it will have to destroy the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.240
 rocket launcher that's for sure because 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.619
 otherwise I'm going to have too much of 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.880
 damage and I think it's mostly the 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.950
 the sniper tricks that will make me 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.820
 wrong because I remind you of them 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.540
 big huge planes really wear 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.250
 a huge reach but finally here is a 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.270
 and prevail but the sniper tricks 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.250
 the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.170
 happens to wait for them so here we go 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.270
 say roughly an equivalent scope 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:12.150
 to the radius of the sniper towers so the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:16.920
 tacc what we do my first if we do 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:19.739
 are we going to destroy rocket launches 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.790
 because that 's really what if I left 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.790
 what will do me the most damage 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.940
 here is the one shot with a barrage 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.940
 and we will take care of the super cannon 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.260
 yeah we have to because super 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:43.220
 cannon will do the one shot 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.220
 on the grenadiers otherwise and so then 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.140
 well we'll all land in the middle and I 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:57.180
 think that will have to use friezes 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:58.680
 the frieze wet our friends so here it's good 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.720
 we are always out of reach so there 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.220
 they are focusing the spear 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.870
 full one is doing the 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.650
 submachine gun the machine gun pardon 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:11.400
 behind ok so here we start having 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.380
 a focus what's good with the 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:19.850
 grenadiers so if you can see it 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:23.250
 is that they have the Canadians have so much 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:27.240
 when they have a defense a sight 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:31.380
 in fact are so awkward that 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.880
 eventually they manage to destroy everything 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.490
 what's around so that's it 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.970
 do that that's what's fun with 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.190
 Here they are that finally it's shaved 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.350
 really everything around 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.750
 and so here we see it finally there you 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.400
 see, we made a few little ones 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.420
 herds you good then there I have the 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.650
 throw the too long ones that pulls me 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.080
 but it's not bad I'm 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.230
 as I wanted to say I'm 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.820
 cleaning up behind that 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.040
 it is rather a good point here we are going to 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:06.019
 to shift by here we will avoid suddenly I 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.019
 think the side the left side 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.600
 that's started the troubles did not 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.300
 does little damage is good there he we 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:20.540
 not bored enormously you do not bother 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:22.700
 a lot we slow down just a little bit 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.780
 think it's going to do it well for 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.510
 the moment we have no losses 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.900
 rather well managed we will try to stay 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:39.820
 as far as possible out of range of the shots 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:39.820
 snipers here I go away so 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.600
 has a lunch left because there is a 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.490
 party that still makes a lot of 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.570
 damage here it is destroyed very well 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:56.530
 very good very well that's very good 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:59.290
 and so we have the electro launcher world that 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.160
 we shoot at it we'll get closer 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.160
 qg for 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.240
 I did not care is it was 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:16.360
 as close to one of a mortar in 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.330
 did kim lose 1 trimming his 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.380
 parents are things that happen 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.290
 obviously in fact if you have more than 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.460
 defense around who bores you 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.080
 get closer to your goal by 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.390
 the occurrence there the qg like that the 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.250
 Canadian actually does not shoot a grenade 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.580
 a little anywhere this month there as they 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:37.510
 are all ready in general now they have 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:40.960
 a rather short range of fire so 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.280
 here is the porous trick and so here is 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.640
 finally it happened with you in 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.890
 had with that it is longer it is 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.720
 true it's longer to attack but that 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.610
 it's fun too it's fun 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.070
 everywhere we are happy we are happy I 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.580
 a grenadier 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.840
 so here's the rewards 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.670
 a lot of wood otherwise the rest it's 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.110
 basic and we still have two 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.030
 fragments of life and a burst of life so 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:08.460
 that's pretty good reward 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:11.500
 so that's it for this mission that is 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.520
 ethics the level 45 who did not hesitate 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.980
 as usual to like and commented 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.030
 I wish you a good game I you 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:23.310
 say to the next for a new 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.310
 mission and greetings to all
