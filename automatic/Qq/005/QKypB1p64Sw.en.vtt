00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.520
 pickups or gamala that was playing 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.230

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.480
 did not play at home because 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.769
 the guys I did not find good and so I 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.939
 know them even well because I was 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.470
 that once so I do not know very much 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:16.110
 well it's a mythical stadium five years ago 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:18.299
 knew very since since redone the side 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.520
 difficult algae can not lose 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.750
 and so pau stadium Toulouse for the ca 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.270
 trù that's what it feels incredible 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.670

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.860
 in this English sports temple already his 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.840

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.780
 amazing when in addition we answer if 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.189
 you can not follow the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.540
 reasoning of the person speaking 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.240
 it's normal it's the moscato show 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.170
 draw your thomas specialist 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.060
 English rugby 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.060

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.229
 thomas way trait on the teams 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.460
 undefeated already that's I think I'm 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.080
 asks if there is another one in europe 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.149
 who is still unbeaten go on 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.100
 spoken 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.660
 and then here are regular finalists 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.300
 half finalists gp from England defeated 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.950
 by Toulon last year at the stage of 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.459
 semi-finals of the European Cup at 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.310
 twickenham two style oppositions a 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.650
 very methodical rugby built to 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.910
 the South African aso with vincent the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.290
 said a lot a lot of density 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.860
 physical a lot of commitment a 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.870
 big defense 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.610
 not necessarily a lot of show even 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.300
 if their game evolves a little since 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.440
 for a few months and a big fat 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.739
 big big test for Toulouse stadium 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.780
 after Toulon showed it to Clermont 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.280
 shown racing showed it they are 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.489
 winners are French clubs that 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.049
 are taxed and face them when they 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.030
 received in France but also there 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.700
 in England not in the context of 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.000
 wembley it's true but first big 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.010
 test 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.560
 after there is there is room for the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.640
 to do for Toulouse do not know it's 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.640
 more complete in terms of rugby
