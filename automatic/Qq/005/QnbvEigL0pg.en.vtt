about Rick and Morty now I have a real
quick<00:00:22.080> kind<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.470> short<00:00:22.740> theory<00:00:22.949> on<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.189> but<00:00:23.880> it

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
quick kind of short theory on it but it

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.160 
quick kind of short theory on it but it
makes<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.180> lot<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.330> sense<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:24.930> actually

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
makes a lot of sense and it's actually

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.390 
makes a lot of sense and it's actually
pretty<00:00:25.380> cool<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.890> think<00:00:26.070> about<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.340> so

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
pretty cool and you think about it so

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.980 
pretty cool and you think about it so
let's<00:00:26.519> go<00:00:26.580> ahead<00:00:26.699> jump<00:00:26.849> right<00:00:27.119> into<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
let's go ahead jump right into it the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.019 
let's go ahead jump right into it the
theory<00:00:28.170> says<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.680> Rick<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.099> smarter<00:00:29.789> because

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
theory says that Rick is smarter because

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.479 
theory says that Rick is smarter because
of<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> mega<00:00:30.869> trees<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.980> mega<00:00:32.189> seeds

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
of the mega trees and the mega seeds

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.700 
of the mega trees and the mega seeds
that's<00:00:33.329> what's<00:00:33.570> inside<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.050> his<00:00:34.140> flask<00:00:34.440> that's

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that's what's inside of his flask that's

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.170 
that's what's inside of his flask that's
all<00:00:34.800> he's<00:00:34.920> always<00:00:35.100> drinking<00:00:35.610> now<00:00:35.790> if<00:00:36.030> you're

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
all he's always drinking now if you're

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.610

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
and the mega seeds that are important to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.459 
and the mega seeds that are important to
Rick's<00:00:41.610> research<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.750> also<00:00:42.870> know<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.140> Rick

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
Rick's research we also know that Rick

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.560 
Rick's research we also know that Rick
has<00:00:43.649> used<00:00:44.010> them<00:00:44.280> for<00:00:44.309> quite<00:00:44.700> some<00:00:44.969> time<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.480> his

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
has used them for quite some time in his

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.770 
has used them for quite some time in his
past<00:00:45.930> now<00:00:46.379> also<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:47.070> see<00:00:47.340> when<00:00:47.910> Morty<00:00:48.420> was<00:00:48.570> on

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
past now also we see when Morty was on

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.750 
past now also we see when Morty was on
the<00:00:48.960> seeds<00:00:49.230> he<00:00:49.530> was<00:00:49.680> highly<00:00:50.039> intelligent<00:00:50.309> but

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
the seeds he was highly intelligent but

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.310 
the seeds he was highly intelligent but
when<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> effects<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> seeds<00:00:51.750> faded<00:00:52.170> he

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
when the effects of the seeds faded he

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.410 
when the effects of the seeds faded he
started<00:00:52.890> drooling<00:00:53.129> from<00:00:53.430> his<00:00:53.610> mouth<00:00:53.789> which<00:00:54.270> is

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
started drooling from his mouth which is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.020 
started drooling from his mouth which is
exactly<00:00:54.870> what<00:00:55.230> we<00:00:55.410> see<00:00:55.649> from<00:00:55.920> Rick<00:00:56.280> very<00:00:56.640> often

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
exactly what we see from Rick very often

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.549 
exactly what we see from Rick very often
he<00:00:57.149> always<00:00:57.329> has<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.750> big<00:00:58.020> long<00:00:58.289> line<00:00:58.500> of

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
he always has that big long line of

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.529 
he always has that big long line of
drool<00:00:58.949> from<00:00:59.100> his<00:00:59.280> mouth<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.820> all<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.359> kind

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
drool from his mouth and all that kind

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.470 
drool from his mouth and all that kind
of<00:01:00.600> weird<00:01:01.260> funny<00:01:01.680> stuff<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.280> think<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.120> Rick

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
of weird funny stuff I think that Rick

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.509 
of weird funny stuff I think that Rick
has<00:01:03.809> used<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.260> seeds<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.890> makes<00:01:05.250> some<00:01:05.430> kind

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
has used the seeds and makes some kind

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.550 
has used the seeds and makes some kind
of<00:01:05.640> super<00:01:06.119> juice<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.659> Hans's<00:01:07.080> his<00:01:07.229> brain

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
of super juice that Hans's his brain

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.530 
of super juice that Hans's his brain
function<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.280> then<00:01:08.670> he<00:01:08.760> mixes<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.299> with

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
function and then he mixes that with

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.560 
function and then he mixes that with
booze<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.520> inside<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.610> his<00:01:11.700> flask<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.420> that's

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
booze and inside of his flask and that's

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.420 
booze and inside of his flask and that's
what<00:01:12.720> he's<00:01:12.810> always<00:01:12.990> drinking<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.250> know

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
what he's always drinking as we know

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.090 
what he's always drinking as we know
Rick<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.600> course<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.020> raging<00:01:16.409> alcoholic<00:01:16.979> and

Rick is of course a raging alcoholic and
the<00:01:17.250> seed<00:01:17.490> juice<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.240> counteract<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the seed juice is just a counteract the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.440 
the seed juice is just a counteract the
booze<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.470> keep<00:01:19.710> his<00:01:19.920> head<00:01:20.189> level<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:21.299> also

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
booze and keep his head level it also

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.149
