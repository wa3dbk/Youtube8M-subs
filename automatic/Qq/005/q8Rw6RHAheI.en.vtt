crowd<00:00:52.620> source<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> great<00:00:53.760> design<00:00:54.239> that

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
crowd source is a great design that

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.810 
crowd source is a great design that
solves<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.440> problem<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.980> making<00:00:56.129> fermented

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
solves the problem of making fermented

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.240 
solves the problem of making fermented
vegetables<00:00:57.300> at<00:00:57.480> home<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:58.649> keeps<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
vegetables at home that keeps the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.740 
vegetables at home that keeps the
vegetables<00:00:59.730> submerged<00:01:00.210> underneath<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
vegetables submerged underneath the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.860 
vegetables submerged underneath the
brine<00:01:01.190> it<00:01:02.190> creates<00:01:02.579> an<00:01:02.730> airtight<00:01:03.210> seal<00:01:03.239> which

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
brine it creates an airtight seal which

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.310 
brine it creates an airtight seal which
means<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.619> carbon<00:01:05.040> dioxide<00:01:05.610> can<00:01:05.820> escape

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
means that the carbon dioxide can escape

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.780 
means that the carbon dioxide can escape
therefore<00:01:07.320> you'll<00:01:07.500> get<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.890> consistent<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
therefore you'll get a consistent and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.320 
therefore you'll get a consistent and
delicious<00:01:09.270> fermentation<00:01:09.900> time<00:01:10.110> after<00:01:10.470> time

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
delicious fermentation time after time

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.210 
delicious fermentation time after time
it's<00:01:11.660> really<00:01:11.810> easy<00:01:12.140> to<00:01:12.470> use<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.740> crowdsource
