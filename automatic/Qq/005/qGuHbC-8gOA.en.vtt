 3rd of the silicon stone that is important 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.770
 that he is saying his wrong thing 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:19.880
 It's now let's open here. 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.880
 calls this application expect to load 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.689
 while carrying that speech I do not know 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.820
 also that the channel is almost closed 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.659
 will expose a lot of time that does not enter 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.979
 channel 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.079
 After I went I killed my computer. 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.530
 as you can also see different 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.719
 things nothing of him then leaves it only for 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.920
 show that I'm still my little 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:45.500
 history of quidsi theta jazz has been giving 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.329
 so unknown that the trajectory but the 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.149
 program makes people stand a bet 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:55.009
 is good I recommend leaving this same 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.679
 ESP is installed and then after the 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.329
 I had the computer, I lost all 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.979
 things like my own 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.649
 channel entry if things do not then 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.739
 we saw in the channel also offers 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:10.819
 I was having problems on it but now 

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:12.110
 came back and you can restore everything and there 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.760
 I'm going to take a break so I will not be long. 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.280
 a lot here in the fast did not generate a 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.500
 pause is very fast 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.269
 ready now I came back after he 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.370
 Finish this notion here I did not have 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.470
 no assault was too fast and you 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.739
 finish installation here 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.760
 he wanted the icon closes automatically 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.769
 file then the game since the game already 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.660
 is ready for use and so I am 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.430
 Speaking of first no longer take this 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.410
 doing the pre-installation before 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.069
 uninstalling everything because sometimes 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.600
 gives 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.090
 was the first expulsion I think the game 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.700
 It's ready, I'll stop here. 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.840
 record opens the game and then burns 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.389
 I'll be right back 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.579
 before the game i clicked open it does 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:55.690
 O wrong here always allow 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.139
 access in the applications were 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.760

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.370
 these user stuff that he gets 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.049
 here you always close so I go 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.519
 squeeze so he'll open the game, I'll go 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:09.169
 after the recorder to give no problem 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:10.910
 Okay, I came back again, gesture that 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:12.829
 always knowing that I know I have 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.889
 that playing using the video here I'm going to 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.109
 record until the game starts but again 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:21.040
 make a contract you will accept now 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:25.740
 I think the game will start 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.080
 I do not know if the game 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.440
 I do not know the freight is recording the 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.440
 game 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.230
 I do not know if they are watching the game but he 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.440
 is running that starts the game with 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:50.430
 freights and recording now I do not know if 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:52.290

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.590

 bug were not our relationships but that 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:30.360
 This is where the player's target processes are 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:34.250
 God and it's here it has the commands 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.250
