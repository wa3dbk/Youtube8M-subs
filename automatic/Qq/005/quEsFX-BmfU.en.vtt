out<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.330> if<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.539> put<00:00:18.779> those<00:00:18.900> grammatical

out that if you put those grammatical
errors<00:00:19.740> together<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.640> can<00:00:20.789> actually<00:00:20.939> make<00:00:21.240> a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
errors together you can actually make a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.759 
errors together you can actually make a
full<00:00:21.539> sentence<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.080> says<00:00:22.260> my<00:00:22.439> name<00:00:22.470> is

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769

full sentence that says my name is
spring<00:00:23.039> trap<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.939> lot<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.269> people<00:00:24.420> were

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
spring trap and a lot of people were

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.929 
spring trap and a lot of people were
thinking<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.230> spring<00:00:25.769> trap<00:00:26.070> automatically

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
thinking that spring trap automatically

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.630 
thinking that spring trap automatically
meant<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.900> was<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.230> animatronics<00:00:29.160> named

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
meant that it was the animatronics named

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.830 
meant that it was the animatronics named
the<00:00:29.880> new<00:00:30.000> animatronic<00:00:30.480> right<00:00:30.570> we've<00:00:30.689> been

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
the new animatronic right we've been

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.600 
the new animatronic right we've been
singing<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.230> trailers<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.859> teasers

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
singing in the trailers and the teasers

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.790 
singing in the trailers and the teasers
it<00:00:32.850> was<00:00:33.059> named<00:00:33.510> spring-trap<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.770> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
it was named spring-trap and that is a

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.650 
it was named spring-trap and that is a
very<00:00:34.950> logical<00:00:35.219> answer<00:00:35.760> because<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.300> sentence

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
very logical answer because the sentence

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.299 
very logical answer because the sentence
does<00:00:36.840> actually<00:00:37.050> say<00:00:37.320> my<00:00:37.469> name<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.800> spring<00:00:38.070> trap

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
does actually say my name is spring trap

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.069 
does actually say my name is spring trap
and<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.969> actually<00:00:39.270> what<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.390> believed<00:00:39.809> to

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
and that is actually what I believed to

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.729 
and that is actually what I believed to
but<00:00:40.800> why<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.790> called<00:00:42.149> spring<00:00:42.690> trap<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.200> lot

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
but why is it called spring trap a lot

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.680 
but why is it called spring trap a lot
of<00:00:43.829> people<00:00:44.070> were<00:00:44.129> thinking<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.629> it<00:00:45.629> could

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
of people were thinking that it could

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.330 
of people were thinking that it could
possibly<00:00:45.960> resemble<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> fact<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
possibly resemble the fact that the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.670 
possibly resemble the fact that the
animatronic<00:00:47.940> could<00:00:48.180> attack<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.440> any<00:00:49.590> time

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
animatronic could attack you at any time

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.680 
animatronic could attack you at any time
or<00:00:49.920> be<00:00:50.190> very<00:00:50.460> fast<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.059> sneaky<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.539> could

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
or be very fast and sneaky and could

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.049 
or be very fast and sneaky and could
jump<00:00:52.289> up<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.010> any<00:00:53.309> time<00:00:53.399> like<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.760> quick

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
jump up on you and any time like a quick

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.479 
jump up on you and any time like a quick
spring<00:00:54.480> trap<00:00:54.780> or<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.469> could<00:00:55.739> attack<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.280> any

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
spring trap or it could attack at any

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.090 
spring trap or it could attack at any
time<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.690> it'd<00:00:57.899> be<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.320> unexpected<00:00:58.829> or

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
time and it'd be like unexpected or

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.700 
time and it'd be like unexpected or
something<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> spring<00:01:00.149> trap<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.480> well

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
something like a spring trap as well

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.799 
something like a spring trap as well
some<00:01:01.710> up<00:01:01.829> people<00:01:02.160> also<00:01:02.340> thought<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.809> it

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
some up people also thought that it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.080 
some up people also thought that it
could<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.530> staff<00:01:04.979> nickname<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.760> they<00:01:05.909> gave

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
could be a staff nickname that they gave

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.210 
could be a staff nickname that they gave
to<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.360> animatronic<00:01:07.080> as<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.619> they<00:01:07.799> did<00:01:08.010> to

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
to the animatronic as like they did to

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.250 
to the animatronic as like they did to
mingle<00:01:08.729> none<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.420> kids<00:01:09.570> actually<00:01:09.840> called

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
mingle none of the kids actually called

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.929 
mingle none of the kids actually called
him<00:01:10.470> mangle<00:01:10.860> his<00:01:11.070> name<00:01:11.280> was<00:01:11.430> supposed<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.850> be

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
him mangle his name was supposed to be

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.929 
him mangle his name was supposed to be
foxy<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.619> staff<00:01:13.950> actually<00:01:14.460> called<00:01:14.760> it

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
foxy but the staff actually called it

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.609 
foxy but the staff actually called it
mangled<00:01:15.479> because<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.900> was<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.320> know<00:01:16.350> all

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
mangled because it was you know all

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.679 
mangled because it was you know all
mangled<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.670> possibly<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> staff<00:01:18.479> could

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
mangled up so possibly the staff could

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.149 
mangled up so possibly the staff could
have<00:01:18.780> given<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> nickname<00:01:19.320> spring-trap

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
have given it the nickname spring-trap

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.830 
have given it the nickname spring-trap
but<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.670> wasn't<00:01:21.000> something<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.659> whole

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
but it wasn't something that the whole

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.690 
but it wasn't something that the whole
company<00:01:22.259> was<00:01:22.290> actually<00:01:22.619> promoting<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
company was actually promoting as the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.270 
company was actually promoting as the
animatronics<00:01:24.299> name<00:01:24.600> but<00:01:25.259> I'm<00:01:25.740> here<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.159> give

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
animatronics name but I'm here to give

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.190 
animatronics name but I'm here to give
you<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> few<00:01:26.790> ideas<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:27.420> why<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.600> actually<00:01:27.930> think

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
you a few ideas on why I actually think

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.170 
you a few ideas on why I actually think
it's<00:01:28.409> called<00:01:28.560> spring-trap<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.400> they're

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
it's called spring-trap and they're

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.940 
it's called spring-trap and they're
actually<00:01:30.420> pretty<00:01:30.840> obvious<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.619> set<00:01:31.829> out

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
actually pretty obvious and set out

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.359 
actually pretty obvious and set out
right<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.280> front<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.549> us<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.979> can't<00:01:35.250> really

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
right in front of us so you can't really

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.219 
right in front of us so you can't really
say<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.820> at<00:01:35.970> first<00:01:36.210> without<00:01:36.450> much<00:01:36.780> evidence

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
say this at first without much evidence

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.090 
say this at first without much evidence
because<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:37.680> aren't<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.950> lot<00:01:37.979> of

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
because there aren't a lot of

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.819 
because there aren't a lot of
screenshots<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.360> actually<00:01:39.720> show<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.229> but

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
screenshots that actually show this but

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.550 
screenshots that actually show this but
after<00:01:41.250> showing<00:01:41.579> us<00:01:41.909> pictures<00:01:42.720> from<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
after showing us pictures from the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.609 
after showing us pictures from the
multimedia<00:01:44.369> fusion<00:01:44.729> file<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.600> Scott<00:01:45.960> had

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
multimedia fusion file that Scott had

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.289 
multimedia fusion file that Scott had
for<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.250> troll<00:01:47.700> game<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.000> he<00:01:48.090> recently

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
for the troll game that he recently

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.270 
for the troll game that he recently
released<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.530> actually<00:01:49.680> see<00:01:49.890> some<00:01:50.159> very

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
released you can actually see some very

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.370 
released you can actually see some very
clear<00:01:50.640> pictures<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.420> spring<00:01:51.750> traps<00:01:52.049> mouth

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
clear pictures of spring traps mouth

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.399 
clear pictures of spring traps mouth
opened<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.159> stuff<00:01:54.030> without<00:01:54.149> static<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:54.990> if

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
opened and stuff without static so if

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.240 
opened and stuff without static so if
you<00:01:55.500> guys<00:01:55.590> don't<00:01:55.680> know<00:01:55.829> what<00:01:55.950> I'm<00:01:56.040> talking

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
you guys don't know what I'm talking

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.620 
you guys don't know what I'm talking
about<00:01:56.280> Scott<00:01:56.610> acted<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.119> he<00:01:57.299> was<00:01:57.450> actually

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
about Scott acted like he was actually

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.630 
about Scott acted like he was actually
hacked<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.200> released<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.619> troll<00:01:58.920> game<00:01:59.219> for<00:01:59.549> us

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
hacked and released a troll game for us

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.490 
hacked and released a troll game for us
but<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.000> main<00:02:00.210> menu<00:02:00.450> actually<00:02:00.990> looked<00:02:01.170> really

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
but the main menu actually looked really

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.649 
but the main menu actually looked really
cool<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.159> seemed<00:02:02.729> as<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.180> actually<00:02:03.360> had

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
cool and seemed as if it actually had

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.050 
cool and seemed as if it actually had
images<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.799> legitimate<00:02:05.310> animatronic

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
images of the legitimate animatronic

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.270 
images of the legitimate animatronic
which<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.450> call<00:02:06.659> spring-trap<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.250> he

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
which we call spring-trap and in it he

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.859 
which we call spring-trap and in it he
does<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.670> few<00:02:08.910> twitches<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.450> stuff<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:09.810> that

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
does a few twitches and stuff like that

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.229 
does a few twitches and stuff like that
giving<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.470> different<00:02:10.830> perspective<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:12.030> his

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
giving a different perspective of his

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.320 
giving a different perspective of his
mouth<00:02:12.450> and

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
mouth and

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.670 
mouth and
like<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.870> somebody<00:02:14.080> actually<00:02:14.290> open

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
like that and somebody actually open

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.350 
like that and somebody actually open
that<00:02:14.800> up<00:02:15.010> in<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.250> engine<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.700> Scott<00:02:15.970> used<00:02:16.240> to

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
that up in the engine that Scott used to

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.940 
that up in the engine that Scott used to
create<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.750> game<00:02:16.960> and<00:02:17.230> got<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.710> few

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
create the game and got a few

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.980 
create the game and got a few
screenshots<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.640> show<00:02:18.970> clear<00:02:19.330> images<00:02:19.810> of

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
screenshots that show clear images of

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.630 
screenshots that show clear images of
his<00:02:20.200> mouth<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:20.620> in<00:02:20.860> those<00:02:21.100> you<00:02:21.310> can<00:02:21.430> actually

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
his mouth and in those you can actually

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.790 
his mouth and in those you can actually
see<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:22.240> few<00:02:22.660> bolts<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.200> stuff<00:02:23.470> that<00:02:23.680> could

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
see a few bolts and stuff that could

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.190 
see a few bolts and stuff that could
relate<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.580> real-life<00:02:25.120> spring-trap<00:02:25.750> that's

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
relate to a real-life spring-trap that's

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.870 
relate to a real-life spring-trap that's
right<00:02:26.470> there<00:02:26.710> is<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.830> real-life<00:02:27.130> spring-trap

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
right there is a real-life spring-trap

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.090 
right there is a real-life spring-trap
inside<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.600> this<00:02:28.690> animatronics<00:02:29.290> mouth<00:02:29.470> like<00:02:30.010> I

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
inside of this animatronics mouth like I

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.680 
inside of this animatronics mouth like I
said<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.520> very<00:02:30.700> obvious<00:02:31.150> conclusion

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
said this is a very obvious conclusion

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.210 
said this is a very obvious conclusion
but<00:02:31.900> you<00:02:32.320> need<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.710> look<00:02:32.950> at<00:02:33.100> these

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
but you need to look at these

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.980 
but you need to look at these
screenshots<00:02:33.640> in<00:02:34.060> order<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.360> see<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.600> clearly

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
screenshots in order to see it clearly

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.540 
screenshots in order to see it clearly
it's<00:02:35.680> almost<00:02:35.860> going<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.100> be<00:02:36.190> doing<00:02:36.280> some

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
it's almost going to be doing some

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.890 
it's almost going to be doing some
comparisons<00:02:37.150> between<00:02:37.270> real-life

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
comparisons between real-life

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.320 
comparisons between real-life
screenshots<00:02:38.530> of<00:02:38.740> an<00:02:39.220> actual<00:02:39.520> spring-trap<00:02:40.090> and

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
screenshots of an actual spring-trap and

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.360 
screenshots of an actual spring-trap and
spring<00:02:41.080> traps<00:02:41.380> mouth<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:41.980> main<00:02:42.130> evidence

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
spring traps mouth and the main evidence

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.780 
spring traps mouth and the main evidence
is<00:02:42.820> that<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.870> job<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.650> spring<00:02:45.220> trap<00:02:45.460> actually

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
is that the job of spring trap actually

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.880 
is that the job of spring trap actually
has<00:02:45.910> two<00:02:46.210> little<00:02:46.390> bolts<00:02:46.690> like<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.380> real-life

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
has two little bolts like a real-life

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.790 
has two little bolts like a real-life
one<00:02:48.340> does<00:02:48.640> as<00:02:48.880> well<00:02:49.150> in<00:02:50.020> what<00:02:50.350> they<00:02:50.470> did<00:02:50.650> was

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
one does as well in what they did was

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.650 
one does as well in what they did was
actually<00:02:51.310> add<00:02:51.459> teeth<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.060> animatronic

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
actually add teeth to the animatronic

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.180 
actually add teeth to the animatronic
and<00:02:52.780> stuff<00:02:52.959> like<00:02:53.110> this<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.500> what<00:02:54.070> I'm

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
and stuff like this and what I'm

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.220 
and stuff like this and what I'm
thinking<00:02:54.640> is<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:54.790> this<00:02:55.150> was<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.420> very<00:02:55.810> very

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
thinking is that this was a very very

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.190 
thinking is that this was a very very
very<00:02:56.350> early<00:02:57.130> on<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.670> prototype<00:02:58.240> kind<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:58.990> thing

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
very early on a prototype kind of thing

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.130 
very early on a prototype kind of thing
of<00:02:59.410> an<00:02:59.620> animatronic<00:03:00.450> for<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.840> Freddy

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
of an animatronic for the Freddy

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.440 
of an animatronic for the Freddy
fazbear's<00:03:02.590> pizzeria<00:03:02.800> or<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.610> diner<00:03:04.180> or

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
fazbear's pizzeria or the diner or

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.420 
fazbear's pizzeria or the diner or
whatever<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:05.050> was<00:03:05.080> a<00:03:05.200> very<00:03:05.380> very<00:03:05.680> very<00:03:05.770> early

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
whatever it was a very very very early

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.350 
whatever it was a very very very early
on<00:03:06.459> animatronic<00:03:07.270> you<00:03:08.260> know<00:03:08.380> test<00:03:08.920> for<00:03:09.490> what

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
on animatronic you know test for what

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.730 
on animatronic you know test for what
what<00:03:10.510> they<00:03:10.630> were<00:03:10.720> trying<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.050> build<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.530> that

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
what they were trying to build and that

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.230 
what they were trying to build and that
is<00:03:11.860> why<00:03:11.980> they<00:03:12.130> actually<00:03:12.490> used<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:12.730> spring<00:03:13.030> trap

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
is why they actually used a spring trap

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.300 
is why they actually used a spring trap
instead<00:03:13.660> of<00:03:13.810> just<00:03:14.020> normal<00:03:14.440> stuff<00:03:14.560> like<00:03:14.920> they

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
instead of just normal stuff like they

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.770 
instead of just normal stuff like they
did<00:03:15.490> with<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.700> new<00:03:15.820> and<00:03:16.030> those<00:03:16.180> skeletons<00:03:16.630> and

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
did with the new and those skeletons and

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.390 
did with the new and those skeletons and
whatnot<00:03:17.140> they<00:03:17.320> obviously<00:03:17.500> made<00:03:17.920> improvements

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
whatnot they obviously made improvements

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.920 
whatnot they obviously made improvements
that<00:03:18.459> they<00:03:18.580> as<00:03:18.760> they<00:03:19.000> went<00:03:19.150> along<00:03:19.209> but<00:03:19.810> this

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
that they as they went along but this

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.360 
that they as they went along but this
was<00:03:20.110> one<00:03:20.260> of<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.410> first<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.920> this<00:03:21.040> was<00:03:21.160> one<00:03:21.250> of

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
was one of the first and this was one of

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.490 
was one of the first and this was one of
the<00:03:21.430> prototypes<00:03:22.000> for<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.900> animatronics<00:03:23.410> and

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
the prototypes for the animatronics and

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.500 
the prototypes for the animatronics and
that<00:03:23.650> is<00:03:23.739> why<00:03:23.860> he<00:03:24.130> has<00:03:24.160> an<00:03:24.640> actual<00:03:24.970> spring-trap

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
that is why he has an actual spring-trap

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.390 
that is why he has an actual spring-trap
as<00:03:25.720> its<00:03:26.320> mouth<00:03:26.500> instead<00:03:26.769> of<00:03:26.920> what<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.130> end<00:03:27.280> of

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
as its mouth instead of what the end of

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.400 
as its mouth instead of what the end of
skeletons<00:03:27.790> would<00:03:27.940> have<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:29.110> they<00:03:29.230> obviously

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
skeletons would have and they obviously

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.820 
skeletons would have and they obviously
didn't<00:03:30.040> use<00:03:30.190> much<00:03:30.400> of<00:03:30.459> him<00:03:30.790> but<00:03:31.690> you<00:03:32.500> know<00:03:32.620> it

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
didn't use much of him but you know it

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.650 
didn't use much of him but you know it
definitely<00:03:33.160> is<00:03:33.550> a<00:03:33.790> weird<00:03:34.090> theory<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.420> this<00:03:34.510> is

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
definitely is a weird theory and this is

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.390 
definitely is a weird theory and this is
could<00:03:34.810> also<00:03:34.959> be<00:03:35.200> you<00:03:35.590> know<00:03:35.680> why<00:03:35.890> he's<00:03:36.160> called

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
could also be you know why he's called

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.680 
could also be you know why he's called
spring-trap<00:03:36.820> this<00:03:36.970> could<00:03:37.090> be<00:03:37.180> why<00:03:37.360> his<00:03:37.540> name

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
spring-trap this could be why his name

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.090 
spring-trap this could be why his name
is<00:03:37.840> spring<00:03:38.050> trap<00:03:38.230> because<00:03:38.320> his<00:03:38.830> mouth

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
is spring trap because his mouth

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.009 
is spring trap because his mouth
actually<00:03:39.640> has<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.820> spring<00:03:40.180> trap<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.660> he<00:03:40.780> has

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
actually has a spring trap and he has

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.470 
actually has a spring trap and he has
some<00:03:41.620> features<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.430> what<00:03:42.910> a<00:03:42.940> spring<00:03:43.239> trap

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
some features of what a spring trap

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.020 
some features of what a spring trap
could<00:03:43.810> actually<00:03:44.739> do<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.580> few<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:45.880> my<00:03:46.000> ideas

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
could actually do and a few of my ideas

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.090 
could actually do and a few of my ideas
would<00:03:46.480> be<00:03:46.510> like<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:47.260> know<00:03:47.320> possibly<00:03:47.650> during

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
would be like you know possibly during

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.270 
would be like you know possibly during
his<00:03:48.430> um<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:49.360> know<00:03:49.480> jump<00:03:49.840> scare<00:03:50.160> he<00:03:51.160> actually

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
his um you know jump scare he actually

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.820 
his um you know jump scare he actually
opens<00:03:51.760> his<00:03:51.850> mouth<00:03:51.970> like<00:03:52.030> a<00:03:52.239> spring<00:03:53.080> trap<00:03:53.260> in<00:03:53.500> or

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
opens his mouth like a spring trap in or

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.040 
opens his mouth like a spring trap in or
he<00:03:54.340> could<00:03:54.550> lunch<00:03:55.090> at<00:03:55.239> your<00:03:55.360> face<00:03:55.600> and<00:03:55.780> chomp

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
he could lunch at your face and chomp

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.930 
he could lunch at your face and chomp
down<00:03:56.200> really<00:03:56.410> fast<00:03:56.680> like<00:03:57.100> a<00:03:57.400> spring<00:03:57.730> trap

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
down really fast like a spring trap

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.080 
down really fast like a spring trap
would<00:03:58.330> do<00:03:58.600> to<00:03:59.350> an<00:03:59.440> actual<00:03:59.590> animal<00:04:00.250> and<00:04:00.880> stuff

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
would do to an actual animal and stuff

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.250 
would do to an actual animal and stuff
like<00:04:01.209> that<00:04:01.269> so<00:04:01.510> I<00:04:01.540> just<00:04:01.780> think<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:01.989> was<00:04:02.200> a

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
like that so I just think it was a

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.930 
like that so I just think it was a
really<00:04:02.470> cool<00:04:02.709> thing<00:04:02.950> to<00:04:02.980> look<00:04:03.250> at<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:03.700> show

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
really cool thing to look at and show

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.720 
really cool thing to look at and show
you<00:04:04.180> guys<00:04:04.300> and<00:04:04.780> talk<00:04:04.959> about<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.920> why<00:04:06.459> it<00:04:06.519> is

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
you guys and talk about and why it is

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.490 
you guys and talk about and why it is
actually<00:04:07.269> called<00:04:07.480> spring-trap<00:04:08.050> in<00:04:08.230> that<00:04:08.350> it

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
actually called spring-trap in that it

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.070 
actually called spring-trap in that it
has<00:04:08.650> an<00:04:09.010> actual<00:04:09.640> spring-trap<00:04:10.390> inside<00:04:10.840> of<00:04:10.959> him

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
has an actual spring-trap inside of him

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.810 
has an actual spring-trap inside of him
I<00:04:11.230> think<00:04:11.590> it's<00:04:11.709> pretty<00:04:11.920> cool<00:04:12.160> to<00:04:12.220> look<00:04:12.580> at<00:04:12.700> it

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
I think it's pretty cool to look at it

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.449 
I think it's pretty cool to look at it
that<00:04:12.970> way<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.150> see<00:04:13.570> that<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:14.650> yeah<00:04:15.250> I<00:04:15.280> just

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
that way and see that and yeah I just

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.199 
that way and see that and yeah I just
wanna<00:04:15.580> hear<00:04:15.640> what<00:04:15.760> you<00:04:15.850> guys<00:04:15.940> think<00:04:16.090> the

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
wanna hear what you guys think the

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.250 
wanna hear what you guys think the
comment<00:04:16.419> section<00:04:16.630> below<00:04:16.690> tell<00:04:16.989> me<00:04:17.049> what<00:04:17.169> you

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
comment section below tell me what you

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.960 
comment section below tell me what you
guys<00:04:17.380> thought<00:04:17.650> I'm<00:04:17.830> the<00:04:17.950> theory<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.340> tell<00:04:18.910> me

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
guys thought I'm the theory and tell me

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.250 
guys thought I'm the theory and tell me
what<00:04:19.060> you<00:04:19.180> guys<00:04:19.299> thought<00:04:19.600> of<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.780> idea<00:04:19.810> of

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
what you guys thought of the idea of

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.449 
what you guys thought of the idea of
like<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.560> jump<00:04:20.799> scare<00:04:20.979> and<00:04:21.100> stuff<00:04:21.250> like<00:04:21.400> that

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
like the jump scare and stuff like that

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.490 
like the jump scare and stuff like that
but<00:04:22.450> other<00:04:22.630> than<00:04:22.780> that<00:04:22.840> I'm<00:04:23.110> taking<00:04:23.200> off<00:04:23.410> so

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
but other than that I'm taking off so

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.529 
but other than that I'm taking off so
you<00:04:23.590> guys<00:04:23.680> take<00:04:23.830> care<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:24.250> as<00:04:24.610> always<00:04:24.729> have<00:04:25.510> a

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
you guys take care and as always have a

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.020 
you guys take care and as always have a
great<00:04:25.660> day
