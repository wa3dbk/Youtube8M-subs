00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.859
 Hey, you can play somewhere else please 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.960
 do not expect me 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:34.430
 the game is over now always this 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.809
 children but now calm came back 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.850
 I believe my housekeeper wife 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.040
 Butcher does not have a good day today 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.230
 why did she give you that? 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.090
 taken away ball 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.340
 it says we are too loud and that here 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.270
 do not want to play her wife mosquito one 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.239
 wipe out 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.800
 Then you come into my laboratory in 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.420
 fantastic institute 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.940
 I have an idea or big ball 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.040
 Although gone, but I'll show you one 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.170
 make great rubber easily yourself 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.390
 you have the desire to produce 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.090
 we need our super flummis 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:21.450
 following utensils lukewarm water 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.210
 Bastl cement 20 grams of Epsom salt or 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.860
 also called magnesium sulfate that 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.430
 you get in the pharmacy or in the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.670
 Baumarkt two small bowls some 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.549
 sheets of kitchen paper and 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.560
 Food coloring is given first 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.990
 make a tablespoon stick one of the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.880
 then both bowls give her 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.040
 a few more drops of food coloring 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.560
 Add and stir the scutum into the second 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.899
 peel comes about 1 tablespoon of bittersalt 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.180
 then two tablespoons lukewarm 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.479
 add water and also this peel 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.399
 stir well now give it to the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.500
 dyed bastl glue into the dish with 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.000
 the butter is salt mixed and mixed 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.790
 both good with each other 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.920
 what he needs now is kitchen paper 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.349
 Take five leaves and put them on 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.260
 the table and now carefully pour the 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.730
 mix on it 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.950
 The kitchen paper now sucks that 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.960
 excess water remains on the back 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.770
 after a few minutes one will wait 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.150
 sticky mass from this mass can 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.810
 now with your hands a rubber 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.090
 to form 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.670
 no fear the crowd you can calm 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.870
 touch 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.280
 then load the usual rubber 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.350
 Dry for about 15 minutes 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.020
 you already have your own rubber 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.020
 made times skipped and tried 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.500
 what inside the sticky rubber mass 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.300
 we'll take a closer look 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.890
 on 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.320
 Bastl glue contains long chains 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.450
 so-called plastic molecule this 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.790
 molecules have many 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.130
 connection points provides bittersalt 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.670
 for that more and more 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.330
 connecting points with others 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.820
 link 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.220
 so arises from long chains 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:15.150
 and after a charred mess 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:16.799
 a blummi how high that blows up how often 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.260
 I have to say it anyway 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.670
 that they should not play here 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.670
 I expect to catch the ball, too 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.330
 the little rackers have me there completely 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.330
 brought out of breath 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.010
 or fast repetition 21 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.190
 the little rabauken we have 9 ball 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:07.380
 to forget 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:10.830
 Now he's part of me, why is he jumping? 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.209
 this stupid both do not have haha there 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.040
 but we are clean from the weather 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.690
 put that the rubber no longer 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.720
 Jump is due to the chemical reaction 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.930
 inside the gum mass this goes 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.970
 namely infinitely in the 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.250
 chemical reaction is about 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.930
 a so-called endless reaction 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.880
 that is, bittersalt does not just work 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.260
 but again and again that yourself 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.250
 the chains more and more together 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.710
 connect 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.780
 after about two to three hours is the 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.300
 completely rubbery and has his 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.830
 lost the power to try 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.080
 once even from a rubber 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.200
 make 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.200
 bye and have fun professor proto
