deal with a pedo marker you tend to

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.970 
deal with a pedo marker you tend to
think<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.750> little<00:02:14.840> bit<00:02:15.019> more<00:02:15.260> about<00:02:15.500> what<00:02:15.769> it<00:02:15.860> is

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
you're doing tend to be a little bit

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.880 
you're doing tend to be a little bit
more<00:02:17.540> conscious<00:02:17.870> about<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.409> lines<00:02:18.620> you're

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
more conscious about the lines you're

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.589 
more conscious about the lines you're
making<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.370> why<00:02:19.519> you're<00:02:19.700> making<00:02:19.849> them<00:02:20.209> so<00:02:20.480> now

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
making and why you're making them so now

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.509 
making and why you're making them so now

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
when you're doing your tag you see why

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.039 
when you're doing your tag you see why
it<00:02:22.580> is<00:02:22.819> you<00:02:23.000> did<00:02:23.180> this<00:02:23.299> line<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.629> way<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.810> did

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
it is you did this line the way you did

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.600 
it is you did this line the way you did
it<00:02:24.170> instead<00:02:24.470> of<00:02:24.560> doing<00:02:24.739> it<00:02:24.799> with<00:02:24.860> pencil<00:02:25.220> and

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
it instead of doing it with pencil and

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.520 
it instead of doing it with pencil and
you're<00:02:25.730> just<00:02:25.909> like<00:02:26.030> ah<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:27.019> then<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.319> get<00:02:27.409> to

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
you're just like ah and then you get to

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.930 
you're just like ah and then you get to
erase<00:02:27.739> whatever<00:02:28.010> mistakes<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.459> make<00:02:28.610> moving
