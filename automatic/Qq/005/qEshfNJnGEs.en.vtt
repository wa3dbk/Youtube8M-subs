00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
it looks really weird it's like you can

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.780 
it looks really weird it's like you can
just<00:02:00.540> tell<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:00.960> about<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.259> fall<00:02:01.290> off<00:02:01.790> while

it<00:02:03.899> looks<00:02:04.200> snug<00:02:04.500> but<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.890> just<00:02:05.070> feels<00:02:05.250> like

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
it looks snug but it just feels like

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.950 
it looks snug but it just feels like
it's<00:02:05.579> about<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.880> fall<00:02:05.909> off<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:06.750> just

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
it's about to fall off and it's just

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.339 
it's about to fall off and it's just
really<00:02:07.229> stiff<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.129> know<00:02:08.250> what<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.429> mean<00:02:08.700> and
