is important that the teats be long

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.770 
is important that the teats be long
enough<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.830> can<00:02:25.980> hand<00:02:26.250> milk<00:02:26.570> because<00:02:27.570> if

enough that you can hand milk because if

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.470 
enough that you can hand milk because if
