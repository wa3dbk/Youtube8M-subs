00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello to all this time I bring you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.710
 how to make some cute cat ears 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.330
 for a fast costume for halloween 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.120
 we need a small piece of felt 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.790
 black 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.390
 very sharp scissors or that are 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.849
 Special for cutting black thread cloth or 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.200
 needle or if you want you can do it with 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.630
 silicon as you prefer 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.070
 and a black headband or a headband that 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.190
 until the color does better with the color 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.230
 of your hair the first thing I did was in 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.240
 a white sheet trace more or less the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.520
 shape and the size that I want to give to my 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.810
 Now I'm going to square it a little bit 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.650
 with a rule 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.650
 Y 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.950
 since I have the design done now I'm going to 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.950
 cut out my mold 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.510
 now we are going to pass the design that 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.730
 we did previously from the little ear with 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.730
 help of a hit to the black felt 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.630
 and we cut everything very carefully 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 and 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.090
 I forgot to mention it we need four 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.920
 pentagons in total to form the two 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.930
 ears 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.000
 now let's sew or stick the ears 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.820
 the parts of the nurse that are 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.830
 drawn with hits should be in the 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.050
 external faces to be able to sew 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.040
 correctly in this way when giving 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.780
 striped back and just will not be going to 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.500
 paste where I indicate with the lines 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.900
 rositas 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.700
 they are already cooked here and I already turned it 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.080
 the fabric tries to make it look more 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.020
 right possible 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.470
 now we're just going to stick it to our 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.470
 diadem 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.990
 I lazcoz and in this way first 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.770
 passing the thread down without pulling 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.200
 a lot and coming back a little more 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:45.150
 ahead of where the thread follows me 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.150
 in this way as in zig zag 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.980
 above you come back and down below 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.939
 care when inserting the needle or you 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.939
 you can explain a little finger 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.930
 trim the excess fabric 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.290
 so 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.110
 and ready 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.240
 to comb, I'm going to divide a section of 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.510
 my hair and I'm going to do it to the 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.660
 in front of me then I will place my 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.430
 headband and I'm going to return this part of the 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.130
 hair towards the back to 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.830
 cover the headband I hope you have 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.870

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.420
 a like 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.209
 wait for the next few days 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.129
 continuation of this video I send you a 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.129
 kiss we see you very soon 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.500
 no no no 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.790

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.790
