00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.860 

I<00:04:05.650> don't<00:04:06.650> know<00:04:06.739> I<00:04:06.769> guess<00:04:07.010> it<00:04:07.569> probably<00:04:08.569> like<00:04:08.840> a

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
I don't know I guess it probably like a

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.569 
I don't know I guess it probably like a
really<00:04:09.219> default<00:04:10.219> looking<00:04:10.790> color<00:04:11.150> type<00:04:11.599> dealio

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
really default looking color type dealio

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.849 
really default looking color type dealio
but<00:04:13.579> I<00:04:13.879> guess<00:04:14.090> we'll<00:04:14.510> just<00:04:14.540> have<00:04:14.930> to<00:04:15.560> leave<00:04:15.739> it

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:17.349 
but I guess we'll just have to leave it
alone<00:04:15.950> i<00:04:16.130> guess<00:04:16.519> you<00:04:16.669> could<00:04:16.789> just<00:04:16.910> select<00:04:17.180> the

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
just choose you know make it the colors

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.450 
just choose you know make it the colors
the<00:04:23.750> way<00:04:23.990> you<00:04:24.050> want<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.560> it's<00:04:25.220> more
