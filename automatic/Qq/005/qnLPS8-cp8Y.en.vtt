reminds<00:02:13.530> me<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.709> an<00:02:13.830> older<00:02:14.160> space<00:02:14.489> game<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.879> used

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
reminds me of an older space game I used

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.789 
reminds me of an older space game I used
to<00:02:15.120> play<00:02:15.180> called<00:02:15.720> gratuitous<00:02:16.470> space<00:02:16.620> battles

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
to play called gratuitous space battles

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.039 
to play called gratuitous space battles
where<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.879> kind<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.209> just<00:02:18.390> fit<00:02:18.629> your<00:02:18.780> ship

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
where you kind of just fit your ship

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.960 
where you kind of just fit your ship
with<00:02:19.230> different<00:02:19.560> weapons<00:02:19.709> systems<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.580> then

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
with different weapons systems and then

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.369 
with different weapons systems and then
just<00:02:21.150> throw<00:02:21.450> them<00:02:21.540> at<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.720> enemy<00:02:22.049> and<00:02:22.170> hope

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
just throw them at the enemy and hope

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.710 
just throw them at the enemy and hope
for<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.620> best<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:23.519> has<00:02:23.760> kind<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.239> like<00:02:24.480> that

so as you go through the game as you'd

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.180 
of the money you earn after you complete
a<00:03:10.340> mission<00:03:10.640> as<00:03:10.940> I'm<00:03:11.870> sure<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:12.290> can<00:03:12.440> imagine<00:03:12.530> as

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
a mission as I'm sure you can imagine as

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.520 
a mission as I'm sure you can imagine as
you<00:03:13.400> progress<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.970> game<00:03:14.209> you<00:03:14.510> get<00:03:14.690> bigger<00:03:15.110> and

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
you progress the game you get bigger and

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.500 
you progress the game you get bigger and
more<00:03:15.709> elaborate<00:03:16.250> holes<00:03:16.549> to<00:03:16.819> work<00:03:17.000> with<00:03:17.209> and

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
more elaborate holes to work with and

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.600 
more elaborate holes to work with and
more<00:03:17.780> powerful<00:03:18.140> weapon<00:03:18.590> systems<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.250> of

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
more powerful weapon systems and of

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.670 
more powerful weapon systems and of
course<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.030> game<00:03:20.239> gets<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.780> little<00:03:21.140> bit<00:03:21.319> harder

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
course the game gets a little bit harder

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.610 
course the game gets a little bit harder
as<00:03:21.860> you<00:03:21.890> make<00:03:22.220> progress<00:03:22.489> in<00:03:23.440> some<00:03:24.440> of<00:03:24.560> the

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
as you make progress in some of the

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.320 
as you make progress in some of the
later<00:03:24.830> missions<00:03:25.099> you<00:03:25.430> have<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:25.760> be<00:03:25.880> kind<00:03:26.120> of

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
later missions you have to be kind of

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.420 
later missions you have to be kind of
mindful<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.230> type<00:03:27.590> of<00:03:27.620> cargo<00:03:28.190> you're

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
mindful of the type of cargo you're

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.180 
mindful of the type of cargo you're
carrying<00:03:28.940> as<00:03:29.120> if<00:03:29.840> they<00:03:30.230> get<00:03:30.440> destroyed<00:03:30.890> they

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
carrying as if they get destroyed they

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.339 
carrying as if they get destroyed they
can<00:03:31.370> damage<00:03:31.819> different<00:03:32.269> modules<00:03:32.750> all<00:03:32.959> around

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
can damage different modules all around

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.949 
can damage different modules all around
it<00:03:33.530> so<00:03:34.010> if<00:03:34.250> you<00:03:34.430> place<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:35.090> certain<00:03:35.720> type<00:03:35.930> of

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
it so if you place a certain type of

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.170 
it so if you place a certain type of
cargo<00:03:36.590> like<00:03:36.860> this<00:03:37.069> nuclear<00:03:37.519> waste<00:03:37.819> in<00:03:38.120> the

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
cargo like this nuclear waste in the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.690 
cargo like this nuclear waste in the
middle<00:03:38.810> of<00:03:38.959> a<00:03:39.110> whole<00:03:39.440> array<00:03:39.709> of<00:03:39.920> weapons<00:03:40.459> and

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
middle of a whole array of weapons and

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.490 
middle of a whole array of weapons and
shield<00:03:41.000> generators<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.720> power<00:03:41.870> generators

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
shield generators and power generators

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.009 
shield generators and power generators
and<00:03:42.709> it<00:03:43.069> happens<00:03:43.489> to<00:03:43.700> explode<00:03:44.269> it<00:03:44.630> will

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
and it happens to explode it will

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.229 
and it happens to explode it will
destroy<00:03:45.530> that<00:03:45.890> entire<00:03:46.340> section<00:03:46.940> of<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.209> ship

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
destroy that entire section of the ship

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.539 
destroy that entire section of the ship
so<00:03:48.049> that<00:03:48.440> kind<00:03:48.620> of<00:03:48.739> stuff<00:03:48.980> is<00:03:49.130> something<00:03:49.459> you

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
so that kind of stuff is something you

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.610 
so that kind of stuff is something you
have<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.760> be<00:03:50.030> mindful<00:03:50.660> when<00:03:51.049> you<00:03:51.200> play<00:03:51.410> through

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
have to be mindful when you play through

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.440 
have to be mindful when you play through
some<00:03:51.799> of<00:03:51.890> these<00:03:51.950> missions<00:03:52.329> essentially<00:03:53.329> it

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
some of these missions essentially it

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.630 
some of these missions essentially it
just<00:03:53.660> adds<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:54.200> level<00:03:54.470> of<00:03:54.739> challenge<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.609> the

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
just adds a level of challenge to the

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.240 
just adds a level of challenge to the
game<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:56.480> kind<00:03:56.870> of<00:03:56.900> like<00:03:57.079> it<00:03:57.109> so<00:03:57.799> another

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
game and I kind of like it so another

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.830 
game and I kind of like it so another
thing<00:03:58.370> that<00:03:58.790> can<00:03:58.910> happen<00:03:58.940> as<00:03:59.450> you're

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
thing that can happen as you're

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.890 
thing that can happen as you're
traveling<00:04:00.380> through<00:04:00.709> your<00:04:01.340> little<00:04:01.760> route<00:04:02.510> here

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
traveling through your little route here

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.979 
traveling through your little route here
is<00:04:03.109> you<00:04:03.590> can<00:04:03.859> get<00:04:04.069> hit<00:04:04.400> by<00:04:04.790> asteroids<00:04:05.540> and<00:04:05.840> it

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
is you can get hit by asteroids and it

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.080 
is you can get hit by asteroids and it
can<00:04:06.140> actually<00:04:06.319> break<00:04:06.799> sections<00:04:07.400> of<00:04:07.640> your<00:04:07.819> ship

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
can actually break sections of your ship

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.930 
can actually break sections of your ship
off<00:04:08.269> rendering<00:04:09.019> it<00:04:09.350> no<00:04:09.530> longer<00:04:09.739> functional<00:04:10.459> so

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
off rendering it no longer functional so

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.400 
off rendering it no longer functional so
you<00:04:10.970> especially<00:04:11.600> want<00:04:11.900> to<00:04:12.019> be<00:04:12.139> kind<00:04:12.319> of

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
you especially want to be kind of

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.559 
you especially want to be kind of
mindful<00:04:12.829> of<00:04:12.889> these<00:04:13.069> things<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.970> prevent<00:04:14.359> this

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
mindful of these things to prevent this

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.719 
mindful of these things to prevent this
from<00:04:14.630> happening<00:04:14.920> otherwise<00:04:15.920> it<00:04:16.220> may<00:04:16.370> make<00:04:16.609> the

rest<00:04:16.940> of<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.120> mission<00:04:17.269> kind<00:04:17.630> of<00:04:17.750> tough<00:04:17.959> but

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
rest of the mission kind of tough but

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.640 
rest of the mission kind of tough but
that's<00:04:18.620> part<00:04:18.859> of<00:04:18.889> the<00:04:19.010> fun<00:04:19.039> as<00:04:19.870> you<00:04:20.870> unlock<00:04:21.079> new

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
that's part of the fun as you unlock new

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.680 
that's part of the fun as you unlock new
modules<00:04:22.550> in<00:04:22.789> the<00:04:22.880> tech<00:04:23.090> tree<00:04:23.360> you<00:04:23.539> can

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
modules in the tech tree you can

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.300 
modules in the tech tree you can
actually<00:04:23.870> choose<00:04:24.289> to<00:04:24.590> spend<00:04:24.889> some<00:04:25.160> of<00:04:25.190> your

I<00:04:31.669> could<00:04:31.729> click<00:04:32.360> on<00:04:32.539> my<00:04:32.720> engine<00:04:33.139> right<00:04:33.320> now<00:04:33.530> and

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
I could click on my engine right now and

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.159 
I could click on my engine right now and
tell<00:04:34.610> it<00:04:34.760> to<00:04:34.970> just<00:04:35.330> kind<00:04:35.510> of<00:04:35.570> strategically

tell it to just kind of strategically
slow<00:04:36.500> down<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:37.100> it'll<00:04:37.460> spit<00:04:37.789> out<00:04:37.880> 50<00:04:38.270> gears<00:04:38.570> to

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
slow down and it'll spit out 50 gears to

into<00:04:43.460> my<00:04:43.580> shield<00:04:43.880> generator<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.570> give<00:04:44.960> it<00:04:45.080> the

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
into my shield generator and give it the

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.560 
into my shield generator and give it the
ability<00:04:45.260> to<00:04:45.710> quickly<00:04:45.979> recharge<00:04:46.639> itself<00:04:47.000> this

ability to quickly recharge itself this

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.230 
ability to quickly recharge itself this
can<00:04:47.840> give<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:48.260> game<00:04:48.470> a<00:04:48.770> tactical<00:04:49.580> element<00:04:49.789> and

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
can give the game a tactical element and

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.010 
can give the game a tactical element and
it<00:04:50.360> can<00:04:50.510> be<00:04:50.539> really

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
it can be really

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.809 
it can be really
helpful<00:04:51.440> in<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.830> later<00:04:52.039> parts<00:04:52.400> when<00:04:52.580> things

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:52.819 
helpful in the later parts when things

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.820 
helpful in the later parts when things
get<00:04:53.000> a<00:04:53.240> little<00:04:53.569> more<00:04:53.750> tough<00:04:53.990> so<00:04:54.289> in<00:04:54.530> the

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
get a little more tough so in the

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.439 
get a little more tough so in the
beginning<00:04:54.949> you'll<00:04:55.340> encounter<00:04:55.610> small<00:04:56.000> fighter

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
beginning you'll encounter small fighter

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.200 
beginning you'll encounter small fighter
squadrons<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:57.470> asteroids<00:04:57.979> but<00:04:58.460> later<00:04:58.669> on<00:04:58.759> as

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
squadrons and asteroids but later on as

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.969 
squadrons and asteroids but later on as
you<00:04:59.449> see<00:04:59.659> recently<00:05:00.319> we're<00:05:00.710> encountering

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
you see recently we're encountering

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.339 
you see recently we're encountering
shifts<00:05:01.699> and<00:05:01.849> they<00:05:02.270> have<00:05:02.449> weapons<00:05:02.659> systems<00:05:03.139> and

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349 
shifts and they have weapons systems and

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:05.080 
shifts and they have weapons systems and
they'll<00:05:03.470> fight<00:05:03.710> back<00:05:03.979> and<00:05:04.250> it<00:05:04.610> just<00:05:04.639> becomes

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
they'll fight back and it just becomes

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.969 
they'll fight back and it just becomes
harder<00:05:05.539> and<00:05:05.569> more<00:05:06.020> challenging<00:05:06.560> and<00:05:06.680> it's

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
harder and more challenging and it's

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.210 
harder and more challenging and it's
part<00:05:07.250> of<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.370> fun<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:07.669> charm<00:05:07.940> of<00:05:08.150> this<00:05:08.330> game

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
part of the fun and charm of this game

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.529 
part of the fun and charm of this game
looking<00:05:10.220> through<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.520> options<00:05:10.669> menu<00:05:11.210> it

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
looking through the options menu it

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:12.999 
looking through the options menu it
looks<00:05:11.720> like<00:05:11.900> there<00:05:12.080> is<00:05:12.319> a<00:05:12.349> couple<00:05:12.860> different

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
looks like there is a couple different

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.850 
looks like there is a couple different
control<00:05:13.639> methods<00:05:14.060> for<00:05:14.210> this<00:05:14.360> game<00:05:14.569> I<00:05:14.930> highly

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
control methods for this game I highly

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.249 
control methods for this game I highly
recommend<00:05:16.159> using<00:05:16.879> the<00:05:17.270> mouse<00:05:17.629> and<00:05:18.020> keyboard

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
recommend using the mouse and keyboard

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.740 
recommend using the mouse and keyboard
as<00:05:18.800> it<00:05:19.310> seems<00:05:19.610> like<00:05:19.759> you<00:05:19.940> need<00:05:20.210> a<00:05:20.270> little<00:05:20.569> bit

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
as it seems like you need a little bit

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.600 
as it seems like you need a little bit
of<00:05:20.780> finesse<00:05:21.199> and<00:05:21.470> it<00:05:21.770> allows<00:05:22.009> you<00:05:22.220> to<00:05:22.400> quickly

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
of finesse and it allows you to quickly

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.189 
of finesse and it allows you to quickly
move<00:05:22.940> your<00:05:23.090> mouse<00:05:23.240> around<00:05:23.270> and<00:05:23.750> collect<00:05:24.080> the

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
move your mouse around and collect the

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.110 
move your mouse around and collect the
little<00:05:24.560> gears<00:05:24.830> as<00:05:25.099> you<00:05:25.370> destroy<00:05:25.729> different

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
little gears as you destroy different

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.360 
little gears as you destroy different
modules<00:05:26.509> on<00:05:26.720> different<00:05:27.110> ships<00:05:27.500> or<00:05:27.800> full<00:05:28.280> of

ship playing with a gamepad seems like

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.689 
ship playing with a gamepad seems like
it<00:05:35.780> would<00:05:35.870> be<00:05:35.930> overly<00:05:36.800> complicated<00:05:37.370> I<00:05:37.550> don't

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
it would be overly complicated I don't

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:38.800 
it would be overly complicated I don't
know<00:05:37.819> if<00:05:37.909> you<00:05:37.970> can<00:05:38.090> actually<00:05:38.360> play<00:05:38.539> this<00:05:38.659> with

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
know if you can actually play this with

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.909 
know if you can actually play this with
a<00:05:38.870> gamepad<00:05:39.880> we<00:05:40.880> did<00:05:41.150> it<00:05:41.270> again<00:05:41.389> captain<00:05:42.020> we<00:05:42.650> are
