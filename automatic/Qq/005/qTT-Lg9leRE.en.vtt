worst<00:02:10.489> it<00:02:10.789> will<00:02:10.940> be<00:02:11.060> longer<00:02:11.510> than<00:02:11.630> you<00:02:11.780> want

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
worst it will be longer than you want

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.570 
worst it will be longer than you want
and<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.260> can<00:02:12.290> always<00:02:12.560> go<00:02:12.830> back<00:02:12.860> through<00:02:13.280> and

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
and you can always go back through and

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.449 
and you can always go back through and
trim<00:02:13.880> that<00:02:14.060> up<00:02:14.680> we're<00:02:15.680> going<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.950> cut<00:02:16.250> along

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
trim that up we're going to cut along

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.600 
trim that up we're going to cut along
the<00:02:16.790> template<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.750> very<00:02:17.959> short<00:02:18.610> deliberate

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
the template and very short deliberate

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.229 
the template and very short deliberate
motions<00:02:24.459> we're<00:02:25.459> going<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.760> make<00:02:25.970> sure<00:02:26.209> that

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
motions we're going to make sure that

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:32.559 
motions we're going to make sure that
that<00:02:26.690> hair<00:02:26.989> is<00:02:27.200> straight<00:02:27.980> down<00:02:30.940> at<00:02:31.940> each<00:02:32.239> point

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
that hair is straight down at each point

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.650 
that hair is straight down at each point
that<00:02:32.870> we're<00:02:33.019> cutting<00:02:34.000> sometimes<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.150> helps<00:02:35.360> if

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
that we're cutting sometimes it helps if

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.970 
that we're cutting sometimes it helps if
you<00:02:35.810> kind<00:02:36.019> of<00:02:36.080> pin<00:02:36.319> it<00:02:36.440> in<00:02:36.530> place<00:02:36.739> with<00:02:36.950> your

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
you kind of pin it in place with your

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.750 
you kind of pin it in place with your
thumb<00:02:37.130> as<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.910> cut<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.890> might<00:02:40.069> want<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.340> do<00:02:40.549> an

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
thumb as you cut you might want to do an

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.630 
thumb as you cut you might want to do an
initial<00:02:41.030> cut<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.660> then<00:02:41.780> go<00:02:41.989> back<00:02:42.170> in<00:02:42.410> to<00:02:43.250> clean

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
initial cut and then go back in to clean

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.050 
initial cut and then go back in to clean
up<00:02:43.790> those<00:02:44.180> extra<00:02:44.690> stray<00:02:45.350> hairs

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.880 

so<00:02:50.569> you<00:02:50.660> can<00:02:50.840> see<00:02:51.020> how<00:02:51.380> it's<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.650> little<00:02:51.770> bit

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
so you can see how it's a little bit

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.920 
so you can see how it's a little bit
jagged<00:02:52.190> so<00:02:53.120> we're<00:02:53.240> just<00:02:53.270> going<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:53.540> push<00:02:53.750> that

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
jagged so we're just going to push that

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.690 
jagged so we're just going to push that
hair<00:02:54.200> along<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.680> template<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.220> make<00:02:55.459> sure

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
hair along the template and make sure

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.270 
hair along the template and make sure
that<00:02:55.850> it's<00:02:56.030> moved<00:02:56.330> out<00:02:56.569> I've<00:02:57.560> got<00:02:57.709> a<00:02:57.740> long<00:02:57.950> spot

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
that it's moved out I've got a long spot

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:10.240 
that it's moved out I've got a long spot
here<00:03:07.270> and<00:03:08.270> as<00:03:08.390> long<00:03:08.420> as<00:03:08.930> when<00:03:09.200> it's<00:03:09.350> pushed<00:03:09.709> out

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
here and as long as when it's pushed out

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.449 
here and as long as when it's pushed out
to<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.030> template<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:12.950> has<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.250> nice

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
to the template that it has a nice

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.640 
to the template that it has a nice
straight<00:03:13.730> line<00:03:14.020> then<00:03:15.020> it's<00:03:15.200> not<00:03:15.319> going<00:03:15.560> to

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
straight line then it's not going to

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.640 
straight line then it's not going to
matter<00:03:15.800> for<00:03:15.920> when<00:03:16.190> we<00:03:16.310> style<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.410> just

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
matter for when we style it so I just

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.080 
matter for when we style it so I just
want<00:03:18.800> to<00:03:18.860> make<00:03:19.010> sure<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.489> it's<00:03:19.700> following

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
want to make sure that it's following

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.270 
want to make sure that it's following
the<00:03:20.209> template<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:21.319> it<00:03:21.770> looks<00:03:21.950> like<00:03:22.100> it's

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
the template and it looks like it's

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.670 
the template and it looks like it's
pretty<00:03:22.519> close<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:23.180> next<00:03:24.170> I'm<00:03:24.290> just<00:03:24.350> going<00:03:24.650> to

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
pretty close so next I'm just going to

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.920 
pretty close so next I'm just going to
switch<00:03:24.830> sides<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.790> I'm<00:03:26.390> going<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.540> cut<00:03:26.750> down

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
switch sides and I'm going to cut down

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.430 
switch sides and I'm going to cut down
the<00:03:27.140> other<00:03:27.290> side<00:03:29.050> and<00:03:30.050> we're<00:03:30.170> just<00:03:30.230> going<00:03:30.380> to

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
the other side and we're just going to

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.740 
the other side and we're just going to
continue<00:03:30.650> this<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.400> so<00:03:31.940> we<00:03:32.120> have<00:03:32.300> completed

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
continue this and so we have completed

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.400 
continue this and so we have completed
our<00:03:33.019> cut<00:03:33.410> style<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:35.690> last<00:03:35.900> step<00:03:36.200> in<00:03:36.319> the

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
our cut style the last step in the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.410 
our cut style the last step in the
process<00:03:36.830> is<00:03:36.860> to<00:03:37.040> sell<00:03:37.430> your<00:03:37.459> weaving<00:03:37.790> clips<00:03:38.060> to

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
process is to sell your weaving clips to

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.600 
process is to sell your weaving clips to
your<00:03:38.450> weft<00:03:38.750> make<00:03:39.530> sure<00:03:39.830> that<00:03:40.190> your<00:03:40.370> tongues

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
your weft make sure that your tongues

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.630 
your weft make sure that your tongues
are<00:03:40.880> pointed<00:03:41.239> up<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:42.260> not<00:03:42.950> upside<00:03:43.370> down

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
are pointed up and not upside down

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.729 
are pointed up and not upside down
otherwise<00:03:44.209> you<00:03:44.600> won't<00:03:44.720> be<00:03:44.930> able<00:03:45.080> to<00:03:45.230> put<00:03:45.470> it<00:03:45.560> on

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
otherwise you won't be able to put it on

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.960 
otherwise you won't be able to put it on
at<00:03:46.069> all<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:48.019> first<00:03:48.260> step<00:03:48.500> is<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:49.130> take<00:03:49.640> your

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
at all the first step is to take your

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.120 
at all the first step is to take your
sewing<00:03:50.540> needle<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:51.019> thread<00:03:51.319> and<00:03:51.590> go<00:03:51.830> through

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
sewing needle and thread and go through

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.410 
sewing needle and thread and go through
the<00:03:52.220> weft<00:03:54.670> before<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:55.760> get<00:03:55.910> to<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.120> end<00:03:56.269> of

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
the weft before you get to the end of

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.930 
the weft before you get to the end of
your<00:03:56.510> thread<00:03:57.220> take<00:03:58.220> your<00:03:58.400> needle<00:03:58.579> and<00:03:58.790> go

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
your thread take your needle and go

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.160 
your thread take your needle and go
through<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.269> loop<00:04:01.150> then<00:04:02.150> take<00:04:02.780> your<00:04:02.989> weaving

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
through the loop then take your weaving

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.910 
through the loop then take your weaving
clip<00:04:04.090> put<00:04:05.090> it<00:04:05.209> in<00:04:05.360> place<00:04:05.570> and<00:04:06.410> you're<00:04:06.739> going<00:04:06.890> to

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
clip put it in place and you're going to

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:16.050 
clip put it in place and you're going to
go<00:04:07.100> through<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.030> weft<00:04:08.380> once<00:04:11.709> twice

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.960 

and<00:04:16.350> three<00:04:17.350> times

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.240 

next<00:04:23.970> you're<00:04:24.090> gonna<00:04:24.150> go<00:04:24.450> back<00:04:25.260> into<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:26.070> weft

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
next you're gonna go back into the weft

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.080 
next you're gonna go back into the weft
and<00:04:26.580> come<00:04:27.570> out<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:28.610> then<00:04:29.610> you're<00:04:29.760> going<00:04:29.910> to

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
and come out and then you're going to

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.760 
and come out and then you're going to
find<00:04:30.360> where<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:30.660> other<00:04:30.840> hole<00:04:31.230> of<00:04:31.530> your

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
find where the other hole of your

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.920 
find where the other hole of your
weaving<00:04:31.920> clip<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:32.700> you're<00:04:33.570> going<00:04:33.660> to<00:04:33.720> go

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
weaving clip is and you're going to go

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:46.790 
weaving clip is and you're going to go
down<00:04:34.500> into<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.490> weft<00:04:35.700> in<00:04:35.970> that<00:04:36.240> spot<00:04:45.800> what

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
down into the weft in that spot what

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.080 
down into the weft in that spot what
that's<00:04:46.980> going<00:04:47.220> to<00:04:47.280> do<00:04:47.460> is<00:04:47.700> it's<00:04:47.850> going<00:04:48.000> to

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
that's going to do is it's going to
