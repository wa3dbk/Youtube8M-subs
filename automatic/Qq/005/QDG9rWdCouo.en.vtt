00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.210
 the new nano 5g left the old 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.849
 nano 4g right we see right away 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.690
 at the level of the dimensions it is 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.610
 strictly identical 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.600
 no change does not have that is more 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.640
 tall than the other even in thickness they 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.019
 are the same are always very fine there 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.420
 there's just a little difference this is the 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.830
 audio output which on again been placed at 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.949
 left and who was right on 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.380
 the old simply because of sensors 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.050
 optics for the camera we will see everything to 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.719
 time the dimensions so these are 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.850
 equal the wheel come not bigger on 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.079
 the one on the other what jumps 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.410
 obviously to the eyes is the size of 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.239
 the screen 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:48.039
 here we won 56 additional pixels 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.640
 which allows to see a little more 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:53.559
 of things in the videos for the rest 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.289
 so it's the same 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.719
 the weight is about the same 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.039
 almost even the difference is 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.690
 the order of a hair, that is to say that the 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.019
 new and even rap just a little bit more 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.840
 light of the old done 36 out of a thousand 4 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.520
 grams against 36.8 for the other so 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.840
 as much as saying that in the pocket or in the 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.729
 hand we will not see the difference 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.630
 the nano is still very light 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.890
 always very thin the coating of the 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.900
 again a little bit changed 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.070
 that is, before we had a 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.159
 matte treatment 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.130
 there we have a brilliant treatment that gives 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.350
 a kind of lacquered look that is 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.729
 really really pretty pretty enough 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.390
 nice it's very soft very smooth and 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.720
 we see in the back so the famous 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.009
 small video camera with microphone 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.780
 and other details there that we do not see but 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.159
 we're going to hear just now 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.579
 is that the exiting of office of two 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.700
 speakers 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.200
 so one can listen to his music that 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.119
 can listen to the movies via this little 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.920
 speaker output by against the radio 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.240
 it does not work you have to 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.890
 necessarily close and the helmet 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.320
 for you by listening to the radio 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.790
 simply 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.200
 clown to ask us without his helmet for 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.970
 use the radio function 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.880
 you have to start by plugging in the headphones 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.640
 earphones on the ipod otherwise we are wise 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.220
 which explains no radio signal plug 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.500
 the headphones to receive the radio 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.810
 so we plug in there then 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.209
 the headphones of an iphone so and no 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.400
 specific headphones or nanos and there we 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.420
 can start listening to the radio then 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.490
 it also means we can not 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.489
 listen to the radio through the speakers 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.959
 that broadcast are via the dock plug 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.840
 we can only listen to him through 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.510
 headphones we then use the button 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.450
 central to switch between 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.500
 functions so here we are listening and if 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.850
 we want to change the station we have the tuner 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.180
 we will press the left button or 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.459
 right button to scan the tape and to 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.040
 each time the ipod stops when 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.860
 find a frequency used 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.170
 it displays the name of the station and we 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.170
 can memorize it so we press it 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.890
 the central button a long press and 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.489
 we have the added menu after setting on 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.380
 valid and the station function is 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.670
 recorded and we see it with the little 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.340
 yellow peas 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.470
 so when we want to go from seven to six 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.030
 have recorded to another just 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.970
 to press the left button or the 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.720
 right button and there we go through 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.440
 stations saved in favorites 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.329
 favorites who have their menu with 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.600
 just a problem is we have 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.799
 only the numbers of the stations on 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.049
 does not have the name then that precisely 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.060
 the ipod is able to recover that name 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.269
 so there it is not very convenient when there 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.269
 has a lot 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.780
 usually people do not have a 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.069
 ten registered stations but 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.260
 except to know perfectly the 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.469
 frequency of the radio there we go a 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.819
 a little bit a little blinding it ago 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.379
 a very nice function on the radio 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.659
 with the nano 5g that's what 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.829
 call the live break what you 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.930
 are listening to a show or 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.310
 a song a newspaper and you are 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.120
 disturb you have to go for example 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.769
 answer the phone 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.810
 rather than losing track of 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:16.139
 the show you will pause it 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.880
 so we press the pause button and we 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.160
 had a small gauge that was in 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.780
 fill up with a cursor the 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.460
 slider stopped and the gauge 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.440
 continues to progress slowly 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.570
 it's actually a cache is at 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.020
 to say that the nano will keep up to 15 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.419
 minutes of programs in memory the 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.610
 mission continues to unfold at 100 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.800
 shop in the nano you have 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.940
 hung up you come back and listen 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.630
 the you were arrested 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:45.470
 just press play and the 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.750
 small cursor we return to the display 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.120
 and the little slider will take him back 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.500
 race and you will resume 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.830
 the show exactly where you were 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.020
 stopped 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.840
 you can also go back or 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.520
 you can resume the live wire 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.220
 of the show just press the 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:06.449
 right key here is 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.010
 and then we came back to live so that's 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.300
 quite practical because during we know 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.340
 we have a reserve of about 15 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.680
 minutes of resignation where we can 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.480
 to be absent and to return and not to lose 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.880
 the 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.730
 not lose what was said during the 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.580
 program the other novelty of nano 5g 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.610
 it's the pedometer it's kind of 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.230
 under service of the kit nike + ipod 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.530
 there we do not need to connect a 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:33.350
 module is not as powerful as this 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.730
 that what the kit of nike 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.170
 just a function of two pedometers 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.510
 that is, he will calculate the number 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.190
 of packs you perform and he goes 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.440
 calculate based on that is the 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.600
 calories that you spent these 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.550
 statistics then register are 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.460
 recovered by itunes and returned 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.860
 at nike who after you shows a little 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.500
 little goals you have achieved 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.720
 and the caloric expenditure you have 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.560
 done so that it works on 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.270
 starts by adjusting its weight on rule 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.860
 the goal we give ourselves and we 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.690
 also chooses if we want the 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.660
 active sound pedometer 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.460
 after we have a little shoe that 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.900
 draws on the top right next to the 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.000
 battery which means that the 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.530
 Pedometer is permanently active 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.470
 so every time we move with 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:21.290
 his his ring the accelerometer goes 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:24.700
 detect them is not elegant this is the 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:27.350
 calculation either we run it manually 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.230
 when we want once everything is 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.720
 set the pedometer as soon as it detects that 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.520
 the user is moving starts to 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.710
 calculate the number of steps then they 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.750
 start sometimes not right away but 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.950
 hang up who little delay taken 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:48.260
 we see here we advance we advance when 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:50.240
 stops and anbar and we are not 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.600
 all so there he made a time of 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.230
 latency 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.270
 we do not have to stay at all 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:07:00.100
 on the screen we can return to the menu 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:03.650
 start his music just go on 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:06.800
 little water m his main menu to see 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.210
 the number of spas while continuing need 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.080
 big pools and who continue you are 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:13.160
 really and the old and new nano 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.490
 are both able to read a 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:19.820
 movie the difference for the new is 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:22.460
 its screen size that is to say that there 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.960
 stayed on the 240 pixels but here we 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:28.259
 has passed in 376 pixels 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.800
 against 320 for the former of the blow to 

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:33.449
 the screen gives a little difference 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:38.280
 that is, we see a little more 

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:45.449
 details about this art that is there and 

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:47.039
 passages that the army does not have an image 

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:48.240
 sometimes clappers and the picture is pretty much 

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:50.009
 almost identical between the two there is 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.050
 not really and not really 

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:54.319
 difference is advantageous over 

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.319
 bonanno
