00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 very good of 2 drops on so this way 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.940
 way and I'm here with a game of 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.639
 warfare 3 the pilla to explain is a 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.440
 couple of little things of what happens this end 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.570
 of week that for those who do not know 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.150
 was the tournament youtuber kisses youtubers 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.830
 which organized or txt and did not 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.289
 I faced some youtubers of the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.119
 Spanish community and the truth is that 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.430
 it was pretty good it consisted in then 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.470
 nothing a playstation 3 tournament and another 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.230
 of xbox or obviously I was in the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.660
 playstation 3 because xbox now for 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.270
 the moment I do not have and it was just 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.540
 well, nothing competitive with vp rules 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.170
 play 5 maps maximum the one that won 3 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.840
 I won and I'm going to the final was 7 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.510
 to 7 maps the one that won 5 not the one that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.550
 I won 4 forgiveness whether it was rising with the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.079
 victory and the truth is that I liked 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.360
 quite good because I'm competitive 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.550
 As you know, I 'm not going to try it much 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.680
 warfare 3 I tried it a couple of times and 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.469
 good did not convince me at all because the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.449
 be typical the typical ones you are that 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.360
 are the ones that stay so to speak 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.030
 away with weapons 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.220
 of assault rifles this bullet the acr and 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.870
 always killing me with that gun and 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.630
 I could not stand but good in this case in 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.250
 the white is 2 because it seems that the weapons 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.080
 to be more balanced and that is why 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.750
 more or less I compete at least to 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.520
 my taste and well I liked it I had 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.620
 the certain disputes with some of the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.630
 opponents in plan we were of 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.160
 connect but they told us that we 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.170
 we would change and things like that 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.360
 but good is one thing that you have to 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.160
 be clear most of you 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.960
 who do not know the competitive because 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.970
 we just have to go win the 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.560
 split or it does not matter how much you kill not 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.630
 it matters if you make a proportion of 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.640
 four or five or if you kill a hundred 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.670
 people what matters is that your team 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.410
 win the game and that's how it should be 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.899
 to play the public ones as it should be 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.369
 always play to win the games 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.110
 although many times I also 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.290
 I include that I will always take myself 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.630
 apps or to get me nuclear or games 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.149
 with a rather bulky result and I 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.210
 I forget about that, so to speak 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.979
 objective but in itself when I that I know by 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.330
 example if we now put an example in 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.280
 a war 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.860
 what matters is to win the enemy not 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.070
 matter that you kill 50 if then all 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.640
 his team kills others 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.870
 what is not youtube experience 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.240
 is the verse youtube I loved 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.160
 because I've known people better 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.930
 that were integrating my team that 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.850
 I only knew his flow but good at the end 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.240
 I have come to know others better 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.010
 that was between alcoy and juan with also 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.390
 Well nothing just maybe I already 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.860
 he began to suggest that we get 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.180
 for the vp and such to see if so 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.210
 we could do something who knows what I know 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.840
 how this was just youtube and I imagine that 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.840
 there will be higher level in this of the uned rv 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.490
 pp have been talking with shock and that 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.990
 you already know that you are also competitive 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.180
 but he is on xbox and he told me that 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.000
 Well, if we get between 64 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.590
 first 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.350
 winning points and gaining such challenges then 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.450
 surely we could get 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.010
 competing among the 64 for there the 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.380
 work of the cap of barcelona but good 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.660
 done and this is already big words no 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.490
 I know if we can get something I do not know if 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.860
 this will go ahead me in any 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.910
 case is what I will comment and if you put me 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.450
 the comments you want to see 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.290
 competitive because I 'm delighted I'll bring it 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.730
 surely it is to bring some of the 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.920
 better moments of the end than this 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.690
 it was pretty good and he has already seen 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.700
 and the buap I hope you liked the 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.590
 video in general that you put me that for 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.270
 the comments that I hope you have 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.130
 liked youtube heroes or youtubers that 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.200
 we do not have anything at all wrong we just 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.780
 winning and without losing any 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.420
 round no game in general so 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.530
 well, we did not like everything in general and 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.150
 I hope you liked it 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.150
 vote the video and see you tomorrow chao 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.530
