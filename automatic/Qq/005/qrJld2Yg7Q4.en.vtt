00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
so if you're interested in that you can

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.720 
so if you're interested in that you can

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
just go back and have a look at it but I

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.950 
just go back and have a look at it but I
have<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.539> say<00:00:18.570> during<00:00:19.560> my<00:00:19.590> last<00:00:20.510> video<00:00:21.510> i<00:00:21.779> did

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.109 
have to say during my last video i did
some<00:00:22.230> research<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:23.519> found<00:00:23.550> something

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
some research and I found something

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.019 
some research and I found something
really<00:00:24.900> nice<00:00:25.050> out<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.920> was<00:00:26.609> wondering

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
really nice out and I was wondering

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.849 
really nice out and I was wondering
about<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.449> for<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.750> longest<00:00:27.990> time<00:00:28.260> how<00:00:28.740> it

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
about this for the longest time how it

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.070 
about this for the longest time how it
actually<00:00:29.039> works<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:30.000> I'm<00:00:30.210> going<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.869> talk

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
actually works but I'm going to talk

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.450 
actually works but I'm going to talk
about<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.439> later<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.980> think<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.309> pretty

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
about it later and I think it's pretty

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.540 
about it later and I think it's pretty
awesome<00:00:32.870> but<00:00:33.870> before<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.440> i'm<00:00:35.160> going<00:00:35.370> to

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
awesome but before that i'm going to

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.880 
awesome but before that i'm going to
give<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.030> super<00:00:36.660> quick<00:00:36.840> overview<00:00:37.170> again<00:00:37.590> just

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
give you super quick overview again just

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.549 
give you super quick overview again just
like<00:00:38.070> always<00:00:38.370> what<00:00:39.170> projector<00:00:40.170> finishes

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
like always what projector finishes

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.680 
like always what projector finishes
actually<00:00:41.040> are<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.700> just<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.270> what<00:00:42.450> glass

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
actually are so just like what glass

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.920 
actually are so just like what glass
finishers<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.280> field<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.390> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
finishers you have a field and a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.660 
finishers you have a field and a
finisher<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.890> combine<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.520> get

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
finisher that you combine and you get

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.069 
finisher that you combine and you get
different<00:00:47.850> effects<00:00:48.329> depending<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
different effects depending on the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.990 
different effects depending on the
combination<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.129> example<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.640> could<00:00:50.760> use

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
combination so for example I could use

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.630 
combination so for example I could use
fire<00:00:51.480> filled<00:00:51.809> my<00:00:52.170> napalm<00:00:52.559> here<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.010> combine

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
fire filled my napalm here and combine

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.910 
fire filled my napalm here and combine
it<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:53.789> my<00:00:53.969> pistol<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.539> my<00:00:55.260> pistol<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:55.739> is

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
it with my pistol one my pistol one is

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.410 
it with my pistol one my pistol one is
one<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.370> two<00:00:56.489> kinds<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.850> projectile

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
one of the two kinds of projectile

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.599 
one of the two kinds of projectile
finishes<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.620> only<00:00:58.800> has<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> twenty<00:00:59.340> percent

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
finishes it only has a twenty percent

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.360 
finishes it only has a twenty percent
chance<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.629> trigger<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.199> combo<00:01:01.620> which<00:01:02.160> is

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
chance to trigger the combo which is

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.700 
chance to trigger the combo which is
something<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.149> don't<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.420> as<00:01:03.719> much<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.379> well

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
something I don't like as much but well

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.700 
something I don't like as much but well
that's<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.070> how<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.439> you<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.560> lay

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that's just how it is so you can lay

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.250 
that's just how it is so you can lay
down<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> fire<00:01:08.189> field<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.869> then<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:10.110> just

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
down a fire field and then you can just

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.960 
down a fire field and then you can just
shoot<00:01:10.500> through<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> chance

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
shoot through it and you have the chance

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.789 
shoot through it and you have the chance
to<00:01:12.180> apply<00:01:12.479> one<00:01:12.750> second<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.080> burning<00:01:13.470> it's

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
to apply one second of burning it's

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.460 
to apply one second of burning it's
random<00:01:14.369> that's<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.820> thing<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.900> see<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.140> hit

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
random that's the thing so you see I hit

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.410 
random that's the thing so you see I hit
twice<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.400> bitch<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:18.150> it's<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
twice here and it's a bitch like it's a

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.730 
twice here and it's a bitch like it's a
good<00:01:18.540> bit<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.720> extra<00:01:19.049> damage<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.500> mean<00:01:19.650> you

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
good bit of extra damage I mean you

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.609 
good bit of extra damage I mean you
can't<00:01:19.920> complain<00:01:20.330> you<00:01:21.330> usually<00:01:21.509> can't<00:01:22.200> really

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
can't complain you usually can't really

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.399 
can't complain you usually can't really
use<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.009> effectively<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:24.030> combat<00:01:24.170> it<00:01:25.170> just

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
use it effectively in combat it just

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.039 
use it effectively in combat it just
happens<00:01:25.890> that's<00:01:26.759> what<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:26.970> always<00:01:27.479> thought<00:01:27.810> at

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
happens that's what I always thought at

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.990 
happens that's what I always thought at
least<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.500> with<00:01:29.189> pistol<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.850> just

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
least like with pistol one I just

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.050 
least like with pistol one I just
sometimes<00:01:30.780> throw<00:01:31.229> down<00:01:31.409> my<00:01:31.590> clinic<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:33.030> a

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
throw down this to just feel tiny bit of

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.429 
throw down this to just feel tiny bit of
extra<00:01:35.909> damage<00:01:36.119> or<00:01:36.450> has<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.689> chance<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.110> do<00:01:37.229> some

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.719 
extra damage and well it's not a huge
thing<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.549> be<00:01:41.700> useful<00:01:41.850> sometimes<00:01:42.450> but

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
thing but it can be useful sometimes but

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.819 
thing but it can be useful sometimes but
there's<00:01:44.729> also<00:01:44.909> another<00:01:45.090> combo<00:01:45.600> finisher

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
there's also another combo finisher

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.139 
there's also another combo finisher
another<00:01:46.829> projectile<00:01:47.369> finisher<00:01:47.700> which<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:48.030> be

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
another projectile finisher which can be

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.179 
another projectile finisher which can be
a<00:01:48.180> bit<00:01:48.360> more<00:01:48.540> reliable<00:01:49.110> my<00:01:49.439> shield<00:01:49.680> five<00:01:49.890> for

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
a bit more reliable my shield five for

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.130 
a bit more reliable my shield five for
example<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.820> hundred<00:01:51.180> percent<00:01:51.299> finishing

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
example is a hundred percent finishing

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.200 
example is a hundred percent finishing
other<00:01:52.530> classes<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.130> their<00:01:53.310> own<00:01:53.340> stuff<00:01:53.909> like

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
other classes have their own stuff like

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.060 
other classes have their own stuff like
ever<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.840> think<00:01:55.079> pretty<00:01:55.290> much<00:01:55.439> everyone<00:01:55.770> has<00:01:56.040> a

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
ever I think pretty much everyone has a

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.920 
ever I think pretty much everyone has a
projectile<00:01:56.610> finisher<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.390> has<00:01:57.570> one<00:01:57.719> hundred

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
projectile finisher that has one hundred

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.230 
projectile finisher that has one hundred
percent<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.579> good<00:01:59.759> thing<00:01:59.790> about<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
percent but the good thing about the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.530 
percent but the good thing about the
shield<00:02:00.479> 5s<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.770> boomerang<00:02:02.040> effect<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.240> I

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
shield 5s it's a boomerang effect so I

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.330 
shield 5s it's a boomerang effect so I
can<00:02:03.899> lay<00:02:04.020> down<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.350> fire<00:02:04.530> field<00:02:04.860> once<00:02:05.100> again

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
can lay down the fire field once again

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.950 
can lay down the fire field once again
and<00:02:05.610> then<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.790> couldn't<00:02:06.090> throw<00:02:06.299> my<00:02:06.509> shield<00:02:06.780> and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
and then I couldn't throw my shield and

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.339 
and then I couldn't throw my shield and
as<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.380> can<00:02:07.500> see<00:02:07.530> oh<00:02:07.860> oh<00:02:08.729> damn<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.660> buck<00:02:09.840> Todd<00:02:10.050> I

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
can't believe this bugged out right now

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.490 
can't believe this bugged out right now

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
again sometimes it doesn't recognize

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.800 
again sometimes it doesn't recognize
that<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.340> throw<00:02:20.550> something<00:02:20.790> through<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:21.210> field

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
that you throw something through a field

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.770 
that you throw something through a field
which<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.710> super<00:02:22.980> rail<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:23.940> there's<00:02:24.630> also

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
which is super rail but there's also

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.210 
which is super rail but there's also
another<00:02:24.990> field<00:02:25.440> which<00:02:25.650> does<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.190> mean

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
another field which does that I mean

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.590 
another field which does that I mean
another<00:02:26.610> finisher<00:02:27.000> which<00:02:27.120> does<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.540> I'm

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
another finisher which does that so I'm

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.120 
another finisher which does that so I'm
going<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.840> show<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.740> with<00:02:28.950> that

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
museum it applies double the burning

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.590 
museum it applies double the burning
same<00:02:41.520> works<00:02:41.760> will<00:02:41.940> shoot<00:02:42.150> five<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.510> can

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
same works will shoot five you can

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.860 
same works will shoot five you can
believe<00:02:42.750> me<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:44.510> that's<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.600> bit<00:02:45.720> more

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
believe me that that's a bit more

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.720 
believe me that that's a bit more
reliable<00:02:46.380> it's<00:02:46.560> still<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.770> lot<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:46.980> amazing<00:02:47.280> but

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
reliable it's still a lot of amazing but

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.340 
reliable it's still a lot of amazing but
that's<00:02:48.000> something<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.480> started<00:02:48.959> using<00:02:49.140> a

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
that's something that I started using a

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.840 
that's something that I started using a
little<00:02:49.590> bit<00:02:49.739> once<00:02:49.950> i<00:02:50.040> found<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.340> out<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.760> i

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
little bit once i found that out and i

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.870 
little bit once i found that out and i
think<00:02:51.090> it's<00:02:51.320> it's<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.500> decent<00:02:52.830> amount<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.640> extra

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
think it's it's a decent amount of extra

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.850 
think it's it's a decent amount of extra
damage<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.660> makes<00:02:54.840> throw<00:02:55.110> wrench<00:02:55.350> actually

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
damage that makes throw wrench actually

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.800 
damage that makes throw wrench actually
useful<00:02:56.070> for<00:02:57.800> condition<00:02:58.800> bills<00:02:59.330> but<00:03:00.330> here<00:03:00.690> you

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
useful for condition bills but here you

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.770 
useful for condition bills but here you
go<00:03:00.930> wit<00:03:01.140> clips<00:03:01.730> um<00:03:02.730> three<00:03:03.209> more<00:03:03.360> seconds<00:03:03.690> and

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
go wit clips um three more seconds and

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.090

worked okay but there's one thing about

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.140 
worked okay but there's one thing about
projectile<00:03:14.220> finishes<00:03:14.520> that<00:03:14.640> was<00:03:14.790> always

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
projectile finishes that was always

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.600 
projectile finishes that was always
wondering<00:03:15.630> about<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.650> have<00:03:16.800> no<00:03:17.100> clue<00:03:17.340> how

it worked so I'm going to show it to you
guys<00:03:20.010> now<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:20.730> there<00:03:20.940> are<00:03:21.560> light<00:03:22.640> fields<00:03:23.640> and

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
guys now so there are light fields and

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.810 
guys now so there are light fields and
water<00:03:24.660> fields<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.410> if<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.860> use<00:03:26.070> a<00:03:26.280> projectile

water fields and if you use a projectile

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.890 
water fields and if you use a projectile
finisher<00:03:27.150> through<00:03:27.360> those<00:03:28.700> it<00:03:29.700> says<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.750> you

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.640 
finisher through those it says that you
would<00:03:31.049> get<00:03:31.200> regeneration<00:03:31.860> out<00:03:32.519> of<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:32.940> and

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
would get regeneration out of it and

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.289 
would get regeneration out of it and
condition<00:03:34.650> removal<00:03:35.130> regeneration<00:03:35.970> on<00:03:36.120> the

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
condition removal regeneration on the

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.759 
condition removal regeneration on the
water<00:03:36.450> feels<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.870> condition<00:03:37.170> removal<00:03:37.590> on<00:03:37.680> the

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
water feels and condition removal on the

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.600 
water feels and condition removal on the
light<00:03:37.920> field<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.510> I<00:03:39.510> always<00:03:40.290> thought<00:03:40.739> you

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
light field and I always thought you

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.060 
light field and I always thought you
would<00:03:41.730> have<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:42.060> hit<00:03:42.209> your<00:03:42.420> allies<00:03:42.870> like<00:03:43.620> okay

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
would have to hit your allies like okay

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.520 
would have to hit your allies like okay
so<00:03:44.130> i<00:03:44.280> tried<00:03:44.610> to<00:03:44.790> use<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.260> on<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.530> guy<00:03:47.269> um<00:03:48.530> on

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
so i tried to use it on this guy um on

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.199 
so i tried to use it on this guy um on
range<00:03:49.920> and<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:50.280> was<00:03:50.489> hoping<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:50.820> I<00:03:50.970> would<00:03:51.090> get

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
range and I was hoping that I would get

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.120 
range and I was hoping that I would get
regeneration<00:03:51.900> myself<00:03:52.260> if<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.560> would<00:03:52.739> hit<00:03:52.890> the

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
regeneration myself if I would hit the

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.100 
regeneration myself if I would hit the
combo<00:03:53.459> but<00:03:53.579> that<00:03:53.760> doesn't<00:03:54.030> work<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.570> thought

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
combo but that doesn't work so I thought

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.110 
combo but that doesn't work so I thought
okay<00:03:55.500> if<00:03:55.680> an<00:03:55.860> ally<00:03:56.130> sense<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.549> between<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.030> he

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
okay if an ally sense in between and he

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.000 
okay if an ally sense in between and he
gets<00:03:57.299> hit<00:03:57.510> by<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.750> projectile<00:03:58.320> that<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.739> Li

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
gets hit by the projectile that the Li

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.100 
gets hit by the projectile that the Li
would<00:03:59.190> get<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.610> effect<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.600> thought<00:04:00.750> okay

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
would get the effect and I thought okay

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.020 
would get the effect and I thought okay
that's<00:04:01.320> just<00:04:01.590> really<00:04:01.920> unreliable<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.910> I'm

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
that's just really unreliable and I'm

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.810 
that's just really unreliable and I'm
not<00:04:03.150> ever<00:04:03.450> going<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:03.930> try<00:04:04.110> to<00:04:04.140> use<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:04.820> but

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
not ever going to try to use that but

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.759 
not ever going to try to use that but
when<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.480> did<00:04:06.690> some<00:04:06.870> research<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:07.590> actually

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
when I did some research I actually

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.550 
when I did some research I actually
found<00:04:08.100> out<00:04:08.370> that<00:04:08.730> it<00:04:09.090> works<00:04:09.329> differently<00:04:09.560> slow

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
found out that it works differently slow

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.699 
found out that it works differently slow
if<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.190> shoot<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.910> combo<00:04:12.360> on<00:04:12.570> this<00:04:13.290> column

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
if you shoot the combo on this column

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.039 
if you shoot the combo on this column
here<00:04:13.739> for<00:04:14.160> example<00:04:14.510> there's<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.630> radius<00:04:15.959> around

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
here for example there's a radius around

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.500 
here for example there's a radius around
the<00:04:16.260> golem<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:16.829> around<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.400> golem<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:18.329> will

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
the golem and around the golem you will

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.849 
the golem and around the golem you will
remove<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:18.959> condition<00:04:19.410> with<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.680> light

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
remove the condition with the light

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.099 
remove the condition with the light
field<00:04:20.190> or<00:04:20.340> you<00:04:20.669> will<00:04:20.880> give<00:04:21.090> regeneration<00:04:21.930> with

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
field or you will give regeneration with

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.950 
field or you will give regeneration with
the<00:04:22.260> water-filled<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:23.780> well<00:04:24.780> with

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
the water-filled and well with

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.990 
the water-filled and well with
projectile<00:04:25.710> finishers<00:04:26.250> that<00:04:26.460> have<00:04:26.580> only<00:04:26.760> two

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
projectile finishers that have only two

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000 
projectile finishers that have only two
two<00:04:27.150> percent<00:04:27.540> chance<00:04:27.780> it's<00:04:28.110> not<00:04:28.260> reliable<00:04:28.620> and

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
two percent chance it's not reliable and

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.470 
two percent chance it's not reliable and
I<00:04:29.130> would<00:04:29.340> not<00:04:29.610> try<00:04:30.000> to<00:04:30.030> use<00:04:30.390> it<00:04:30.630> but<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:31.560> think

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
I would not try to use it but I think

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.610 
I would not try to use it but I think
what's<00:04:33.480> something<00:04:33.930> like<00:04:33.960> this<00:04:36.230> like<00:04:37.230> with<00:04:37.440> the

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
what's something like this like with the

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.340 
what's something like this like with the
with<00:04:37.920> the<00:04:37.950> wrench<00:04:38.330> since<00:04:39.330> it<00:04:39.480> hits<00:04:39.660> twice<00:04:40.050> as

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
with the wrench since it hits twice as

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.430 
with the wrench since it hits twice as
well<00:04:40.590> it<00:04:40.950> can<00:04:41.160> be<00:04:41.310> really<00:04:41.610> good<00:04:42.000> I<00:04:42.270> pretty<00:04:43.260> sure

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
well it can be really good I pretty sure

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.870 
well it can be really good I pretty sure
this<00:04:43.560> can<00:04:43.740> be<00:04:43.860> used<00:04:44.100> in<00:04:44.220> PvE<00:04:44.520> really

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
this can be used in PvE really

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.280 
this can be used in PvE really
effectively<00:04:45.300> as<00:04:45.480> well<00:04:45.630> so<00:04:45.900> I've<00:04:45.990> repaired

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
effectively as well so I've repaired

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.140 
effectively as well so I've repaired
something<00:04:46.650> here<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:46.830> put<00:04:47.070> five<00:04:47.400> golems<00:04:47.850> on<00:04:48.000> one

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
something here I put five golems on one

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.420 
something here I put five golems on one
spot<00:04:48.420> okay<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.320> I'm<00:04:49.710> just<00:04:49.890> going<00:04:50.040> to<00:04:50.160> use<00:04:50.400> my

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
spot okay and I'm just going to use my

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.700 
spot okay and I'm just going to use my
f1<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.270> make<00:04:51.420> a<00:04:51.450> water<00:04:51.720> view<00:04:51.960> for<00:04:52.200> one<00:04:52.320> second

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
f1 to make a water view for one second

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.930 
f1 to make a water view for one second
and<00:04:52.770> then<00:04:52.860> I'm<00:04:53.010> going<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.250> throw<00:04:53.550> my<00:04:53.700> wrench

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
and then I'm going to throw my wrench

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.060 
and then I'm going to throw my wrench
through<00:04:54.270> those<00:04:54.450> and<00:04:54.690> we'll<00:04:55.530> see<00:04:55.770> how<00:04:55.890> much

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
through those and we'll see how much

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.750 
through those and we'll see how much
regeneration<00:04:56.790> I<00:04:56.880> get<00:04:57.090> let's<00:04:57.810> try<00:04:57.990> this<00:04:59.750> but

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
regeneration I get let's try this but

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.010 
regeneration I get let's try this but
see<00:05:02.760> that's<00:05:03.090> like<00:05:03.300> 20<00:05:03.660> seconds<00:05:03.930> of

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
see that's like 20 seconds of

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.720 
see that's like 20 seconds of
regeneration<00:05:05.120> just<00:05:06.120> for<00:05:06.270> free<00:05:06.480> and<00:05:07.730> that's

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
regeneration just for free and that's

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.570 
regeneration just for free and that's
pretty<00:05:09.390> awesome<00:05:09.690> actually<00:05:10.350> okay<00:05:11.160> I<00:05:11.190> hit<00:05:11.400> five

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
pretty awesome actually okay I hit five

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.210 
pretty awesome actually okay I hit five
enemies<00:05:12.030> with<00:05:12.210> it<00:05:12.390> but<00:05:13.260> either<00:05:13.530> way<00:05:13.890> it's<00:05:14.070> like

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
enemies with it but either way it's like

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.830 
enemies with it but either way it's like
a<00:05:14.250> little<00:05:14.490> bit<00:05:14.760> of<00:05:14.790> extra<00:05:15.000> healing<00:05:15.600> that<00:05:15.690> you

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
a little bit of extra healing that you

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.200 
a little bit of extra healing that you
can<00:05:16.020> get<00:05:16.140> out<00:05:16.320> of<00:05:16.350> it<00:05:16.590> and<00:05:16.800> it's<00:05:17.100> it<00:05:17.790> should<00:05:18.000> not

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
can get out of it and it's it should not

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.940 
can get out of it and it's it should not
be<00:05:18.270> underestimated<00:05:18.450> and<00:05:19.320> if<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:19.530> use<00:05:19.680> it<00:05:19.830> with

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
be underestimated and if you use it with

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.860 
be underestimated and if you use it with
a<00:05:19.980> light-filled<00:05:20.730> for<00:05:21.000> example<00:05:21.450> wait<00:05:21.750> i'm

here we go the elixir ground five you

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.330 
here we go the elixir ground five you
can<00:05:30.060> remove<00:05:30.360> conditions<00:05:30.900> with<00:05:31.110> it<00:05:31.290> and<00:05:31.470> you

can<00:05:32.490> use<00:05:32.669> it<00:05:32.700> for<00:05:33.270> yourself<00:05:33.660> as<00:05:33.810> well<00:05:33.840> but<00:05:34.350> not

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
can use it for yourself as well but not

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.290 
can use it for yourself as well but not
just<00:05:34.710> that<00:05:34.860> you<00:05:35.220> can<00:05:35.340> also<00:05:35.490> use<00:05:35.700> it<00:05:35.729> for<00:05:35.970> allies

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
just that you can also use it for allies

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.390 
just that you can also use it for allies
so<00:05:36.450> if<00:05:36.570> you<00:05:36.660> know<00:05:36.840> that<00:05:37.050> some<00:05:37.710> of<00:05:37.740> your<00:05:38.010> allies

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
so if you know that some of your allies

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.909 
so if you know that some of your allies
fighting<00:05:38.970> against<00:05:39.240> a<00:05:39.390> lot<00:05:39.570> of<00:05:39.690> enemies<00:05:40.110> and<00:05:40.320> if

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
fighting against a lot of enemies and if

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.560 
fighting against a lot of enemies and if
he<00:05:41.040> said<00:05:41.250> if<00:05:41.370> he<00:05:41.400> has<00:05:41.669> a<00:05:41.700> lot<00:05:41.940> of<00:05:41.970> conditions<00:05:42.479> on

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
he said if he has a lot of conditions on

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.120 
he said if he has a lot of conditions on
him<00:05:42.720> you<00:05:42.810> can<00:05:42.930> just<00:05:43.140> lay<00:05:43.500> down<00:05:43.530> the<00:05:43.950> super

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
him you can just lay down the super

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.340 
him you can just lay down the super
elixir<00:05:44.610> and<00:05:44.760> just<00:05:45.030> throw<00:05:45.479> the<00:05:45.780> wrench<00:05:45.990> through

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
elixir and just throw the wrench through

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.100 
elixir and just throw the wrench through
the<00:05:46.890> enemies<00:05:47.250> and<00:05:47.460> your<00:05:47.760> Li<00:05:48.750> would<00:05:48.930> get

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
the enemies and your Li would get

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.810 
the enemies and your Li would get
condition<00:05:49.470> removals<00:05:49.890> or<00:05:50.010> even<00:05:50.400> possibly

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
condition removals or even possibly

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.659 
condition removals or even possibly
multiple<00:05:51.180> Adam<00:05:51.660> a<00:05:51.780> life<00:05:52.340> same<00:05:53.340> with<00:05:53.520> the

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
multiple Adam a life same with the

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.250 
multiple Adam a life same with the
regeneration<00:05:54.210> and<00:05:54.570> I<00:05:54.780> think<00:05:54.990> that's<00:05:55.140> just

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
regeneration and I think that's just

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.800 
regeneration and I think that's just
really<00:05:55.979> useful<00:05:56.610> and<00:05:56.880> I'm<00:05:57.240> happy<00:05:57.570> that<00:05:57.600> I've

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
really useful and I'm happy that I've

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.330 
really useful and I'm happy that I've
found<00:05:57.960> this<00:05:58.140> out<00:05:58.350> I<00:05:58.560> haven't<00:05:58.890> had<00:05:59.160> the<00:05:59.310> chance

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
found this out I haven't had the chance

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.050 
found this out I haven't had the chance
to<00:05:59.640> actually<00:06:00.030> try<00:06:00.540> it<00:06:00.600> and<00:06:01.310> actual<00:06:02.310> pvp<00:06:02.820> yet

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
to actually try it and actual pvp yet

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.719 
to actually try it and actual pvp yet
but<00:06:03.450> I<00:06:03.479> think<00:06:03.900> for<00:06:04.350> mpv<00:06:04.800> at<00:06:05.040> least<00:06:05.280> I<00:06:05.430> will<00:06:05.550> use

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
but I think for mpv at least I will use

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.180 
but I think for mpv at least I will use
the<00:06:05.910> regeneration<00:06:06.419> combo<00:06:06.870> a<00:06:06.900> lot<00:06:07.169> and<00:06:07.380> i<00:06:08.040> will

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
the regeneration combo a lot and i will

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.730 
the regeneration combo a lot and i will
also<00:06:08.340> try<00:06:08.640> to<00:06:08.669> use<00:06:08.850> it<00:06:08.970> in<00:06:09.060> pvp<00:06:09.570> so<00:06:10.470> i<00:06:10.530> hope<00:06:10.710> that

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
also try to use it in pvp so i hope that

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.670 
also try to use it in pvp so i hope that
