files over to your computer and edit
from<00:00:39.300> them<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.170> course<00:00:40.379> there's<00:00:40.710> lots<00:00:40.769> of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
from them so of course there's lots of

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.069 
from them so of course there's lots of
cameras<00:00:41.399> out<00:00:41.550> there<00:00:41.850> from<00:00:42.289> JVC<00:00:43.309> Sony<00:00:44.309> and

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
cameras out there from JVC Sony and

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.910 
cameras out there from JVC Sony and
Canon<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:47.870> aren't<00:00:48.870> working<00:00:49.109> aren't<00:00:49.649> doing

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
Canon that aren't working aren't doing

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.099 
Canon that aren't working aren't doing
anything<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.519> you<00:00:50.670> now<00:00:50.819> and<00:00:51.269> it<00:00:51.749> puts<00:00:51.989> them

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
anything for you now and it puts them

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:53.599 
anything for you now and it puts them
back<00:00:52.289> into<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> field<00:00:52.889> and<00:00:53.159> puts<00:00:53.309> them<00:00:53.489> back

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
back into the field and puts them back

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.979 
back into the field and puts them back
in<00:00:53.670> use<00:00:54.089> at<00:00:54.359> a<00:00:54.389> relatively<00:00:55.350> low<00:00:55.709> cost<00:00:56.010> and

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
in use at a relatively low cost and

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.919 
in use at a relatively low cost and
there<00:00:57.989> should<00:00:58.289> be<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.499> way<00:00:58.769> to<00:00:58.829> use<00:00:59.549> the<00:01:00.119> DC<00:01:00.359> in

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
there should be a way to use the DC in

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.100 
there should be a way to use the DC in
to<00:01:01.379> power<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.920> off<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.639> 12<00:01:03.600> volt<00:01:03.749> batteries

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
to power this off of 12 volt batteries

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.270 
to power this off of 12 volt batteries
so<00:01:04.379> maybe<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:04.710> some<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.129> bigger

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
so maybe you have some of the bigger

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.180 
so maybe you have some of the bigger
broadcast<00:01:05.820> cameras<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.920> DTaP<00:01:07.920> out

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
broadcast cameras that have a DTaP out

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.880 
broadcast cameras that have a DTaP out
and<00:01:08.640> there<00:01:09.300> is<00:01:09.510> an<00:01:09.690> input<00:01:09.870> that<00:01:10.320> takes<00:01:10.650> I

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
and there is an input that takes I

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.210 
and there is an input that takes I
believe<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.640> rated<00:01:12.300> at<00:01:12.480> I<00:01:12.810> think<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.470> 8<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
believe it's rated at I think it's 8 to

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.920 
believe it's rated at I think it's 8 to
8<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.360> 18<00:01:15.930> volts<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:17.390> so<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.660> use<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
8 to 18 volts and so you can use the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.360 
8 to 18 volts and so you can use the
power<00:01:19.140> that's<00:01:19.440> powering<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.860> camera<00:01:20.250> to

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
power that's powering the camera to

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.300 
power that's powering the camera to
power<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.820> unit<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.510> it<00:01:22.380> also<00:01:22.590> runs<00:01:22.950> off<00:01:23.280> of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
power this unit and it also runs off of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.500 
power this unit and it also runs off of
four<00:01:24.210> double<00:01:25.050> A<00:01:25.140> batteries<00:01:26.180> we're<00:01:27.180> looking<00:01:27.420> at

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
four double A batteries we're looking at

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.600

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.500 
won't go and finalize the data that's
here<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:40.670> make<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:40.940> readable<00:02:41.150> by<00:02:41.450> the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
here and make it readable by the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.750 
here and make it readable by the
computer<00:02:42.080> so<00:02:42.320> basically<00:02:43.070> if<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.370> don't<00:02:43.550> make

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
computer so basically if you don't make

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.520 
computer so basically if you don't make
the<00:02:43.910> media<00:02:44.180> files<00:02:44.450> it'll<00:02:44.780> just<00:02:45.050> look<00:02:45.170> like<00:02:45.380> an

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
the media files it'll just look like an

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.860 
the media files it'll just look like an
empty<00:02:45.740> card<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:46.850> some<00:02:47.090> other<00:02:47.180> options<00:02:47.570> here

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
empty card so some other options here

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.930 
empty card so some other options here
format<00:02:48.590> media<00:02:48.920> there's<00:02:49.340> room<00:02:49.520> to<00:02:49.580> upgrade

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
format media there's room to upgrade

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.320 
format media there's room to upgrade
firmware<00:02:50.210> so<00:02:50.630> as<00:02:50.780> data<00:02:51.080> video<00:02:51.580> introduces<00:02:52.580> new

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
firmware so as data video introduces new

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.720 
firmware so as data video introduces new
software<00:02:53.900> that<00:02:53.930> can<00:02:54.230> be<00:02:54.290> loaded<00:02:55.010> onto<00:02:55.340> the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
software that can be loaded onto the

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.030 
software that can be loaded onto the
unit<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.900> then<00:02:57.880> play<00:02:58.880> mode<00:02:59.210> and<00:02:59.540> then<00:03:00.410> got<00:03:01.010> a

unit and then play mode and then got a
record<00:03:01.490> mode<00:03:01.790> here<00:03:02.410> so<00:03:03.410> that<00:03:03.650> basically

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
record mode here so that basically

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.100 
record mode here so that basically
record<00:03:04.700> mode<00:03:04.940> just<00:03:05.270> attempted<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.900> start

record mode just attempted to start

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.080 
record mode just attempted to start
recording<00:03:06.380> so<00:03:06.620> it's<00:03:07.340> telling<00:03:07.670> me<00:03:07.850> that

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090
