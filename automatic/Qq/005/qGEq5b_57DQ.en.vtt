00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
underneath here to help flatten this a

00:02:51.660 --> 00:03:00.729 
underneath here to help flatten this a
bit

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.610 

like<00:03:01.310> that

like that

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.770 
like that
the<00:03:03.040> same<00:03:03.250> thing<00:03:03.400> on<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.580> other<00:03:03.610> side<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.750> you

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
the same thing on the other side so you

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:13.440 
the same thing on the other side so you
just<00:03:05.050> take<00:03:05.260> this<00:03:05.500> here<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:07.150> paper<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:13.390> just

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.660 

now<00:03:24.450> your<00:03:24.600> piece<00:03:24.750> should<00:03:24.960> look<00:03:25.140> like<00:03:25.170> this

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
like so

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.310 
like so
I'll<00:05:43.540> do<00:05:43.660> the<00:05:43.780> same<00:05:43.960> thing<00:05:44.200> on<00:05:44.260> the<00:05:44.380> other<00:05:44.410> side

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
I'll do the same thing on the other side

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:57.620 
I'll do the same thing on the other side
so<00:05:47.320> take<00:05:47.530> this<00:05:47.710> part<00:05:48.480> fold<00:05:49.480> into<00:05:49.810> the<00:05:49.930> center

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:04.980 

and<00:05:58.170> then<00:05:58.350> press

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.640 

foldover<00:06:05.710> better<00:06:06.100> angle

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.920 

it's<00:06:10.310> a<00:06:10.340> good<00:06:10.490> guide<00:06:10.669> if<00:06:10.940> you<00:06:11.000> can<00:06:11.270> get<00:06:11.449> them

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
it's a good guide if you can get them

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.700 
it's a good guide if you can get them
even<00:06:12.440> up<00:06:12.650> here<00:06:13.600> then<00:06:14.600> you<00:06:15.169> should<00:06:15.410> be<00:06:15.500> able<00:06:15.590> to

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
even up here then you should be able to

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:26.880 
even up here then you should be able to
get<00:06:15.919> them<00:06:16.220> even<00:06:16.430> on<00:06:16.880> the<00:06:17.870> sides

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.550 

so<00:06:27.430> now<00:06:27.550> the<00:06:27.610> back<00:06:27.960> side<00:06:28.960> should<00:06:29.380> look<00:06:29.530> like

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
so now the back side should look like
