 a man who is going to have our website 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.509
 in that folder yumblat we go 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.229
 to move the package 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:09.449
 and that is the best 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:12.629
 peta in which we are going to extract the content of that park 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:24.589

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:29.859
 is established in the public letter ht tops and link detailed 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.469

 yumblat which is the folder that we created in the public tv to the server 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.819
 next we will continue with the steps that the region needs the 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.949
 those steps choose the language in which we are going to install 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:04.309
 in this case we are going to choose the Spanish mind 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.119
 in the second step 

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:12.359

 let's write the name of the local server jobs 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.180
 in the username bush wrote a product 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.180

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.630
 live to work with you in sales so much 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.700

 as well as with passwords 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.240
 we can leave it 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.610
 at this time 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:06.819
 on the screen that that ftp confederation left it like this and we continue to 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:08.699
 the next page 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.429
 I write the name of the website in this case and chemicals from the ebro 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.950

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.669
 that is, the key person in the website 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.129
 and we can choose 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:24.189
 a password 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:28.569
 that is going to be the password of the user aqmi that is to say of the administrator of the 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.569
 chihuahua website 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.740
 osorio adm in wax 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.640
 which will have the power to make any modification of said threshold 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:49.979
 below where it says to install it custom sample data we're going to 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:51.620
 leave it this way 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.960
 if they ask us 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.080
 if we want to continue like this let's tell him he was fine 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.830
 because the intention at this moment is to create our own 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.129
 data 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:07.129
 this will show you the last screen of the installation 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:12.739
 which indicates that the file should be deleted by the installation selector 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:16.029
 scarpetta &amp; young are the folders 

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:19.029
