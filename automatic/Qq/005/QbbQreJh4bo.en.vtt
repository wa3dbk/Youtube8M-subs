00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.460
 hello girls in this video I bring you the 

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:09.100
 hairstyle of patriotic look that I left in 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.860
 another video if you want to see this video from 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.750
 the look that I bring right now in my eyes 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.510
 here below in the information box 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.789
 I leave the link but good for this 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.859
 is what we are going to do is this braid 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.310
 which is a braid that goes like very 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:27.159
 adopt now the national holidays and is 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.550
 super easy to do then let's 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:31.590
 see her 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.020
 we started unraveling very well our 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.930
 hair removing all the tangles that 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.790
 we can have even the tips you have to 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.610
 decide which side we want the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.580
 braid and we make a partition to the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.010
 half here is the super procedure 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.059
 simple you have to grab thin strips 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.730
 of a partition on the bottom and 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.340
 we're going to pass over that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.650
 partition to the other side this what 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.500
 Let's do all the hair the 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.719
 truth is super easy and here we are going to 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.619
 see again we grab the part of 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.710
 down a thin strip we went through 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.560
 above that section and towards the other 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.580
 side and so we're going to go across 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.800
 small sections here at the beginning there are 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.590
 to go creating the base of the braid and 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.899
 once we have that base we are going to 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.450
 see how it's going to be easier to go 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:30.210
 weaving the strips and the stories 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.880
 grabbing thin because that's how it feels 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.630
 much more the interwoven that is created 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.610
 but if you want to do 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.159
 it's a little thicker you're going to 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.500
 save time and also looks super 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.960
 pretty so it's a matter of her 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.570
 you decide here is already creating a 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.390
 little bit better the base part of the 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.000
 braid and as you can see is much easier to go 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.659
 weaving and nothing else you are passing the 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.270
 parts of the sections below and no longer 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.090
 it takes so long now it 's a question 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.490
 of practice too but basically it's 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.560
 a braid that you can use not only 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.470
 now for the national holidays but in 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.149
 the newspaper you take ones that you like 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.480
 five or six minutes if you have the 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:17.019
 long hair like me marimar type but 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.030
 the truth is super easy and now yes 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.650
 which is a matter of you getting down to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.370
 practice and you will see what is going to 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.829
 get out pretty nice you end up putting a 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.829
 liga to ensure your hair well 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:32.519
 you can put a ribbon there and you can 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.870
 separate it so that it shows much more 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.540
 We practically finished the braid 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.660
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.660
 the next
