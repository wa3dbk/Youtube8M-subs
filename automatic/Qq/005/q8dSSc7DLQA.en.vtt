there is an incredible dis
and<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.640> between<00:02:03.000> what<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.360> say<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.900> southern

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
and that between what we say is southern

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.950

that we're living in the studies are

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.800 
that we're living in the studies are
showing<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.940> there's<00:02:09.210> virtually<00:02:09.630> no

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
showing that there's virtually no

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
church and the world so I guess my

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.230 
church and the world so I guess my
question<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:14.100> at<00:02:14.250> what<00:02:14.310> point<00:02:14.460> is<00:02:14.940> something

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
question is at what point is something

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.610 
question is at what point is something
