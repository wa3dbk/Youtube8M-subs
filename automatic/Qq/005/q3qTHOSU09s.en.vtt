then we also have more a clipper so

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.640 
then we also have more a clipper so
these<00:00:23.360> are<00:00:23.510> the<00:00:23.600> two<00:00:23.780> nice<00:00:23.960> we<00:00:24.170> use<00:00:24.320> this<00:00:24.440> for

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
these are the two nice we use this for

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.920 
these are the two nice we use this for
the<00:00:24.980> smaller<00:00:25.250> things<00:00:25.640> you<00:00:26.180> know<00:00:26.300> around<00:00:26.570> camp

and push crafting type things and we

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.069 
and push crafting type things and we
need<00:00:33.020> a<00:00:33.050> bit<00:00:33.289> a<00:00:33.320> little<00:00:33.500> bit<00:00:33.710> heavier<00:00:33.980> blade<00:00:34.280> so

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
need a bit a little bit heavier blade so

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.630 
need a bit a little bit heavier blade so
again<00:00:36.079> this<00:00:36.229> is<00:00:36.379> mine<00:00:36.620> I<00:00:36.949> wrapped<00:00:37.370> it<00:00:37.519> in

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
again this is mine I wrapped it in

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.809 
again this is mine I wrapped it in
paracord<00:00:38.530> probably<00:00:39.530> about<00:00:39.739> three<00:00:40.519> years<00:00:40.550> ago

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:40.819 
paracord probably about three years ago

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:43.119 
paracord probably about three years ago
or<00:00:41.149> so<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:41.839> it's<00:00:41.929> held<00:00:42.139> up<00:00:42.260> really<00:00:42.319> great<00:00:42.920> as

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
or so and it's held up really great as

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.759 
or so and it's held up really great as
you<00:00:43.249> can<00:00:43.370> still<00:00:43.579> see<00:00:43.760> I<00:00:44.030> still<00:00:44.929> still<00:00:45.379> on<00:00:45.559> there

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
you can still see I still still on there

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.590 
you can still see I still still on there
and<00:00:46.519> then<00:00:46.729> this<00:00:46.819> is<00:00:46.940> my<00:00:47.059> brother's<00:00:47.359> he

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
and then this is my brother's he

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.840 
and then this is my brother's he
modified<00:00:47.989> his<00:00:48.019> he<00:00:48.769> put<00:00:48.949> a<00:00:48.979> there's<00:00:49.789> a

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
modified his he put a there's a

modified his he put a there's a
sharpening<00:00:50.179> stone<00:00:50.420> on<00:00:50.569> here<00:00:50.839> is<00:00:51.079> where<00:00:51.260> well

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:51.679 
sharpening stone on here is where well

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.039 
sharpening stone on here is where well
as<00:00:51.829> a<00:00:51.859> parallel<00:00:52.339> or<00:00:52.370> magnesium<00:00:52.760> rod<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:53.359> here

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:54.049 
as a parallel or magnesium rod and here

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:56.529 
as a parallel or magnesium rod and here
on<00:00:54.260> his<00:00:54.440> and<00:00:54.799> his<00:00:55.519> original<00:00:55.940> sheet<00:00:56.179> as<00:00:56.329> you<00:00:56.420> can

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
on his and his original sheet as you can

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:57.789 
on his and his original sheet as you can
see<00:00:56.690> this<00:00:56.780> was<00:00:56.959> the<00:00:56.989> original<00:00:57.079> sheath<00:00:57.649> they

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:57.799 
see this was the original sheath they

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:59.020 
see this was the original sheath they
came<00:00:57.979> with<00:00:58.129> it's<00:00:58.339> still<00:00:58.519> holding<00:00:58.789> up<00:00:58.850> real

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
came with it's still holding up real

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.329 
came with it's still holding up real
well<00:00:59.329> the<00:01:00.229> only<00:01:00.350> other<00:01:00.440> modifications<00:01:01.159> that

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
well the only other modifications that

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:02.919 
well the only other modifications that
we've<00:01:01.459> done<00:01:01.639> to<00:01:01.729> these<00:01:01.850> is<00:01:02.089> we've<00:01:02.269> each<00:01:02.420> put<00:01:02.780> on

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
we've done to these is we've each put on

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.660 
we've done to these is we've each put on
kind<00:01:03.739> of<00:01:03.859> a<00:01:03.920> drop<00:01:04.129> with<00:01:04.760> a<00:01:04.790> drop<00:01:05.860> loop<00:01:06.860> with

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
kind of a drop with a drop loop with

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.040 
kind of a drop with a drop loop with
snaps<00:01:08.120> on<00:01:08.330> it<00:01:08.480> and<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.660> reason<00:01:08.870> we<00:01:08.930> do<00:01:09.020> that

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
snaps on it and the reason we do that

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.690 
snaps on it and the reason we do that
primarily<00:01:09.410> is<00:01:09.800> when<00:01:10.010> we<00:01:10.190> have<00:01:10.340> these<00:01:10.490> on

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
primarily is when we have these on

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.860 
primarily is when we have these on
sometimes<00:01:11.150> we're<00:01:11.300> getting<00:01:11.540> in<00:01:11.660> and<00:01:11.780> out<00:01:11.810> of

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
sometimes we're getting in and out of

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.750 
sometimes we're getting in and out of
the<00:01:11.990> truck<00:01:12.200> it's<00:01:12.740> a<00:01:12.920> nice<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.280> clip<00:01:13.460> this<00:01:13.580> off

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
the truck it's a nice to clip this off

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.790 
the truck it's a nice to clip this off
and<00:01:14.510> then<00:01:14.630> be<00:01:14.780> able<00:01:14.870> to<00:01:15.080> just<00:01:15.500> throw<00:01:15.620> it<00:01:15.680> in<00:01:15.740> the

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
and then be able to just throw it in the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.310 
and then be able to just throw it in the
truck<00:01:15.980> versus<00:01:16.340> having<00:01:16.640> it<00:01:16.760> on<00:01:17.140> we're<00:01:18.140> gonna<00:01:18.260> be

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
truck versus having it on we're gonna be

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.480 
truck versus having it on we're gonna be
getting<00:01:18.470> in<00:01:18.650> down<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:18.950> truck<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.160> lot<00:01:19.400> or

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
getting in down to the truck a lot or

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.360 
getting in down to the truck a lot or
whatever<00:01:19.610> pull<00:01:20.570> them<00:01:20.660> out<00:01:20.750> we're<00:01:21.680> still<00:01:21.890> one

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
whatever pull them out we're still one

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.440 
whatever pull them out we're still one
of<00:01:22.460> them<00:01:22.550> biggest<00:01:22.820> complaints<00:01:23.090> we<00:01:23.150> still<00:01:23.330> have

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
of them biggest complaints we still have

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.660 
of them biggest complaints we still have
is<00:01:23.600> we<00:01:23.720> don't<00:01:24.020> like<00:01:24.230> how<00:01:24.890> this<00:01:25.010> flops<00:01:25.340> around

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
is we don't like how this flops around

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.310 
is we don't like how this flops around
when<00:01:25.850> he's<00:01:25.940> come<00:01:26.120> off<00:01:26.270> but<00:01:26.600> we've<00:01:26.990> learned<00:01:27.170> to

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
when he's come off but we've learned to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.440 
when he's come off but we've learned to
live<00:01:27.440> with<00:01:27.590> that<00:01:27.620> this<00:01:28.610> is<00:01:28.760> mine<00:01:28.940> you<00:01:29.090> can<00:01:29.240> see

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
live with that this is mine you can see

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.050 
live with that this is mine you can see
though<00:01:30.440> some<00:01:31.010> of<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.160> we're<00:01:31.340> from<00:01:32.030> different

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
though some of the we're from different

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.610 
though some of the we're from different
batana<00:01:32.720> in<00:01:32.900> that<00:01:33.050> whereas<00:01:33.320> some<00:01:33.470> of<00:01:33.560> the
