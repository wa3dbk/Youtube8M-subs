00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:08.230
 not so they can not attack us 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.340
 easily in classes plans 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.080
 we are going to file 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.260
 after 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.380
 We are going to leave 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.150
 do not tell me reverse plans 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.090
 csd 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.650
 here 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.840
 a text viewer 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:36.620
 then we're going to go where he says 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.440
 here in this part we put you 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.500
 there is supposed to say 500 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.620
 but we put 5000 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.079
 and here 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:52.530
 they are level 10 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.990
 level 10 and they have 5500 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.030
 we are level 2 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.160
 I will have 5000 level 37 thousand level 49 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.300

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.220
 we can not save ok we close our 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.930
 class implementation plans 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.930
 we open beaches plans 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.800

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.060
 there 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:55.460
 The level 2 mortar has foundations damage 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:59.010
 per second that's a lot because 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.340
 level 2 should not say 5 damage 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.790
 per second and 1000 of life has and 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.170
 should have 450 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.640
