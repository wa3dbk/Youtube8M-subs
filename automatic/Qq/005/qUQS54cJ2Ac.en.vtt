systems are even at a glance anybody can

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.950 
systems are even at a glance anybody can
figure<00:00:28.830> out<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.340> 7800<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.449> better<00:00:30.720> than

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
figure out that 7800 is better than

to play that thing like a piano are
there<00:01:35.880> really<00:01:36.090> going<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.720> many<00:01:37.110> games

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
there really going to be that many games

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.730 
there really going to be that many games
that<00:01:37.680> use<00:01:37.860> four<00:01:38.250> buttons<00:01:39.000> since<00:01:39.840> its<00:01:40.020> Nintendo
