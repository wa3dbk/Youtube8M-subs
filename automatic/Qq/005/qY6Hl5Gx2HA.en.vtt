00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.549
 and footwear is an implement that 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.529
 We use to protect our feet 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.809
 currently fulfills the same function 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.820
 but it is also a high product 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.799
 added value for its technology in the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.020
 production and for innovations in 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.060
 design and materials today we will see the 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.160
 complete process of manufacturing a 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.380
 leather shoe first so that 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.720
 can make a production of the center 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.910
 that is much more commercial is to define the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.160
 last that is used and the sole 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.500
 begins to define then the concept 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.690
 that will have the designs to work 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.489
 after having defined the concept of 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.469
 the collection what we started then 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.899
 is to make a quick sketch of the last 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.480
 for her, what are we going to 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.730
 work directly do several 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.350
 several designs after the sketches are 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.050
 makes a selection of sketches what 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.270
 we do is digitize the last after 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.550
 of having digitized the last we passed 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.010
 the sketch that we already made in lines 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.469
 when it is already in print we print and 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.129
 we make a test a test shirt 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.129
 of footwear 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.100
 and 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.650
 once delivered to the footwear design 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.990
 we started with the modeling process or 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.910
 pattern of the same then mask 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.670
 evening more lining the last by one of 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.940
 its sides was especially on the side 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.979
 external to take out the shirt pattern or 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.530
 copy of the ornament proceed to trace what 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.660
 which are points and guidelines for later 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.759
 they went on flat we put the shirt 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:44.180
 copy of the standard and we lower it on a 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:47.149
 cardboard to paste on white and 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.130
 that I start what is the part of 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.039
 modeling is to the drawing part of the 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.050
 of the design that they gave me previously 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.630
 that drawing that is to organize everything that 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.729
 is the drawing in general and the model 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.420
 How is the shoe once the 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.610
 drawing we pull the drawing the draft are 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.280
 some small wheels that selects the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.959
 drawing to be able to draw the pattern of 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.800
 the molds of each of the pieces that 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.800
 make up the model 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.030
 we start the cutting process we are 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.940
 using a silver point mine 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.940
 to scratch the line of armed 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.200
 let's go to another process that is called 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.390
 roughing roughing which is to lower the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.819
 chalice of the jurisdiction to be able to work it 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:45.930
 this is passed to a porsche another process 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:49.049
 which calls armed or we finish the process 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.680
 of armed we went to the other process of 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.680
 sewing 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.030
 we proceed to prepare the template to 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.950
 prepare the cut and then the rector the 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.960
 assembly on each of your machines that 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.910
 place the friends the wise are the 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.920
 reinforcements that place you which court 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.990
 in the front that is for 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.760
 protect the foot and to shape the 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.070
 shoe in the back that is the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.860
 buttress that is to protect the foot 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.920
 and the shape of the shoe is conformed 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.560
 Cutting in the forming machine 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.760
 Buttresses to give shape to the 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:31.090
 cut by means of heat then it is passed to 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.570
 the vaporizer machine and it is mounted on 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.700
 the point mount machine without system 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.470
 that demonstrate the point the machine 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.380
 electropneumatic there we go riding 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.960
 the sides that is an editor of laos or 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.810
 in French electrical system and then it 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.490
 passes the mount of cuffs or heels that 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.540
 is to close the heel after that 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.880
 we would go to the part of the aged that 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.040
 it's a beautifying oven 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.240
 electropneumatic and then we would go to the 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.140
 part of discarded 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.050
 and seated the shoe then mounted 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.330
 that peace was that settled 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.000
 hammer and loaded already proceeds to the 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:18.260
 part in his age that is to stick the sole 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:22.160
 of the shoe mounted on the standard we receive 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.470
 the footwear from the assembly process and 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.870
 in your ice cream and we already went through the process 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:33.140
 completion we pass to a 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:35.180
 process that cleaning glue already 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.450
 being clean we proceed to inking 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.970
 Laces and edges of the soles 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.520
 where sometimes they spent with the 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.670
 carded and what we do is a 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.700
 application of special waxes that 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:52.250
 they will help close the pores and give 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.740
 the final hue of the footwear we come 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.890
 to the final process that is to shine 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.470
 for this we support ourselves with some 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.240
 cotton brushes we come is already at 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.360
 final process that is 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:12.650
 template 2 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:14.120
 cordoned off for more information about 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.280
 the manufacture of footwear and 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.110
 leather goods go to the center of 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.100
 leather manufacturing design 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:26.800
 located at 63 street number 58 b 03
