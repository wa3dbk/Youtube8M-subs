00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:32.440 

I've<00:00:08.400> been<00:00:08.639> running<00:00:08.790> in<00:00:09.090> it<00:00:09.240> now<00:00:19.220> as<00:00:20.220> well

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.030 

there's<00:00:33.450> 2/3<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.110> underneath<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.890> your

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
there's 2/3 of that underneath of your

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.979 
there's 2/3 of that underneath of your
foot<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.600> gonna<00:00:36.600> be<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> more<00:00:36.989> structured

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
foot is gonna be a more structured

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.720 
foot is gonna be a more structured
density<00:00:39.989> foam<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.010> more<00:00:41.160> supportive

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
density foam so it's more supportive

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.700 
density foam so it's more supportive
then<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.270> outside<00:00:42.690> has<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.170> nice<00:00:43.350> soft

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
then the outside has that nice soft

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.360 
then the outside has that nice soft
crash<00:00:44.010> pad<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> little<00:00:44.780> softer<00:00:45.780> foam<00:00:46.530> substance

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
crash pad a little softer foam substance

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.229 
crash pad a little softer foam substance
I<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.640> think<00:00:48.329> compared<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.579> the<00:00:50.579> last<00:00:50.820> model

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
I do think compared to the last model

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.819 
I do think compared to the last model
and<00:00:51.360> then<00:00:51.480> especially<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:52.079> model<00:00:52.350> before<00:00:52.680> it

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
and then especially the model before it

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.150 
and then especially the model before it
it<00:00:53.100> feels<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.820> little<00:00:53.850> bit<00:00:54.270> stiffer<00:00:55.160> it's

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
it feels just a little bit stiffer it's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.189 
it feels just a little bit stiffer it's
that<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.850> would<00:00:57.300> kind<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.570> always<00:00:57.780> put<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.109> in

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
that I would kind of always put it in

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.580 
that I would kind of always put it in
the<00:00:58.289> light<00:00:58.469> stability<00:00:59.090> I<00:01:00.109> think<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.289> a

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
the light stability I think it's a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.100 
the light stability I think it's a
genius<00:01:02.250> way<00:01:04.549> just<00:01:05.549> as<00:01:05.670> stability<00:01:06.119> decoupled

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
genius way just as stability decoupled

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.899 
genius way just as stability decoupled
heel<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:07.830> when<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.070> land<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.640> it

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
heel here so when you land on that it

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.940 
heel here so when you land on that it
flexes<00:01:09.390> nice<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.780> smooth<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.229> they<00:01:10.619> keep<00:01:10.830> it

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
flexes nice and smooth and they keep it

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.520 
flexes nice and smooth and they keep it
on<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.189> outside<00:01:11.549> very<00:01:11.820> smooth<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.630> flexible

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
on the outside very smooth and flexible

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.950 
on the outside very smooth and flexible
and<00:01:14.119> decoupled<00:01:15.119> all<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> way<00:01:15.450> through<00:01:15.720> here

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
and decoupled all the way through here

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.020 
and decoupled all the way through here
on<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.530> inside<00:01:16.950> you'll<00:01:17.189> see<00:01:17.369> right<00:01:17.549> here<00:01:17.759> what

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
on the inside you'll see right here what

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.370 
on the inside you'll see right here what
they<00:01:18.180> do<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.479> they<00:01:18.600> fill<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.229> little

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
they do is they fill that in a little

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.899 
they do is they fill that in a little
bit<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:20.070> they're<00:01:20.220> giving<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> nice

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
bit what they're giving you is a nice

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.940 
bit what they're giving you is a nice
stable<00:01:21.509> landing<00:01:21.840> site<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.500> been<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> shoe<00:01:22.890> I

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
stable landing site it's been a shoe I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.710 
stable landing site it's been a shoe I
probably<00:01:23.250> enjoyed<00:01:23.670> more<00:01:26.000> so<00:01:27.000> as<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> big<00:01:27.360> over

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
probably enjoyed more so as a big over

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:36.760 
probably enjoyed more so as a big over
pronator<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.530> giving<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.009> enough<00:01:29.280> support

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.069 

and<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:39.150> tongue<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:39.720> too<00:01:39.900> bulky

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
and the tongue is not too bulky

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.620 
and the tongue is not too bulky
sometimes<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.860> gives<00:01:41.040> extra<00:01:41.759> fat<00:01:41.939> on<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
sometimes that gives extra fat on the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.260 
sometimes that gives extra fat on the
medial<00:01:43.020> side<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.500> shoe<00:01:43.619> they<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> nice

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
medial side of the shoe they have a nice

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.249 
medial side of the shoe they have a nice
arch<00:01:45.689> wrap<00:01:46.079> here<00:01:46.790> that<00:01:47.790> will<00:01:48.420> really<00:01:48.780> cinch<00:01:49.049> up

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
arch wrap here that will really cinch up

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.990 
arch wrap here that will really cinch up
through<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> arch<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.520> get<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.820> close

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
through the arch and if I get it close

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.730 
through the arch and if I get it close
enough<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.540> camera<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.259> kind<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> see

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
enough to the camera you can kind of see

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.859 
enough to the camera you can kind of see
the<00:01:52.920> weave<00:01:53.130> underneath<00:01:53.670> there<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.090> what<00:01:54.720> they

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
the weave underneath there and what they

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.420 
the weave underneath there and what they
do<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.170> they<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> inside<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
do is they do that on the inside of the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.910 
do is they do that on the inside of the
shoe<00:01:56.610> but<00:01:57.479> not<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> outside<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.770> what

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
shoe but not on the outside and so what

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.920 
shoe but not on the outside and so what
you<00:01:59.040> get<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.880> really<00:02:00.090> fill<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.570> up<00:02:00.630> in

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
you get is you really fill that up in

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.510 
you get is you really fill that up in
your<00:02:00.960> arch<00:02:01.229> where<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.560> need<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> support<00:02:02.310> and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
your arch where you need the support and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.980 
your arch where you need the support and
then<00:02:02.820> one<00:02:03.000> other<00:02:03.149> thing<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.479> I've<00:02:03.689> heard<00:02:03.930> a

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
then one other thing that I've heard a

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.080 
then one other thing that I've heard a
lot<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.170> people<00:02:04.500> say<00:02:04.770> before<00:02:05.490> they<00:02:05.640> try<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.939> on

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
lot of people say before they try it on

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.639 
lot of people say before they try it on
is<00:02:06.890> that<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.039> looks<00:02:08.369> like

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
is that it looks like

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:09.929 
is that it looks like
there's<00:02:08.799> not<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:08.950> lot<00:02:09.099> of<00:02:09.129> structure<00:02:09.459> to<00:02:09.640> the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:09.939 
there's not a lot of structure to the

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.390 
there's not a lot of structure to the
top<00:02:10.119> of<00:02:10.269> the<00:02:10.360> shoe<00:02:10.680> but<00:02:11.680> they've<00:02:11.860> done<00:02:12.099> it<00:02:12.220> kind

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
top of the shoe but they've done it kind

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.100 
top of the shoe but they've done it kind
of<00:02:12.519> with<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.849> weave<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.450> fabric<00:02:13.900> rather

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
of with the weave and the fabric rather

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.990 
of with the weave and the fabric rather
than<00:02:14.349> a<00:02:14.379> lot<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.709> overlays<00:02:15.220> which<00:02:15.610> takes<00:02:15.849> some

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
than a lot of overlays which takes some

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.970 
than a lot of overlays which takes some
of<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.180> weight<00:02:16.420> out<00:02:16.599> so<00:02:17.230> it's<00:02:17.470> still<00:02:17.769> nice

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
of that weight out so it's still nice

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.369 
of that weight out so it's still nice
and<00:02:18.010> structured<00:02:18.670> on<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.939> top<00:02:19.150> it's<00:02:20.110> just<00:02:20.170> not

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
and structured on the top it's just not

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.740 
and structured on the top it's just not
something<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.680> see<00:02:21.040> or<00:02:21.250> necessarily<00:02:21.970> feel

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
something you see or necessarily feel

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.059 
something you see or necessarily feel
when<00:02:23.049> you<00:02:23.110> put<00:02:23.290> your<00:02:23.470> hand<00:02:23.620> on<00:02:23.739> it<00:02:23.799> but<00:02:24.010> you

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
hasn't rubbed me the wrong way this is

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.280 
hasn't rubbed me the wrong way this is
ten<00:02:59.200> point<00:02:59.409> four<00:02:59.620> ounces<00:03:00.069> on<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.340> guys<00:03:00.519> side

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
ten point four ounces on the guys side

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.170 
ten point four ounces on the guys side
which<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.680> pegasus<00:03:03.189> is<00:03:03.220> only<00:03:03.489> ten<00:03:03.760> point<00:03:03.970> two

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.360 
which the pegasus is only ten point two
ounces<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:04.720> point<00:03:05.230> two<00:03:05.409> ounces<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:06.099> you<00:03:06.189> get<00:03:06.340> a

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
ounces so point two ounces and you get a

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.800 
ounces so point two ounces and you get a
stability<00:03:06.639> shoe<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:07.299> if<00:03:07.389> you're<00:03:07.510> someone<00:03:07.780> that

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
stability shoe so if you're someone that

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.879 
stability shoe so if you're someone that
needs<00:03:08.049> stability<00:03:08.560> but<00:03:08.680> you're<00:03:08.799> always

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
needs stability but you're always

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.710 
needs stability but you're always
complaining<00:03:09.220> about<00:03:09.519> having<00:03:10.090> a<00:03:10.299> heavy<00:03:10.450> shoe

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
complaining about having a heavy shoe

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.099 
complaining about having a heavy shoe
this<00:03:11.200> isn't<00:03:11.590> heavy<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:12.870> structure<00:03:13.870> still

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
this isn't heavy the structure still

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.319 
this isn't heavy the structure still
keeps<00:03:14.379> that<00:03:14.560> waffle<00:03:14.859> outsole<00:03:15.639> on<00:03:15.849> the<00:03:16.120> front

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
keeps that waffle outsole on the front

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.809 
keeps that waffle outsole on the front
end<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:16.900> you<00:03:16.989> still<00:03:17.260> get<00:03:17.349> traction<00:03:17.709> for<00:03:18.430> sloppy

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
end so you still get traction for sloppy

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.909 
end so you still get traction for sloppy
