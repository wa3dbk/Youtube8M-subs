 a little experimentally but even 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.490
 bagram composition 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.910
 Ekaterinburg team serzh is teeth in 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:33.649
 the attack of the Urals 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:36.270
 urala here their cockroaches well and the match itself 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.730
 of course it's a pity 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.040
 20 minutes a and Samedov serves on 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.230
 Ko-Ko-ko-ko scores a great 10 th 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.780
 the channel is now so severing 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.570
 Yekaterinburg 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.969
 but no yekaterinburg just grabbed 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.460
 teeth and their gates and could not 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.219
 Spartacus to score he here with the barbell 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.930
 recording riley 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.579
 aural took yes abundant series 2 minutes 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.530
 almost the only one with its attack 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.350
 outing into the wrong gate and here's a goal 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.689
 11 cripple events were just 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.930
 tropical atacama hit the bar 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.200
 just not the gate but here people drank in 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.299
 barbell Ural stood on the world and the closer 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.979
 were 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.170
 ending more time than all 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.799
 more we understood that in the penalty shootout 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.020
 the outcome is not predictable at all, but we 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.049
 continued to attack and continued to peel 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.299
 on the rods as you can see the Urals are not at all 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.670
 attacked because he was just defending 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.700
 and we have nothing like that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.189
 let's see the penalty shootout series 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.350
 penalty in the first stage of the Russian Cup with 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.350
 Ural fucking do called 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.280
 should have been missed in the second half and 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:02:02.000
 now have to punch kicked 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:06.470
 leave order somehow will beat where 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.509
 is here and so nearly so 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.640
 first as a comes to the ball 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.350
 the man who scored then switched to 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:23.209
 right flank and the game as soon as another 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:25.310
 table and sport missed a goal 10 by 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.970
 struck the center although pressed like 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.610
 right it all depends on pischikova which 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:38.830
 again he missed the bank for all the gates in 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.830
 I already got 11 ryzhov 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:51.450
 Artem Dziuba 1215 in the center for some reason 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.790
 although the press right, what is is sick 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:06.020
 of against the sorin and the lanterns themselves 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:08.870
 flashlights shook headphones jean 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.230
 again centered 31 Well yes is something I want to 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:20.480
 why I don't hit the corner 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:24.320
 Lucky while I dirham same by if 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.060
 the accuracy of the Urals would not let down everything 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.560
 Dmitry Kombarov normally would beat at 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:34.160
 Spartak next lap but with pedals 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:38.210
 it will be necessary to practice all the same here 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.920
 in the corner and all 41 lit here dmitri 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.220
 kombarov Spartak to the next major 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:47.330

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:50.530
 horror of joy full pants straight ural 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.530

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:04.920
 fine twenty-four strike Spartacus 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.780
 12 products 7 out of three from the Urals by ownership 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.180
 sword too well the advantage of Spartacus 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.380
 nothing can just talk about 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.620
 to be god did not want everything not to 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:17.489
 won in the main time only 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:20.660
 better as a 80 h grabbed just do not understand 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.660
