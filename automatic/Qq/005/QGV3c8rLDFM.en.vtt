and in the painting world most people

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.570 
and in the painting world most people
aren't<00:00:13.240> really<00:00:13.389> using<00:00:13.840> gel<00:00:14.080> coat<00:00:14.490> it's<00:00:15.490> a

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
really durable hard shell that we're

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.400 
really durable hard shell that we're
paying<00:00:18.279> over<00:00:18.700> that<00:00:19.000> point<00:00:19.210> to<00:00:19.480> some<00:00:20.259> of<00:00:20.320> those

paying over that point to some of those

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.069 
paying over that point to some of those
areas<00:00:20.740> have<00:00:20.860> to<00:00:20.950> be<00:00:21.040> just<00:00:21.220> flat<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.900> they'll

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:23.079 
areas have to be just flat so they'll

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.380 
areas have to be just flat so they'll
block<00:00:23.289> everything<00:00:23.710> down<00:00:24.130> and<00:00:24.490> they'll<00:00:25.060> take

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
block everything down and they'll take

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.839 
block everything down and they'll take
their<00:00:26.050> straight<00:00:26.559> edges<00:00:26.950> and<00:00:27.160> skills<00:00:27.550> and

their straight edges and skills and

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.280 
their straight edges and skills and
they'll<00:00:28.029> measure<00:00:28.270> everything<00:00:28.720> out<00:00:29.020> make<00:00:29.230> sure

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
they'll measure everything out make sure

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.499 
they'll measure everything out make sure
we've<00:00:29.770> you<00:00:30.430> know<00:00:30.460> everything's<00:00:31.000> within<00:00:31.149> the

the time goes into to doing

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.520 
the time goes into to doing
and<00:00:40.180> after<00:00:40.570> they've<00:00:40.720> prepped<00:00:41.020> it<00:00:41.260> and<00:00:41.410> they

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
and after they've prepped it and they

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.410 
and after they've prepped it and they
blow<00:00:41.740> it<00:00:41.860> all<00:00:41.950> off<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:42.400> blow<00:00:42.580> it<00:00:42.640> out<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:43.120> wipe

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
blow it all off and blow it out the wipe

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.130 
blow it all off and blow it out the wipe
the<00:00:44.040> product<00:00:45.040> and<00:00:45.160> you<00:00:45.220> close<00:00:45.490> your<00:00:45.640> off<00:00:45.820> I<00:00:46.330> get

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
the product and you close your off I get

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.170 
the product and you close your off I get
it<00:00:47.260> as<00:00:47.350> clean<00:00:47.590> as<00:00:47.650> they<00:00:47.920> can<00:00:48.100> get<00:00:48.250> it<00:00:48.310> and<00:00:48.640> then

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
it as clean as they can get it and then

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:56.930 
it as clean as they can get it and then
it<00:00:49.570> waits<00:00:49.809> to<00:00:50.020> killing<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.380> paint<00:00:50.590> booth

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.459 

once<00:00:57.940> I<00:00:58.030> get<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.269> boots<00:00:58.449> loaded<00:00:58.870> up<00:00:59.019> you<00:00:59.379> know

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
once I get the boots loaded up you know

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:00.599 
once I get the boots loaded up you know
I'll<00:00:59.710> blow<00:00:59.949> it<00:00:59.980> off

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
I'll blow it off

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.520 
I'll blow it off
and<00:01:00.730> then<00:01:01.059> we<00:01:01.719> have<00:01:01.839> what's<00:01:02.019> called<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:02.289> tack

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
and then we have what's called a tack

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.189 
and then we have what's called a tack
rag<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:04.000> just<00:01:04.180> really<00:01:04.360> sticky<00:01:04.720> and<00:01:04.930> it'll

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
rag it's just really sticky and it'll

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.359 
rag it's just really sticky and it'll
start<00:01:05.560> to<00:01:05.650> pull<00:01:05.860> up<00:01:06.070> any<00:01:07.350> dust<00:01:08.350> or<00:01:08.770> anything

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
start to pull up any dust or anything

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.990 
start to pull up any dust or anything
that's<00:01:09.580> so<00:01:09.909> caught<00:01:10.240> up<00:01:10.479> in<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.830> inside<00:01:12.759> of<00:01:12.790> the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
that's so caught up in the inside of the

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.410 
that's so caught up in the inside of the
enclosure<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:13.780> then<00:01:14.440> after<00:01:14.860> that<00:01:15.240> one<00:01:16.240> more

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
enclosure and then after that one more

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.359 
enclosure and then after that one more
time<00:01:16.450> with<00:01:17.049> the<00:01:17.289> air<00:01:17.649> hose<00:01:17.860> will<00:01:18.190> blow

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
time with the air hose will blow

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:26.670 
time with the air hose will blow
everything<00:01:18.729> off<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:20.409> then<00:01:21.280> I'll<00:01:21.490> rape<00:01:21.880> start

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.520 

one<00:01:27.280> purpose<00:01:27.670> of<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:27.970> sealers<00:01:28.390> is<00:01:28.600> just<00:01:29.350> to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
one purpose of the sealers is just to

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.400 
one purpose of the sealers is just to
get<00:01:29.710> everything<00:01:29.980> kind<00:01:30.400> to<00:01:30.550> a<00:01:30.580> solid<00:01:31.570> uniform

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
get everything kind to a solid uniform

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.880 
get everything kind to a solid uniform
color<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:34.660> other<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:35.290> one<00:01:35.620> of<00:01:35.650> the<00:01:35.740> main

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
color the other and one of the main

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.070 
color the other and one of the main
purpose<00:01:36.280> of<00:01:36.370> the<00:01:36.460> sealer<00:01:36.730> is<00:01:36.940> just<00:01:37.150> it<00:01:37.690> helps

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
purpose of the sealer is just it helps

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.950 
purpose of the sealer is just it helps
bond<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:39.010> paint<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:40.120> the<00:01:40.390> gel<00:01:40.630> or<00:01:40.840> the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
bond the paint to the gel or the

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.290 
bond the paint to the gel or the
substrate<00:01:41.530> so<00:01:41.830> it's<00:01:42.490> really<00:01:42.790> creating<00:01:43.240> a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
substrate so it's really creating a

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.970 
substrate so it's really creating a
barrier<00:01:43.510> and<00:01:43.960> then<00:01:44.080> it<00:01:44.230> spawning<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.800> two

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
barrier and then it spawning the two

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.510 
barrier and then it spawning the two
together<00:01:46.140> over<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.230> first<00:01:47.440> color<00:01:47.680> base<00:01:47.950> on

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
together over the first color base on

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.010 
together over the first color base on
that's<00:01:49.120> where<00:01:49.360> everything<00:01:49.600> pretty<00:01:49.990> much

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
that's where everything pretty much

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.940 
that's where everything pretty much
happens

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.359 

and<00:01:57.070> after<00:01:57.789> that<00:01:57.969> you<00:01:58.479> know<00:01:58.680> go<00:01:59.680> back<00:01:59.890> over

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
and after that you know go back over

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.240 
and after that you know go back over
we'll<00:02:00.880> look<00:02:01.450> over<00:02:01.659> each<00:02:01.869> each<00:02:02.649> individual

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
we'll look over each each individual

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.090 
we'll look over each each individual
piece<00:02:03.490> you<00:02:03.820> know<00:02:03.909> every<00:02:04.270> surface<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.890> you

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
piece you know every surface and you

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.040 
piece you know every surface and you
know<00:02:06.219> that's<00:02:06.399> kind<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.729> what<00:02:06.789> drives<00:02:07.479> me<00:02:07.869> as

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
know that's kind of what drives me as

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.350 
know that's kind of what drives me as
you<00:02:08.349> know<00:02:08.440> as<00:02:08.649> you<00:02:09.580> know<00:02:09.670> we're<00:02:09.819> painting<00:02:10.239> you

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
you know as you know we're painting you

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.970 
you know as you know we're painting you
were<00:02:10.539> constantly<00:02:11.379> changing<00:02:11.950> our<00:02:12.040> technique

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
were constantly changing our technique

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.630 
were constantly changing our technique
just<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.849> improve<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.659> processes<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:16.430> gets

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
just to improve the processes it gets

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.640 
just to improve the processes it gets
down<00:02:16.879> to<00:02:17.060> just<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.390> small<00:02:17.569> little<00:02:17.959> change<00:02:18.379> you

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
down to just a small little change you

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.220 
down to just a small little change you
know<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.890> air<00:02:19.010> pressure<00:02:19.340> how<00:02:20.239> much<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.720> were

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
know the air pressure how much you were

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.470 
know the air pressure how much you were
putting<00:02:21.500> out<00:02:21.650> again<00:02:22.010> or<00:02:22.489> you<00:02:23.269> know<00:02:23.360> the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
putting out again or you know the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.920 
putting out again or you know the
distance<00:02:23.930> from<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.440> enclosure<00:02:25.269> can<00:02:26.269> suddenly

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
distance from the enclosure can suddenly

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.660 
distance from the enclosure can suddenly
make<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.110> big<00:02:27.349> difference<00:02:27.769> in<00:02:27.890> what<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.250> finish

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
make a big difference in what the finish

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.820 
make a big difference in what the finish
and<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.360> outcome<00:02:29.780> will<00:02:29.900> be<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:33.440> I'll<00:02:33.650> put

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
and the outcome will be so and I'll put

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.509 
and the outcome will be so and I'll put
second<00:02:34.280> coat<00:02:34.400> of<00:02:34.430> base<00:02:34.640> on<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.620> usually<00:02:36.620> time

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
second coat of base on and usually time

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.390 
second coat of base on and usually time
I<00:02:37.670> put<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.000> second<00:02:38.330> coat<00:02:38.510> on<00:02:38.540> it's<00:02:39.470> pretty

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
I put the second coat on it's pretty

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.600 
I put the second coat on it's pretty
much<00:02:40.549> there

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
much there

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.310 
much there
and<00:02:42.970> once<00:02:43.240> once<00:02:43.660> we're<00:02:43.900> done<00:02:43.990> with<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.200> base

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
and once once we're done with the base

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.160 
and once once we're done with the base
CO<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:45.520> we'll<00:02:45.670> come<00:02:45.850> back<00:02:46.030> in<00:02:46.270> we'll<00:02:46.780> put<00:02:46.990> out

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
CO and we'll come back in we'll put out

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.699 
CO and we'll come back in we'll put out
three<00:02:47.380> coats<00:02:47.650> clear<00:02:47.980> on<00:02:48.190> there

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.770 

everything<00:02:53.489> can<00:02:53.700> be<00:02:53.970> done<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.450> little<00:02:54.689> bit

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
everything can be done just a little bit

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.780 
everything can be done just a little bit
better<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.319> know<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:55.860> it's<00:02:56.099> just<00:02:56.189> constant

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
better you know so it's just constant

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.670 
better you know so it's just constant
trying<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.090> improve<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.689> take<00:02:58.379> to<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.650> next

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
trying to improve and take to the next

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.449 
trying to improve and take to the next
level

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
level

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.850 
level
so<00:02:59.579> I<00:02:59.849> mean<00:03:00.060> there's<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.299> level<00:03:01.049> of<00:03:01.170> quality<00:03:01.439> and

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
so I mean there's a level of quality and

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.640 
so I mean there's a level of quality and
a<00:03:02.069> standard<00:03:02.819> there<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.689> you<00:03:04.049> know<00:03:04.140> we<00:03:04.409> had

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
a standard there that you know we had

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.780 
a standard there that you know we had

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
speaker we want it to be beautiful I

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.649 
speaker we want it to be beautiful I
mean<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.290> absolute<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:14.010> know<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.549> they<00:03:15.420> know

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
mean the absolute you know and they know

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.740 
mean the absolute you know and they know
that<00:03:16.650> if<00:03:16.799> they<00:03:16.920> do<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.310> right<00:03:17.579> and<00:03:18.299> it<00:03:18.420> comes<00:03:18.629> in

that if they do it right and it comes in

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.240 
that if they do it right and it comes in
hearing<00:03:18.989> it's<00:03:19.079> painted<00:03:19.439> I<00:03:19.560> mean<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:20.129> end
