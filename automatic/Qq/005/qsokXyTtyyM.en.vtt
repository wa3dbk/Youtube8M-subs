 I'm interested also happy with 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.260
 the first thing that occurred to me is the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.850
 synthie media that drives you crazy 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.579

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.059
 take these companies gives these 200 euros 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.170
 crisis for the eyes the face no 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.030
 notion of the most diverse 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.549
 most expensive krems the corresponding 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.110
 eternal and beautiful skin you lie there 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.010
 Just make it fresh and healthy for a long time 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.420
 look 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.770
 I have it now if I have the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.330
 dance see of me or at the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.250
 grandmother or my mother 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.140
 we just got away from it for a very long time 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.400
 healthy fresh food lived in 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.320
 tunesia so i can stick to it 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.450
 Remember when we were there when we got there 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.740
 flown are the beautiful place one 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.659
 game then I'd really 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.820
 show their life in the mountains in 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.590
 Tunisia it is very green there 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.479
 have fresh spring water so there is 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.009
 such a source that comes poodle that 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.360
 water out so if you are water 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.680
 Stopped and had mine 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.540
 relatives there or always have them 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.009
 still fresh spring water and it is 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.360
 exactly the culprit in the house so you have to 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.500
 can sometimes run back then takes 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.479
 a coup with me then I always am 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.649
 thought along as a small child was then so 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.659
 get a little egg or 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.520
 also a pitcher you have done great and 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.990
 it was not completely different water 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.310
 like the dead water from ours 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.320
 faucet what am I going to filter though 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.729
 and hope that the water was that 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.210
 really powerful thing quite 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.200
 other 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.570
 that helps again the skin yes the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.680
 to give power just to look fresh 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.310
 Have fresh water you had one 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.360
 clean air no chemicals polluted air 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.780
 like here with us now 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.730
 and why they are still so fresh healthy 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.650
 skin was that they are very green 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.300
 have then eaten my tunes 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.940
 mother, my father has my husband too 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.170
 tell me that when he was little that 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.280
 they ate a lot of green so 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.280
 no salads like here 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.560
 They did not have the salads right now 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.239
 Enjoying here, they were wild 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.900
 Green's hand fell on the fields 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.670
 worked 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.410
 and because they told me that the 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.120
 parents have shown the can 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.830
 it's not poisonous to you that's not 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.810
 poisonous you can not eat that 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.300
 or just have a lot during the day 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.130
 eaten wildly and yes fresh 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.810
 water then have this wild cool it 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.620
 Generally , people do not say so 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.390
 much like today 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.580
 I have myself as I always do 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.140
 I'm eating here again all day 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.300
 the carrot then again an apple 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.500
 is healthy but want to tell 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.970
 the body regenerates itself when 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.989
 Rest a bit there insulin level 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.440
 if I go up and down all the time 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.540
 jump 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.100
 So I think what is important if you 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.350
 really long fresh and healthy 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.390
 want to look like it's exaggerating 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.010
 Eating fresh food with food 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.130
 so fresh living food as for 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.820
 For example, many have sprouted wildly 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.750
 green in any case a lot of green and 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.120
 unprocessed foods that help 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.680
 then what is very important is the 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.000
 inner attitude when I think of mine 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.110
 Aunts think they were always happy 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.060
 I've always thought so much about 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.560
 Although sung have worked a lot but 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.090
 both work that was something quite 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.030
 Others are always at home 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.500
 huge house just big family times 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.850
 sat together that happened 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.560
 play together they were cooked 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.660
 So in the garden really one 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.489
 wonderful time has been there and 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.079
 they were just happy and happy 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.280
 and they were not the richest, though 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.780
 they did not have everything 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.370
 what you want the newest 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.750
 mobile tv on tv so the 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.280
 We finished the women 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.990
 Seen there can be serious as someone 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.000
 Remember you sometimes hear radio 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.470
 that's why it's the whole day 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.819
 to be busy with the children 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.490
 Though the animals are busy 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.430
 beautiful the cows the chickens the 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.410
 then sheep in the garden and this 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.560
 environment this clean environment this 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.510
 positive energy broadcast this 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.700
 have magic eat the fresh water 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.319
 I think that was very fresh 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.450
 kept and very young and hold her 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.880
 have this whole make up does not mean 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.859
 so yes take long for fresh and young 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.380
 and looking healthy is that possible 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.180
 with a positive attitude and with 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.090
 fresh food fresh water 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.530
 and go to bed early so my 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.200
 have been 44 points 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.660
 some points where i think the whole 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.350
 are important and make a lot of power 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.330
 with the children 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.770
 I hope that today we like it 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
 I'll love you all youtuber again 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.900
