00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.970
 Hi guys, I welcome you back to music making de Aleks Vesper here 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:17.579
 to have 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:22.569
 because and the distribution has come to us the new Metalurgs announce pedals 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.380
 let once the double Dahl variant 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.989
 and the frames 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.930
 that is one-tenth of the batteries 190 Euro Tidof the pedal variant 419 Euro 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.649
 around 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.139
 Marbecks has left a very long time leads these pedals 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.190
 and I find that quite expensive are really great technical innovations 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.980
 can 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.770
 That's how I want to explain you this time 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.770
 around 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.130
 Not only millions of euros, of course, is the variant that they either felt with 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.280
 or play with rubber 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.640
 the whole will 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.170
 commercially 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.210
 arrested with his in the back room r 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.530
 but it comes to the first flight 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.620
 I can with these plans in the bus 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.420
 here drinks 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.340
 two poems 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.170
 lock 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.170
 or take out the one are 20 grams of weight 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.750
 or for example a smaller ten grams 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.130
 that means I can vary how much power 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.180
 I want to transfer on the clubhead 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.820
 Percent and its highest point not over other companies by doing a ski 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.150
 Bars Weight I find myself very central to things an exciting thing 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.820
 then percent 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.780
 Like other manufacturers, work here is very well done 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.860
 processed 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.120
 Camichel this transmission switch concentric on the eccentric 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.270
 the center episode has depending on when the point of maximum 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.070
 power transmission 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.470
 attacks 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.450
 Percent is a really great thing for example 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.570
 this was this one 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.230
 Percent Velcro 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.260
 the one else percent only 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.680
 KlÃ¤den could 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.550
 You can do that here now 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.710
 under screwdrivers 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.950
 this means 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.479
 I play on a percent surface where I actually do not need it 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.370
 Imes again and just get along with the tutors and the rubber surface 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.009
 I have bigger problems with the adhesion screw's turn 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:21.759
 sick to choose freely else is still to say the min 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.469
 The pedals are very narrow and I think that's great 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:30.760
 because by multiples often a bit space problem arise through 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:32.840
 Gate tower feet through the 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.199
 Hayek machine 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.510
 so that can not be narrow enough for me, not so big a stage 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:39.469
 to have a big tread 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:43.539
 the percent included came a joint here still has the little feature 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:49.049
 that your Suisse extendable a maximum of 50 cents meters this is a stop here 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.179
 means no 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:53.699
 More of these little gadgets lose their not that super 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:57.680
 the whole the Verdener becomes possible very robust 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.539
 COF 8 so that's the beautiful one 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:04.119
 These costs will be preserved for as long as possible in March 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:05.549
 Comfort 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.450
 Encrypt with small porches for twelve young rolls for the wave 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.459
 should that be animal man z and then let's see how it all works 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.789
 pike 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.970
 the new MacBooks 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.529
 Hawk pedals 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:46.810
 Zingel variant 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.129
 but the variant 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.289
 quite the OSE part I have now I would be here for this trick 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:52.129
 decided 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:55.119
 with the double card to work with a few simple steps is also the 

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:57.719
 Band Varian Kirst and assemble 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:01.079
 Percent there are quite a few technical innovations and features in this 

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:03.779
 Machine in the magazine can read how I think 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:06.189
 I sometimes have to go here too 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.999
 You can see that there is no play between the pedals 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:12.110
 between the beats 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.059
 just the stuff of Dios 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:18.360
 That is on site and the grandiose thought out 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.409
 around 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:22.860
 I think and painting has a lot of possibilities 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.789
 in some time the 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:26.870
 optimal personal 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.500
 Put trumpet all together next to these down screws 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.169
 So what's on my side, we'll go back to music
