00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
because I I could learn it was only

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.280 
because I I could learn it was only
about<00:01:06.710> 60<00:01:07.250> or<00:01:07.340> 70<00:01:07.670> kilometres<00:01:08.210> long<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.630> I

about 60 or 70 kilometres long and I

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.260 
about 60 or 70 kilometres long and I
could<00:01:09.470> learn<00:01:09.619> that<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.520> it<00:01:10.640> took<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:10.880> few<00:01:11.000> weeks
