00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.330
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:17.119
 new short guide to the story section 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:24.680
 devour and that we protect 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:26.029
 all weapons outside the concordia you 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.720
 have seen it like the first one 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.090
 section of the mission ended and must 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:40.610
 now here directions 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:42.559
 northwest to look for lindsey 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.780
 I say so and then we have the 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.970
 First I do not know if you like it 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.710
 the need to remove really here because 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:54.140
 I'll probably make new ones anyway 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.760
 now just looks up there on the 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:02.890
 map already the green circle there must go 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:05.149
 to lindsay in connection we have to 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.000
 back to the south are these 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:13.820
 direction and certainly not north 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.950
 But then do not go the success anymore 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:21.820
 we have something else to complete 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.820
 a trashy and nice dog 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.270
 after we have defeated the two 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:40.299
 Now from cave in which there is still 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.299
 so threshing and 23 francs 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:53.789
 unfortunately a man does not help 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.270
 much decomposed so the end effect is the success 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.270
 not so hard 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.189
 just have to be fast enough 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.899
 that none of the npcs dies that is 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:13.910
 much easier than in the concordia 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:16.489
 himself the fortress and here in the cave 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.350
 is also relatively easy the three 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.310
 then can hold against on the spot 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.310
 one with a little bit of area damage 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.700
 quickly clear away so online now with 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.819
 lindsay speak the dialogue but fast 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.819
 by 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.819
 then out and turn right again 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.019
 there we have the 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.890
 first npcs since already fights one 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:47.660
 have apparently come back again 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.420
 others in any case so here we have 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.239
 three npcs that's the one in front of you 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.920
 us then back right on the tree, too 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.970
 fights and is on top of the tower too 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.760
 one must by no means 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.799
 to forget 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.090
 but he is well protected and wants 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.090
 I think not attacked first 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.829
 fight back there what else can I contribute 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.310
 I also have to protect them 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:17.030
 believe that is not my part of 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.070
 Successful so that all appeal 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:25.299
 they give a short feedback 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:25.299
 then go on the third one up here 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.530
 Thanks, we can but then 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.420
 ignore it when you run away 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:40.720
 the one below is also often attacked 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:44.049
 from a thresher this time but not so 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.519
 then up here in the north 2 it can 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:52.060
 in the northwest, it is the ones that have become 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:57.760
 apparently already helped myself so 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:03.160
 better then it goes through here once 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.319
 the river and then I think so too 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.069
 only one more 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.750
 By the way, if you have the mission and 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.370
 several people do two or so 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.040
 more then there are more in the pc segment 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.989
 I have to save now only the way 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:22.630
 for the solo times so and from the last 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.520
 he's also struggling in my fight right now 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.350
 principle are when the way with two 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:32.440
 people, for example, still further east 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.510
 two more people like it 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.099
 I do not know so much more people 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.450
 but then address the last one too 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.820
 and then the same is true directly 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.150
 Success also fills the success 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.280
 beautiful 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.780
 well maybe it will watch you 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.470
 Here I hope I could give you one 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.810
 help a little 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.979
 The success is really as hard as we are 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.099
 See you next time up 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.099
 then
