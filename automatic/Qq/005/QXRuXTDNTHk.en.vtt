team in that poll there will be a video

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.670 
team in that poll there will be a video
explaining<00:00:25.880> my<00:00:26.360> series<00:00:26.779> idea<00:00:26.990> for<00:00:27.170> that<00:00:27.350> and

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
explaining my series idea for that and

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.410 
explaining my series idea for that and
then<00:00:28.100> you<00:00:28.130> guys<00:00:28.490> will<00:00:28.760> give<00:00:28.970> your<00:00:29.060> input<00:00:29.210> on

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
then you guys will give your input on

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.179 
then you guys will give your input on
that<00:00:29.539> so<00:00:29.810> this<00:00:30.199> is<00:00:30.260> kind<00:00:30.590> of<00:00:30.680> a<00:00:30.740> secondary

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
that so this is kind of a secondary

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.279 
that so this is kind of a secondary
series<00:00:31.520> I<00:00:31.609> guess<00:00:31.789> to<00:00:32.300> that<00:00:32.509> while<00:00:33.050> the

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:33.289 
series I guess to that while the

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:34.779 
series I guess to that while the
rebuilding<00:00:33.920> series<00:00:34.190> is<00:00:34.309> still<00:00:34.460> going<00:00:34.609> on

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
he's playing the Spurs I mean that's

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.129 
he's playing the Spurs I mean that's
basically<00:04:04.980> my<00:04:05.489> you<00:04:05.940> know<00:04:06.060> logic<00:04:06.569> on<00:04:06.690> that<00:04:06.900> the

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
basically my you know logic on that the

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.009 
basically my you know logic on that the
Spurs<00:04:07.379> will<00:04:08.370> forever<00:04:08.849> have<00:04:09.150> LeBrons<00:04:09.720> number

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
Spurs will forever have LeBrons number

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.979 
Spurs will forever have LeBrons number
they<00:04:10.169> should<00:04:10.949> have<00:04:11.040> beat<00:04:11.190> them<00:04:11.280> two<00:04:12.269> times<00:04:12.569> in

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
they should have beat them two times in

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.039 
they should have beat them two times in
a<00:04:13.139> row<00:04:13.319> two<00:04:14.159> years<00:04:14.340> ago<00:04:14.720> you<00:04:15.720> know<00:04:15.840> two<00:04:15.900> years

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
a row two years ago you know two years

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.740 
a row two years ago you know two years
ago<00:04:16.289> and<00:04:16.620> then<00:04:16.739> last<00:04:17.099> year<00:04:17.340> so<00:04:17.849> you<00:04:18.570> know<00:04:18.720> I

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
ago and then last year so you know I

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.420 
ago and then last year so you know I
think<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.349> Spurs<00:04:19.680> err<00:04:19.859> will<00:04:20.070> always<00:04:20.280> be

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
think that Spurs err will always be

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.940 
think that Spurs err will always be
superior<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.659> LeBron<00:04:22.169> I'm<00:04:22.560> going<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.830> stop

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
superior to LeBron I'm going to stop

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:23.659 
superior to LeBron I'm going to stop
talking<00:04:23.190> about<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.430> though<00:04:23.550> because

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
talking about that though because

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.890 
talking about that though because
there's<00:04:23.909> really<00:04:24.030> no<00:04:24.180> point<00:04:24.330> talking<00:04:24.539> about<00:04:24.690> it

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
there's really no point talking about it

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.870 
there's really no point talking about it
so<00:04:25.349> look<00:04:25.680> at<00:04:25.860> all<00:04:26.039> of<00:04:26.070> those<00:04:26.310> injuries

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
so look at all of those injuries

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.450 
so look at all of those injuries
you<00:04:27.030> see<00:04:27.240> we<00:04:27.780> are<00:04:27.900> tied<00:04:28.230> for<00:04:28.500> seventh<00:04:28.860> in<00:04:29.040> the

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
you see we are tied for seventh in the

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.910 
you see we are tied for seventh in the
Eastern<00:04:29.790> Conference<00:04:30.260> this<00:04:31.260> team<00:04:31.500> is<00:04:31.680> not

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
Eastern Conference this team is not

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.770 
Eastern Conference this team is not
looking<00:04:32.220> good<00:04:32.280> whatsoever<00:04:32.880> and<00:04:33.150> we're<00:04:33.630> going

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
looking good whatsoever and we're going

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.720 
looking good whatsoever and we're going
to<00:04:33.870> get<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.170> Cavs<00:04:34.440> in<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.830> first<00:04:35.070> round<00:04:35.310> so<00:04:35.370> we

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
to get the Cavs in the first round so we

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.270 
to get the Cavs in the first round so we
are<00:04:36.180> most<00:04:36.390> likely<00:04:36.630> screwed<00:04:37.140> and<00:04:37.380> just<00:04:38.040> to<00:04:38.130> take

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
are most likely screwed and just to take

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.790 
are most likely screwed and just to take
a<00:04:38.310> look<00:04:38.460> at<00:04:38.610> our<00:04:38.790> injuries<00:04:39.330> here<00:04:39.570> you<00:04:40.560> know<00:04:40.650> in

a look at our injuries here you know in

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.860 
a look at our injuries here you know in
case<00:04:40.950> we<00:04:40.980> had<00:04:41.220> more<00:04:41.520> Isiah<00:04:42.210> Thomas<00:04:42.300> is<00:04:42.690> most

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
case we had more Isiah Thomas is most

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.730 
case we had more Isiah Thomas is most
likely<00:04:43.080> out<00:04:43.290> for<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.500> whole<00:04:43.650> entire

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
likely out for the whole entire

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.710 
likely out for the whole entire
postseason<00:04:44.160> if<00:04:44.490> we<00:04:44.580> do<00:04:44.760> end<00:04:45.030> up<00:04:45.120> advancing<00:04:45.600> and

points to advance to the Eastern
Conference<00:05:43.800> Finals<00:05:44.130> I<00:05:44.430> believe<00:05:44.580> our<00:05:44.700> third

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
Conference Finals I believe our third

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.490 
Conference Finals I believe our third
straight<00:05:45.420> Eastern<00:05:45.780> Conference<00:05:46.140> Finals

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
straight Eastern Conference Finals

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.530 
straight Eastern Conference Finals
appearance<00:05:46.920> so<00:05:47.460> that<00:05:47.610> is<00:05:47.760> pretty<00:05:47.880> nice<00:05:48.060> but<00:05:48.360> we

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
appearance so that is pretty nice but we

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.820 
appearance so that is pretty nice but we
are<00:05:48.660> going<00:05:48.840> up<00:05:48.960> against<00:05:49.230> the<00:05:49.320> Bulls<00:05:49.530> and

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
are going up against the Bulls and

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.250 
are going up against the Bulls and
unless<00:05:50.280> Derrick<00:05:50.640> Rose<00:05:50.850> is<00:05:50.880> hurt<00:05:51.210> I<00:05:51.480> doubt<00:05:52.080> that

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
unless Derrick Rose is hurt I doubt that

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.600 
unless Derrick Rose is hurt I doubt that
we're<00:05:52.350> going<00:05:52.440> to<00:05:52.500> do<00:05:52.650> anything<00:05:52.980> special<00:05:53.160> and

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
we're going to do anything special and

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.040 
we're going to do anything special and
no<00:05:54.000> one<00:05:54.150> on<00:05:54.270> their<00:05:54.390> team<00:05:54.540> assert<00:05:54.810> they<00:05:54.930> are

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
no one on their team assert they are

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.530 
no one on their team assert they are
fully<00:05:55.320> healthy<00:05:55.560> so<00:05:56.370> it's<00:05:57.090> looking<00:05:57.240> like<00:05:57.390> we

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
fully healthy so it's looking like we

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.860 
fully healthy so it's looking like we
are<00:05:57.660> going<00:05:57.930> to<00:05:58.050> lose<00:05:58.290> in<00:05:58.650> four<00:05:59.400> games<00:05:59.730> we<00:06:00.660> do

win Game three but they win Game four
and<00:06:03.840> oh<00:06:04.110> and<00:06:04.470> they<00:06:04.680> ultimately<00:06:04.940> win<00:06:05.940> the
