going to show you how to just simply

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.169 
going to show you how to just simply
encrypt<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.410> file<00:00:13.620> so<00:00:14.309> let's<00:00:14.580> go<00:00:14.730> into<00:00:14.969> our

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
encrypt a file so let's go into our

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.410 
encrypt a file so let's go into our
documents<00:00:15.949> and<00:00:16.949> as<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.580> are<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:17.880> windows<00:00:18.240> 8

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
documents and as we are in windows 8

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.880 
documents and as we are in windows 8
you'll<00:00:18.660> notice<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.140> ribbon<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.590> quite

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
you'll notice the ribbon is quite

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.279 
you'll notice the ribbon is quite
different<00:00:20.160> which<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.760> can<00:00:20.939> change<00:00:21.240> by<00:00:21.480> going

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
different which you can change by going

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.160 
different which you can change by going
up<00:00:22.439> here<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.000> shobha<00:00:24.000> livin<00:00:24.330> or<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.779> ribbon

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
up here and shobha livin or the ribbon

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.859 
up here and shobha livin or the ribbon
below<00:00:25.439> or<00:00:25.800> minimize<00:00:26.369> ribbons<00:00:26.910> but<00:00:27.210> now<00:00:27.810> you

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
below or minimize ribbons but now you

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.839 
below or minimize ribbons but now you
have<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.410> full<00:00:28.890> size<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.550> have<00:00:29.699> your

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
have it a full size and you have your

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.959 
have it a full size and you have your
manage<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.890> how<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.189> optimize<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
manage and how you can optimize the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.690 
manage and how you can optimize the
folder<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.570> what<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:35.280> we're<00:00:35.610> going

folder and what have you but we're going

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.370 
folder and what have you but we're going
to<00:00:35.760> go<00:00:35.910> ahead<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.450> create<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.870> real<00:00:37.170> quick

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
to go ahead and just create a real quick

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.400 
to go ahead and just create a real quick
file<00:00:38.480> but<00:00:39.480> we're<00:00:39.629> going<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.780> create<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.140> folder

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
file but we're going to create a folder

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.220 
file but we're going to create a folder
for<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.670> I'll<00:00:41.760> tell<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:41.969> why<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.079> moment

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
for it and I'll tell you why in a moment

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.229 
for it and I'll tell you why in a moment
we'll<00:00:43.649> call<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.090> encrypt<00:00:45.320> me<00:00:46.550> that<00:00:47.550> cell<00:00:47.940> and

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
we'll call it encrypt me that cell and

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.360 
we'll call it encrypt me that cell and
now<00:00:48.870> we're<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> open<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.039> up<00:00:50.340> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
now we're going to open that up and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.930 
now we're going to open that up and
we're<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.449> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.690> create<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.050> simple<00:00:52.940> text

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
we're just going to create a simple text

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.029 
we're just going to create a simple text
document

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.340 

right<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.820> now<00:01:00.000> technically<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.079> click

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
right so now technically we can click

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.829 
right so now technically we can click
this<00:01:01.589> right<00:01:02.159> click<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.670> go<00:01:02.879> forth<00:01:03.690> and

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
this right click it and go forth and

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.499 
this right click it and go forth and
select<00:01:04.170> properties<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.009> then<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:06.210> yes

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
select properties and then in here yes

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.990 
select properties and then in here yes
you<00:01:06.540> have<00:01:06.899> your<00:01:07.080> security<00:01:07.259> above<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> law<00:01:08.310> but

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
you have your security above the law but

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.940 
you have your security above the law but
in<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.240> case<00:01:09.509> you<00:01:09.869> would<00:01:10.020> go<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.200> advanced

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
in this case you would go to advanced

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.899 
in this case you would go to advanced
and<00:01:11.100> then<00:01:11.549> encrypt<00:01:12.030> contents<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:13.140> secure<00:01:13.530> data

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
and then encrypt contents to secure data

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.080 
and then encrypt contents to secure data
but<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.090> highly<00:01:15.600> recommend<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.729> actual

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
but I highly recommend you do the actual

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.090 
but I highly recommend you do the actual
folder<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.899> file<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.409> want<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.680> do<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.979> in

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
folder for the file you want to do it in

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.660 
folder for the file you want to do it in
why<00:01:20.640> I'll<00:01:21.060> show<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.420> click<00:01:22.350> advanced<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.490> is

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
why I'll show you click advanced this is

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.460 
why I'll show you click advanced this is
what<00:01:23.850> happens<00:01:24.180> when<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.350> without

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
what happens when you do it without

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.080 
what happens when you do it without
encrypting<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.369> folder<00:01:28.789> it's<00:01:29.789> not<00:01:30.030> very

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
encrypting that folder it's not very

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.889 
encrypting that folder it's not very
good<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:31.580> he<00:01:32.580> now<00:01:32.789> you<00:01:32.850> have<00:01:33.390> an<00:01:33.509> encryption

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
good and he now you have an encryption

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.859 
good and he now you have an encryption
warning<00:01:34.580> telling<00:01:35.580> you<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.000> basically

warning telling you is that basically

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.389 
warning telling you is that basically
there<00:01:37.440> may<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:37.619> an<00:01:37.860> encrypted<00:01:38.340> folder<00:01:39.049> and

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
there may be an encrypted folder and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.190 
there may be an encrypted folder and
there<00:01:41.399> may<00:01:41.520> also<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:42.179> the<00:01:42.560> encrypted

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
there may also be the encrypted

so please
so<00:01:47.939> that's<00:01:48.270> why<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.509> isn't<00:01:48.869> good<00:01:49.079> quality

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
so that's why this isn't good quality

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.399 
so that's why this isn't good quality
goods<00:01:49.890> careful<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:51.119> instead<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:52.170> doing

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
goods careful so instead of just doing

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.230 
goods careful so instead of just doing
that<00:01:52.890> we're<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:53.340> gonna<00:01:53.549> go<00:01:53.759> ahead<00:01:54.060> and

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
that we're just gonna go ahead and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:05.500 
that we're just gonna go ahead and
virtually<00:01:54.929> right

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:16.870 

you're<00:02:06.510> gay

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.020 

and<00:02:17.240> now<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:17.510> back<00:02:18.350> up<00:02:18.380> your<00:02:18.740> file

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.820 

encrypting<00:02:25.030> file<00:02:25.270> system<00:02:25.300> now<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:26.560> have

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
encrypting file system now you have

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.130 
encrypting file system now you have
backup<00:02:27.490> your<00:02:27.700> file<00:02:27.910> encryption<00:02:28.270> certificate

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
backup your file encryption certificate

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.560 
backup your file encryption certificate
and<00:02:29.290> key<00:02:29.440> this<00:02:29.980> is<00:02:30.160> incredible<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.240> believe

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
and key this is incredible and I believe

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.710 
and key this is incredible and I believe
it<00:02:31.750> uses<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.110> block

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
it uses the block

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.070 
it uses the block
janani<00:02:34.500> back<00:02:34.890> up<00:02:35.070> now<00:02:35.250> back

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
janani back up now back

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.350 
janani back up now back
now<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.830> incredibly<00:02:38.760> important

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
now this is incredibly important

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.630 
now this is incredibly important
especially<00:02:39.630> if<00:02:40.110> you're<00:02:40.380> encrypting<00:02:41.130> files

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
especially if you're encrypting files

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.240 
especially if you're encrypting files
that<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.090> definitely<00:02:42.830> you're<00:02:43.830> going<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.070> need

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
that you definitely you're going to need

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.520 
that you definitely you're going to need
this<00:02:44.400> encryption<00:02:45.560> certificate<00:02:47.540> that's<00:02:48.540> using

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
this encryption certificate that's using

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.480 
this encryption certificate that's using
the<00:02:49.560> encryption<00:02:50.190> simply<00:02:51.150> because<00:02:51.270> if<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.810> put

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
the encryption simply because if you put

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.130 
the encryption simply because if you put
the<00:02:52.610> computer

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
the computer

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.500

computer separate sets a didn't need

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.080 
computer separate sets a didn't need
this<00:02:56.660> key<00:02:56.900> it's<00:02:57.290> almost<00:02:57.980> nearly<00:02:58.670> impossible

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
this key it's almost nearly impossible

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.070 
this key it's almost nearly impossible

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.509 
public computer or work computer people
can<00:04:17.489> undelete<00:04:18.120> files<00:04:18.539> magically<00:04:19.459> anyway<00:04:20.459> so

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
can undelete files magically anyway so

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.909 
can undelete files magically anyway so
we're<00:04:21.450> gonna<00:04:21.630> call<00:04:21.959> it<00:04:21.989> encrypt<00:04:22.410> me<00:04:22.530> because

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
we're gonna call it encrypt me because

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.090 
we're gonna call it encrypt me because
that's<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.340> folder<00:04:23.780> that<00:04:24.780> we<00:04:24.930> encrypted<00:04:25.530> so

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
that's the folder that we encrypted so

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.240 
that's the folder that we encrypted so
this<00:04:26.340> way<00:04:26.520> we<00:04:26.550> know<00:04:26.700> the<00:04:27.030> encrypt<00:04:27.419> a<00:04:27.570> folder

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
this way we know the encrypt a folder

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.040 
this way we know the encrypt a folder
and<00:04:29.250> this<00:04:29.729> is<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.060> key<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.270> belongs<00:04:30.750> to<00:04:30.900> it

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
and this is the key that belongs to it

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.740 
and this is the key that belongs to it
and<00:04:31.380> seeing<00:04:32.039> you<00:04:32.250> have<00:04:32.520> all<00:04:32.729> files<00:04:33.000> but<00:04:33.270> don't
