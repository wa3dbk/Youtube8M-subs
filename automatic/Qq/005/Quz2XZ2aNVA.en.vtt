00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
definitely worth taking a look at his

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.910 
definitely worth taking a look at his
arms<00:02:51.209> do<00:02:51.720> not<00:02:51.870> move<00:02:52.080> that's<00:02:52.380> one<00:02:52.560> feature<00:02:52.860> I

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
arms do not move that's one feature I

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.590

almost<00:02:53.100> forgot<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.489> mention<00:02:53.760> because<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.330> does

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
almost forgot to mention because it does

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.420

look<00:02:54.810> like<00:02:54.840> his<00:02:55.080> arms<00:02:55.380> move<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.860> little<00:02:56.040> bit<00:02:56.220> but

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
look like his arms move a little bit but

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.430 
look like his arms move a little bit but
they<00:02:56.580> don't<00:02:56.910> it's<00:02:57.239> just<00:02:57.300> they're<00:02:57.840> stationary

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
they don't it's just they're stationary

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.600 
they don't it's just they're stationary
