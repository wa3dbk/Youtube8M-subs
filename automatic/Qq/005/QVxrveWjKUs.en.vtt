00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 just for deaf people 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.950
 responsible for the orientation of the 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.270
 engineering school 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.740
 can you tell us why a boy 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.110
 should choose to attend 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.320
 management engineering here at liuc 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.980
 yes we say that we can summarize in 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.570
 three reasons why a student should 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.279
 come here to castellanza in this 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.119
 fantastic campus to study engineering 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.920
 management 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.260
 the first is that this speed is 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.529
 university really very close to 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.019
 industrial context to us companies 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.780
 we teach the logistics the production the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.559
 We do not teach marketing and finance 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.530
 practically with the forts 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.690
 practical implications with teaching 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.520
 particularly experiential with class 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.440
 also district and with routes of 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.030
 excellence and with a whole series of 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.280
 activities that kids do both 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.250
 universities and companies, perhaps 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.320
 followed by tutors who may not be 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.739
 john and researchers but are in fact gods 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.940
 real production or real directors 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.010
 establishment manager then in 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.870
 reality our engineering and one 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.940
 engineering with a strong focus 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.850
 industrial but also with a fort 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.340
 address to business and services 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.140
 to information technology and so it is 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.570
 certainly very close to those that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.430
 are the concrete needs of companies 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.850
 so much so that our students do not 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.950
 find not find 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.960
 the crisis not in about 20 days 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.790
 we are able to place our graduates 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.460
 in the best companies not only of the 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.690
 territory but of all Italy e 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.670
 even abroad 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.259
 the second reason is obviously that 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.659
 this in the student-friendly city 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.729
 therefore whatever is needed 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.220
 student with special requests 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.360
 they are served in no time here 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.850
 there is a structure particularly 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.670
 efficient so there are no queues not 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.289
 there is no bureaucracy there is a counter e 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.539
 this really causes the student 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.759
 have the road flattened then should 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.360
 just think about studying a 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.740
 focus on striving to overcome 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.020
 everything else is provided instead 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.700
 from university as a service to another 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.369
 had reached in the third and final 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.110
 perhaps the most important is that this 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.850
 in the city with particular faculty 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.860
 engineering has a strong vocation 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.929
 international our students indeed 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.670
 for over 40 percent go 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.290
 third fourth and fifth year to live 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.480
 an experience abroad that together a 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.040
 erasmus project that is in an exchange 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.900
 university with another university 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.969
 rather than even looking for the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.099
 double title the notes we make different 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:25.010
 English courses we have teachers 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.629
 mother tongue then English but also 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.930
 other foreign languages ​​are for us 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.639
 really the path to follow for not 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.620
 have problems in the future when 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.620
 you will have to look for carona
