 that's going to happen 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.130
 the problem of what is barefoot now - has given 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.480
 that there are no identified plattens supported under red Burdisso 1 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.470

 So she did too 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.810
 Let Caro Purcell down to 1 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.100
 now 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.050
 the whole thing must be bleeding that 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.490
 TuS stay full course both 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.160

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.490

 back again 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.830
 Likewise 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.659
 if I go to the celebrity Qualms Mortier now 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:13.379

 take it at the word would just give that an example 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.129

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.870
 Symphonic written apart that we can play this separately 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:37.639

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:56.249
 Jimi 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.159
 like 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.229
 can you still 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.239
 for a little bit better there are different agreements 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.459
 possibilities 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.439
 and depending on whether you are Latin or English or German percent 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.229
 Would like to have a song 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:16.939
 at the other 1200 x and where Turks can still be looked up as certain 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.289
 Things are written 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:22.379
 it's a bit more complicated but you have to work in it 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:27.509
 ca I think that was already so far 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:29.439
