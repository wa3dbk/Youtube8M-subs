00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.450

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.650
 hello, today you were honorary 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.380
 guest at the tournament the tournament was held in 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.730
 20 21 anniversary was dedicated to the mountains 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.520
 republics of Ingushetia what are your impressions 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.440
 about this event 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.110
 I have a positive impression on me 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:36.040
 really liked how I was met 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:38.020
 general tournament like something 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.300
 some kind of zest in this is when 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.989
 fight in the open air 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.579
 I'd try it myself it says you 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.780
 somehow met in a special way that 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.469
 I remember that I remember from exactly 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.960
 the republic itself 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.030
 Well, I do not know, we fed very well 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.550
 get drunk on the road several times 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.120
 even repeatedly before we arrived 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.440
 to the place you need to drag heavily filled 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.210
 tell me what fear you managed 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.360
 look and what do you highlight 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.119
 remember what you note 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.860
 saw slaughter someone really liked how 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.460
 he finished with a painful hold well done 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.140
 Magomed Malikov against Mons we see 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.470
 such a bloody battle is already hard 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.039
 had to watch them small scored 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.700
 expected such an outcome 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.770
 well, in general, I expected until the first two 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.970
 round 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.610
 Magomed has big chances to win 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.970
 if it hits well, that's what happened with 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.149
 first hit it hit which led to 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.420
 Monson sections so doctors base 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.069
 would 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.319
 from dissection it has already finished its 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.590
 tasks for the exam session 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.720
 already if the opportunity to start preparing 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.070
 to your fight against constantine on deaf 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.799
 I started training 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.100
 but I still do not remember because everything is still 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.079
 next week I have not yet learned 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.700
 it's all over 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.729
 Is the date known when tentatively 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.350
 may be we may be so 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.390
 M1 leadership promised at the end of August 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.620
 we are intervention time 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.310
 where it is still unknown how you will 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.630
 do you plan to prepare 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.640

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.510
 special which was not here before proceeding 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.049
 It is from the style of Constantine special 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.959
 not something we will not particularly nobody to attract 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.410
 myself in training all the same way and 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.019
 I will remain more pressure on 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.510
 physical strength endurance like this 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.820

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.640
