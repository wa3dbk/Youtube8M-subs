anything else but you know so in it now
that<00:04:43.530> you've<00:04:43.650> seen<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:44.010> actual<00:04:44.250> format<00:04:44.870> what

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
that you've seen the actual format what

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.379 
that you've seen the actual format what
would<00:04:46.020> you<00:04:46.110> change<00:04:46.380> what<00:04:46.740> would<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:47.389> do

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
would you change what would you do

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.500 
would you change what would you do
differently<00:04:48.870> if<00:04:49.260> you<00:04:49.380> had<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.740> chance<00:04:50.070> to<00:04:50.510> take

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
differently if you had a chance to take

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.659 
differently if you had a chance to take
out<00:04:51.630> what<00:04:51.870> would<00:04:51.930> you<00:04:52.050> put<00:04:52.199> in<00:04:52.260> I'd<00:04:52.979> leave<00:04:53.550> the

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
out what would you put in I'd leave the

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.280 
out what would you put in I'd leave the
deck<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:53.910> same<00:04:54.090> I<00:04:54.210> think<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:54.720> think<00:04:54.990> it's<00:04:55.080> the

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
deck the same I think I think it's the

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.719 
deck the same I think I think it's the
most<00:04:55.620> optimal<00:04:56.010> build<00:04:56.190> is<00:04:56.940> really<00:04:57.120> consistent

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
most optimal build is really consistent

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.650 
most optimal build is really consistent
incredible<00:04:59.729> wind<00:04:59.880> up<00:05:00.000> match<00:05:00.150> up<00:05:00.360> even<00:05:00.600> though

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
incredible wind up match up even though

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.250 
incredible wind up match up even though
I<00:05:00.690> just<00:05:00.780> lost<00:05:01.050> to<00:05:01.260> it<00:05:02.720> you<00:05:03.720> know<00:05:03.840> you<00:05:03.900> can't<00:05:04.139> win

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
I just lost to it you know you can't win

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.730 
I just lost to it you know you can't win
them<00:05:04.380> all<00:05:04.440> but<00:05:05.000> for<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.060> both<00:05:06.180> sides<00:05:06.479> it

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.140 

nothing<00:05:10.740> inside<00:05:10.919> I<00:05:10.979> could<00:05:11.190> say<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.460> same

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
nothing inside I could say the same

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.730 
nothing inside I could say the same
it<00:05:12.419> has<00:05:12.690> it's<00:05:13.020> really<00:05:13.380> well<00:05:13.530> covered<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:16.470> only

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
it has it's really well covered the only

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.370 
it has it's really well covered the only
hard<00:05:16.979> match<00:05:17.130> of<00:05:17.310> this<00:05:17.430> deck<00:05:17.610> has<00:05:17.789> is<00:05:18.289> well<00:05:19.289> it's

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
hard match of this deck has is well it's

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.689 
hard match of this deck has is well it's
not<00:05:19.440> really<00:05:19.560> a<00:05:19.650> bad<00:05:19.740> matchup<00:05:20.010> but<00:05:20.220> that<00:05:20.520> just

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
not really a bad matchup but that just

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.730 
not really a bad matchup but that just
loses<00:05:20.970> to<00:05:21.090> itself<00:05:21.389> so<00:05:21.660> I<00:05:22.289> mean<00:05:22.470> if<00:05:22.560> you<00:05:22.620> don't

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
loses to itself so I mean if you don't

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.529 
loses to itself so I mean if you don't
if<00:05:22.919> you<00:05:22.979> run<00:05:23.130> out<00:05:23.160> of<00:05:23.340> monsters<00:05:23.490> you<00:05:24.240> know

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
if you run out of monsters you know

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.140 
if you run out of monsters you know
happens<00:05:24.660> but<00:05:24.990> and<00:05:25.520> they<00:05:26.520> need<00:05:26.700> to<00:05:26.760> last<00:05:26.940> some

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
happens but and they need to last some

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.279 
happens but and they need to last some
of<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.330> things<00:05:27.510> you<00:05:27.600> want<00:05:27.750> to<00:05:27.780> say<00:05:27.930> to<00:05:28.020> you<00:05:28.110> to
