00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.709 
foundations um I like that it has the
different<00:00:35.550> benefits<00:00:35.670> though<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.120> really<00:00:36.480> don't

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
different benefits though I really don't

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.910 
different benefits though I really don't
think<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:37.079> get<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.230> lot<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.469> benefits<00:00:37.800> from

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
think you get a lot of benefits from

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.770 
think you get a lot of benefits from
your<00:00:38.100> makeup<00:00:38.399> but<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:38.969> don't<00:00:39.300> think<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.629> hurts

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
your makeup but I don't think it hurts

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.220 
your makeup but I don't think it hurts
to<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.230> them<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.309> not<00:00:41.399> going<00:00:41.670> to

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
to have them in it so it's not going to

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.350 
to have them in it so it's not going to
affect<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.500> negative<00:00:43.680> way<00:00:44.000> but<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.239> me

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
affect you in a negative way but for me

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.209 
affect you in a negative way but for me
I<00:00:45.390> wear<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.719> lot<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.899> primers<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.710> wear<00:00:46.920> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
I wear a lot of primers I wear a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.040 
I wear a lot of primers I wear a
moisturizer<00:00:48.090> before<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.629> do<00:00:48.690> think<00:00:48.989> that

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
moisturizer before so I do think that

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.540 
moisturizer before so I do think that
protects<00:00:49.469> my<00:00:49.620> skin<00:00:49.860> from<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.160> lot<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
protects my skin from a lot of the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.000 
protects my skin from a lot of the
products<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.690> liquid<00:00:52.170> foundations<00:00:52.590> being

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
products in liquid foundations being

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.049 
products in liquid foundations being
absorbed<00:00:53.309> into<00:00:53.610> my<00:00:53.789> skin<00:00:54.530> but<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.789> did<00:00:56.789> want<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
absorbed into my skin but I did want to

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.490 
absorbed into my skin but I did want to
share<00:00:57.239> with<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.420> guys<00:00:57.480> my<00:00:57.570> thoughts<00:00:58.079> between

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the new illumination and the original

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.470 
the new illumination and the original
and<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.710> wanted<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.550> do<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> full<00:01:02.940> review<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.270> this

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
and I wanted to do a full review on this

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.509 
and I wanted to do a full review on this
I<00:01:03.660> went<00:01:03.899> through<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.110> whole<00:01:04.439> -<00:01:04.710> basically<00:01:05.189> I

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
I went through a whole - basically I

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.429 
I went through a whole - basically I
have<00:01:05.939> maybe<00:01:06.090> two<00:01:06.420> more<00:01:06.570> uses<00:01:06.960> at<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> bottom

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
have maybe two more uses at the bottom

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.800 
have maybe two more uses at the bottom
here<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.610> love<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.180> foundation<00:01:09.330> I

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
here and I love this foundation I

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.740 
here and I love this foundation I
absolutely<00:01:10.590> love<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.010> foundation<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:12.270> I

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
absolutely love this foundation and I

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.719 
absolutely love this foundation and I
think<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.110> something<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:14.040> would<00:01:14.250> work<00:01:14.520> for

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
think it's something that would work for

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.640 
think it's something that would work for
a<00:01:14.790> lot<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.210> people<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.810> doesn't<00:01:16.350> have<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
a lot of people it doesn't have the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.940 
a lot of people it doesn't have the
greatest<00:01:17.220> shade<00:01:17.700> selection<00:01:18.140> um<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.799> very

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
greatest shade selection um it's very

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.100 
greatest shade selection um it's very
very<00:01:20.700> minimal<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.090> think<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.360> has<00:01:21.450> five<00:01:21.720> shades

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
very minimal I think it has five shades

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.830 
very minimal I think it has five shades
and<00:01:23.030> that's<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.360> only<00:01:24.689> downfall<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.340> um

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
and that's the only downfall in this um

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.260 
and that's the only downfall in this um
it<00:01:27.840> doesn't<00:01:28.470> go<00:01:28.829> into<00:01:29.189> some<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.939> deeper

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
it doesn't go into some of the deeper

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.749 
it doesn't go into some of the deeper
tones<00:01:30.570> which<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.770> little<00:01:32.100> disappointing

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
tones which is a little disappointing

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.480 
tones which is a little disappointing
only<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.299> it's<00:01:33.600> not<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> foundation<00:01:34.200> that

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
only because it's not a foundation that

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.800 
only because it's not a foundation that
absolutely<00:01:35.490> everyone<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.240> find<00:01:36.450> their<00:01:36.600> color

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
absolutely everyone can find their color

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.700 
absolutely everyone can find their color
in<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.290> that's<00:01:38.220> kind<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.880> bummer<00:01:39.530> but<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
in and that's kind of a bummer but the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.740 
in and that's kind of a bummer but the
price<00:01:40.979> point<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> little<00:01:41.909> steep<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.360> think

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
price point is a little steep I think

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.740 
price point is a little steep I think
for<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> CC<00:01:43.350> cream<00:01:43.380> at<00:01:43.770> $38<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.450> me<00:01:45.540> this

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
for a CC cream at $38 but to me this

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.719 
for a CC cream at $38 but to me this
isn't<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.170> CC<00:01:46.470> cream<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.860> mean<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> CC<00:01:47.640> cream

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
isn't a CC cream I mean it is a CC cream

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.980 
isn't a CC cream I mean it is a CC cream
because<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.210> color<00:01:48.390> correcting<00:01:48.840> and

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
because it's color correcting and

five days out of the week because I work

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.600 
five days out of the week because I work
in<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.420> hospital<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.320> doesn't<00:02:07.680> look<00:02:07.920> heavy

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
in a hospital and it doesn't look heavy

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.460 
in a hospital and it doesn't look heavy
it<00:02:08.970> looks<00:02:09.179> natural<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.899> doesn't<00:02:10.080> look<00:02:10.259> cakey

it looks natural it doesn't look cakey
and<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.250> doesn't<00:02:11.520> adhere<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.819> my<00:02:11.940> dry<00:02:12.239> patch

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
and it doesn't adhere to my dry patch

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.780 
and it doesn't adhere to my dry patch
and<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:13.710> is<00:02:13.860> actually<00:02:14.010> good<00:02:14.370> because<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.580> used

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and this is actually good because I used

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.610 
and this is actually good because I used
to<00:02:14.820> have<00:02:14.880> oily<00:02:15.240> skin<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.810> did<00:02:16.080> like<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.440> then

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
to have oily skin and I did like it then

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.670 
to have oily skin and I did like it then
too<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.580> do<00:02:17.700> think<00:02:18.210> it<00:02:18.420> works<00:02:18.720> for<00:02:18.960> any<00:02:19.200> skin

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
too so I do think it works for any skin

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.850 
too so I do think it works for any skin
type<00:02:21.020> absolutely<00:02:22.020> on<00:02:22.110> these<00:02:22.260> can<00:02:22.440> type<00:02:22.650> and

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
type absolutely on these can type and

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.380 
type absolutely on these can type and
it's<00:02:23.250> great<00:02:23.490> if<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.700> do<00:02:23.880> have<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.060> bit<00:02:24.270> of

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
either side looking at it though it does

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.810 
either side looking at it though it does
look<00:03:40.080> like<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.470> illumination<00:03:41.250> is<00:03:41.430> more<00:03:41.700> of

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
look like the illumination is more of

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.800 
look like the illumination is more of
like<00:03:41.850> a<00:03:42.180> thicker<00:03:42.810> mousse<00:03:44.299> looks<00:03:45.299> a<00:03:45.390> little<00:03:45.570> bit

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
like a thicker mousse looks a little bit

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.199 
like a thicker mousse looks a little bit
more<00:03:45.930> liquidy<00:03:46.440> which<00:03:46.590> is<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.950> original<00:03:50.209> so

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
more liquidy which is the original so

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.460 
more liquidy which is the original so
I'm<00:03:51.450> going<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.690> put<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:53.750> illumination<00:03:54.750> on<00:03:54.930> the

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
I'm going to put the illumination on the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.360 
I'm going to put the illumination on the
side<00:03:55.769> in<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.640> original<00:03:57.030> on<00:03:57.720> this<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:59.310> I'm

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
side in the original on this so I'm

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.460 
side in the original on this so I'm
going<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.519> go<00:03:59.670> in<00:03:59.880> with<00:04:00.150> my<00:04:00.420> bare<00:04:00.720> minerals<00:04:01.260> a

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
going to go in with my bare minerals a

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.890 
going to go in with my bare minerals a

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
smoothing face brush love this brush

smoothing face brush love this brush
like<00:04:04.200> seriously<00:04:04.650> love<00:04:04.830> this<00:04:04.980> brush<00:04:05.190> so<00:04:05.880> I'm

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
like seriously love this brush so I'm

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.770 
like seriously love this brush so I'm
going<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.150> do<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.390> original<00:04:06.810> side<00:04:07.019> first

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.860 

again<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.590> CCS<00:04:12.980> do<00:04:13.190> have<00:04:13.520> amazing<00:04:13.970> coverage<00:04:14.540> I

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
again the CCS do have amazing coverage I

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.259 
again the CCS do have amazing coverage I
think<00:04:14.900> it's<00:04:15.320> like<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.620> most<00:04:16.090> coverage<00:04:17.090> you

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
think it's like the most coverage you

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.780 
think it's like the most coverage you
can<00:04:17.420> get<00:04:17.540> from<00:04:17.660> a<00:04:17.720> CC<00:04:18.049> cream<00:04:18.079> it's<00:04:18.440> amazing<00:04:19.250> so

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
can get from a CC cream it's amazing so

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.009 
can get from a CC cream it's amazing so
I'm<00:04:19.850> going<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.030> do<00:04:20.180> with<00:04:20.390> the<00:04:20.540> illumination

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
I'm going to do with the illumination

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.370 
I'm going to do with the illumination
side<00:04:21.470> now<00:04:21.739> so<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:25.550> consistency<00:04:25.940> did<00:04:26.810> seem<00:04:27.350> a

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
side now so the consistency did seem a

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.030 
side now so the consistency did seem a
little<00:04:27.770> different<00:04:28.190> but<00:04:29.230> when<00:04:30.230> it<00:04:30.320> goes<00:04:30.470> on<00:04:30.680> it

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
little different but when it goes on it

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.860 
little different but when it goes on it
seriously<00:04:31.640> is<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:31.970> same<00:04:32.240> finish<00:04:34.690> what<00:04:35.690> do<00:04:35.780> you

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
seriously is the same finish what do you

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.990 
seriously is the same finish what do you
guys<00:04:36.020> think<00:04:36.080> this<00:04:36.890> is<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.250> illuminating<00:04:37.850> this

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
guys think this is the illuminating this

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.750 
guys think this is the illuminating this
is<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.300> original<00:04:38.780> I<00:04:38.900> mean<00:04:39.080> maybe<00:04:39.290> very<00:04:40.250> subtle

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
is the original I mean maybe very subtle

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.660 
is the original I mean maybe very subtle
but<00:04:41.120> once<00:04:41.480> I<00:04:41.630> apply<00:04:41.720> a<00:04:42.320> setting<00:04:43.070> powder<00:04:43.100> it's

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
but once I apply a setting powder it's

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.500 
but once I apply a setting powder it's
like<00:04:43.850> no<00:04:44.180> difference<00:04:44.720> I<00:04:46.120> just<00:04:47.120> don't<00:04:47.300> see<00:04:47.480> a

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
like no difference I just don't see a

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:57.130 
like no difference I just don't see a
difference<00:04:50.800> at<00:04:51.800> all<00:04:55.480> I'm<00:04:56.480> going<00:04:56.570> to<00:04:56.660> go<00:04:56.720> in<00:04:56.870> and

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
difference at all I'm going to go in and

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.050 
difference at all I'm going to go in and
finish<00:04:57.890> the<00:04:57.919> rest<00:04:58.280> of<00:04:58.430> my<00:04:58.550> face<00:04:58.850> and<00:05:00.880> I'm<00:05:01.880> going

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060

this is like the weekend I usually film
all<00:05:39.380> weekends<00:05:39.979> and<00:05:40.360> when<00:05:41.360> I<00:05:41.390> wear<00:05:41.660> this

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
all weekends and when I wear this

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.600 
all weekends and when I wear this
foundation<00:05:41.930> it<00:05:42.410> looks<00:05:42.440> really<00:05:42.830> natural<00:05:42.979> and<00:05:43.370> I

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
foundation it looks really natural and I

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.600 
foundation it looks really natural and I
don't<00:05:43.669> get<00:05:44.240> a<00:05:44.300> lot<00:05:44.419> of<00:05:44.479> extra<00:05:44.870> things<00:05:44.900> and<00:05:45.610> it

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
don't get a lot of extra things and it

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.010 
don't get a lot of extra things and it
gives<00:05:47.120> me<00:05:47.300> that<00:05:47.600> coverage<00:05:48.260> so<00:05:49.010> I<00:05:49.400> mean<00:05:50.300> yeah<00:05:50.960> it

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
gives me that coverage so I mean yeah it

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.880 
gives me that coverage so I mean yeah it
would<00:05:51.110> have<00:05:51.200> been<00:05:51.290> cool<00:05:51.530> to<00:05:51.650> have<00:05:51.770> this

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
would have been cool to have this

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.409 
would have been cool to have this
product<00:05:52.130> in<00:05:52.250> illuminate<00:05:52.700> like<00:05:53.150> in<00:05:53.300> an

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
product in illuminate like in an

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.810 
product in illuminate like in an
illuminating<00:05:54.020> form<00:05:54.350> I<00:05:54.620> don't<00:05:55.100> think<00:05:55.460> it's<00:05:55.610> the

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
illuminating form I don't think it's the

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.960 
illuminating form I don't think it's the
most<00:05:55.970> hydrating<00:05:56.300> I<00:05:57.250> don't<00:05:58.250> really<00:05:58.430> think<00:05:58.520> any

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
most hydrating I don't really think any

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.930 
most hydrating I don't really think any
foundation<00:05:59.630> is<00:05:59.690> hydrating<00:06:00.169> I'll<00:06:01.130> just<00:06:01.310> be

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
foundation is hydrating I'll just be

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.659 
foundation is hydrating I'll just be
real<00:06:02.180> I've<00:06:02.390> never<00:06:02.750> found<00:06:02.990> a<00:06:03.669> hydrating

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
real I've never found a hydrating

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.340 
real I've never found a hydrating
foundation<00:06:05.270> but<00:06:05.479> I<00:06:05.540> do<00:06:05.630> think<00:06:05.930> there's<00:06:06.140> ones

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
foundation but I do think there's ones

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.050 
foundation but I do think there's ones
that<00:06:06.530> don't<00:06:06.680> cling<00:06:06.979> to<00:06:07.070> dry<00:06:07.250> skin<00:06:07.310> and<00:06:07.790> maybe

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
that don't cling to dry skin and maybe

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.909 
that don't cling to dry skin and maybe
that's<00:06:08.300> what<00:06:08.510> these<00:06:08.630> formulas<00:06:09.169> are<00:06:09.380> these

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
that's what these formulas are these

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:11.740 
that's what these formulas are these
companies<00:06:10.160> mean<00:06:10.580> by<00:06:10.760> hydrating<00:06:11.330> that<00:06:11.510> they're

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
companies mean by hydrating that they're

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.610 
companies mean by hydrating that they're
good<00:06:11.930> for<00:06:12.290> drier<00:06:13.130> skin<00:06:13.900> but<00:06:14.900> I<00:06:14.930> don't<00:06:15.229> think

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
good for drier skin but I don't think

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.920 
good for drier skin but I don't think
they're<00:06:16.060> yeah<00:06:17.060> they<00:06:17.210> both<00:06:17.330> have<00:06:17.510> hydrating

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
they're yeah they both have hydrating

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.260 
they're yeah they both have hydrating
serum<00:06:18.169> in<00:06:18.350> them<00:06:18.440> but<00:06:19.070> I<00:06:19.100> think<00:06:19.610> these<00:06:19.880> are<00:06:20.030> even

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
serum in them but I think these are even

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.560 
serum in them but I think these are even
good<00:06:20.419> for<00:06:20.770> oily<00:06:21.770> skin<00:06:22.539> so<00:06:23.539> I<00:06:23.570> think<00:06:23.900> it's

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
good for oily skin so I think it's

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.260 
good for oily skin so I think it's
seriously<00:06:25.199> great<00:06:25.380> for<00:06:25.650> any<00:06:25.919> skin<00:06:26.340> type<00:06:26.370> I<00:06:26.820> do

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
seriously great for any skin type I do

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.629 
seriously great for any skin type I do
use<00:06:27.600> the<00:06:27.780> shade<00:06:27.990> light<00:06:28.380> in<00:06:28.620> both<00:06:28.860> that's<00:06:29.400> one

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
use the shade light in both that's one

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.310 
use the shade light in both that's one
thing<00:06:29.789> that's<00:06:29.850> really<00:06:30.000> nice<00:06:30.180> they<00:06:30.720> are<00:06:30.750> the

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
thing that's really nice they are the

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.999 
thing that's really nice they are the
same<00:06:31.530> color<00:06:32.900> so<00:06:33.900> they<00:06:34.199> did<00:06:34.380> make<00:06:34.560> it<00:06:34.680> easier

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:35.009 
same color so they did make it easier

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.360 
same color so they did make it easier
but<00:06:35.610> if<00:06:35.850> you<00:06:36.060> like<00:06:36.449> the<00:06:36.600> CC<00:06:36.930> cream<00:06:37.370> you're

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
but if you like the CC cream you're

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.710 
but if you like the CC cream you're
going<00:06:38.430> to<00:06:38.550> like<00:06:38.639> the<00:06:38.789> illumination<00:06:39.330> one<00:06:39.449> just

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
going to like the illumination one just

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.060 
going to like the illumination one just
as<00:06:39.840> much<00:06:39.990> I<00:06:40.229> honestly<00:06:40.530> think<00:06:40.680> it<00:06:40.800> does<00:06:40.919> the

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
as much I honestly think it does the

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.520 
as much I honestly think it does the
exact<00:06:41.550> same<00:06:41.699> thing<00:06:41.940> I<00:06:42.479> don't<00:06:42.840> see<00:06:43.500> a

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
exact same thing I don't see a

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.189
