00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
doing that zone objective no that train

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.870 
doing that zone objective no that train
will<00:01:30.600> move<00:01:30.750> away<00:01:31.020> like<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.710> would<00:01:31.829> never<00:01:32.009> know

this just on your own okay so you just
try<00:01:36.030> all<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.299> benches<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.810> top<00:01:36.990> level

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
try all the benches on the top level

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.950 
try all the benches on the top level
train<00:01:38.189> moves<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.119> get<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> moon<00:01:39.689> pearl

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
train moves you can get the moon pearl

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.230 
train moves you can get the moon pearl
yep<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.189> that's<00:01:41.430> something<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.060> should<00:01:42.210> go

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
yep so that's something you should go

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
out of your way to do absolutely it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.139 
out of your way to do absolutely it
increases<00:01:45.750> your<00:01:45.780> magic<00:01:46.640> upholding<00:01:47.640> abilities

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
why would you want to do that because I

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.880 
why would you want to do that because I
thought<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.100> got<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:51.439> there's<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.500> second

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
thought you got it there's a second

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.679 
thought you got it there's a second
level<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.310> magic<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:54.090> once<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.390> fill<00:01:54.570> up

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
level of magic like once you fill up

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.060 
level of magic like once you fill up
this<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.290> start<00:01:55.470> filling<00:01:55.680> up<00:01:55.799> another

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
this you can start filling up another

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.600 
this you can start filling up another
one

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
one

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.240 
one
