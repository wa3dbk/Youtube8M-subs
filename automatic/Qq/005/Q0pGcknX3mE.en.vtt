00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.910
 and friends forward here it exists 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.920
 a lot of videos and a lot 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.690
 disputes over casio g-shock watches 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.610
 they are known for their counter-impact and 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.439
 users wondered what 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.860
 will be with the clock if they fall big 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.050
 manor 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.000
 For example, if some kind of non- task root 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.230
 walking on the roof of building creation and 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.510
 accidentally breaks down 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.910
 200 fate extremal already in principle 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.010
 what is clear is what will happen to the clock 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.490
 find the answer to the question we arrived at 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.490
 construction site 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.400
 meet this stepan he volunteered to be 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.230
 volunteer in our uneasy 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.450
 the experiment we filled stepana 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.610
 different materials to his weight 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.690
 coincided with the average weight of a person that 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.239
 will happen next 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.100
 we raise the dummy 20 4th floor of this 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.219
 building under construction point height 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.649
 dropping is 75 meters dummy weight 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.839
 about 70 kilograms which is average 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.489
 weight man at the time of the fall rate 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.210
 lighthouses at about 40 meters 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.220
 give me a sec 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.409
 that is one hundred forty four kilometers per hour 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.229
 and honestly I think the clock is not 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.720
 endure such a fall and I'm sure that 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.460
 I stand and not so but let's look at 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.460
 5000 rubles come on 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.580
 we are at the top of the dummy is at the start 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.050
 from here 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.840
 instead of landing, they look like 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.820
 a matchbox is very scary but it 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.820
 worth it let's check our watches 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:43.200
 c hours 18 minutes 15 seconds 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:47.229
 Well, the times of advice are equally we are ready 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.030
 we are immediately ready so guys we start 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.369
 calculation then we have gathered here today 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.400
 The most important watch is now 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.780
 will fall and it will be just an action 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.780
 approximately start counting 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.170
 1 went 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.200
 let's go let's go 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
 So 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.740
 but they own it whole 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.560
 sign 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.330
 and so love virgin 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.330
 fine 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.060
 that the modes are switched 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.350
 external later but generally polo stimulating 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.610
 guys well this is from honest for and 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.340
 I could not imagine that it would be so 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:45.550
 perfect all the key backlights and worked 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.120
 all settings are fully active external 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.319
 watch type 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.489
 look hair even clasp 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.379
 even in these moments nothing 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.989
 suffered after soap i can say 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:58.609
 it was super mega cool let's 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.609
 look again this psh 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.530
 and how 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.599
 impressive sight well i hope you 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.969
 never have to check on 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.650
 strength be careful come on 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:25.349
 Our site would be worth a point ru and we will 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.349
 see together see you bye
