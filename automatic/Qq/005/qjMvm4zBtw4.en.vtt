so I'm twisting my hair and I just

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:13.759

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
thought you'd like to watch this is the

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.740 
thought you'd like to watch this is the
first<00:00:14.040> time<00:00:14.190> I've<00:00:14.309> twisted<00:00:14.519> my<00:00:14.700> hair<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.360> think

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
first time I've twisted my hair I think

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.810 
first time I've twisted my hair I think
in<00:00:15.870> two<00:00:16.049> weeks<00:00:16.289> maybe<00:00:16.619> you<00:00:17.340> know<00:00:17.400> like<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.670> said

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
in two weeks maybe you know like I said

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.480 
in two weeks maybe you know like I said
before<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.240> don't<00:00:18.359> really<00:00:18.630> twist<00:00:18.930> or<00:00:19.590> style<00:00:20.220> my

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
before I don't really twist or style my

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.679 
before I don't really twist or style my
hair<00:00:22.609> so<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.640> don't<00:00:23.939> have<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.090> kind<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.449> time

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
hair so I don't have that kind of time

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.570 
hair so I don't have that kind of time
and<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.740> don't<00:00:25.800> really<00:00:25.949> think<00:00:26.070> some<00:00:26.490> people

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
and I don't really think some people

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.189 
and I don't really think some people
twist<00:00:26.939> their<00:00:27.119> hair<00:00:27.390> because<00:00:27.630> they<00:00:27.900> really

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
twist their hair because they really

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.620 
twist their hair because they really
can't<00:00:28.650> live<00:00:28.920> with<00:00:29.400> shrunken<00:00:29.880> head<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.510> I'm
