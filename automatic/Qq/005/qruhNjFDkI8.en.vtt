meal planning or just kind of talk about

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.170 
meal planning or just kind of talk about
my<00:00:18.930> approach<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.220> me<00:00:20.369> personally<00:00:20.400> I

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
my approach to it so for me personally I

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.029 
my approach to it so for me personally I
don't<00:00:21.270> meal<00:00:21.840> plan<00:00:22.109> at<00:00:22.289> all<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.410> don't<00:00:22.529> bring<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
don't meal plan at all I don't bring a

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.550 
don't meal plan at all I don't bring a
lunch<00:00:23.070> box<00:00:23.490> around<00:00:23.820> or<00:00:24.150> cooler<00:00:24.689> or<00:00:24.990> whatever

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
lunch box around or cooler or whatever

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.080 
lunch box around or cooler or whatever
so<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.800> can<00:00:25.980> eat<00:00:26.130> meals<00:00:26.369> every<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:26.910> often

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
so I can eat meals every so often

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.820 
so I can eat meals every so often
because<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.900> really<00:00:28.019> doesn't<00:00:28.320> matter<00:00:28.410> how

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
because it really doesn't matter how

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.609 
because it really doesn't matter how
often<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.460> eat<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.939> will<00:00:29.970> see<00:00:30.179> people<00:00:30.480> doing

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
often you eat you will see people doing

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.810 
often you eat you will see people doing
intermittent<00:00:31.619> fasting<00:00:31.800> all<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> time<00:00:32.669> and

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
intermittent fasting all the time and

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.150 
intermittent fasting all the time and
they<00:00:32.910> will<00:00:33.059> go<00:00:33.210> 16<00:00:33.960> hours<00:00:34.530> without<00:00:34.800> eating

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
they will go 16 hours without eating

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.950 
they will go 16 hours without eating
they're<00:00:35.850> still<00:00:36.059> making<00:00:36.149> all<00:00:36.420> kinds<00:00:36.840> of

and<00:00:41.160> disadvantages<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.090> me<00:00:42.719> personally<00:00:43.260> I

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
and disadvantages to it me personally I

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.590 
and disadvantages to it me personally I
get<00:00:43.680> hungry<00:00:44.070> after<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.520> couple<00:00:44.940> hours<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.480> if

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
get hungry after a couple hours so if

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.240 
get hungry after a couple hours so if
you<00:00:45.719> were<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.870> meal<00:00:46.559> plan<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.039> meals

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
you were to meal plan and have meals

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.160 
you were to meal plan and have meals
every<00:00:47.730> couple<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.149> hours<00:00:48.270> then<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:48.989> obviously

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
every couple of hours then you obviously

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.020 
every couple of hours then you obviously
wouldn't<00:00:49.590> have<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.070> hungry<00:00:50.610> feeling

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
wouldn't have that hungry feeling

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.750 
wouldn't have that hungry feeling
because<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.780> sucks<00:00:52.110> when<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.949> hungry<00:00:53.399> I

really is the most important thing way
more<00:02:29.550> important<00:02:30.090> than<00:02:30.180> meal<00:02:30.630> planning<00:02:30.930> it's

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
more important than meal planning it's

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.530 
more important than meal planning it's
more<00:02:31.590> important<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.040> hit<00:02:32.310> your<00:02:32.580> set<00:02:33.150> numbers

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
more important to hit your set numbers

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.780 
more important to hit your set numbers
for<00:02:33.810> carbs<00:02:34.110> protein<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.620> fat<00:02:34.800> than<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.520> to

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
for carbs protein and fat than it is to

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.000 
for carbs protein and fat than it is to
worry<00:02:35.970> about<00:02:36.120> how<00:02:36.690> many<00:02:36.750> meals<00:02:37.110> am<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.650> going<00:02:37.860> to

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
worry about how many meals am I going to

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.590 
worry about how many meals am I going to
have<00:02:38.160> today<00:02:38.490> so<00:02:38.940> there<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.150> go<00:02:39.210> that's<00:02:39.390> my

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
have today so there you go that's my

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.690 
have today so there you go that's my
approach<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.050> meal<00:02:40.590> planning<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.670> a

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
approach to meal planning is it a

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.270 
approach to meal planning is it a
necessity<00:02:42.260> not<00:02:43.260> really<00:02:43.620> but<00:02:43.800> does<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.010> have

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
necessity not really but does it have

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.880 
necessity not really but does it have
its<00:02:44.640> advantages<00:02:45.110> yes<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.290> does<00:02:46.440> but<00:02:46.680> does<00:02:46.860> it

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
its advantages yes it does but does it

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.730 
its advantages yes it does but does it
have<00:02:47.100> disadvantages<00:02:48.110> yes<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.470> that's<00:02:49.680> really

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
have disadvantages yes and that's really
