00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello everyone my name is Artem and in 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.299
 today's lesson we will be with you 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.550
 create a brass text here 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.400
 blender and so get down go 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.599
 blender and here the first thing we add 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.970
 the text object will rotate it on the x axis by 90 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.369
 degrees and change the inscription to any 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.080
 I'll write another Cooper here 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.420
 so now go to the text tab 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.679
 and pass the dumb thickness parameter 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:37.079
 extrude mouth on 0.1 and creating chamfer 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:39.660
 to 0.2 now we need to raise two 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.309
 letters on top that she was not on one 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.530
 on par with the rest 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.899
 letters and for this we need 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.180
 first convert this text to our 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.930
 object press alt + c 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.250
 choose the second item in our temple text and 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.309
 now turn to the front view 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.510
 Art on it is a view of the mode of the warframe and 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.359
 edit mode 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.270
 now we have not allocated anything we 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:09.990
 press the key to select two data 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:12.990
 Letters of me are scale zz 0.7 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.850
 and now raise them so that they are 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.159
 in line with the rest of ours 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.040
 in letters 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.920
 but here's something like this all come back to 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.810
 object mode and now with the help of three 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.750
 modifier will create something that 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.130
 we will eventually be on the final area 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.189
 go to the modifiers tab and 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.290
 add 1 strap modifier 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.600
 he will recreate our topology again 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.840
 object now as you see here in 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.270
 editing mode we have top 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.390
 here is uneven and using 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.700
 mesh modifier increasing parameter 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.250
 internet we will re-create it 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.320
 immediately take points moody's correct 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.920
 thousands so that we have displayed the whole 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.079
 the text and its separate parts were not removed 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.170
 This parameter is now increased to 7 and 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.920
 we point the point of accomplishments 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.810
 now add 2 modifiers will it 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.569
 will reduce the amount of our earlier 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.060
 thereby keeping our shape 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.120
 at the facility here we just need 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.959
 change the type of chips snap lamarr and here 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.790
 unlimit to see you standing before 5 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.530
 here is now warframe mode you can 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.760
 see results now playing with 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.329
 hand parameter etc. 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.730
 you see how it changes with you more 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.849
 than eight should not be installed because 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.989
 how does it create a big load and 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.810
 Iâ€™ll focus on 7 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.019
 and now add the last modifier 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.069
 warframe now as you can see it happened here 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.200
 such a disgrace 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.019
 to get rid of it remove 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.669
 tick off ilyin cycle and now 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:51.680
 thickness set 0.03 here we have 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:54.319
 this is the text here as you see 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.959
 and sometimes normal but turned inside out but I somehow 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.139
 everything is so necessary in this 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.840
 case the text will be similar to brass when 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:04.849
 pretty simple material 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.150
 with the modifier settings we finished 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.040
 and now we add gender to the price 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.419
 it will be a plane we increase it to a hundred 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.870
 time 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:20.170
 s100 printer and front view 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:21.970
 located down here like this 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.800
 and now do not remove the selection with 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.200
 planes go to the materials tab 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.190
 create a line new material i will call 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.370
 here by default, all type of rendering in 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.860
 us oh course diffuse shader of birds and 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.000
 Now select the inscription itself we create 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.580
 Danish material 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.340
 call it cooper and change the shader here 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.010
 diffuse on autumn rough with 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.040
 established 0.1 so that you have it wrong 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:58.110
 strongly shone and change color 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:04:00.670
 i will use color and 79 66 would 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.750
 such a copper color can 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.230
 use the same 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.630
 and now let 's do the tuning and lighting 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.920
 I have a lamp, stand up and no, so I 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.739
 going to the right view 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.230
 and I will add you have it already 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.329
 have we just move it here to us 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.459
 you need to add a lamp here 3 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.330
 cells left and 1 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.190
 I add a point type and now move on 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.669
 in front view and center it 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.160
 our inscription will be like this 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.050
 located our lamp here on 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.960
 lamp tab immediately install laziness and 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.380
 salsa options are three and strength 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.300
 equal to 1000 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.720
 everything and the last one stayed with the camera me 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.700
 cameras by jennetta so i will add and 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.720
 to go to the view from the camera click 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.490
 control + alt + 0 0 under the keyboard 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.520
 so we moved to the view from the camera and now 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.039
 I'm a little readjusting to tie to the world 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.419
 mind and now will move here 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:03.520
 thereby moving the camera and now after 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.990
 I can make a trial 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.990
 render and see it 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.410
 if everything suits you all 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.150
 like it then on the tab ramira 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.190
 set the number of samples to 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.980
 final render of me it will be 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.610
 500 and to avoid these white ones 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.900
 pixels which is called fireflies 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.920
 set clang indirect parameters 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.050
 equal to one 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.910
 visually it is practically no way 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.680
 will affect our scene but will help 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.410
 to avoid 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.100
 here is this annoying noise and all and after 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.230
 this perform the final raids on 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.940
 this lesson is over all thanks to 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.940
 Meetings in the next lessons for now.
