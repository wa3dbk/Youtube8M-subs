00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
machines are these one-armed bandits I

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.120 
machines are these one-armed bandits I
showed<00:02:02.630> two<00:02:02.899> pictures<00:02:03.259> right<00:02:03.470> there<00:02:03.679> one<00:02:04.009> of

order of stuff that you get for the
percentage<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.930> first<00:02:24.620> thing<00:02:25.099> that<00:02:25.370> you

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
percentage the first thing that you

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.949 
percentage the first thing that you
actually<00:02:25.610> have<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:25.880> highest<00:02:26.269> chance<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.750> get

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
actually have the highest chance to get

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.620 
actually have the highest chance to get
is<00:02:27.140> money<00:02:27.560> which<00:02:28.190> is<00:02:28.430> two<00:02:28.730> things<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.329> a<00:02:29.420> bell

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
is money which is two things in a bell

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.780 
is money which is two things in a bell
the<00:02:29.660> second<00:02:30.349> one<00:02:30.530> right<00:02:30.769> here<00:02:31.519> is<00:02:31.640> actually

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
the second one right here is actually

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.670 
the second one right here is actually
nothing<00:02:32.239> which<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:32.959> kind<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:33.440> thought<00:02:33.620> that

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
nothing which I kind of thought that

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.319 
nothing which I kind of thought that
that<00:02:33.950> would<00:02:34.099> have<00:02:34.190> been<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.430> first<00:02:34.670> one<00:02:34.850> but

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
that would have been the first one but

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.020 
that would have been the first one but
the<00:02:36.139> most<00:02:36.410> likely<00:02:36.650> thing<00:02:37.220> you<00:02:37.459> will<00:02:37.609> get<00:02:37.819> is

the most likely thing you will get is
money<00:02:38.569> and<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.440> second<00:02:39.829> thing<00:02:40.160> is<00:02:40.569> nothing<00:02:41.569> at

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
money and the second thing is nothing at

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.170 
money and the second thing is nothing at
all<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.079> the<00:02:42.650> third<00:02:43.040> one<00:02:43.370> is<00:02:43.609> actually<00:02:43.880> that

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
all and the third one is actually that

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.840 
all and the third one is actually that
white<00:02:44.450> weapon<00:02:44.870> right<00:02:45.049> there<00:02:45.109> and<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:46.549> fourth

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.580 
get for three 7s in row the seventh one
is<00:03:04.400> just<00:03:04.609> one<00:03:04.880> thing<00:03:05.299> of<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.600> Iridium<00:03:06.109> the

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
is just one thing of the Iridium the

is just one thing of the Iridium the
eighth<00:03:06.889> one<00:03:07.280> is<00:03:07.459> a<00:03:07.489> little<00:03:07.730> different<00:03:08.000> it's

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
eighth one is a little different it's

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.539 
eighth one is a little different it's
the<00:03:08.480> three<00:03:08.870> Moxie<00:03:09.380> legs<00:03:09.650> in<00:03:09.829> row<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.310> you'll

most likely get a blue weapon but

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.720 
most likely get a blue weapon but
there's<00:03:12.440> a<00:03:12.530> small<00:03:12.709> chance<00:03:13.190> of<00:03:13.370> getting<00:03:13.639> a

zero<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.510> chance<00:03:29.870> of<00:03:30.079> getting<00:03:30.410> but<00:03:30.829> that's<00:03:31.069> it

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
zero to chance of getting but that's it

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.800
