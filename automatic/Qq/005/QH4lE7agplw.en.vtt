service to this team that's you know all
of<00:01:04.580> their<00:01:04.699> interests<00:01:05.180> should<00:01:05.540> be<00:01:05.690> aligned

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
of their interests should be aligned

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.510 
of their interests should be aligned
that<00:01:06.380> there<00:01:06.560> are<00:01:06.680> they<00:01:06.950> don't<00:01:07.100> get<00:01:07.280> to<00:01:07.430> the

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
that there are they don't get to the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.150 
that there are they don't get to the
goal<00:01:07.730> in<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.060> same<00:01:08.270> way<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:09.260> I<00:01:09.680> think<00:01:09.800> that's

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
goal in the same way so I think that's

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.710 
goal in the same way so I think that's
what<00:01:10.310> rody<00:01:10.550> is<00:01:10.670> always<00:01:11.300> trying<00:01:11.450> to<00:01:11.570> navigate
