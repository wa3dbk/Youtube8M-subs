00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.220
 Mr. peachum exactly a big 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.899
 an idol of this hour that is complicated 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.220
 picchu before I asked you something about 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.139

 how it all ended and you received it 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.010

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.720
 work 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.190
 mentalized this with an uncoded 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.640
 it's very powerful that now 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:31.359
 the mister crystallized in the end 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:33.790
 the pass to the effect and we started what 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.190
 better than starting some inaugurating 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.970
 children 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.930

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.930
 where I 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.360
 well the best way to start the year 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.360
 complicated 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:08.880

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.950
 maybe 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.539
 it is complicated shots and teeth 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.539
 in the country too 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:26.020

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.020

 a clinic and it's worth it now 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.190
 it is impressive 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.200
 but apart always emphasized the 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.020
 generosity of Miguel what is not 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.890

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.890
 let alone 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.310

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.550
 so much trajectory and so many years with the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.510
 success embracing the success of certain 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:09.030

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:11.270
 freedom to the stage that what you have to 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.270
