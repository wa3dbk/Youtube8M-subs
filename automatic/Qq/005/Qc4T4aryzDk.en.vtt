00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.730
 a legend back 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.090
 the new one is finally coming back every day 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:39.640
 an opel of emotions he wakes in 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.210
 the big footsteps of the old dt 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.040
 the form and the folding headlights also 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.150
 The small coupe quickly roll in 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.730
 the cult cars between 1968 and 73 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.430
 over 100,000 copies are sold 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.100
 About 70 percent of them are in America 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.930
 your fanbase 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.050
 no wonder the form reminds one of 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.899
 the then corvette with its 90 ps 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.330
 he reaches 185 km h peak 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.670
 then a top value so synonymous explains 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.090
 the legendary promotional slogan just fly 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.090
 is more beautiful 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.890
 in acceleration, the uae gt 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.540
 even the Porsche 912 in the duel with 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.550
 porsche, today's gt beats the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.060
 boxster from zero to a hundred by 0.4 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.050
 seconds the top speed is 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.190
 but at only about 230 km / h 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.710
 Looking at the data sheet turns out 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.520
 the gt as a real sports car 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.780
 two liter turbo engine with 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.220
 gasoline direct injection 264 ps 353 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.660
 meter maximum torque 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.880
 on the way in the gt one notes that he 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.100
 Although fast but no board ata bolide 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.170
 is the landing gear and the steering are 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.990
 not on extreme sports but on 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.180
 Fast cruising designed on curvy 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.790
 country roads are so fast driving fun 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.510
 on the turbo shows and the race kate 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.910
 can be addictive as well 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.470
 the design finally make an opel 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.959
 one admires from every angle 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.130
 can look at and again somehow 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.130
 he reminds of the corvette 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.980
 crouching on the standard 18 ZÃ¶llern 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.989
 the gt wide and deep above the asphalt 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.989
 and looks aggressively into the landscape 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.569
 nice details the chrome-framed 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.249
 air outlets on the bonnet and the 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.249
 side views in the front wheel arches 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.700
 The interior looks tidy 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.700
 Instruments are easy to read 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.530
 the seats are comfortable but could be something 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.719
 more sideways provide chrome and 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.060
 piano lacquer look noble but can be over 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:53.150
 the almost complete absence of stocks 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.859
 nothing to comfort in the way 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.230
 just as annoying the tedious roof 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.519
 opening actions button press lever 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.230
 pull off 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.420
 the roof in the already much too 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.010
 small trunk fold trunk space 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.170
 close and watch out though that one 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.500
 The jacket would not be stuck here 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.389
 an electric roof better 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.159
 on the other hand, only the turbo engine convinces 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:16.159
 sound could be a little Rowdy 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.719
 the gt has followed us over the 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.739
 performance has no roadster in 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.840
 this price range 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.689
 However, he is a real second under 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.670
 ask too few shelves in the interior 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.889
 tiny poorly usable trunk 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.749
 and the annoying hood mechanism 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.040
 In addition, the sixth course is missing 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:46.590
 if the circuit is very small 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.840
 Nevertheless, on sunny days on empty 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.530
 Roads will get the gp fast 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.530
 to distribute
