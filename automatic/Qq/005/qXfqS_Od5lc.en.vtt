for<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> eight<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.079> okay<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:55.949> here's<00:00:56.370> what

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
for a eight and okay so here's what

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.250 
for a eight and okay so here's what
comes<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.000> package<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.629> little<00:00:57.960> note<00:00:58.230> in

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
comes in the package a little note in

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.470 
comes in the package a little note in
addition<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> big<00:00:59.609> instruction<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.329> this

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
addition to the big instruction so this

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.029 
addition to the big instruction so this
must<00:01:00.719> be<00:01:00.870> stuff<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.320> people<00:01:01.440> often<00:01:01.859> make<00:01:02.010> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
accidental color transfer can happen

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.760 
accidental color transfer can happen
which<00:01:06.240> means<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> powder<00:01:06.780> will<00:01:07.049> come<00:01:07.229> off<00:01:07.409> and

which means the powder will come off and

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.050 
which means the powder will come off and

the back of the chair where she sat and
everything<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.860> hair<00:01:29.490> spray<00:01:29.909> seals

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
everything like that so hair spray seals

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.090 
everything like that so hair spray seals
it<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.900> keeps<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.350> color<00:01:31.500> from<00:01:31.829> coming

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
it in and it keeps the color from coming

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.010 
it in and it keeps the color from coming
off<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.490> getting<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.939> other<00:01:33.060> things<00:01:33.150> so

extra step set you're supposed to take
one<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.780> put<00:02:12.900> a

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
one is to put a

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.929 
one is to put a
over-the-shoulder<00:02:13.709> so<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.700> chalk

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
over-the-shoulder so that the chalk

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:16.309 
over-the-shoulder so that the chalk
powder<00:02:15.239> doesn't<00:02:15.510> get<00:02:15.689> onto<00:02:15.840> your<00:02:15.989> clothing

another<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.549> we<00:02:17.640> don't<00:02:17.819> have<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.269> this

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
another that we don't have is this

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.990 
another that we don't have is this
spray-on<00:02:19.379> primer<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.489> thought<00:02:20.670> what<00:02:20.849> is

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
spray-on primer and I thought what is

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.190 
spray-on primer and I thought what is
that<00:02:21.209> what<00:02:21.420> some<00:02:21.659> kind<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.900> spray-on

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
that what some kind of a spray-on

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.020 
that what some kind of a spray-on
conditioner<00:02:22.920> apparently<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.519> can<00:02:23.670> get<00:02:23.819> for

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
conditioner apparently you can get for

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.149 
conditioner apparently you can get for
your<00:02:24.120> hair<00:02:24.360> they<00:02:24.870> do<00:02:24.930> recommend<00:02:25.349> you<00:02:25.650> use<00:02:25.680> that

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
your hair they do recommend you use that

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.890 
your hair they do recommend you use that
I<00:02:26.189> guess<00:02:26.549> it<00:02:26.700> helps<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.209> grab<00:02:27.420> onto<00:02:27.659> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
I guess it helps it to grab onto the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.899 
I guess it helps it to grab onto the
chalk<00:02:28.170> they<00:02:28.709> do<00:02:28.769> not<00:02:29.069> however<00:02:29.220> recommend<00:02:29.700> you

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
try the blue and see how it works out

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.570

spin<00:04:11.620> side<00:04:11.890> down<00:04:12.160> chalk<00:04:12.760> side<00:04:13.060> up<00:04:14.310> but<00:04:15.310> little

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
spin side down chalk side up but little

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:28.940 
spin side down chalk side up but little
piece

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.980 

I<00:04:29.010> do<00:04:29.610> see<00:04:29.910> a<00:04:29.940> little<00:04:30.210> of<00:04:30.420> it<00:04:30.540> here<00:04:30.720> but<00:04:30.750> it's

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
I do see a little of it here but it's

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.630 
I do see a little of it here but it's
hard<00:04:31.170> to<00:04:31.260> show<00:04:31.440> up<00:04:31.560> on<00:04:31.710> that<00:04:31.770> really<00:04:32.100> dark<00:04:32.280> hair

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
hard to show up on that really dark hair

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.850 
hard to show up on that really dark hair
well<00:04:33.420> these<00:04:33.630> colors<00:04:34.020> we<00:04:34.200> had<00:04:34.320> some<00:04:34.500> trouble

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
well these colors we had some trouble

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.550 
well these colors we had some trouble
with<00:04:34.890> showing<00:04:35.370> up<00:04:35.580> in<00:04:35.730> this<00:04:35.880> fairly<00:04:36.870> dark<00:04:37.200> hair

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560

with showing up in this fairly dark hair
the<00:04:37.590> pink<00:04:38.100> is<00:04:38.250> good<00:04:38.400> though<00:04:38.610> I<00:04:38.640> think<00:04:38.940> it

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
the pink is good though I think it

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.190 
the pink is good though I think it
showed<00:04:39.240> up<00:04:39.360> really<00:04:39.600> well<00:04:39.720> so<00:04:39.780> I'm<00:04:40.020> going<00:04:40.140> to

in now again these colors I'm sure they

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.270 
in now again these colors I'm sure they
work<00:04:51.780> just<00:04:51.810> probably<00:04:52.350> not<00:04:52.710> so<00:04:52.920> well<00:04:53.070> in<00:04:53.190> the

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
work just probably not so well in the

work just probably not so well in the
dark<00:04:53.490> hair<00:04:53.700> but<00:04:53.850> we<00:04:53.970> do<00:04:54.090> have<00:04:54.240> an<00:04:54.390> idea<00:04:54.480> to<00:04:54.780> show

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
dark hair but we do have an idea to show

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.510 
dark hair but we do have an idea to show
you<00:04:54.990> what<00:04:55.170> they<00:04:55.260> look<00:04:55.290> like<00:04:55.440> hold<00:04:55.830> on<00:04:55.980> a<00:04:56.010> second

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
you what they look like hold on a second

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.790 
you what they look like hold on a second
alright<00:04:57.330> we<00:04:57.540> found<00:04:57.750> a<00:04:57.810> blonde<00:04:58.050> in<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:58.380> family

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
alright we found a blonde in the family

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.980 
alright we found a blonde in the family
this<00:04:59.040> is<00:04:59.100> actually<00:04:59.580> an<00:04:59.670> old<00:04:59.820> toy<00:05:00.210> that's<00:05:00.660> meant

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
this is actually an old toy that's meant

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.200 
this is actually an old toy that's meant
for<00:05:01.280> practicing<00:05:02.280> brushing<00:05:02.670> hair<00:05:02.880> putting

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
for practicing brushing hair putting

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.910 
for practicing brushing hair putting
Clips<00:05:03.570> do<00:05:03.720> it<00:05:03.840> if<00:05:03.990> in<00:05:04.140> hairstyle<00:05:04.380> so<00:05:04.830> we

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
Clips do it if in hairstyle so we

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.170 
Clips do it if in hairstyle so we
thought<00:05:05.070> would<00:05:05.190> try<00:05:05.340> a<00:05:05.370> couple<00:05:05.610> colors<00:05:05.970> on<00:05:06.150> it

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
thought would try a couple colors on it

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.580 
thought would try a couple colors on it
then<00:05:06.450> we<00:05:06.510> can<00:05:06.630> actually<00:05:06.750> see<00:05:07.080> if<00:05:07.170> it<00:05:07.260> washes

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
then we can actually see if it washes

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.130 
then we can actually see if it washes
out<00:05:07.710> so<00:05:08.610> let's<00:05:09.240> try<00:05:09.480> the<00:05:09.540> comet<00:05:09.870> as<00:05:09.960> that

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
out so let's try the comet as that

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.660 
out so let's try the comet as that
didn't<00:05:10.620> work<00:05:10.740> too<00:05:10.950> well<00:05:10.980> in<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.310> really<00:05:11.490> dark

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
didn't work too well in the really dark

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.100 
didn't work too well in the really dark
hair<00:05:11.970> would<00:05:12.300> you<00:05:12.360> mind<00:05:12.540> holding<00:05:12.690> under<00:05:13.020> the

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
hair would you mind holding under the

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:21.230 
hair would you mind holding under the
shoulders<00:05:13.500> there<00:05:13.770> let's<00:05:14.550> try<00:05:14.730> the<00:05:14.850> blue<00:05:20.240> guess

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
shoulders there let's try the blue guess

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.120 
shoulders there let's try the blue guess
synthetic<00:05:21.780> hair<00:05:21.990> this<00:05:22.230> may<00:05:22.410> not<00:05:22.560> stick<00:05:22.890> in<00:05:23.040> the

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
synthetic hair this may not stick in the

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.150 
synthetic hair this may not stick in the
same<00:05:23.310> way<00:05:23.460> as<00:05:23.580> real<00:05:23.790> here<00:05:24.890> see<00:05:25.890> what<00:05:26.040> it's

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
same way as real here see what it's

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.530 
same way as real here see what it's
doing<00:05:26.250> there<00:05:26.400> it's<00:05:26.820> just<00:05:26.910> sticking<00:05:27.180> to<00:05:27.360> some

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
doing there it's just sticking to some

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:37.010 
doing there it's just sticking to some
of<00:05:27.690> it<00:05:29.330> purple

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.900 

lots<00:05:38.020> of<00:05:38.169> purple<00:05:38.560> along<00:05:39.039> here<00:05:39.400> we've<00:05:39.610> got<00:05:39.759> the

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.999 
splat I guess splat hair chop we found
this<00:06:55.300> at<00:06:55.449> the<00:06:55.539> drugstore<00:06:55.779> and<00:06:56.289> it<00:06:56.680> was<00:06:56.860> I<00:06:56.979> think

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:57.009 
this at the drugstore and it was I think

00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:59.309 
this at the drugstore and it was I think
six<00:06:57.520> or<00:06:57.669> seven<00:06:58.029> dollars<00:06:58.150> but<00:06:58.810> that<00:06:58.990> was<00:06:59.139> for

00:06:59.309 --> 00:06:59.319 
six or seven dollars but that was for

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:01.800 
six or seven dollars but that was for
one<00:06:59.529> color<00:06:59.860> this<00:07:00.490> is<00:07:00.729> I<00:07:00.969> think<00:07:01.150> we<00:07:01.240> got<00:07:01.389> this<00:07:01.569> as

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:01.810 
one color this is I think we got this as

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.680 
one color this is I think we got this as
seen<00:07:02.080> on<00:07:02.229> TV<00:07:02.710> hot<00:07:03.069> hues<00:07:03.430> it's<00:07:03.909> four<00:07:04.180> colors<00:07:04.539> for

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:04.690 
seen on TV hot hues it's four colors for

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.659 
seen on TV hot hues it's four colors for
about<00:07:04.840> ten<00:07:05.080> dollars<00:07:05.289> so<00:07:05.710> this<00:07:06.250> is<00:07:06.460> less

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:06.669 
about ten dollars so this is less

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:08.730 
about ten dollars so this is less
expensive<00:07:06.849> for<00:07:07.539> getting<00:07:07.779> multiple<00:07:08.349> colors

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:08.740 
expensive for getting multiple colors

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.769 
expensive for getting multiple colors
but<00:07:09.340> apparently<00:07:09.699> this<00:07:09.909> one<00:07:10.150> may<00:07:10.330> do<00:07:10.389> a<00:07:10.509> better

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:10.779 
but apparently this one may do a better

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:13.230 
but apparently this one may do a better
job<00:07:10.900> I'm<00:07:11.860> actually<00:07:12.039> giving<00:07:12.639> you<00:07:12.699> the<00:07:12.819> color<00:07:13.029> if

do okay

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.920 
do okay
so<00:07:21.490> that's<00:07:21.940> sort<00:07:22.120> of<00:07:22.240> the<00:07:22.330> difference<00:07:22.719> this

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.930 
so that's sort of the difference this

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.120 
so that's sort of the difference this
seems<00:07:23.169> to<00:07:23.289> work<00:07:23.319> better<00:07:23.620> with<00:07:23.740> the<00:07:23.949> lighter

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.130 
seems to work better with the lighter

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.680 
seems to work better with the lighter
color<00:07:24.430> hair<00:07:24.699> though<00:07:24.969> there<00:07:25.180> is<00:07:25.300> a<00:07:25.330> difference

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:25.690 
color hair though there is a difference

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.480 
color hair though there is a difference
in<00:07:25.840> the<00:07:25.930> applicator<00:07:26.469> tell<00:07:26.740> me<00:07:26.860> about<00:07:26.949> that<00:07:27.219> how

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.490 
in the applicator tell me about that how

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.129 
in the applicator tell me about that how
did<00:07:27.880> the<00:07:28.090> problem<00:07:28.360> you<00:07:28.449> had<00:07:28.599> putting<00:07:28.840> this<00:07:28.930> on

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:29.139 
did the problem you had putting this on

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:33.629 
did the problem you had putting this on
um<00:07:30.509> it<00:07:31.509> did<00:07:31.719> come<00:07:32.050> with<00:07:32.199> the<00:07:32.380> sponge<00:07:32.710> but<00:07:33.219> the

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:33.639 
um it did come with the sponge but the

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:36.180 
um it did come with the sponge but the
sponge<00:07:34.000> seemed<00:07:34.479> to<00:07:34.719> wiggle<00:07:35.110> around<00:07:35.319> a<00:07:35.770> lot<00:07:35.979> in

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:36.190 
sponge seemed to wiggle around a lot in

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:41.149 
sponge seemed to wiggle around a lot in
my<00:07:36.460> fingers<00:07:37.000> so<00:07:37.870> I<00:07:38.430> just<00:07:39.430> ended<00:07:39.639> up<00:07:39.909> using<00:07:40.210> my

00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:41.159 
my fingers so I just ended up using my

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:43.879 
my fingers so I just ended up using my
right<00:07:41.789> this<00:07:42.749> one<00:07:43.050> it<00:07:43.259> comes<00:07:43.379> with<00:07:43.589> the<00:07:43.649> sponge

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:43.889 
right this one it comes with the sponge

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:46.159 
right this one it comes with the sponge
but<00:07:44.129> it's<00:07:44.279> not<00:07:44.459> attached<00:07:44.939> in<00:07:45.209> a<00:07:45.270> compact<00:07:45.839> form

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:46.169 
but it's not attached in a compact form

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:48.229 
but it's not attached in a compact form
like<00:07:46.529> this<00:07:46.800> so<00:07:47.279> it<00:07:47.550> was<00:07:47.639> like<00:07:47.759> a<00:07:47.789> separate

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:48.239 
like this so it was like a separate

00:07:48.239 --> 00:07:49.699 
like this so it was like a separate
sponge<00:07:48.539> you<00:07:48.779> had<00:07:48.869> to<00:07:48.959> try<00:07:49.080> to<00:07:49.110> keep<00:07:49.349> on<00:07:49.559> your

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:49.709 
sponge you had to try to keep on your

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:51.379 
sponge you had to try to keep on your
thumb<00:07:49.949> and<00:07:50.339> then<00:07:50.580> keep<00:07:50.789> the<00:07:50.909> chalk<00:07:51.149> on<00:07:51.360> the

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:51.389 
thumb and then keep the chalk on the

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:53.329 
thumb and then keep the chalk on the
other<00:07:51.599> and<00:07:51.959> I<00:07:52.319> kept<00:07:52.559> slipping<00:07:52.739> out<00:07:53.069> so<00:07:53.249> I

00:07:53.329 --> 00:07:53.339 
other and I kept slipping out so I

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:55.790 
other and I kept slipping out so I
remember<00:07:53.759> she<00:07:53.969> had<00:07:53.999> out<00:07:54.389> colored<00:07:55.169> fingers<00:07:55.559> for

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 
remember she had out colored fingers for

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.439 
remember she had out colored fingers for
a<00:07:55.830> while<00:07:56.009> afterwards<00:07:56.489> so<00:07:56.879> that's<00:07:57.059> part<00:07:57.330> of<00:07:57.389> the

00:07:57.439 --> 00:07:57.449 
a while afterwards so that's part of the

00:07:57.449 --> 00:07:59.179 
a while afterwards so that's part of the
other<00:07:57.599> deal<00:07:57.869> with<00:07:58.050> this<00:07:58.229> they<00:07:58.439> have<00:07:58.469> a<00:07:58.860> good

00:07:59.179 --> 00:07:59.189 
other deal with this they have a good

00:07:59.189 --> 00:08:01.040 
other deal with this they have a good
applicator<00:07:59.789> design<00:08:00.209> with<00:08:00.419> this<00:08:00.599> one<00:08:00.809> but

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.050 
applicator design with this one but

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.600 
applicator design with this one but

hair<00:08:04.499> chalk<00:08:04.800> may<00:08:05.339> be<00:08:05.399> the<00:08:05.580> way<00:08:05.669> to<00:08:05.729> go<00:08:05.939> we'll

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 
hair chalk may be the way to go we'll

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.269 
hair chalk may be the way to go we'll
put<00:08:06.539> a<00:08:06.569> link<00:08:06.779> to<00:08:07.050> both<00:08:07.199> of<00:08:07.439> them<00:08:07.559> down<00:08:07.769> below<00:08:07.979> so

00:08:08.269 --> 00:08:08.279
