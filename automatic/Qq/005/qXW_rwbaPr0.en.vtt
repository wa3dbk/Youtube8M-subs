00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
that first started making videos about

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.379 
that first started making videos about
last<00:00:06.299> year<00:00:06.660> I<00:00:07.049> made<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.890> video<00:00:08.189> with<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:09.030> little

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
last year I made a video with a little

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.930 
last year I made a video with a little
bra<00:00:09.599> lid<00:00:09.840> on<00:00:10.050> basically<00:00:10.679> on<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.490> outside<00:00:11.849> of

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
bra lid on basically on the outside of

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.520 
bra lid on basically on the outside of
my<00:00:12.090> shirt<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.540> lot<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.780> people<00:00:12.990> ask<00:00:13.139> me<00:00:13.230> what's

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
my shirt a lot of people ask me what's

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.150 
my shirt a lot of people ask me what's
up<00:00:13.650> with<00:00:13.769> that

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
up with that

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.340 
up with that
and<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.610> reason<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:14.969> did<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.210> was<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:16.170> I

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
and the reason I did that was so that I

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.290 
and the reason I did that was so that I
can<00:00:16.500> show<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.710> all<00:00:16.980> wear<00:00:17.220> bra<00:00:17.730> strap<00:00:18.029> length

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
can show you all wear bra strap length

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.660 
can show you all wear bra strap length
is<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.690> me<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.170> then<00:00:19.470> any<00:00:19.740> length<00:00:20.100> after<00:00:20.310> that

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
is on me and then any length after that

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.279 
is on me and then any length after that
you<00:00:20.910> will<00:00:21.029> be<00:00:21.090> able<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.480> see<00:00:21.660> where<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:21.990> falls

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
you will be able to see where that falls

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.700 
you will be able to see where that falls
on<00:00:22.529> me<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.710> determine<00:00:23.400> my<00:00:23.550> true<00:00:23.760> hair<00:00:24.000> length

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
on me to determine my true hair length

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
on me to determine my true hair length
so<00:00:25.710> that's<00:00:26.039> what<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.430> about

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
so that's what this is about

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.490 
so that's what this is about
that's<00:00:27.180> why<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.840> first<00:00:27.990> time<00:00:28.260> this

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
that's why this is the first time this

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.189 
that's why this is the first time this
is<00:00:28.619> why<00:00:28.769> I'm<00:00:28.830> doing<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.189> now<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:30.630> just<00:00:30.960> want

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
now and you can compare the videos

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.100 
now and you can compare the videos
basically<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.030> see<00:00:54.210> what<00:00:54.329> my<00:00:54.449> growth<00:00:54.750> rate<00:00:54.960> is

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
basically you see what my growth rate is

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.930 
basically you see what my growth rate is
like<00:00:55.350> if<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.010> want<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.250> compare<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.760> your

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
like if you want to compare to your

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.459 
like if you want to compare to your
growth<00:00:57.239> rate<00:00:57.390> some<00:00:57.780> people<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.440> that

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
growth rate some people like to do that

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.349 
growth rate some people like to do that
as<00:00:58.800> well<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.280> that's<00:00:59.730> all<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.030> video<00:01:00.270> is

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359

for the ends on the ends I use cool only
and<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.950> also<00:01:23.220> took<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.119> roots<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.560> flat

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
and I also took the roots and I flat

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.690 
and I also took the roots and I flat
ironed<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:27.390> took<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:28.400> just<00:01:29.400> took<00:01:29.520> the

ironed it I just took I just took the
flat<00:01:29.939> iron<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.229> pressed<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.009> roots

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
flat iron and I pressed it on the roots

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.940 
flat iron and I pressed it on the roots
for<00:01:32.549> about<00:01:32.759> two<00:01:33.030> seconds<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.650> took<00:01:34.829> it

out of the flat iron and I did that
because<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.470> plan<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:37.920> writing<00:01:38.280> my<00:01:38.520> hair<00:01:38.790> and

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
because I do plan on writing my hair and

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.359 
because I do plan on writing my hair and
it<00:01:39.360> helps<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:39.810> me<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.350> keep<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> tangles<00:01:41.250> out

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
it helps for me to keep the tangles out

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.190 
it helps for me to keep the tangles out
of<00:01:41.430> my<00:01:41.610> hair<00:01:41.850> while<00:01:42.090> I'm<00:01:42.210> writing<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.960> my

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
of my hair while I'm writing if my

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.569 
of my hair while I'm writing if my
hair's<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.530> little<00:01:43.740> bit<00:01:43.860> straighter<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
hair's a little bit straighter on the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.080 
hair's a little bit straighter on the
roots

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
roots

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.569 
roots
it's<00:01:45.240> not<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.469> wavy<00:01:46.469> like<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.859> usually<00:01:47.070> is

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
it's not a wavy like it usually is

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.700 
it's not a wavy like it usually is
especially<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.390> new<00:01:48.509> growth<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.289> it<00:01:49.469> helps

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
especially the new growth so it helps

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.260 
especially the new growth so it helps
for<00:01:49.859> that<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.219> that's<00:01:50.340> all<00:01:50.490> my<00:01:50.579> hair<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.909> kind

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
for that so that's all my hair is kind

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.880 
for that so that's all my hair is kind
of<00:01:51.420> straight<00:01:51.689> it's<00:01:51.960> big<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:52.530> straight<00:01:52.740> at<00:01:52.799> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
of straight it's big but straight at the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.190 
of straight it's big but straight at the
same<00:01:53.070> time<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.479> also<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.899> best<00:01:55.079> way

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
same time so that's also the best way

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.620 
same time so that's also the best way
for<00:01:55.380> me<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.500> compare<00:01:55.829> length<00:01:56.210> is<00:01:57.210> while<00:01:57.509> my

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
for me to compare length is while my

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.779 
for me to compare length is while my
hair<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:57.990> pretty<00:01:58.289> straight<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.009> I'm<00:01:59.579> just

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
hair is pretty straight and I'm just

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.300 
hair is pretty straight and I'm just
gonna<00:01:59.969> start<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.020> remember<00:02:01.770> where<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.100> came

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
gonna start so I remember where it came

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.120 
gonna start so I remember where it came
in<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.700> last<00:02:02.909> video<00:02:03.329> not<00:02:04.170> sure<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.679> it<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.069> know

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
in the last video not sure of it I know

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.800 
in the last video not sure of it I know
my<00:02:05.340> hair<00:02:05.520> did<00:02:05.759> grow<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> little<00:02:06.179> bit<00:02:06.299> because<00:02:06.600> I

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
my hair did grow a little bit because I

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.469 
my hair did grow a little bit because I
also<00:02:07.020> got<00:02:07.350> bangs<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:08.009> while<00:02:08.160> ago<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.149> believe

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
also got bangs a while ago and I believe

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.300 
also got bangs a while ago and I believe
they<00:02:09.629> came<00:02:09.869> somewhere<00:02:10.319> around<00:02:10.410> here<00:02:11.039> around

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
they came somewhere around here around

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.589 
they came somewhere around here around
my<00:02:11.760> upper<00:02:12.030> lip<00:02:12.269> and<00:02:12.569> at<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.140> moment<00:02:14.360> it's<00:02:15.360> on

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
my upper lip and at the moment it's on

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.270 
my upper lip and at the moment it's on
my<00:02:15.810> neck<00:02:15.870> somewhere<00:02:16.349> it's<00:02:16.830> like<00:02:16.980> by<00:02:17.130> my

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
my neck somewhere it's like by my

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.030 
my neck somewhere it's like by my
collarbone<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.870> know<00:02:18.989> that<00:02:19.230> my<00:02:19.590> hair<00:02:19.799> did

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
collarbone so I know that my hair did

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.670 
collarbone so I know that my hair did
grow<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.640> don't<00:02:20.940> know<00:02:21.060> exactly<00:02:21.420> how<00:02:21.630> much<00:02:21.840> but

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
grow I don't know exactly how much but

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.559 
grow I don't know exactly how much but
when<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.890> compare<00:02:23.310> videos<00:02:23.730> I'll<00:02:24.120> be<00:02:24.329> able<00:02:24.420> to

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
when I compare videos I'll be able to

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:31.130 
when I compare videos I'll be able to
see<00:02:24.840> just<00:02:25.230> like<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.590> will<00:02:25.739> too<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:29.750> this<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:30.930> at

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
see just like you will too so this is at

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.229 
see just like you will too so this is at
keeping<00:02:31.500> my<00:02:31.620> face<00:02:31.980> straight<00:02:32.370> forward<00:02:32.879> no

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
keeping my face straight forward no

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.559 
keeping my face straight forward no
funny<00:02:33.540> stuff

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.830 

so<00:02:40.170> hopefully<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:41.370> can<00:02:41.400> see<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.909> end<00:02:42.090> in<00:02:42.719> the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
so hopefully you can see the end in the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.899 
so hopefully you can see the end in the
camera<00:02:43.230> sometimes<00:02:44.040> it's<00:02:44.189> not<00:02:44.340> positioned

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
camera sometimes it's not positioned

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.569 
camera sometimes it's not positioned
correctly<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.810> when<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:46.739> look<00:02:46.980> at<00:02:47.099> a<00:02:47.129> video<00:02:47.340> I

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
correctly and when I look at a video I

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:48.920 
correctly and when I look at a video I
see<00:02:47.849> that<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.060> cut<00:02:48.329> off<00:02:48.359> something<00:02:48.719> so

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
see that I cut off something so

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.360 
see that I cut off something so
hopefully<00:02:49.319> and<00:02:49.560> cut<00:02:49.709> anything<00:02:49.920> off<00:02:52.370> and

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
hopefully and cut anything off and

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.619 
hopefully and cut anything off and
that's<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.840> as<00:02:55.049> far<00:02:55.260> as<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.530> back<00:02:59.629> just

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
that's that and as far as the back just

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:14.400 
that's that and as far as the back just
going<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.900> gather<00:03:01.079> all<00:03:01.439> of<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.799> hair

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.560 

so<00:03:14.950> hopefully<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.430> guys<00:03:15.640> saw<00:03:15.880> that<00:03:15.910> it's

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
so hopefully you guys saw that it's

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.670 
so hopefully you guys saw that it's
about<00:03:16.930> at<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:18.100> top<00:03:18.370> of<00:03:18.730> genes<00:03:19.570> that<00:03:19.780> sit<00:03:20.320> kind

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
about at the top of genes that sit kind

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.460 
about at the top of genes that sit kind
of<00:03:20.890> high<00:03:21.040> so<00:03:21.460> if<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:21.760> had<00:03:21.910> a<00:03:21.940> lowrider<00:03:22.450> jeans<00:03:22.630> it

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
of high so if I had a lowrider jeans it

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.350 
of high so if I had a lowrider jeans it
wouldn't<00:03:23.950> hit<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.280> top<00:03:24.490> of<00:03:24.520> my<00:03:24.790> jeans<00:03:25.060> but<00:03:25.240> if

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.860 
are curious about the inches my hair is
not<00:03:44.860> completely<00:03:45.370> straight<00:03:45.670> in<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:46.030> 24<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.630> while

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
not completely straight in a 24 a while

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.230 
not completely straight in a 24 a while
so<00:03:47.440> this<00:03:48.100> is<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.400> best<00:03:48.580> I<00:03:48.730> was<00:03:48.850> going<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.120> get

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
so this is the best I was going to get

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.450 
so this is the best I was going to get
for<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.510> moment<00:03:49.900> it's<00:03:49.990> good<00:03:50.200> measure<00:03:50.440> it<00:03:50.710> from

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
for the moment it's good measure it from

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.080 
for the moment it's good measure it from
the<00:03:52.120> front<00:03:52.300> of<00:03:52.420> my<00:03:52.540> head<00:03:52.780> always<00:03:53.080> to<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.500> back

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
wrong the last time so I'm going to

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.710 
wrong the last time so I'm going to
measure<00:03:59.920> it<00:04:00.190> right<00:04:00.220> this<00:04:00.790> time<00:04:00.850> and<00:04:01.330> hopefully
