00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.290
 hello and welcome to digital 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.689
 for the presentation of the joystick 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.599
 game gio tech hf2 which is a joystick 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:14.290
 wireless bluetooth for ps3 which 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:16.330
 works with two batteries lr6 no 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.280
 provided by whoever is at 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.700
 the back in a housing a little bit 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.600
 like on the xbox 360 controller 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.310
 so we put rechargeable batteries 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.440
 but we can obviously put batteries 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.860
 alkaline that also works in usb 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.910
 like ps3 joysticks there in these cases 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.579
 then there's no need to put pestle 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.350
 It's already a good point 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.870
 if not main main difference 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.059
 compared to the ps3 controller besides the 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.160
 form a new flat already controller that 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.550
 is more imposing a little bit more 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.999
 high and with a grip a small 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:55.120
 little closer also the xbox 360 with 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:56.499
 forms increasingly dug from the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.190
 arts is a bit brighter 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:01.569
 also compared to the ps3 obviously we 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.949
 will also find the big difference 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:06.910
 which is the position of the sticks 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:09.790
 analog that takes it back the same 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.830
 principle only on xbox 360 with a stick 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.140
 left analogue completely 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.370
 completely or left beyond the 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.950
 manna is there for allergic people 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.990
 that the largue onomie ps3 is not bad 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.560
 it makes it possible to have the 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.560
 really grows completely straight and 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.360
 have not inflected as safe as on 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.760
 ps3 but hey that's really really 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.950
 a matter of taste but the followers of 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.580
 the dualshock on the contrary you are 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.490
 allergic rather basically to taking in 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.830
 hand of the joystick 360 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.050
 So here we are at the level of 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.370
 change 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:50.700
 and triggers longer at the level 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.540
 triggers she has ra that allows to 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.520
 reach them 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.200
 with finally the middle of the index 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.190
 so it's true that it's not bad 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.640
 can win maybe a little bit 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.140
 from time to more ease to reach 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.510
 these famous trigger 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.890
 so that does not radically change the 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.390
 things but it 's not bad 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.390
 maybe a little bit of time in 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.190
 changes that one needs to use one's 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.690
 triggers l1 and r1 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.740
 otherwise we have a controller that is 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.290
 rather a correct punishment without more 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.180
 it is not exceptional that it is correct 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.400
 no problem we touched the man 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.230
 also plastic with touched like there 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.460
 it's very nice 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.040
 on the other hand at the level of the buttons that makes 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.330
 plus maybe it's a little more 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.810
 more entry level it's true 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.230
 told me the buttons that sound a bit a 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.630
 little hollow with plastic whose 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.540
 is not great great but good 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.470
 remains that remains correct even when 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.239
 chronology level 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.489
 on the other hand drugs of the cross 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:55.170
 directionally we will have 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.640
 maybe a little harder to pin down 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.050
 the different directions with respect to 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.670
 nice help ps3 or amenity all 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:05.610
 was everything is separate to see to the used 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.070
 we'll talk about it again during the written test 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.540
 otherwise at the level of the finish like the 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.700
 said my there are some small details 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.010
 finishing for at g unit engineering at 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.420
 trap level that does not close 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.400
 totally but good we find the same 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.850
 hd problem on the 360 ​​controller which is 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.709
 sometimes a little ill-fitting it is 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.290
 dramatic 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.890
 otherwise nothing special about 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.870
 ergonomics 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.700
 on the other hand here is very important press 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.560
 still we have a turbo button on 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.020
 this joystick that allows precisely 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.070
 to accelerate in order to simulate a 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.720
 the very fast pressures on the 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.310
 buttons to make it work it 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.520
 just press the east button 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.660
 pressed the turbo button like that and 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.910
 to press another button their 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.900
 sting and must let go as much turbo so 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.240
 there for example if we support all the 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.430
 turbo time one press on x once 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.550
 we release and even after conditions 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.960
 General button pressed x leaving 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.840
 for example it's going to be okay 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.000
 really a very fast movements 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.020
 as if we support it is really great 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.970
 quickly on the button and last point on 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.000
 is going to have some kind of little switch 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.800
 at the bottom of the joystick that allows 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.330
 simply to pay back 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.180
 commands between the triggers so there 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.040
 for example the triggers and nerdy 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.750
 two will be reversed so in 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.990
 some games that can be it can be 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.300
 it can be practical games games 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.020
 of style a charter and stuff like 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.000
 we're going we sometimes want the inverted 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.620
 orders so there the option is 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.090
 available 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.210
 that's all we can say about this 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.460
 geotech hf2 controller for the moment and 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:47.760
 so more information in the test 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.760
 written on thenumeriques.com see you soon
