00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
this is a second

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.610 
this is a second
Falcon<00:00:04.080> crazy<00:00:04.380> Kong<00:00:04.680> PCB<00:00:05.370> that<00:00:05.609> I<00:00:05.670> have<00:00:06.620> this

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
Falcon crazy Kong PCB that I have this

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.070 
Falcon crazy Kong PCB that I have this
one<00:00:07.859> mostly<00:00:08.309> boots<00:00:08.610> up<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:09.030> static<00:00:09.510> garbage

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
one mostly boots up to static garbage

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.620 
one mostly boots up to static garbage
but<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:10.559> Simon<00:00:11.010> actually<00:00:11.360> styled<00:00:12.360> it's<00:00:12.480> the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
but this Simon actually styled it's the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.720 
but this Simon actually styled it's the
gaming<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.259> crashed<00:00:13.559> it's<00:00:14.370> kind<00:00:14.639> of

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
gaming and crashed it's kind of

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.630 
gaming and crashed it's kind of
indicating<00:00:15.650> bad<00:00:16.650> Ram<00:00:17.010> when<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.369> sort<00:00:17.580> of

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
indicating bad Ram when that sort of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.279 
indicating bad Ram when that sort of
thing<00:00:17.789> usually<00:00:18.000> happens<00:00:18.510> but<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.750> tested<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
thing usually happens but I tested the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.170 
thing usually happens but I tested the
Rams<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.710> they<00:00:19.830> seemed<00:00:20.100> okay<00:00:20.550> that's<00:00:21.090> the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
Rams and they seemed okay that's the

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.380 
Rams and they seemed okay that's the
main<00:00:21.359> program<00:00:22.230> RAM<00:00:22.500> there<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.330> what<00:00:24.330> I've

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
main program RAM there and what I've

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.259 
main program RAM there and what I've
done<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.779> using<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.580> logic<00:00:26.580> probe<00:00:26.880> I

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
done is using the logic probe I

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.019 
done is using the logic probe I
basically<00:00:28.170> come<00:00:28.380> through<00:00:28.710> some<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.609> some<00:00:29.970> of

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
basically come through some of some of

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.010 
basically come through some of some of
the<00:00:30.210> chips<00:00:30.449> relating<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.050> CPU<00:00:31.470> area<00:00:32.809> for<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.870> red

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
the chips relating to CPU area for a red

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.229 
the chips relating to CPU area for a red
sticker<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.469> -<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:35.250> seems<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:35.820> some<00:00:36.090> bad

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
sticker on - that seems to have some bad

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.650 
sticker on - that seems to have some bad
signals<00:00:37.640> I'd<00:00:38.640> see<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.030> green<00:00:39.210> sticker<00:00:39.480> which

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
signals I'd see the green sticker which

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.780 
signals I'd see the green sticker which
might<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.680> some<00:00:40.950> bad<00:00:41.100> signal<00:00:41.489> lots<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.700> them

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
might have some bad signal lots of them

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.880 
might have some bad signal lots of them
on<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.000> scope<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.600> looks<00:00:42.750> slightly<00:00:43.110> weak<00:00:43.559> it's

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
on the scope it looks slightly weak it's

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.709 
on the scope it looks slightly weak it's
probably<00:00:44.219> ok<00:00:44.640> but<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.090> know<00:00:45.120> might<00:00:45.539> as<00:00:45.570> well

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
probably ok but you know might as well

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.330 
probably ok but you know might as well
check<00:00:46.260> them<00:00:46.410> around<00:00:46.500> make<00:00:46.680> sure<00:00:46.860> they're<00:00:47.010> ok

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
check them around make sure they're ok

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.850 
check them around make sure they're ok
so<00:00:48.180> I'm<00:00:48.270> gonna<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> look<00:00:49.530> at<00:00:49.680> some<00:00:49.800> of

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
so I'm gonna have a look at some of

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.850 
so I'm gonna have a look at some of
those<00:00:49.980> chips<00:00:50.250> now<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:51.440> made<00:00:52.440> an<00:00:52.559> interesting

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
those chips now I made an interesting

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.979 
those chips now I made an interesting
discovery<00:00:53.129> with<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> two<00:00:54.000> crazy<00:00:54.300> Kong<00:00:54.600> boards

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
discovery with the two crazy Kong boards

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.189 
discovery with the two crazy Kong boards
I've<00:00:55.110> got<00:00:55.460> both<00:00:56.460> look<00:00:56.789> identical

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
I've got both look identical

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.290 
I've got both look identical
they've<00:00:58.829> even<00:00:58.949> got<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> same<00:00:59.280> chips<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
they've even got the same chips in the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.060 
they've even got the same chips in the
same<00:01:00.510> positions<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.199> both<00:01:01.230> boards<00:01:01.920> I've

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
same positions on both boards I've

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.349 
same positions on both boards I've
actually<00:01:02.219> gone<00:01:02.460> through<00:01:02.520> pretty<00:01:02.969> much<00:01:03.030> every

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
actually gone through pretty much every

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.299 
actually gone through pretty much every
one<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.719> compared<00:01:04.110> them<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.619> can't<00:01:04.890> see<00:01:05.070> any

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
one and compared them so I can't see any

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.149 
one and compared them so I can't see any
hardware<00:01:06.180> differences<00:01:06.470> but<00:01:07.470> basically<00:01:07.890> I

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
hardware differences but basically I

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.010 
hardware differences but basically I
thought<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> roms<00:01:09.090> from<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.479> board<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.869> put

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
thought the roms from this board and put

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.359 
thought the roms from this board and put
them<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.380> board<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.040> what<00:01:11.189> those

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
them on this board and it's what those

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.600 
them on this board and it's what those
over<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.850> vice<00:01:12.060> versa<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:13.189> both<00:01:14.189> boards

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
over and vice versa and both boards

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.640 
over and vice versa and both boards
completely<00:01:15.150> failed<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.630> boot<00:01:15.869> when<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.409> did

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
completely failed to boot when I did

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.800 
completely failed to boot when I did
that<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.189> seems<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.150> some<00:01:18.420> slight

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
that so it seems that the some slight

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.539 
that so it seems that the some slight
hardware<00:01:19.380> different<00:01:19.650> somewhere<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.220> stops

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
hardware different somewhere that stops

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.190 
hardware different somewhere that stops
the<00:01:20.759> roms<00:01:20.970> being<00:01:21.330> swapped<00:01:21.600> over<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.080> it's

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
the roms being swapped over so it's

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.620 
the roms being swapped over so it's
actually<00:01:22.290> got<00:01:22.530> two<00:01:22.740> different<00:01:22.950> ROM<00:01:23.280> sets<00:01:23.630> even

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
actually got two different ROM sets even

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.480 
actually got two different ROM sets even
if<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.140> try<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.380> swap<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> graphics<00:01:26.280> roms

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
if I just try and swap the graphics roms

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.450 
if I just try and swap the graphics roms
over<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.210> then<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> graphics<00:01:28.710> completely

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
over and then the graphics completely

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.280 
over and then the graphics completely
scrambled<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> other<00:01:30.360> board<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.869> even<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
scrambled on the other board so even the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.690 
scrambled on the other board so even the
graphics<00:01:31.680> roms<00:01:31.860> are<00:01:31.979> completely<00:01:32.490> different

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
graphics roms are completely different

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.149 
graphics roms are completely different
and<00:01:33.450> what<00:01:33.869> am<00:01:33.960> i<00:01:34.020> doing<00:01:34.320> today<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.680> read<00:01:34.920> some

swappable<00:01:50.009> fairly<00:01:50.790> easy<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.030> solve<00:01:51.329> this

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
swappable fairly easy to solve this

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.260 
swappable fairly easy to solve this
actually<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.770> banks<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.280> four<00:01:53.579> jumper<00:01:54.030> pads

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
actually the banks of four jumper pads

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.929 
actually the banks of four jumper pads
on<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> back<00:01:54.950> control<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.219> dress<00:01:56.460> lines<00:01:56.700> on

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
on the back control the dress lines on

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.870 
on the back control the dress lines on
the<00:01:57.060> eproms<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.979> between<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.100> two<00:01:59.280> four<00:01:59.549> sets

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
the eproms and between the two four sets

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.380 
the eproms and between the two four sets
I<00:02:00.180> think<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.439> one<00:02:01.649> has<00:02:02.000> non-standard<00:02:03.000> eproms

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
I think this one has non-standard eproms

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.029 
I think this one has non-standard eproms
it's<00:02:03.659> got<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.930> H<00:02:04.079> ends<00:02:04.320> force<00:02:05.070> twenty<00:02:05.909> six<00:02:06.240> is

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
it's got the H ends force twenty six is

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.650 
it's got the H ends force twenty six is
so<00:02:08.039> that's<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.879> reason<00:02:09.000> why<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.330> didn't

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
so that's the reason why that didn't

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.679 
so that's the reason why that didn't
work<00:02:09.780> before

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:11.689 
work before

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:15.080 
work before
okay<00:02:12.689> I'm<00:02:12.959> crazy<00:02:13.409> Kong<00:02:13.709> bored<00:02:14.099> number<00:02:14.580> two<00:02:14.790> I

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
okay I'm crazy Kong bored number two I

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.089 
okay I'm crazy Kong bored number two I
found<00:02:15.599> one<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.319> that's<00:02:16.439> a<00:02:16.590> problem

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
found one of the that's a problem

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.479 
found one of the that's a problem
I've<00:02:17.640> socketed<00:02:18.510> this<00:02:18.659> 1:07<00:02:19.470> p.m.<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:20.310> the

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
I've socketed this 1:07 p.m. in the

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.390 
I've socketed this 1:07 p.m. in the
timing<00:02:20.939> circuit<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.829> the<00:02:22.829> original<00:02:23.159> chip

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
timing circuit and the original chip

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.089 
timing circuit and the original chip
back<00:02:23.640> in<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:25.140> can<00:02:25.290> see<00:02:25.439> the<00:02:25.470> graphics<00:02:26.010> are

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
back in you can see the graphics are

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.640 
back in you can see the graphics are
completely<00:02:26.579> screwed<00:02:26.849> up<00:02:27.180> texts<00:02:27.959> all<00:02:28.140> over<00:02:28.170> the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
completely screwed up texts all over the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.750 
completely screwed up texts all over the
place<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.299> game<00:02:30.480> crashes<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.019> lot<00:02:31.430> so<00:02:32.430> I'm

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
place and the game crashes a lot so I'm

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.399 
place and the game crashes a lot so I'm
just<00:02:32.909> going<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.090> replace<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.870> with<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.140> new

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
just going to replace that with a new

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.020 
just going to replace that with a new
chip<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.370> that's<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:36.090> new<00:02:36.390> 1:07<00:02:37.140> fitted

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
chip so that's a new 1:07 fitted

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.190 
chip so that's a new 1:07 fitted
straight<00:02:39.030> from<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.269> title<00:02:39.569> screen<00:02:39.599> you<00:02:40.019> can

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
straight from the title screen you can

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.009 
straight from the title screen you can
see<00:02:40.579> it's<00:02:41.579> a<00:02:41.730> hell<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.209> lot<00:02:42.359> better<00:02:42.540> it's

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
see it's a hell of a lot better it's

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.569 
see it's a hell of a lot better it's
still<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.260> bit<00:02:43.379> of<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.590> sprite<00:02:43.920> issue<00:02:44.159> they<00:02:44.459> see

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
still a bit of a sprite issue they see

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.670 
still a bit of a sprite issue they see
yeah<00:02:45.120> donkey<00:02:45.420> kong<00:02:45.690> sort<00:02:45.989> of<00:02:46.049> floating<00:02:46.590> in

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
yeah donkey kong sort of floating in

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.680 
yeah donkey kong sort of floating in
mid-air<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.310> keeps<00:02:47.459> going<00:02:47.609> white<00:02:47.940> and

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
mid-air and keeps going white and

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.539 
mid-air and keeps going white and
there's<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.900> bit<00:02:49.049> of<00:02:49.139> crap<00:02:49.859> around<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.280> top

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
there's a bit of crap around this top

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.110 
there's a bit of crap around this top
area<00:02:50.819> here<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.590> little<00:02:52.859> London<00:02:53.220> blue

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
area here and this little London blue

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.710 
area here and this little London blue
girder<00:02:54.480> there<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:56.030> that's<00:02:57.030> all<00:02:57.209> wrong<00:02:57.420> cool

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
girder there and that's all wrong cool

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.190 
girder there and that's all wrong cool
there<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:58.620> certainly<00:02:59.579> not<00:02:59.849> fixed<00:03:00.540> yet<00:03:00.840> thought

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
there so certainly not fixed yet thought

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.530 
there so certainly not fixed yet thought
massively<00:03:01.920> better<00:03:02.250> by<00:03:02.549> replacing<00:03:02.879> that<00:03:03.239> 107

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
massively better by replacing that 107

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.809 
massively better by replacing that 107
so<00:03:06.540> bit<00:03:06.750> rubbish<00:03:07.019> on<00:03:07.290> there<00:03:10.459> this<00:03:11.459> is<00:03:11.609> annoying

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
so bit rubbish on there this is annoying

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.220 
so bit rubbish on there this is annoying
this<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:13.069> 7<00:03:14.069> 4<00:03:14.310> LS<00:03:14.670> warm<00:03:15.030> oh<00:03:15.329> servant<00:03:16.079> I

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
this is the 7 4 LS warm oh servant I

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.470 
this is the 7 4 LS warm oh servant I
just<00:03:16.530> removed<00:03:16.859> that<00:03:17.069> was<00:03:17.310> clearly<00:03:17.639> faulty<00:03:18.150> as

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
just removed that was clearly faulty as

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.699 
just removed that was clearly faulty as
you<00:03:18.660> can<00:03:18.780> see<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.199> says<00:03:19.470> pass<00:03:20.000> so<00:03:21.379> it<00:03:22.379> seems

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
you can see it says pass so it seems

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.099 
you can see it says pass so it seems
that<00:03:22.859> our<00:03:22.980> chip<00:03:23.250> isn't<00:03:23.549> able<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:24.000> drive<00:03:24.449> logic

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
that our chip isn't able to drive logic

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.930 
that our chip isn't able to drive logic
levels<00:03:25.410> greatly<00:03:25.829> even<00:03:25.949> though<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.370> will<00:03:26.549> pass

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
levels greatly even though it will pass

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.659 
levels greatly even though it will pass
when<00:03:27.660> tested<00:03:28.079> out<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.500> circuit<00:03:29.010> that's

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
when tested out of circuit that's

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.670 
when tested out of circuit that's
something<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.030> gotta<00:03:30.209> watch<00:03:30.419> out<00:03:30.660> for<00:03:30.690> when

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
something you gotta watch out for when

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.860 
something you gotta watch out for when
testing<00:03:32.280> chips<00:03:34.190> I've<00:03:35.190> replaced<00:03:35.669> the<00:03:35.940> seven

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
testing chips I've replaced the seven

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.920 
testing chips I've replaced the seven
four<00:03:37.169> seven<00:03:37.530> four<00:03:38.040> that's<00:03:38.849> I<00:03:39.299> previously

scope<00:03:45.449> but<00:03:45.810> replacing<00:03:47.150> has<00:03:48.150> brought<00:03:48.569> the

scope but replacing has brought the

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.890

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:15.789 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:18.189 

yeah<00:04:16.789> sounds<00:04:17.180> like<00:04:17.239> as<00:04:17.389> a<00:04:17.419> couple<00:04:17.720> sounds

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
yeah sounds like as a couple sounds

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.420 
yeah sounds like as a couple sounds
missing<00:04:18.590> I<00:04:18.650> need<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:18.859> have<00:04:18.949> a<00:04:18.979> look<00:04:19.160> at<00:04:19.280> our

next<00:04:19.669> I'm<00:04:20.449> glad<00:04:20.690> to<00:04:20.840> see<00:04:20.959> it's<00:04:21.109> actually

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
next I'm glad to see it's actually

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.790 
next I'm glad to see it's actually
rolling<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:22.520> playable<00:04:22.940> right<00:04:23.210> now<00:04:23.419> so<00:04:24.289> I'll

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.529 
rolling and playable right now so I'll
start<00:04:25.009> off<00:04:25.100> here<00:04:25.190> that<00:04:25.340> sounds<00:04:28.360> right<00:04:29.360> I<00:04:29.389> just

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
start off here that sounds right I just

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.120 
start off here that sounds right I just
noticed<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.139> pressing<00:04:30.650> on<00:04:30.740> one<00:04:30.919> of<00:04:30.949> the

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
noticed that pressing on one of the

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.909 
noticed that pressing on one of the
sound<00:04:31.400> sample<00:04:31.910> roms<00:04:32.090> will<00:04:32.990> actually<00:04:33.229> bring

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
sound sample roms will actually bring

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:40.840 
sound sample roms will actually bring
back<00:04:38.650> take<00:04:39.650> some<00:04:39.830> fiddling<00:04:40.190> to<00:04:40.370> go<00:04:40.460> to<00:04:40.669> work

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
back take some fiddling to go to work

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:48.159 
back take some fiddling to go to work
okay<00:04:46.210> so<00:04:47.210> I<00:04:47.270> think<00:04:47.449> I<00:04:47.660> need<00:04:47.750> to<00:04:47.870> replace<00:04:48.110> a

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
okay so I think I need to replace a

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.520 
okay so I think I need to replace a
socket

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.740 

so<00:04:51.530> I've<00:04:51.650> replaced<00:04:51.979> the<00:04:52.160> socket<00:04:52.820> on<00:04:52.940> this<00:04:53.270> ROM

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
so I've replaced the socket on this ROM

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.990 
so I've replaced the socket on this ROM
here<00:04:54.020> these<00:04:54.289> two<00:04:54.650> here<00:04:54.979> contain<00:04:55.669> the<00:04:55.910> samples

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
here these two here contain the samples

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.870 
here these two here contain the samples
does<00:04:59.000> no<00:04:59.300> coin<00:04:59.690> the<00:04:59.900> sound

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:17.220 

and<00:05:07.880> also<00:05:08.290> become<00:05:09.290> jumping<00:05:09.830> noises<00:05:09.980> missing

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.879 

however<00:05:18.230> the<00:05:18.830> run<00:05:19.040> and<00:05:19.310> jump<00:05:19.460> now<00:05:19.700> works<00:05:20.650> so<00:05:21.650> I

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
however the run and jump now works so I

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.670 
however the run and jump now works so I
suspect<00:05:22.700> this<00:05:23.240> okay<00:05:23.570> it's<00:05:23.870> probably<00:05:24.169> also<00:05:24.320> bad

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
suspect this okay it's probably also bad

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.810 
suspect this okay it's probably also bad
so<00:05:25.250> I'm<00:05:25.490> gonna<00:05:25.610> change<00:05:25.850> that<00:05:26.030> now<00:05:27.340> so<00:05:28.340> I've<00:05:28.669> now

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
so I'm gonna change that now so I've now

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.060 
so I'm gonna change that now so I've now
replaced<00:05:29.180> both<00:05:29.480> of<00:05:29.750> these<00:05:29.930> sounds<00:05:30.500> hand<00:05:30.830> pull

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
replaced both of these sounds hand pull

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.790 
replaced both of these sounds hand pull
the<00:05:31.700> EEPROM<00:05:32.360> sockets<00:05:32.840> and<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.169> game<00:05:33.560> should

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
the EEPROM sockets and the game should

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.390 
the EEPROM sockets and the game should
now<00:05:34.010> be<00:05:34.280> 100%<00:05:34.970> fully<00:05:35.389> working<00:05:36.070> so<00:05:37.070> let's<00:05:37.250> just

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
now be 100% fully working so let's just

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.060 
now be 100% fully working so let's just
try<00:05:37.520> and<00:05:37.639> clean<00:05:37.850> up<00:05:38.470> that<00:05:39.470> sound<00:05:39.800> is<00:05:39.950> now

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
try and clean up that sound is now

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.390 
try and clean up that sound is now
present<00:05:40.639> I<00:05:41.560> remember<00:05:42.560> the<00:05:42.650> Kong<00:05:42.860> sound<00:05:43.190> was

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400
