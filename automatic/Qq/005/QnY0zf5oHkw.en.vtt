00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.060
 previous plus week we want that 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.400

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.829
 With much desire we are training 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.930
 we have calculated we have a team the 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.730
 best car preparation equipment 16 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.320
 be with us we were first 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.989
 Ecuadorians the first that would not count 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.970
 be here with a super responsibility 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.370
 great and now we have already reviewed 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.159
 mechanical technical functions and we are 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.159
 ready for the race there is no other 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.559
 career in the world that looks like 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.879
 calcines this route 40 as a high school 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.679
 for the dakar in the face that element 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.649
 main so that you have an idea 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.359
 it's about 9,000 kilometers this is 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.410
 a race of four thousand for us 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.390
 can prepare us this is the occasion 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.910
 then so we are taking it we have 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.649
 to finish and we are all seeing see 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.179
 what result to have and of course leave in 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.570
 high the name of ecuador in its first 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:11.570
 dakar yes 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.220
 the third stage was hard 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.390
 it is not known yet because we did not reach the 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.759
 camp but until six thirty 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.800
 in the morning but the doctor at night and 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.630
 It is very hard and it is very risky to exit 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.310
 that hour without being able to see anything yesterday did not 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.870
 could do nothing if you have to do it 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.300
 all there is no cancer oil hides the 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.050
 points of changing pills we saw the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.050
 part of the car 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.370
 of career but but very good of the day 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.370
 complicated world are the famous hard 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.040
 call her where 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.069
 the face and the most part 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.849
 risky of all people 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.849
 very good 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:03:00.290
 on a day of teacher's choice to 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:03:00.290
 come out with a lot of resistance 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.390
 a very nice race the united vegetable 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.569
 charcoal to the mature charge running in 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.999
 the country 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.060
 very important that brothers of 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:36.459
 Latin America join 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.410
 I know very nice players and in 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.209
 definitive when the more we are 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.310
 surely more pilots are going to have 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.220
 chance to win and leave in quality this 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.209
 a very complex very difficult sport 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.209
 dangerous that requires experience 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.980
 we have made many friends here and 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.900
 they begin to meet the people of 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.520
 camp have seen us as 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.530
 welcome we have had constant 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.900
 of we have had strong stomping the 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.590
 accelerator to the level that we 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:15.160
 We put it is very good and we started from 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.019
 day on Sunday on the ramp will arrive 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.690
 today Saturday he got the number 7 in the 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.669
 general in your balance more than positive more 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.080
 that happy yes and the most important thing that 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:27.200
 it was the inscription of being inscribed 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:30.290
 for the meat it 's got 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.970
 in the breeding stage , I went 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.200
 super cool we ask for a super risk 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.970
 quiet knowing that we do not have to 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.470
 risk we have to maintain our 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.270
 first place is in taking out villas and 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.590
 our position in general in the 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.390
 category we are second also like this 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.060
 that in the three classifications we are 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.480
 much higher than ever 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.480
 we imagine 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.610
 Complete registration for the 2014 Dakar 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.420
