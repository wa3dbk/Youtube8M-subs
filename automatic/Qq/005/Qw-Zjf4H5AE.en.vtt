00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
now what the machine is doing is

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.600 
now what the machine is doing is
straight<00:05:03.849> stitching<00:05:04.510> and<00:05:04.979> going<00:05:05.979> over<00:05:06.159> to<00:05:06.460> the

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.350 

this<00:05:23.710> is<00:05:23.950> what<00:05:24.190> it<00:05:24.310> should<00:05:24.340> look<00:05:24.580> like<00:05:24.730> on<00:05:25.210> the
