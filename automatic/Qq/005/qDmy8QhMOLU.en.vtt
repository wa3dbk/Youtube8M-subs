00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
like why people fart more is it because

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.570 
like why people fart more is it because
I<00:01:24.439> think<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.560> because<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.860> drink<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.310> lot<00:01:26.340> of

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
I think it's because I drink a lot of

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.569 
I think it's because I drink a lot of
pop<00:01:26.790> maybe<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.659> makes<00:01:27.869> me<00:01:28.080> burp<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.590> fart<00:01:28.740> or<00:01:29.310> I
