00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
it's the fact that it was very very

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.560

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
quickly and they all ended within three

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.810 
quickly and they all ended within three
to<00:00:28.140> four<00:00:28.410> minutes<00:00:28.650> felt<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.519> was<00:00:29.640> playing

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
until then it doesn't really matter

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.490 
until then it doesn't really matter
because<00:01:38.420> Jeff<00:01:39.420> only<00:01:39.659> has<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:41.119> finishing<00:01:42.119> move

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
because Jeff only has one finishing move

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.569 
because Jeff only has one finishing move
currently<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.710> can't<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.070> more<00:01:44.250> than<00:01:44.310> one

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
currently and can't have more than one

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.700 
currently and can't have more than one
when<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.790> first<00:01:44.850> start<00:01:45.299> my<00:01:45.840> career<00:01:45.899> mode<00:01:46.470> so

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
when you first start my career mode so

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.499 
when you first start my career mode so
it<00:01:46.740> doesn't<00:01:47.009> really<00:01:47.070> matter<00:01:47.340> however<00:01:48.149> it

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
it doesn't really matter however it

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.969 
it doesn't really matter however it
would<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.689> nice<00:01:48.990> because<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.409> could<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.710> add

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
would be nice because I could just add

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.550 
would be nice because I could just add
the<00:01:50.220> twist<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.670> fate<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.240> his<00:01:51.509> signature<00:01:52.320> moves

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
the twist of fate to his signature moves

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.530 
the twist of fate to his signature moves
and<00:01:52.890> then<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.700> could<00:01:53.939> follow<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.240> up<00:01:54.390> with<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
and then I could follow it up with a

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.240 
and then I could follow it up with a
Swanton<00:01:54.840> bomb<00:01:55.079> much<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.649> he<00:01:55.770> does<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.159> real

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
doing so you can see I wouldn't be able

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.080 
doing so you can see I wouldn't be able
to<00:04:09.870> get<00:04:10.050> the<00:04:10.410> whisper<00:04:10.920> in<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.070> wind<00:04:11.100> to<00:04:11.340> go<00:04:11.550> at

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
to get the whisper in the wind to go at

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.070 
to get the whisper in the wind to go at
this<00:04:12.210> point<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:12.600> thought<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.900> match<00:04:13.050> was

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
this point I thought the match was

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.840 
this point I thought the match was
actually<00:04:13.530> kind<00:04:13.740> of<00:04:13.830> glitch<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:14.550> I<00:04:14.670> would<00:04:14.790> have

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
actually kind of glitch and I would have

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.580 
actually kind of glitch and I would have
been<00:04:15.000> really<00:04:15.150> mad<00:04:15.420> if<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.750> got<00:04:15.960> the<00:04:16.170> pitfall

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
been really mad if you got the pitfall

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.500 
been really mad if you got the pitfall
right<00:04:16.859> here

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
right here

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.870 
right here
because<00:04:17.960> i'm<00:04:18.230> actually<00:04:18.410> not<00:04:18.620> used<00:04:19.070> to<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.670> pin

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
because i'm actually not used to the pin

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.060 
because i'm actually not used to the pin
system<00:04:20.150> you<00:04:20.600> get<00:04:20.780> used<00:04:21.050> to<00:04:21.140> it<00:04:21.260> as<00:04:21.500> you<00:04:21.650> play<00:04:21.890> it

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
system you get used to it as you play it

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.730 
system you get used to it as you play it
more<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:22.370> more<00:04:22.430> but<00:04:23.210> in<00:04:23.780> terms<00:04:23.840> of<00:04:24.200> timing<00:04:24.500> and

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
more and more but in terms of timing and

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.010 
more and more but in terms of timing and
stuff<00:04:25.090> pinning<00:04:26.090> in<00:04:26.210> this<00:04:26.360> game<00:04:26.570> could<00:04:26.840> be

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
stuff pinning in this game could be

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.040 
stuff pinning in this game could be
really<00:04:27.380> frustrating<00:04:27.590> and<00:04:28.160> very<00:04:28.220> very<00:04:29.050> very

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
really frustrating and very very very

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.860 
really frustrating and very very very
unpredictable<00:04:30.770> like<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:32.270> first<00:04:32.480> time<00:04:32.690> I

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
unpredictable like the first time I

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.930 
unpredictable like the first time I
played<00:04:32.930> this<00:04:33.200> game<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.890> jumped<00:04:34.490> in<00:04:34.550> a<00:04:34.640> couple

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
played this game I jumped in a couple

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.360 
played this game I jumped in a couple
matches<00:04:35.300> one<00:04:35.450> of<00:04:35.540> the<00:04:35.600> matches<00:04:35.780> I<00:04:36.230> got<00:04:37.010> pinned

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370
