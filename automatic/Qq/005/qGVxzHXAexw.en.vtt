00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
at the grinder piece does the bottom

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.639 
at the grinder piece does the bottom
piece<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.910> comes<00:00:42.090> out<00:00:42.239> after<00:00:43.230> your<00:00:43.350> grind

the<00:00:43.770> coffee<00:00:43.950> it's<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.460> here<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.789> little<00:00:45.180> nice

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
the coffee it's in here a little nice

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.069 
the coffee it's in here a little nice
container<00:00:46.370> found<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.520> seems<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.149> pretty

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
container found that seems to be pretty

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.260 
container found that seems to be pretty
nice<00:00:49.200> form-fitting<00:00:49.829> okay<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
nice form-fitting okay so this is the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.729 
nice form-fitting okay so this is the
adjustment<00:00:51.690> level<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:54.320> basically<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
adjustment level so basically on the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.180 
adjustment level so basically on the
internet<00:00:56.360> what<00:00:57.360> other<00:00:57.570> people<00:00:57.989> say<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.739> there

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
internet what other people say is there

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.450 
internet what other people say is there
are<00:00:59.280> directions<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.940> here<00:01:00.710> see<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.280> in

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
are directions in here see but it's in

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.490 
are directions in here see but it's in
Japanese<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.629> doesn't<00:01:03.899> help<00:01:03.989> me<00:01:04.110> very<00:01:04.379> much

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
Japanese so it doesn't help me very much

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.570 
Japanese so it doesn't help me very much
so<00:01:05.330> basically<00:01:06.439> most<00:01:07.439> people<00:01:07.590> recommend<00:01:08.280> that

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
so basically most people recommend that

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.510 
so basically most people recommend that
you<00:01:08.909> go<00:01:09.060> all<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.840> way<00:01:09.869> tight<00:01:10.310> basically<00:01:11.310> where

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
you go all the way tight basically where

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.730 
you go all the way tight basically where
you<00:01:11.640> can't<00:01:11.909> turn<00:01:12.119> anymore<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:13.710> you

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
you can't turn anymore and then you

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.060 
you can't turn anymore and then you
slowly<00:01:14.340> turn<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.450> until<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.840> hear<00:01:16.020> clicks<00:01:16.350> so

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
slowly turn it until you hear clicks so

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.420 
slowly turn it until you hear clicks so
I'm<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.880> probably<00:01:18.060> grind<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> a

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
I'm going to probably grind at a a

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.700 
I'm going to probably grind at a a
medium<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.790> our<00:01:20.909> drip<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.450> used<00:01:21.810> here<00:01:22.229> seven

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
medium for our drip so used here seven

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.330 
medium for our drip so used here seven
clicks<00:01:22.979> that's<00:01:23.369> what<00:01:23.700> most<00:01:24.000> people<00:01:24.360> recommend

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
clicks that's what most people recommend

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.090 
clicks that's what most people recommend
but<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.759> may<00:01:27.150> like<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.750> more<00:01:28.439> finer<00:01:28.680> or<00:01:28.799> you

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
but you may like it more finer or you

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.530 
but you may like it more finer or you
like<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.430> more<00:01:29.579> coarse<00:01:29.850> but<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.270> basically

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
like it more coarse but you basically

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.810 
like it more coarse but you basically
turn<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.590> I'll<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:31.950> quiet<00:01:31.979> as<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.400> turn<00:01:32.729> it

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
turn and I'll just be quiet as I turn it

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:43.960 
turn and I'll just be quiet as I turn it
and<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.210> hear<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> clicks

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.399 

and<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.360> can<00:01:45.510> see<00:01:45.630> over<00:01:45.720> here<00:01:45.840> there<00:01:46.170> is

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
and then you can see over here there is

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.190 
and then you can see over here there is
a<00:01:46.440> gap<00:01:48.710> focus<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.940> where<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.960> beans

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
a gap focus and this is where the beans

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.969 
a gap focus and this is where the beans
will<00:01:52.409> rub<00:01:52.619> up<00:01:52.800> against<00:01:53.159> on<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.619> ceramic<00:01:55.619> dot

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
will rub up against on the ceramic dot

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.800 
will rub up against on the ceramic dot
here<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.369> let<00:01:56.580> me<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:56.850> undo<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.479> all<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.690> way

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
here so let me just undo it all the way

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.630 
here so let me just undo it all the way
and<00:01:58.610> you<00:01:59.610> basically<00:01:59.910> can<00:02:00.660> see<00:02:00.840> how<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.470> looks

a<00:02:05.670> couple<00:02:06.180> months<00:02:06.300> it<00:02:06.540> comes<00:02:06.750> out<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.500> is

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
a couple months it comes out so this is

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.350 
a couple months it comes out so this is
the<00:02:08.420> nut<00:02:09.420> piece<00:02:10.280> see<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.670> ceramic<00:02:11.970> bar

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
the nut piece see this is a ceramic bar

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.190 
the nut piece see this is a ceramic bar
I<00:02:14.209> can<00:02:15.209> focus<00:02:15.390> on<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:15.780> yep

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
I can focus on it yep

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.870 
I can focus on it yep
see<00:02:16.530> out<00:02:16.680> here<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.070> this<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.520> other<00:02:17.640> piece

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880

see out here and this is the other piece
of<00:02:18.030> ceramic<00:02:18.480> bar<00:02:18.830> this<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:19.950> basically<00:02:20.220> how<00:02:20.310> you

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
of ceramic bar this is basically how you

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.680 
of ceramic bar this is basically how you
would<00:02:20.520> clean<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:22.590> pop<00:02:22.769> out<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.070> ring

guess what looks like down here so after

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.310 
guess what looks like down here so after
every<00:04:40.720> grind<00:04:40.960> you<00:04:41.140> might<00:04:41.290> want<00:04:41.530> to<00:04:41.560> clean<00:04:41.860> it

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.840 

so<00:04:54.550> because<00:04:54.940> this<00:04:55.150> is<00:04:55.210> stainless<00:04:55.660> steel<00:04:56.850> most

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
so because this is stainless steel most

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.620 
so because this is stainless steel most
sort<00:04:58.000> of<00:04:58.030> coffee<00:04:58.210> comes<00:04:58.480> out<00:04:58.630> it's<00:04:58.870> not<00:04:59.050> like
