00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:15.460
 origami heart 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.770
 for making we need 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:22.750
 square sheet of paper for this we take 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.750
 a4 sheet 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:48.620
 neatly bend the corner here to 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:51.310
 it was exactly the edge and draw the line now 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.800
 this part is cut off 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:59.530
 cut off this part we remove it to us 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.530
 no need to expand square 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.300
 fold the square in half 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:14.560
 exactly do the line expand 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.979
 fold the square in half vertically 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:40.040
 we make the line we expand now 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.420
 we bend the upper edge to the central 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.420
 horizontal line 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:02:00.270
 make lines sheet 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:10.530
 we turn over we bend the right corner 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:11.700
 along the center line go to them 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.600
 also 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:23.960
 we bend the left corner to the center line 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:32.330
 vertical iron eats 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:33.450
 turn over from this side bend 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:41.340
 edge 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:49.010
 to the center line here exactly should 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:50.490
 be doing a line on the left side also 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.440
 bend the edge 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.440
 to the center line 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:12.040
 make the line now lower corners 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:15.550
 we bend and form a line one corner 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.550
 second corner 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:37.490
 now we are raising this lower part 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:40.000
 top and fold in half here 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.000
 hold 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:52.600
 we fold him up here and 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:05.150
 Here, too, we make this line more convenient. 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.140
 arrange so now these here 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:15.680
 the corners are laid out so it will be more convenient 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:25.640
 visible and ironed 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:29.750
 from this side also iron now 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:39.980
 back so doing this corner 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:43.930
 wrapped in this pocket now 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.930
 these lower corners we bend 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.470
 form a line from this side and from this 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.470
 country 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:13.190
 now we fold these corners to line 1 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:29.150
 it turns out and 2 also we bend before 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.150
 places 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:45.310
 and now turn on the front 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:45.310
 side of the heart is ready hole here 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.470
 also something can be put
