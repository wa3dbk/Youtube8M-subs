00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
not as it appears that's a little too

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.930 
not as it appears that's a little too
close<00:00:37.850> for<00:00:37.880> my<00:00:38.270> liking<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:38.930> still<00:00:39.469> filming

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940

close for my liking and still filming
yeah<00:00:40.940> that's<00:00:41.270> very<00:00:41.360> very<00:00:41.840> close<00:00:42.170> from<00:00:42.410> I<00:00:42.530> like

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
yeah that's very very close from I like

yeah that's very very close from I like
it<00:00:42.950> is<00:00:43.040> that<00:00:43.250> they<00:00:44.149> seem<00:00:44.210> to<00:00:44.390> be<00:00:44.510> getting

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
it is that they seem to be getting

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.330 
it is that they seem to be getting
closer<00:00:45.050> all<00:00:45.200> the<00:00:45.350> time<00:00:45.500> as<00:00:45.950> they're<00:00:46.100> flying

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
closer all the time as they're flying

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
my liking look for the sake of the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.310 
my liking look for the sake of the
camera<00:00:52.310> will<00:00:53.180> keep<00:00:53.420> rolling<00:00:54.910> UFOs

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
interaction with them in real life that

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.280 
interaction with them in real life that
you<00:00:59.000> entirely<00:00:59.510> different<00:00:59.960> matters

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290

going<00:01:54.709> out<00:01:54.829> now<00:01:56.560> that's<00:01:57.560> looking<00:01:57.979> good

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
going out now that's looking good

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.899 
going out now that's looking good
with<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:00.840> up<00:02:02.000> there<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.479> slow<00:02:03.720> well<00:02:04.909> there

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
with the can up there is slow well there

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.510 
with the can up there is slow well there
are<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.270> nice<00:02:06.930> white<00:02:07.290> glowing<00:02:07.650> objects<00:02:08.220> and

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.820 

it<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.670> certainly<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.240> aircraft<00:02:13.250> your<00:02:14.250> resume

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
it is certainly on aircraft your resume

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.040 
it is certainly on aircraft your resume
but<00:02:16.830> one<00:02:17.070> wonders<00:02:17.280> what<00:02:17.910> they<00:02:18.120> are<00:02:18.270> using<00:02:18.600> to

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
but one wonders what they are using to

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.980 
but one wonders what they are using to
make<00:02:19.140> themselves<00:02:19.380> small<00:02:20.340> like<00:02:20.850> this<00:02:21.090> that's

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
make themselves small like this that's

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.110 
make themselves small like this that's
what<00:02:22.110> I'm<00:02:22.200> filming<00:02:22.650> could<00:02:22.860> be<00:02:23.010> actually<00:02:23.550> huge

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
what I'm filming could be actually huge

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.949 
what I'm filming could be actually huge
to<00:02:24.600> be<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.780> large<00:02:25.440> UFO<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.970> seems<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.540> be<00:02:27.570> using

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
to be a large UFO that seems to be using

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.000 
to be a large UFO that seems to be using
some<00:02:28.140> sort<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.760> morphing<00:02:29.760> device<00:02:30.140> or<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.770> could

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
some sort of morphing device or it could

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.229 
some sort of morphing device or it could
be<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.400> classified<00:02:33.380> drum<00:02:34.380> craft<00:02:34.760> if<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.970> were<00:02:36.090> to

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
be a classified drum craft if it were to

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.930 
be a classified drum craft if it were to
be<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.630> harsh<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.830> achieve<00:02:38.100> on<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.430> issue<00:02:38.550> I

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
be a harsh to achieve on the issue I

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.449 
be a harsh to achieve on the issue I
could<00:02:39.780> be<00:02:39.900> looking<00:02:40.019> at<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.380> silent<00:02:40.650> drawn<00:02:41.100> craft

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
could be looking at a silent drawn craft

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.630 
could be looking at a silent drawn craft
of<00:02:41.610> some<00:02:41.790> description<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.480> Air<00:02:42.660> Force
