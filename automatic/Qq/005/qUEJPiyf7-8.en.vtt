00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
definitely see myself having more

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.929 
definitely see myself having more
enjoyment<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.659> him<00:01:06.869> then<00:01:07.799> then<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.700> was<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
enjoyment on him then then what I was a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.570 
enjoyment on him then then what I was a
few<00:01:09.180> weeks<00:01:09.240> ago<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:09.869> that's<00:01:10.020> good<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.580> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
few weeks ago so that's good but the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.070 
few weeks ago so that's good but the
reason<00:01:11.760> why<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.119> videos<00:01:12.510> kind<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.810> stopped

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
reason why the videos kind of stopped

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.469 
reason why the videos kind of stopped
was<00:01:13.290> because<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:14.430> two<00:01:14.580> main<00:01:14.760> types<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.180> videos

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479
