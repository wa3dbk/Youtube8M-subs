the<00:02:21.900> grains<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.739> so<00:02:22.950> much<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.250> chocolate

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
the grains but not so much the chocolate

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.800 
the grains but not so much the chocolate
malt<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:25.940> only<00:02:26.940> put<00:02:27.120> 70<00:02:27.450> grams<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.780> chocolate

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
malt I only put 70 grams of chocolate

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.440 
malt I only put 70 grams of chocolate
malt<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.350> here<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.709> I'm<00:02:29.190> probably<00:02:30.030> going<00:02:30.360> to

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
malt in here so I'm probably going to

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.920 
malt in here so I'm probably going to
try<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:30.690> recipe<00:02:31.049> again<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.840> do<00:02:33.840> everything

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
try this recipe again and do everything

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.990 
try this recipe again and do everything
exactly<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.500> same<00:02:34.769> I<00:02:35.040> might<00:02:35.459> reduce<00:02:35.760> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
exactly the same I might reduce the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.060 
exactly the same I might reduce the
finishing<00:02:36.390> comps<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.720> little<00:02:36.930> bit<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.230> up<00:02:37.829> the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
finishing comps a little bit and up the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.880 
finishing comps a little bit and up the
chocolate<00:02:38.280> malt<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.790> bit<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:40.380> i<00:02:40.500> think<00:02:40.560> i'll

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
chocolate malt a bit and i think i'll

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.220 
chocolate malt a bit and i think i'll
probably<00:02:41.130> get<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.549> exactly<00:02:42.150> where<00:02:42.450> or<00:02:43.140> i

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
probably get this exactly where or i

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.539 
probably get this exactly where or i
would<00:02:43.560> want<00:02:43.799> it<00:02:43.920> but<00:02:44.010> this<00:02:44.130> is<00:02:44.280> actually

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
would want it but this is actually

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.580 
would want it but this is actually
really<00:02:44.820> good<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.329> can<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:46.019> can't<00:02:46.350> really

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
really good you can you can't really

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.770 
really good you can you can't really
taste<00:02:46.799> the<00:02:46.920> chocolate<00:02:47.160> malt<00:02:47.519> that<00:02:47.609> much<00:02:48.030> you

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
taste the chocolate malt that much you

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.750 
taste the chocolate malt that much you
can<00:02:48.930> tell<00:02:49.140> by<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.350> color<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.799> it<00:02:50.040> now<00:02:50.310> i<00:02:50.370> used

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
can tell by the color of it now i used

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.840 
can tell by the color of it now i used
as<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.480> saw<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.810> video<00:02:51.959> i<00:02:52.410> used<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.340> light

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
as you saw in the video i used a light

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.229 
as you saw in the video i used a light
multi<00:02:54.630> extract<00:02:55.079> liquid<00:02:55.200> malt<00:02:55.590> extract<00:02:56.239> and

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
multi extract liquid malt extract and

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.479 
multi extract liquid malt extract and
the<00:02:57.870> beer<00:02:58.079> has<00:02:58.290> come<00:02:58.500> out<00:02:58.650> sort<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.070> coppery

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
the beer has come out sort of a coppery

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.450 
the beer has come out sort of a coppery
color<00:02:59.579> so<00:03:00.390> definitely<00:03:00.630> the

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
color so definitely the

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.440 
color so definitely the
the<00:03:05.490> specialty<00:03:06.490> grains<00:03:06.700> have<00:03:07.090> definitely

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
the specialty grains have definitely

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.540 
the specialty grains have definitely
changed<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:08.320> color<00:03:08.560> of<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.860> beer<00:03:11.130> but<00:03:12.130> not<00:03:12.370> as

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
changed the color of the beer but not as

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.440 
changed the color of the beer but not as
much<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:13.800> flavor<00:03:14.800> of<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.010> beer<00:03:15.280> which<00:03:15.610> when

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
much the flavor of the beer which when

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.130 
much the flavor of the beer which when
you<00:03:16.540> saw<00:03:16.690> I<00:03:16.720> put<00:03:17.050> those<00:03:17.170> didn't<00:03:17.830> put<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:17.950> lot<00:03:18.160> of

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
you saw I put those didn't put a lot of

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.290 
you saw I put those didn't put a lot of
grain<00:03:20.140> in<00:03:20.170> there<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:20.830> I<00:03:21.100> will<00:03:21.640> definitely<00:03:21.850> try

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
grain in there so I will definitely try

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.620 
grain in there so I will definitely try
this<00:03:22.360> recipe<00:03:22.690> again<00:03:23.080> and<00:03:23.700> add<00:03:24.700> more<00:03:25.060> grains<00:03:25.330> to

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
this recipe again and add more grains to

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.150 
this recipe again and add more grains to
it<00:03:25.750> more<00:03:25.960> chocolate<00:03:26.440> maybe<00:03:26.650> some<00:03:26.950> more

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
it more chocolate maybe some more

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.400 
it more chocolate maybe some more
crystal<00:03:28.060> not<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.690> say<00:03:28.810> this<00:03:28.960> isn't<00:03:29.110> a<00:03:29.260> good

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
crystal not to say this isn't a good

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.940 
crystal not to say this isn't a good
beer<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.830> actually<00:03:30.250> pretty<00:03:30.460> damn<00:03:30.670> good<00:03:31.950> and

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
beer is actually pretty damn good and

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.400 
beer is actually pretty damn good and
it's<00:03:33.490> it's<00:03:33.960> definitely<00:03:34.960> a<00:03:34.990> drinkable

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
it's it's definitely a drinkable

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:43.040 
it's it's definitely a drinkable
sessionable<00:03:35.980> beer

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.820 

quite<00:03:43.740> bitter<00:03:43.950> actually

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.640 

and<00:03:49.280> a<00:03:49.760> little<00:03:50.000> under<00:03:50.240> carbonated<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:51.500> my

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
and a little under carbonated to my

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.350 
and a little under carbonated to my
tastes<00:03:52.130> but<00:03:52.280> that's<00:03:52.580> something<00:03:52.910> I<00:03:53.000> can<00:03:53.150> fix

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
tastes but that's something I can fix

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.850 
tastes but that's something I can fix
with<00:03:54.080> the<00:03:54.230> keg<00:03:54.520> so<00:03:55.520> yeah<00:03:56.510> it's<00:03:57.290> a<00:03:57.350> good<00:03:57.500> one<00:03:57.560> I

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
with the keg so yeah it's a good one I

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.530 
with the keg so yeah it's a good one I
like<00:03:58.130> it<00:03:58.310> I'll<00:03:58.490> do<00:03:58.730> this<00:03:58.850> one<00:03:58.910> again<00:03:59.120> I'll

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
like it I'll do this one again I'll

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.950 
like it I'll do this one again I'll
tweak<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.200> flavors<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.650> little<00:04:00.740> bit<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.960> their

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
tweak the flavors a little bit the their

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.710 
tweak the flavors a little bit the their
grains<00:04:03.290> a<00:04:03.470> bit<00:04:03.650> hops<00:04:04.280> will<00:04:05.180> do<00:04:05.300> another<00:04:05.450> batch

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
grains a bit hops will do another batch

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.600 
grains a bit hops will do another batch
I<00:04:06.170> don't<00:04:06.530> know<00:04:06.590> if<00:04:06.680> I'll<00:04:06.770> film<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:07.250> maybe

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
I don't know if I'll film that maybe

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.700 
I don't know if I'll film that maybe
just<00:04:07.970> a<00:04:08.120> little<00:04:08.270> bit<00:04:08.420> of<00:04:08.510> it<00:04:08.600> and<00:04:08.630> we'll<00:04:09.440> see

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
just a little bit of it and we'll see

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.670

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.530 
it's a nice glass for this type of beer
and<00:04:33.340> definitely<00:04:34.340> holding<00:04:35.060> out<00:04:35.180> a<00:04:35.210> little<00:04:35.390> bit

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
and definitely holding out a little bit

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.770 
and definitely holding out a little bit
on<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.720> head<00:04:35.930> I<00:04:36.170> have<00:04:36.680> noticed<00:04:37.100> that<00:04:37.750> when<00:04:38.750> i

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
on the head I have noticed that when i

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.540 
on the head I have noticed that when i
first<00:04:39.080> started<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.560> drink<00:04:39.800> it<00:04:39.980> a<00:04:40.010> few<00:04:40.340> days<00:04:40.400> ago

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
first started to drink it a few days ago

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.300 
first started to drink it a few days ago
in<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.780> keg<00:04:42.020> it<00:04:42.200> had<00:04:42.380> more<00:04:42.680> head<00:04:42.980> retention

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
in the keg it had more head retention

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.410 
in the keg it had more head retention
now<00:04:44.210> that<00:04:44.390> it's<00:04:44.510> gotten<00:04:44.780> a<00:04:44.810> little<00:04:44.930> lower<00:04:46.420> it's

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
now that it's gotten a little lower it's

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.000 
now that it's gotten a little lower it's
lost<00:04:47.630> some<00:04:47.870> of<00:04:47.900> its<00:04:48.080> carbonation<00:04:48.650> so<00:04:48.800> maybe

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
lost some of its carbonation so maybe

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.010 
lost some of its carbonation so maybe
something<00:04:49.370> I<00:04:49.550> need<00:04:49.700> to<00:04:49.820> fix<00:04:50.060> in<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.390> keg

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
something I need to fix in the keg

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.170 
something I need to fix in the keg
itself<00:04:51.500> give<00:04:52.070> it<00:04:52.160> a<00:04:52.220> little<00:04:52.340> boost<00:04:52.610> overnight

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
itself give it a little boost overnight

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.610 
itself give it a little boost overnight
just<00:04:53.390> to<00:04:53.510> give<00:04:53.690> it<00:04:53.720> some<00:04:53.900> more<00:04:53.930> carbonation

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
just to give it some more carbonation

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.130 
just to give it some more carbonation
but<00:04:54.800> it<00:04:55.130> certainly<00:04:55.340> is<00:04:55.669> equal<00:04:56.660> to<00:04:56.810> if<00:04:57.110> not

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
but it certainly is equal to if not

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.010 
but it certainly is equal to if not
better<00:04:57.470> than<00:04:57.680> some<00:04:58.010> of<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:58.430> craft<00:04:59.390> brews<00:04:59.750> that
