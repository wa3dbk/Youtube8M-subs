00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 yo everyone it was them I hope 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.009
 that you're fine because in any case 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.049
 me it's going this week he's wary the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.330
 theme it's food so we go so 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.950
 to talk about eating I do not know about you but 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.269
 me what I prefer when I 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.309
 am invited to people's homes when you 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.990
 restaurant is the dessert buffet 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.550
 I think there is no better end it is 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.310
 the base as the dessert buffet with 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.609
 with chocolate mousse cakes 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.170
 and pancakes the French pastry but I 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.119
 do not even know how one can not love 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.769
 and that's why today I have 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.269
 decided to make a little tutorial 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.579
 learn something super healthy 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.809
 is superb we celebrated the chocolate 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.809
 so let's go 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.079
 so what you need to do 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.120
 your chocolate bananas that's all 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.350
 first bananas and chocolate that 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.340
 seems logical but also toothpicks 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.930
 once you have all of that 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.789
 just peeled all your 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.530
 bananas and then you put them in 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.399
 a plate and wanted to cut in three 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.410
 equal parts 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.840
 once it's done you take two 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.729
 pots an average and a small of 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.090
 so that the little one can get into the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.680
 average 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.260
 once it's done you fill 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.939
 the big pot about three 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.189
 quarters with water you go next 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:19.979
 heat it on the gas and you 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.420
 wait until the water boils during this time 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.060
 there you cut out your chocolate squares 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.979
 in full of small pieces over it will be 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.979
 cut into smaller ones it will be 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.659
 once the water is hot you 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.270
 just have to dive the little one 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.960
 pot in the biggest and wait 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.369
 that chocolate do not hesitate between 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.590
 two to mix with a spoon 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.719
 because otherwise it will be a bit long and 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.549
 if you mix it will make the cast easier 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.200
 chocolate once it's done you 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.490
 let stand 2 3 minutes and in 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.560
 waiting you just have to plant 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.030
 toothpicks in bananas and that's 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.619
 which will allow you to hold the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.229
 banana without you full of chocolate 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:02.659
 everywhere and then you have to bring 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.520
 a tray and alu paper you go 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.709
 cover the paper tray with the us a 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.179
 not logical 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:10.310
 then you take your bananas and you 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.799
 you can smear them with chocolate 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.440
 put chocolate on top of it 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:21.620
 anywhere is more chocolate better 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:23.870
 it's then you drop your bananas 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.120
 on the plate and you can add some 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.650
 little nuggets of color or whatever 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.940
 you want me personally I like 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.650
 well the nuggets of color you 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.900
 continue to coat all your bananas 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.480
 and you can add little circles 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.709
 like that little colored balls 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.989
 still small colored balls 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.930
 you can also put for example 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.609

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.000
 put your bananas in the freezer and 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.389
 you wait a good fortnight 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.010
 minutes 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.139
 once it's done do you 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.730
 springs tea and chocolate will harden 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.500
 and the little nuggets will be hung 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.870

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.840
