packaging<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:27.240> these<00:02:27.540> great<00:02:27.930> now<00:02:28.020> on<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.410> the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
actual shadows itself and the quality

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.560 
actual shadows itself and the quality
there<00:02:31.230> are<00:02:31.410> some<00:02:32.040> duds<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.670> found<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.330> this

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
there are some duds I found that this

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.320 
there are some duds I found that this
one<00:02:33.840> all<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.740> shades<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.550> are<00:02:35.790> really

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
one all the shades in this are really

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.470 
one all the shades in this are really
nice<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.860> think<00:02:38.160> it's<00:02:38.400> because<00:02:38.850> none<00:02:39.450> of

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
nice and I think it's because none of

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.440 
nice and I think it's because none of
them<00:02:39.690> are<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:40.110> like<00:02:40.490> shimmery<00:02:41.490> pearly<00:02:42.090> type

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
them are that like shimmery pearly type

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.650 
them are that like shimmery pearly type
of<00:02:42.630> texture<00:02:43.430> they're<00:02:44.430> all<00:02:44.670> either<00:02:45.060> kind<00:02:45.450> of

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
of texture they're all either kind of

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.380 
of texture they're all either kind of
like<00:02:45.870> matte<00:02:46.290> or<00:02:46.560> semi<00:02:47.010> matte<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:48.150> taupe

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
like matte or semi matte and the taupe

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.120 
like matte or semi matte and the taupe
color<00:02:48.420> even<00:02:48.930> has<00:02:49.080> like<00:02:49.200> very<00:02:49.530> little<00:02:49.890> shimmer

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130

color even has like very little shimmer
to<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.370> even<00:02:50.730> though<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:50.880> one<00:02:51.270> has<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.600> most

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
to it even though that one has the most

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.660 
to it even though that one has the most
shimmer<00:02:52.080> in<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.380> one<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:53.270> this<00:02:54.270> one<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:56.430> two

shimmer in this one in this one the two
Purple's<00:02:57.209> are<00:02:57.390> probably<00:02:57.660> what<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.900> can

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
Purple's are probably what you can

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.740 
Purple's are probably what you can
mostly<00:02:58.350> see<00:02:58.560> on<00:02:58.860> my<00:02:59.010> eyes<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.640> I<00:03:00.120> was

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
mostly see on my eyes and I was

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.600 
mostly see on my eyes and I was
skeptical<00:03:01.320> about<00:03:01.410> this<00:03:01.770> purple<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.220> decided<00:03:02.520> to

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
skeptical about this purple I decided to

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.370 
skeptical about this purple I decided to
wear<00:03:02.730> today<00:03:02.880> just<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.270> test<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.660> out<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:04.050> was

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
wear today just to test it out I was

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.540 
wear today just to test it out I was
skeptical<00:03:04.860> about<00:03:04.890> how<00:03:05.100> bright<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.430> would

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
skeptical about how bright you would

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.160 
skeptical about how bright you would
turn<00:03:05.700> out<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.090> it's<00:03:06.180> not<00:03:06.390> like<00:03:06.600> extremely

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
turn out and it's not like extremely

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.780 
turn out and it's not like extremely
bright<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.440> wouldn't<00:03:07.800> say<00:03:07.920> it's<00:03:08.100> as<00:03:08.280> bright<00:03:08.580> as

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
bright I wouldn't say it's as bright as

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.850 
bright I wouldn't say it's as bright as
you<00:03:08.910> see<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.240> here<00:03:09.600> in<00:03:09.750> this<00:03:09.959> quad<00:03:10.200> but<00:03:10.740> it

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
you see it here in this quad but it

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.620 
you see it here in this quad but it
actually<00:03:11.010> has<00:03:11.370> pretty<00:03:11.550> decent<00:03:11.700> pigmentation

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
actually has pretty decent pigmentation

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.509 
actually has pretty decent pigmentation
I<00:03:12.720> was<00:03:12.870> surprised<00:03:13.260> but<00:03:13.860> then<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.070> was<00:03:14.160> like<00:03:14.250> okay

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
I was surprised but then I was like okay

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.340 
I was surprised but then I was like okay
there's<00:03:14.760> no<00:03:15.000> way<00:03:15.239> like<00:03:15.600> it's<00:03:15.810> going<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.170> last

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
there's no way like it's going to last

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.949 
there's no way like it's going to last
it's<00:03:16.650> probably<00:03:16.980> going<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.310> like<00:03:17.459> fade<00:03:17.670> off<00:03:17.959> the

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
it's probably going to like fade off the

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.150 
it's probably going to like fade off the
color<00:03:19.170> is<00:03:19.290> probably<00:03:19.470> going<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:19.800> turn<00:03:19.920> into

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
color is probably going to turn into

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.640 
color is probably going to turn into
some<00:03:20.459> yucky<00:03:20.850> muddy<00:03:21.090> color<00:03:21.390> like<00:03:22.080> after<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.440> few

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
some yucky muddy color like after a few

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.680 
some yucky muddy color like after a few
hours<00:03:22.950> but<00:03:23.250> it's<00:03:23.670> been<00:03:23.910> holding<00:03:24.360> up<00:03:24.480> really

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
hours but it's been holding up really

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.650 
hours but it's been holding up really
well<00:03:25.260> like<00:03:25.830> I'm<00:03:26.010> I'm<00:03:26.489> impressed<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.420> two

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
well like I'm I'm impressed the two

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.810 
well like I'm I'm impressed the two
colors<00:03:28.320> up<00:03:28.530> here<00:03:28.800> which<00:03:29.040> look<00:03:29.370> like<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.730> know

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
colors up here which look like you know

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.550 
colors up here which look like you know
they<00:03:29.940> have<00:03:29.970> more<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.239> that<00:03:30.330> pearly<00:03:30.870> finish<00:03:31.260> are

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
they have more of that pearly finish are

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.250 
they have more of that pearly finish are
really<00:03:32.280> really<00:03:32.670> sheer<00:03:32.940> like<00:03:33.269> I'll<00:03:33.750> swatch<00:03:34.050> it

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
really really sheer like I'll swatch it

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.370 
really really sheer like I'll swatch it
it<00:03:35.010> kind<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:35.400> just<00:03:35.610> looks<00:03:35.790> like<00:03:35.940> little

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
it kind of just looks like little

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.900 
it kind of just looks like little
glitter<00:03:37.380> particles<00:03:37.709> on<00:03:38.040> my<00:03:38.190> hand<00:03:38.459> it's<00:03:38.670> not<00:03:38.850> a

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
glitter particles on my hand it's not a

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.530 
glitter particles on my hand it's not a
nice<00:03:39.299> like<00:03:39.600> pigmented<00:03:40.290> buttery<00:03:40.709> type<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.580> um

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
nice like pigmented buttery type of um

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.210 
nice like pigmented buttery type of um
pigmentation<00:03:43.500> at<00:03:43.590> all<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:43.950> then<00:03:44.040> when<00:03:44.160> I

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
pigmentation at all and then when I

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.460 
pigmentation at all and then when I
swatch<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:44.850> just<00:03:45.120> looks<00:03:45.299> like<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.750> light

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
swatch it it just looks like a light

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.370 
swatch it it just looks like a light
dusting<00:03:46.739> of<00:03:47.100> like<00:03:47.310> shimmer<00:03:47.970> but<00:03:48.239> not<00:03:48.450> not<00:03:49.170> like

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
dusting of like shimmer but not not like

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.289 
dusting of like shimmer but not not like
a<00:03:49.440> nicely<00:03:50.070> finely<00:03:50.519> milled<00:03:50.730> shimmer<00:03:51.060> is<00:03:51.180> what

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
a nicely finely milled shimmer is what

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.840 
a nicely finely milled shimmer is what
I'm<00:03:51.390> trying<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.600> say<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.430> those<00:03:53.430> two<00:03:53.610> of<00:03:53.700> there

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
I'm trying to say so those two of there

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:54.320 
I'm trying to say so those two of there
are<00:03:53.940> duds

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
are duds

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.780 
are duds
the<00:03:54.840> Purple's<00:03:55.230> are<00:03:55.410> actually<00:03:55.709> not<00:03:55.920> bad<00:03:56.130> the

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
the Purple's are actually not bad the

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.729 
the Purple's are actually not bad the
deeper<00:03:57.480> one<00:03:57.630> I<00:03:57.780> applied<00:03:58.049> it<00:03:58.230> in<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.500> crease

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
deeper one I applied it in the crease

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.199 
deeper one I applied it in the crease
and<00:03:58.769> I<00:03:59.010> had<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.280> keep<00:03:59.459> building<00:03:59.700> it<00:03:59.880> up<00:04:00.030> the

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
and I had to keep building it up the

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.120 
and I had to keep building it up the
purple<00:04:00.450> I<00:04:00.840> also<00:04:01.019> had<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.410> keep<00:04:01.590> building<00:04:01.920> it<00:04:02.040> up

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
purple I also had to keep building it up

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.280 
purple I also had to keep building it up
because<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:03.030> feel<00:04:03.360> like<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.690> texture<00:04:04.110> of<00:04:04.140> these

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
because I feel like the texture of these

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.530 
because I feel like the texture of these
are<00:04:04.500> pretty<00:04:04.709> thin<00:04:05.250> because<00:04:05.850> it<00:04:06.000> was<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:06.269> thin

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
are pretty thin because it was so thin

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.240 
are pretty thin because it was so thin
once<00:04:06.750> again<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.380> was<00:04:07.470> skeptical<00:04:07.950> I<00:04:08.040> thought

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
once again I was skeptical I thought

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.580 
once again I was skeptical I thought
okay<00:04:08.519> since<00:04:08.730> it's<00:04:08.910> so<00:04:09.150> like<00:04:09.450> thin<00:04:10.170> it's

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
okay since it's so like thin it's

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.680 
okay since it's so like thin it's
probably<00:04:11.130> going<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.459> crease<00:04:11.730> really<00:04:12.299> quickly

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
probably going to crease really quickly

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.920 
probably going to crease really quickly
now<00:04:12.900> these<00:04:13.440> claim<00:04:13.860> to<00:04:14.250> last<00:04:14.489> 16<00:04:15.060> hours<00:04:15.330> I

on my eyes right now has been about six
hours<00:04:25.340> or<00:04:25.730> so<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.120> they<00:04:26.690> have<00:04:26.870> not<00:04:27.050> creased<00:04:27.530> of

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
hours or so and they have not creased of

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.610 
hours or so and they have not creased of
course<00:04:28.550> I<00:04:28.760> did<00:04:29.000> prime<00:04:29.240> eyelids<00:04:29.600> using<00:04:29.960> my

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
course I did prime eyelids using my

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.060 
course I did prime eyelids using my
Urban<00:04:30.890> Decay<00:04:31.780> as<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:32.930> grabbed<00:04:33.200> it<00:04:33.230> my<00:04:33.770> Urban

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
Urban Decay as I grabbed it my Urban

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.710 
Urban Decay as I grabbed it my Urban
Decay<00:04:34.100> primer<00:04:34.430> potion<00:04:34.610> I<00:04:35.000> always<00:04:35.480> prime

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
Decay primer potion I always prime

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.120 
Decay primer potion I always prime
eyelids<00:04:36.080> it<00:04:36.260> just<00:04:36.410> doesn't<00:04:36.680> make<00:04:36.740> sense<00:04:36.800> for

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
eyelids it just doesn't make sense for

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.490 
eyelids it just doesn't make sense for
me<00:04:37.190> not<00:04:37.430> to<00:04:37.490> because<00:04:37.910> I<00:04:38.000> have<00:04:38.090> oily<00:04:38.270> skin<00:04:38.450> and<00:04:38.960> I

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
me not to because I have oily skin and I

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.800 
me not to because I have oily skin and I
have<00:04:39.590> oily<00:04:39.950> lids<00:04:40.130> so<00:04:40.520> if<00:04:40.880> I<00:04:41.030> don't<00:04:41.300> like

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
have oily lids so if I don't like

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.660 
have oily lids so if I don't like
nothing<00:04:42.020> is<00:04:42.260> going<00:04:42.440> to<00:04:42.530> wear<00:04:42.800> well<00:04:43.010> on<00:04:43.280> me<00:04:43.490> for

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
nothing is going to wear well on me for

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.760 
nothing is going to wear well on me for
a<00:04:43.730> very<00:04:43.910> long<00:04:44.090> time<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:44.810> I<00:04:44.840> did<00:04:45.260> prime<00:04:45.440> eyelids

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
a very long time so I did prime eyelids

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.580 
a very long time so I did prime eyelids
but<00:04:46.070> even<00:04:46.760> then<00:04:47.000> you<00:04:47.300> know<00:04:47.390> I<00:04:47.750> have<00:04:48.050> worn<00:04:48.410> other

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
but even then you know I have worn other

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.950 
but even then you know I have worn other
shadows<00:04:49.070> and<00:04:49.310> prime<00:04:50.000> my<00:04:50.150> lids<00:04:50.360> where<00:04:50.690> the

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
shadows and prime my lids where the

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.930 
shadows and prime my lids where the
shadows<00:04:51.290> would<00:04:51.470> crease<00:04:51.740> really<00:04:52.130> quickly<00:04:52.700> and

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
shadows would crease really quickly and

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.880 
shadows would crease really quickly and
usually<00:04:53.570> those<00:04:54.080> are<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.350> shadows<00:04:54.620> that<00:04:54.740> have

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
usually those are the shadows that have

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.360 
usually those are the shadows that have
like<00:04:55.070> that<00:04:55.220> thin<00:04:55.580> texture<00:04:56.120> it's<00:04:56.630> not<00:04:57.370> rich

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
like that thin texture it's not rich

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.130 
like that thin texture it's not rich
enough<00:04:58.400> maybe<00:04:58.970> I<00:04:59.270> don't<00:04:59.540> know<00:04:59.630> and<00:04:59.930> you<00:05:00.020> know

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
enough maybe I don't know and you know

last<00:05:06.860> very<00:05:07.010> long<00:05:07.280> -<00:05:07.520> but<00:05:08.210> these<00:05:08.510> are<00:05:08.570> I'm

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
last very long - but these are I'm

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.230 
last very long - but these are I'm
actually<00:05:09.680> really<00:05:10.040> I<00:05:10.310> really<00:05:10.520> am<00:05:10.760> impressed

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
actually really I really am impressed

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.180 
actually really I really am impressed
they<00:05:11.420> don't<00:05:11.660> crease<00:05:11.960> very<00:05:12.110> quickly<00:05:12.440> at<00:05:12.860> all<00:05:13.160> I

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
they don't crease very quickly at all I

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.580 
they don't crease very quickly at all I
haven't<00:05:13.870> experienced<00:05:14.870> any<00:05:15.050> creasing<00:05:15.470> with

them just yet so I really think they

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.600 
them just yet so I really think they

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
would last like a full workday full

would last like a full workday full
