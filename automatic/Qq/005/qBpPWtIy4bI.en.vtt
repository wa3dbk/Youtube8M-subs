 a lot of satisfaction 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.889
 and pulling he threw himself into the void from the highest mountain of all 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.739
 after ten years of suffering 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.439
 ten years of endless nightmare 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.439
 although he has a match - 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.739
 it was his exit pointed 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.020
 although it was not always like that 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.850
 Gratos was once a champion of the days 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.050
 murdered as animals the victims who did before 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.870
 reminding him of his own past 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.870
 a past that would never escape 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.400
 his only consolation was the most 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.700
 do not rest without rest from one port to another in the service of the gods of 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.650
 Olympus 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.650
 in which he put all his spheres 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.030
 good tax how much did you average 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.640
 shortly before women visited her injury 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.830
 do not put stones and make forget the horrors that reflected sun 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.420
 is missing 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.690
 ten years to first 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.690
 of serving the gods slightly for ten years 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.600
 when I was released from these nightmares 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.649
 you have to make a last one it would be for us data 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.529
 the biggest of the challenges that await 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:13.019
 in aces 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.019
 city ​​that right now does have siblings 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.409
 while we talk 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.029
 Athens is on the verge of destruction 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:24.029
 it's artistic will and such a great city 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.849
 We want to politicize the gods that fight each other 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.509
 for that reason you have to be you kratos 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:35.569
 only a mortal trained by a god has any chance of defeating 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.059
 hades 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:39.159
 if I can do what you ask me 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.309
 kill a god 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:43.189
 the visions 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.069
 they will end all 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.849
 complete this last task and if you forgive that past that consumes you 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:51.979
 have faith extracts 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.979
 the gods never forget those who help them 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.589
 after the rotten each time of the internal 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:02.449
 Kratos set course once 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:08.349
 your biggest challenge and the freedom of your growing madness awaits you ancient ding 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.349
 city ​​and east 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:18.499
 and with that act 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:22.779
 14 the events that would lead to the petition were chained 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.799
 he simply said his own had 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.049
 Perez, you're late, maybe too late to save Athens 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.189
 who is sunk to save athens truth 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.610
 we should not have oracle control looked at in its alignment one of the 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.679
 clubs 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:47.699
 Spartan army captain in the past 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.749
 chub started his command with only 50 soldiers 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:54.559
 but soon design extended to me 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.269
 his tactics were tests 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.849
 but effective 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.749
 gentry has given power was feared by all except one person 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:11.779
 his wife was the only one with the courage to face his fury when you have 

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:12.919
 pretty kratos 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.609

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.069
 not for being 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:26.059
 his desires for conquest did not know and 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:27.889
 but what I craved 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.889

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.129
 Pandora's box 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.169
 that is beyond the walls of Athens 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.300
 composed of the gods in the desert to the east 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.689
 a careful dishes 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:11.879
 many have left in search of Pandora's box 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.879
 but none has returned 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.409
 efe 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:20.610
 Kratos

 many things are possible 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.099
 that's why it's so well hidden 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:50.099
 away in the desert of lost souls 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:55.169
