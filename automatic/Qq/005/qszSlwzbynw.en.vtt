00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.789
 Why

 huge casting i'm swinging 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.259
 brown so they are not too many others 

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:11.269
 I do not understand why it's all weir who prevail on the throne 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.799
 maybe because that's what can not be for nothing 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:20.590
