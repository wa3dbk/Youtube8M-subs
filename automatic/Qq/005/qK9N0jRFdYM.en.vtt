00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.900
 correct a problem that is generating 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.150
 the monarch hotel 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.300
 fiber optic that is installing 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.210
 telmex 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.760
 the problem that presents us is losses 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.610
 of signal 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.369
 a browser I do not know how it connects 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.620
 within walking distance of the antenna 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.760
 wireless 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.500
 let's start 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.770
 first thing we're going to do is enter the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.829
 with modem configuration only 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.390
 introducing the 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.730
 ip number 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.510
 192 points 160 and 8.1 points 54 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.510
 we give enter 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.150
 they present it to us 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.940
 this access we are going to put you in mind 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.630
 with a capital 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.729
 and in the access code it would be him 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.770
 European that comes in the back 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.710
 of your mobile 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.799
 respecting the type d 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.090
 of caps if they are uppercase with a new 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.869
 capital 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.869
 we are going to process 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.300
 to 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.350
 network option 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.350
 then to modify 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.400
 let's change these parameters that 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.300
 would be 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.300
 effect d 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.979
 the wifi filter 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.009
 sea direction that we are going to put 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.009
 not 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:57.480
 as not down 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.210
 we change the web encryption 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.820
 for this 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.020
 window we will accept 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.659
 that is not saying that it's going to 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.490
 disable the group do 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.380
 lopez is ok 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.730
 we leave as is 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.250
 in 16 bits 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.400
 the web key stays the same let's go to 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.400
 save 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.900
 By doing this, we are going to lose here 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.900
 our connection 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.870
 I want to put a cross or a card there 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.240
 it tells us that 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.000
 it is not this 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.540
 the correct configuration we are going to give 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.540
 where says 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.040
 with the right button on the connection you 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.040
 we give in properties 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.540
 and we will give click tells me show 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.540
 characters 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.900
 we copy this key 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.900
 that our key to 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:25.870
 wifi copy we change the system 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.190
 open we leave the web 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.190
 we stick the key 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.690
 we accept 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.100
 already connects and if they are fixed it already says that 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.210
 is a 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.210
 radio type 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.590
 radio type 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.590
 802.11 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:07.110
 already with this we will have better reach 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.660
 and we are going to finish with the disconnections 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.850
 that if you have any doubt leave in the 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.300
 bottom part make this video favorite 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.990
 Give it a thumbs up if there will be more videos 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.990
 Thank you
