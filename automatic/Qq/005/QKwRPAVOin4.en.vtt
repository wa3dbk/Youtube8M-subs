almost everyone else on the tour we know
that<00:00:16.379> ranch<00:00:16.590> has<00:00:16.890> one<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.220> biggest<00:00:17.369> serves

on the tour but there's one specific

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.830 
on the tour but there's one specific
reason<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.160> me<00:00:20.369> besides<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.180> other<00:00:21.300> normal

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
reason to me besides the other normal

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.840 
reason to me besides the other normal
factors<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.800> his<00:00:22.949> serve<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:23.519> big<00:00:23.730> and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
factors that his serve is so big and

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.189 
factors that his serve is so big and
we're<00:00:23.939> going<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.090> talk<00:00:24.300> about<00:00:24.330> his<00:00:24.689> elastic

arm in a second so rain is comes from

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.640 
arm in a second so rain is comes from
the<00:00:27.240> ready<00:00:27.420> position<00:00:27.570> like<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.170> he<00:00:28.410> has<00:00:28.500> an

racquet up in this position again these
are<00:00:34.020> just<00:00:34.170> things<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.590> are<00:00:34.829> not<00:00:34.980> really

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
are just things that are not really

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.889 
are just things that are not really
biomechanically<00:00:36.059> important<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.660> little

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
biomechanically important just little

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.630 
biomechanically important just little
nuances<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.440> he<00:00:37.680> does<00:00:37.860> but<00:00:38.280> from<00:00:38.489> this

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
nuances that he does but from this

nuances that he does but from this
position<00:00:38.850> here<00:00:39.660> things<00:00:40.230> start<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> change

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
position here things start to change

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.139 
position here things start to change
when<00:00:40.980> he<00:00:41.070> comes<00:00:41.280> into<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.550> load<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:41.940> he<00:00:42.030> goes

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
when he comes into the load so he goes

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.819 
when he comes into the load so he goes
in<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.390> loaded<00:00:42.690> position<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.559> looks

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
in the loaded position this looks

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.619 
in the loaded position this looks
traditionally<00:00:44.430> like<00:00:44.610> everyone<00:00:45.000> else<00:00:45.180> but

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
traditionally like everyone else but

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.270 
traditionally like everyone else but
things<00:00:45.930> change<00:00:46.289> when<00:00:46.410> he<00:00:46.530> goes<00:00:46.649> into<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> drop

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
things change when he goes into the drop

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.729 
things change when he goes into the drop
and<00:00:47.610> into<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.059> position<00:00:48.300> now<00:00:48.780> most<00:00:49.469> top

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and into this position now most top

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.740

servers<00:00:50.219> usually<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.910> racket<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.449> line

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
servers usually have the racket in line

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.450 
servers usually have the racket in line
or<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.170> right<00:00:52.469> side<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.829> their<00:00:52.949> back<00:00:53.190> like

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
or on the right side of their back like

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.520 
or on the right side of their back like
this<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:54.480> rain<00:00:54.690> itch<00:00:54.840> gets<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> racket

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
this but rain itch gets the racket

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.010 
this but rain itch gets the racket
instead<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.070> position<00:00:56.870> comes<00:00:57.870> from

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
instead of in this position comes from

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.529 
instead of in this position comes from
the<00:00:58.109> load<00:00:58.320> he<00:00:59.070> drops<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.030> racket<00:01:00.390> will

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
the load he drops and the racket will

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.439 
the load he drops and the racket will
flare<00:01:00.870> out<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> right<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:02.070> he<00:01:02.820> comes<00:01:03.120> into

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
flare out to the right as he comes into

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.149 
flare out to the right as he comes into
this<00:01:03.539> position<00:01:03.809> here<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.530> as<00:01:04.589> he<00:01:04.680> comes<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:04.979> to

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
this position here and as he comes up to

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:05.780 
this position here and as he comes up to
extend

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
extend

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.850 
extend
so<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.330> position<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.840> extremely<00:01:07.020> important

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
so that position is extremely important

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.070 
so that position is extremely important
it<00:01:08.340> provides<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.760> lot<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.000> elasticity<00:01:09.450> and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
it provides a lot of elasticity and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.539 
it provides a lot of elasticity and
gives<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.350> more<00:01:10.380> racket<00:01:10.920> head<00:01:11.070> speed<00:01:11.369> with

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
gives you more racket head speed with

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.620 
gives you more racket head speed with
your<00:01:11.700> arm<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.030> I'm<00:01:12.119> going<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.299> show<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.479> that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
your arm so I'm going to show you that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.810 
your arm so I'm going to show you that
one<00:01:12.780> more<00:01:12.900> time

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
one more time

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.670 
one more time
from<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:14.939> position<00:01:15.180> comes<00:01:16.110> back<00:01:16.320> into<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
from this position comes back into the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.890 
from this position comes back into the
load<00:01:16.890> from<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> loaded<00:01:17.939> position<00:01:18.119> he<00:01:18.540> drops

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
load from the loaded position he drops

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.870 
load from the loaded position he drops
the<00:01:19.470> racket<00:01:19.799> will<00:01:19.920> flare<00:01:20.189> out<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> right

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the racket will flare out to the right

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.210 
the racket will flare out to the right
side<00:01:21.180> creating<00:01:21.659> an<00:01:21.750> extra<00:01:22.140> stretch<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.770> then

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
side creating an extra stretch and then

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.679 
side creating an extra stretch and then
he<00:01:23.310> comes<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:23.939> he<00:01:24.030> comes<00:01:24.299> through<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.630> he

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
he comes up and he comes through and he

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.719 
he comes up and he comes through and he
snaps<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.290> his<00:01:25.409> serve<00:01:25.680> we're<00:01:26.400> gonna<00:01:26.490> look<00:01:26.610> at

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
snaps on his serve we're gonna look at

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.429 
snaps on his serve we're gonna look at
some<00:01:26.850> slow-motion<00:01:27.450> video<00:01:27.720> now<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:27.990> rain<00:01:28.320> each

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
some slow-motion video now of rain each

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.260 
some slow-motion video now of rain each
with<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.950> without<00:01:29.189> his<00:01:29.310> racket<00:01:29.729> we're<00:01:30.119> also

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
with and without his racket we're also

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.819 
with and without his racket we're also
going<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.479> compare<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.020> Roger<00:01:31.350> Federer

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
going to compare that to Roger Federer

and you're gonna see the difference

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.350 
and you're gonna see the difference
between<00:01:33.270> those<00:01:33.659> two<00:01:33.720> drop<00:01:34.140> positions<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:35.360> our

going to notice is that again the hand
path<00:02:19.910> is<00:02:20.120> very<00:02:20.150> simple<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:21.320> blue<00:02:21.590> line<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:21.950> a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
path is very simple that blue line is a

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.130 
path is very simple that blue line is a
very<00:02:22.250> simple<00:02:22.610> path<00:02:22.820> to<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.120> ball<00:02:23.330> but<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.870> tip

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
very simple path to the ball but the tip

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.420 
very simple path to the ball but the tip
of<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.320> racket<00:02:24.440> for<00:02:24.770> Ronix<00:02:25.190> will<00:02:25.340> be

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
of the racket for Ronix will be

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.460 
of the racket for Ronix will be
considerably<00:02:26.030> bigger<00:02:26.330> in<00:02:26.660> terms<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:27.050> its<00:02:27.200> size

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
considerably bigger in terms of its size

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.530 
considerably bigger in terms of its size
that<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.370> will<00:02:28.520> profes<00:02:28.940> Derby<00:02:29.240> cuz<00:02:29.390> of<00:02:29.510> that

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
that it will profes Derby cuz of that

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.030 
that it will profes Derby cuz of that
move<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:30.080> happens<00:02:30.410> at<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.620> end<00:02:30.770> of<00:02:30.890> his

move that happens at the end of his

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.210 
move that happens at the end of his
service<00:02:31.250> motion<00:02:31.790> in<00:02:32.740> this<00:02:33.740> last<00:02:34.010> section

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
service motion in this last section

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.110 
service motion in this last section
we're<00:02:34.430> gonna<00:02:34.490> do<00:02:34.610> some<00:02:34.760> technique

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
we're gonna do some technique

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.910 
we're gonna do some technique
comparisons<00:02:35.720> we've<00:02:35.870> got<00:02:35.990> R<00:02:36.020> on<00:02:36.230> H<00:02:36.440> on<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.680> left

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
comparisons we've got R on H on the left

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.230 
comparisons we've got R on H on the left
and<00:02:37.100> fatter<00:02:37.310> than<00:02:37.490> right<00:02:37.700> we're<00:02:37.910> gonna<00:02:38.030> use

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
and fatter than right we're gonna use

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.730 
and fatter than right we're gonna use
the<00:02:38.420> racket<00:02:38.960> to<00:02:39.050> show<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.410> difference

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
the racket to show the difference

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.170 
the racket to show the difference
because<00:02:39.830> it's<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.100> little<00:02:40.280> easier<00:02:40.520> to<00:02:40.760> see<00:02:40.880> with

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
because it's a little easier to see with

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.730 
because it's a little easier to see with
the<00:02:41.300> racket<00:02:41.660> versus<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:42.140> wrist<00:02:42.380> here<00:02:42.560> in<00:02:42.650> the

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
the racket versus the wrist here in the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.470 
the racket versus the wrist here in the
hand<00:02:42.950> position<00:02:43.370> but<00:02:43.580> what<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.090> want<00:02:44.330> you<00:02:44.390> to

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
hand position but what I want you to

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.420 
hand position but what I want you to
look<00:02:44.720> at<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.170> massive<00:02:45.650> difference<00:02:46.070> in<00:02:46.280> the

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
look at is the massive difference in the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.090 
look at is the massive difference in the
drop<00:02:46.730> between<00:02:47.600> where<00:02:47.780> Ron<00:02:48.050> H's<00:02:48.410> racket<00:02:48.800> comes

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
drop between where Ron H's racket comes

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.830 
drop between where Ron H's racket comes
from<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:49.640> where<00:02:49.760> Federer's<00:02:50.240> racket<00:02:50.600> comes

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
from and where Federer's racket comes

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.960 
from and where Federer's racket comes
from<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.620> easy<00:02:51.800> argument<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.610> make<00:02:52.790> would<00:02:52.940> be

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
from the easy argument to make would be

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.670 
from the easy argument to make would be
that<00:02:53.210> Federer<00:02:53.480> is<00:02:53.570> hitting<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.870> slice<00:02:54.200> serve<00:02:54.470> up

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
that Federer is hitting a slice serve up

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.280 
that Federer is hitting a slice serve up
the<00:02:54.800> T<00:02:54.980> from<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.400> ad<00:02:55.520> side<00:02:55.880> which<00:02:56.540> is<00:02:56.720> true<00:02:57.080> but

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
the T from the ad side which is true but

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.200 
the T from the ad side which is true but
that<00:02:57.350> will<00:02:57.620> not<00:02:57.770> change<00:02:57.800> that<00:02:58.430> drop<00:02:58.760> position

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
that will not change that drop position

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.610 
that will not change that drop position
that<00:02:59.330> you<00:02:59.420> see<00:02:59.630> with<00:02:59.780> both<00:02:59.930> players<00:03:00.200> here<00:03:00.440> if<00:03:00.530> I

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
that you see with both players here if I

the way around inches racket comes up to

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
it's going to have to violently snap

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.950 
it's going to have to violently snap
forward<00:03:07.520> to<00:03:07.790> create<00:03:08.120> that<00:03:08.270> racket<00:03:08.510> at<00:03:08.720> speed

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960

next so now we have Ronnie up there with
Andy<00:03:20.390> Murray<00:03:20.570> and<00:03:20.630> when<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:20.840> see<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:20.960> couple<00:03:21.200> of

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
Andy Murray and when you see a couple of

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.930 
Andy Murray and when you see a couple of
really<00:03:21.530> good<00:03:21.710> things<00:03:21.770> just<00:03:22.190> off<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.610> bat<00:03:22.760> for

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
really good things just off the bat for

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.480 
really good things just off the bat for
the<00:03:23.060> comparison<00:03:23.810> one<00:03:24.470> Murray's<00:03:25.010> serving<00:03:25.370> off

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
the comparison one Murray's serving off

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.280 
the comparison one Murray's serving off
the<00:03:25.640> deuce<00:03:25.880> side<00:03:26.120> and<00:03:26.420> -<00:03:26.930> they're<00:03:27.140> both

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
the deuce side and - they're both

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.050 
the deuce side and - they're both
hitting<00:03:27.560> flat<00:03:27.890> serves<00:03:28.160> up<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.490> T<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:28.940> the

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
hitting flat serves up the T so the

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.730 
hitting flat serves up the T so the
placements<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.630> same<00:03:29.840> but<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.560> difference

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
placements the same but the difference

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.980 
placements the same but the difference
really<00:03:31.220> again<00:03:31.610> is<00:03:31.850> in<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.480> drop<00:03:32.810> position

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
really again is in that drop position

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.050 
really again is in that drop position
that<00:03:33.410> we<00:03:33.530> see<00:03:33.710> with<00:03:33.830> Roenick<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.640> position

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
that we see with Roenick the position

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.730 
that we see with Roenick the position
that<00:03:35.150> he<00:03:35.330> achieves<00:03:35.690> before<00:03:36.110> he<00:03:36.170> goes<00:03:36.350> up<00:03:36.620> to

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
that he achieves before he goes up to

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.990 
that he achieves before he goes up to
the<00:03:36.860> contact<00:03:37.340> point<00:03:37.580> you<00:03:37.730> can<00:03:37.850> see<00:03:37.970> that

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
the contact point you can see that

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.760 
the contact point you can see that
rackets<00:03:38.510> really<00:03:38.750> flared<00:03:39.110> out<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.530> right

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
rackets really flared out to the right

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.920 
rackets really flared out to the right
Murray's<00:03:40.490> in<00:03:40.640> a<00:03:40.700> more<00:03:40.880> traditional<00:03:41.120> position

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
Murray's in a more traditional position

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.420 
Murray's in a more traditional position
not<00:03:42.110> getting<00:03:42.380> that<00:03:42.500> same<00:03:42.770> amount<00:03:43.040> of<00:03:43.100> stretch

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
not getting that same amount of stretch

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.070 
not getting that same amount of stretch
and<00:03:43.700> Ron<00:03:44.210> H<00:03:44.330> is<00:03:44.450> gonna<00:03:44.630> have<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:44.870> really

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
and Ron H is gonna have to really

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.170 
and Ron H is gonna have to really
accelerate<00:03:45.500> here<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.430> get<00:03:46.580> that<00:03:46.700> racket<00:03:47.090> head

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
accelerate here to get that racket head

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.780 
accelerate here to get that racket head
speed<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.660> snap<00:03:48.020> up<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.560> ball<00:03:48.740> in<00:03:49.700> the

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
speed and snap up to the ball in the

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.010 
speed and snap up to the ball in the
last<00:03:49.910> few<00:03:50.210> sections<00:03:50.450> we're<00:03:50.690> going<00:03:50.810> to<00:03:50.870> show

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
last few sections we're going to show

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.930 
last few sections we're going to show
Dmitri<00:03:51.530> off<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:51.770> then<00:03:51.860> a<00:03:51.890> few<00:03:52.130> other<00:03:52.190> bonuses

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
video play through we're going to see

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.620 
video play through we're going to see
that<00:03:58.280> same<00:03:58.340> drop<00:03:58.940> position<00:03:59.150> in<00:03:59.540> the

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
that same drop position in the

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.300 
that same drop position in the
difference<00:03:59.990> between<00:04:00.320> our<00:04:00.470> two<00:04:00.680> servers<00:04:01.160> and

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
difference between our two servers and

difference between our two servers and
Dimitrov<00:04:02.060> gets<00:04:02.240> plenty<00:04:02.420> of<00:04:02.540> mph<00:04:02.900> on<00:04:03.170> his<00:04:03.290> serve

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
Dimitrov gets plenty of mph on his serve

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.410

flexibility and snap into that serve for

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.490 
flexibility and snap into that serve for
a<00:04:10.580> better<00:04:10.850> delivery<00:04:11.120> we<00:04:12.050> can<00:04:12.080> see<00:04:12.320> both

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
a better delivery we can see both

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.650 
a better delivery we can see both
servers<00:04:12.950> going<00:04:13.280> up<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.520> tee<00:04:13.730> and<00:04:14.000> again<00:04:14.480> both

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
servers going up the tee and again both

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.530 
servers going up the tee and again both
servers<00:04:15.080> off<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.530> deuce<00:04:15.710> side<00:04:16.150> in<00:04:17.150> this<00:04:17.330> last

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
servers off the deuce side in this last

servers off the deuce side in this last
video<00:04:17.780> we<00:04:17.989> have<00:04:18.200> Melo<00:04:18.620> ceramic<00:04:19.130> side-by-side

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
video we have Melo ceramic side-by-side

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.849 
video we have Melo ceramic side-by-side
with<00:04:20.210> himself<00:04:20.390> with<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.080> without<00:04:21.169> the<00:04:21.500> racket

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
with himself with and without the racket

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.170 
with himself with and without the racket
so<00:04:21.950> you<00:04:22.010> can<00:04:22.130> really<00:04:22.280> get<00:04:22.460> a<00:04:22.520> feel<00:04:22.820> for<00:04:22.850> the

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
so you can really get a feel for the

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.580 
so you can really get a feel for the
motion

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
motion
