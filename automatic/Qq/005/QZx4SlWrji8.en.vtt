getting better if you ask me now when

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.470 
getting better if you ask me now when

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
you buy when you buy the first set

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.720 
you buy when you buy the first set
instead<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.960> giving<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.559> $15<00:00:14.130> keywords<00:00:14.580> it

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
instead of giving you to $15 keywords it

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.320 
instead of giving you to $15 keywords it
gives<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:14.969> three<00:00:16.100> so<00:00:17.100> making<00:00:17.400> them<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.940> huge

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
gives you three so making them a huge

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.599 
gives you three so making them a huge
huge<00:00:18.630> huge<00:00:18.869> money<00:00:19.140> maker<00:00:19.199> /<00:00:19.740> set<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.160> back<00:00:20.310> but

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
huge huge money maker / set you back but

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.210 
huge huge money maker / set you back but
I<00:00:20.910> notice<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:22.230> gives<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.650> three<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.100> then

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
I notice it gives you the three but then

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.320 
I notice it gives you the three but then
when<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.400> try<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.609> do<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.880> again<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.240> only

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
when you try to do it again it only

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.509 
when you try to do it again it only
gives<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.660> one<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.560> says<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.920> reach<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
gives you one and it says you reach the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.040 
gives you one and it says you reach the
max<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:26.849> I'm<00:00:26.939> guessing<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.359> cause<00:00:27.539> they<00:00:27.840> call

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
max so I'm guessing it cause they call

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.330 
max so I'm guessing it cause they call
themselves<00:00:28.230> fixing<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.920> but<00:00:28.949> what<00:00:29.189> they're

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
themselves fixing it but what they're

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.460 
themselves fixing it but what they're
doing<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.699> giving<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.029> fifteen<00:00:30.390> dollars<00:00:30.720> for

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
doing is giving you fifteen dollars for

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.639 
doing is giving you fifteen dollars for
each<00:00:31.590> pair<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.460> back<00:00:32.669> instead<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.649> each

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
each pair that you back instead of each

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.190 
each pair that you back instead of each
