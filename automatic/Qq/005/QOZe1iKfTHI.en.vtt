00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
started the transition would have been

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.070 
started the transition would have been
in<00:01:22.100> when<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.130> say<00:01:23.340> 98<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.900> just

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
in when I say 98 and then it just

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.749 
in when I say 98 and then it just
progressed<00:01:25.470> where<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.740> was<00:01:26.100> carrying<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.549> more

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
progressed where I was carrying on more

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
you know and and I was lucky because it

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.810 
you know and and I was lucky because it
was<00:01:37.829> something<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.310> cared<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.670> lot<00:01:38.759> about

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
was something that I cared a lot about

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.929 
was something that I cared a lot about
so<00:01:39.360> he<00:01:39.479> was<00:01:39.600> easier<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.049> me<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.759> don't<00:01:41.759> really

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
so he was easier for me I don't really

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.639
