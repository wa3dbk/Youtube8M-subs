00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.180 
hardest part was probably being away
from<00:04:02.760> home<00:04:03.140> and<00:04:04.140> not<00:04:04.470> really<00:04:04.770> being<00:04:04.980> able<00:04:05.040> to

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
from home and not really being able to

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.280 
from home and not really being able to
talk<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.460> my<00:04:05.730> family<00:04:05.970> because<00:04:06.750> we<00:04:07.080> get<00:04:07.200> to

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
talk to my family because we get to

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.200 
talk to my family because we get to
write<00:04:07.470> letters<00:04:07.800> but<00:04:08.070> it<00:04:08.250> takes<00:04:08.430> like<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:08.880> week

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
write letters but it takes like a week

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.780 
write letters but it takes like a week
for<00:04:10.140> your<00:04:10.440> letter<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.920> get<00:04:11.070> to<00:04:11.220> them<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.640> then

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
for your letter to get to them and then

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.550 
for your letter to get to them and then
when<00:04:11.910> they<00:04:12.030> finally<00:04:12.300> read<00:04:12.690> your<00:04:12.990> letter<00:04:13.320> it

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
when they finally read your letter it

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.810 
when they finally read your letter it
takes<00:04:13.710> another<00:04:13.950> week<00:04:14.160> for<00:04:14.340> them<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.550> write<00:04:14.670> one

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
takes another week for them to write one

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:24.040 
takes another week for them to write one
back<00:04:15.080> so<00:04:16.080> that<00:04:16.230> was<00:04:16.350> hard

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.150
