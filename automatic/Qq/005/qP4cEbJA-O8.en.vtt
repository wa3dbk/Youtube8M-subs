starting a superflat survival series and
if<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.220> guys<00:01:41.340> want<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.610> look<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.820> up<00:01:41.909> people

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
if you guys want to look it up people

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.789 
if you guys want to look it up people
have<00:01:42.329> done<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> lot<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.720> superflat<00:01:43.229> Survival

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
have done a lot of superflat Survival

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.469 
have done a lot of superflat Survival
Series<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.280> they're<00:01:44.399> really<00:01:44.759> really<00:01:44.939> cool<00:01:45.299> in

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
Series and they're really really cool in

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.600 
Series and they're really really cool in
my<00:01:45.600> opinion<00:01:45.960> they're<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> lot<00:01:47.070> better<00:01:47.250> than<00:01:47.520> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
my opinion they're a lot better than a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.580 
my opinion they're a lot better than a
regular<00:01:47.759> Survival<00:01:48.450> Series<00:01:48.600> because<00:01:49.320> there's

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
regular Survival Series because there's

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.010 
regular Survival Series because there's
a<00:01:49.680> lot<00:01:49.860> more<00:01:49.890> technique<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.329> it

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
a lot more technique to it and it

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.480 
a lot more technique to it and it
requires<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.500> lot<00:01:52.530> more<00:01:52.710> skill<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.340> knowledge

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
requires a lot more skill and knowledge

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.959 
requires a lot more skill and knowledge
of<00:01:54.060> Minecraft<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.579> that's<00:01:56.579> something<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.850> I

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
of Minecraft so that's something that I

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.069 
of Minecraft so that's something that I
was<00:01:57.090> kind<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.270> inspired<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.689> doing<00:01:57.960> there

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
was kind of inspired to doing there

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.109 
was kind of inspired to doing there
minecraft<00:01:58.920> does<00:01:59.070> get<00:01:59.250> popular<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.700> guess<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.000> can

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
minecraft does get popular I guess I can

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.280 
minecraft does get popular I guess I can
include<00:02:00.450> hunger<00:02:00.719> games<00:02:00.899> with<00:02:01.049> other

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290

include hunger games with other
youtubers<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.210> guess<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.390> can<00:02:03.509> come<00:02:03.659> up<00:02:03.780> as

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
youtubers I guess that can come up as

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.260 
youtubers I guess that can come up as
well<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.490> you<00:02:05.490> know<00:02:05.579> depending<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:06.030> what<00:02:06.090> you

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
well so you know depending on what you

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.089 
well so you know depending on what you
guys<00:02:06.360> think<00:02:06.630> if<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.229> guys<00:02:07.320> do<00:02:07.740> think<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.039> I

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
guys think if you guys do think that I

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.279

should<00:02:08.310> do<00:02:08.429> minecraft

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
should do minecraft

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.180 
should do minecraft
leave<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.530> comments<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:10.979> should
