00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
you is this is my glue holder because I

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.350 
you is this is my glue holder because I
spend<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.490> much<00:02:05.610> time<00:02:05.670> waiting<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:06.120> the<00:02:06.240> glue

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.180 
spend so much time waiting for the glue
to<00:02:06.570> come<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> point<00:02:07.080> so<00:02:07.650> I<00:02:07.710> quickly<00:02:07.920> made

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
to come to the point so I quickly made

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.340 
to come to the point so I quickly made
myself<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.610> little<00:02:08.640> holder<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.750> I

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
myself a little holder like this and I

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.440 
myself a little holder like this and I
find<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.800> very<00:02:10.860> helpful<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:12.030> keep<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.270> glue

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
find that very helpful to keep the glue

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.320 
find that very helpful to keep the glue
ready<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.050> rock<00:02:13.200> at<00:02:13.350> all<00:02:13.440> times

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330
