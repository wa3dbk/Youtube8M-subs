00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.130

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.509
 just way we could say nonetheless 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.790
 television we do not have much 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.200
 after the completion of the 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.910
 program however if he was given much 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.110
 tribune and that he continues to give the lizard 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.849
 Murdock complicates you a bit 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.160
 situation that both participated in 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.860
 that program to complicate if I am 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.000
 super friends burgos we are friends not for 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.460
 nothing I think that even if you thought 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.320
 we all have perhaps the dream of being 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.410
 in the fifth vergara maybe all of us 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.410
 we deserve 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.150
 boroughs but in reality everything monistic 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.700
 we dream about this story I do not feel 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:52.200
 for I am nothing super friend greets 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.910
 morning lizard hopefully you do not have 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.730
 very successful but your career reaches 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.040
 download the vineyard festival for you is going to 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.350
 be a super important scenario 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.630
 and one let's say that failure does not matter 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.060
 the failure being in the section of 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.290
 line is that it did not prepare me that I think 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.550
 that anyone who prepares 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.950
 for failure 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.030
 can not get to the fifth vergara 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.070
 then I do not visualize that 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.020
 I'm interested in what interests me tomorrow 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.549
 make it clear that I am going to make a 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.770
 and that people have a good time for that 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.159
 I'm prepared for failure 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.679
 like here another week for here 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.319
 actually go up entertaining because in 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.929
 the series of celebrating my birthday already 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.340
 I was with cane and on February 24 but 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.469
 It was a super special birthday because 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.319
 my family is all in vineyard then 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.689
 I had alone in my house with my musician and with 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.109
 my sister when I fell asleep I 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.109
 I worried 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.340
 but what I had clear that my musician 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.340
 Was playing 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.340
 do not 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.930
 this has actually been a week 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.210
 super special because 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.010
 it has been spoken in him 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.880
 I actually arrived here without knowing everything 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.880
 Tuesday of Wednesday 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.440
 makes us be a humorist 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:16.300
 humorist believe critical societies 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.440
 what happened what not what what I'm going 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.080
 to say something we suffer a 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.940
 earthquake really big big 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.030
 but you do not find that you asked in the 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.670
 eighth Region 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.350
 things have happened 70 I also know I 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.260
 I think we have inside our DNA 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.680
 of penguin of people's chorero 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.060
 colonel of the people in which people take 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.890
 everything that gathers our region we have 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.340
 a very good wave and like things 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.540
 pass and pass or if we keep laughing not 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.800
 I think it's an artist's land because 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.020
 besides being the humorists that you 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.200
 name and violet also in the region 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.340
 Claudia Taboo said 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.340
 my dad too 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.000
 there's really a lot of rim people there 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.980
 all artist the three bunkers 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.980
 we could see countless artists 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.050
 so that it is the capital of the artists 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.090
 unwittingly 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.530
 and I feel grateful to me 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.410
 region and that would have also given me the 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.350
 opportunity to represent it and I hope 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.510
 represent very well tomorrow you're going to 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.310
 face the monster after 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.720
 has finished miguel bosé because 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.390
 I imagine you have to have a routine 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.340
 fast and attack for so that the fans 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.770
 they are calm 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.110
 first of all tomorrow more than ever 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.260
 there are a lot in the fifth are pure women 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.340
 and I do not tell women I won 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.770
 less are those in the fifth 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.130
 vergara second and that will be a 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:39.220
 receptive public or the woman always 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.780
 has been receptive to humor always I have 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.270
 had events to secrete sending 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.490
 and 500 secretary and usually 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.990
 empower women more than when there 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.230
 500 men where I have suffered 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.230
 quite 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.920
 so nothing the routine is ready 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.200
 is prepared justly for all 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.230
 public not only in what you say 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.550
 a quick routine a routine is for 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.430
 all public there is no discrimination 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.430
 because they are women is for all 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.980
 tomorrow you would have liked maybe some 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.650
 public of another style is like with 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.509
 this public that go to see Miguel 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.780
 bosé ya jonas brothers we know that 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:22.669
 they are well- seasoned fans of their weight 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.690
 and go back to guide lives I'm not going to 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.490
 comment but it's really not super 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.000
 well the public is super good at 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.680
 public I repeat you again a public 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.810
 female who usually talk that the 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.520
 people, people say that women are 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.410
 slower is lie is the lie more 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.660
 great that the public has invented 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.840
 feminine a receptive audience attentive and 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.289
