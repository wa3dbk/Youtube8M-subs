00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.820
 thick onion rings recipe for the 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:14.599
 recipe if they have these ingredients 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:17.450
 milk flour yeast eggs an onion 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:22.280
 great that we're going to cut hair 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:26.480
 salt and pepper enough to start 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:30.070
 we prepare our batter in a 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.070
 container for we are milk 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:43.579
 preferably at room temperature 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:47.140
 the non-cold milk leaven that we will go 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.140
 to melt with a whisk 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.500
 then add the flour 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.119
 always turning in the same now in 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.119
 so as not to form lumps 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:28.159
 now we can add an egg 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:37.579
 whole plus a tour we continue to 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:41.740
 always mix in the same towards one 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.740
 batter should be a thick batter 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:59.439
 now pepper salt and mix 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.369
 still flour 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:34.349
 now we let it rest for about 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:38.379
 half an hour covering it with a cloth like this 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.659
 meanwhile we are waiting for ours 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:47.409
 batter that will double in volume 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:52.379
 we pay our sliced ​​onion 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:57.030
 quite the same that we're going to share 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.030
 so to ring 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:19.700
 pressing so as not to 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.700
 break them we will get rings 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:30.689
 better to use a large onion 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:32.970
 so as to make more effect once 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:35.010

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.939
 the remaining small central ones there 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.220
 we'll use that another recipe 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:51.440
 now let's take it back into a 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:58.909

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.909
 add a pinch of salt like this 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:11.370
 pepper and let rest and then go to them 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:14.659
 pass in the batter and fry them in 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.659
 oil at 170 degrees 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:22.380

 onion we're going to soak in 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.750
 our batter in this way we avoid 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:05:01.750
