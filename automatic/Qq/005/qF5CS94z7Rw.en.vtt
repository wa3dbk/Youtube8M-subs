00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
knocked out of bounds which stops the

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.360 
knocked out of bounds which stops the
clock<00:05:56.720> which<00:05:56.990> helps<00:05:57.260> us<00:05:57.410> out<00:05:57.650> you<00:05:57.979> try<00:05:58.130> thrown

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
clock which helps us out you try thrown

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.590 
clock which helps us out you try thrown
out<00:05:58.520> I<00:05:58.550> wasn't<00:05:58.850> me<00:05:59.000> at<00:05:59.090> the<00:05:59.180> first<00:05:59.330> down<00:05:59.510> either

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
out I wasn't me at the first down either

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.820 
out I wasn't me at the first down either
way<00:05:59.720> but<00:05:59.930> the<00:06:00.050> more<00:06:00.200> important<00:06:00.530> thing<00:06:00.560> at<00:06:00.740> the

way but the more important thing at the

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.820 
way but the more important thing at the
clock<00:06:01.010> actually<00:06:01.400> stopped<00:06:01.729> there<00:06:02.000> so<00:06:02.680> we<00:06:03.680> got

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
clock actually stopped there so we got

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.450 
clock actually stopped there so we got
two<00:06:03.979> minutes

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
two minutes

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340 
extra yards and we dive in the end zone

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.250 
extra yards and we dive in the end zone
just<00:06:51.880> to<00:06:52.060> see<00:06:52.540> we<00:06:52.690> could<00:06:52.840> get<00:06:52.930> that<00:06:53.080> touchdown

come<00:06:53.620> I<00:06:53.680> don't<00:06:53.860> dive<00:06:54.010> probably<00:06:54.430> don't<00:06:54.550> get<00:06:54.610> the

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:54.730 
come I don't dive probably don't get the

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.130 
come I don't dive probably don't get the
touchdown<00:06:54.940> we<00:06:55.180> actually<00:06:55.450> get<00:06:55.630> the<00:06:55.750> touchdown

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:56.140
