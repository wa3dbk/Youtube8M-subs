a new pc to play them but right now i

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.670 
a new pc to play them but right now i
have<00:01:16.790> my<00:01:16.820> xbox<00:01:17.420> one<00:01:17.690> and<00:01:17.900> have<00:01:18.200> a<00:01:18.260> lot<00:01:18.410> of<00:01:18.440> fun

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
have my xbox one and have a lot of fun

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.980 
have my xbox one and have a lot of fun
on<00:01:18.800> it<00:01:19.010> and<00:01:19.160> also<00:01:19.430> i'm<00:01:20.060> really<00:01:20.450> really<00:01:20.570> bad<00:01:20.840> at

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
on it and also i'm really really bad at

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.510 
on it and also i'm really really bad at
pc<00:01:21.350> games<00:01:21.590> like<00:01:21.770> with<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:21.980> controls<00:01:22.340> and

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
pc games like with the controls and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.310 
pc games like with the controls and
stuff<00:01:22.760> but<00:01:22.910> i<00:01:23.000> guess<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:23.630> takes<00:01:23.810> time<00:01:24.050> to<00:01:24.080> get

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
stuff but i guess it takes time to get

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.960 
stuff but i guess it takes time to get
used<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.590> everything<00:01:24.680> so<00:01:25.190> there<00:01:25.670> are<00:01:25.790> some

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
used to everything so there are some

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.790 
used to everything so there are some
crazy<00:01:26.270> mods<00:01:26.570> like<00:01:26.810> in<00:01:26.960> this<00:01:27.080> example<00:01:27.140> i'm<00:01:27.650> also

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
crazy mods like in this example i'm also
