00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
of people that's a lot of extra work

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.310 
of people that's a lot of extra work
that<00:01:53.280> they<00:01:53.430> don't<00:01:53.670> want<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.180> or<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:55.140> some

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
that they don't want to do or in some

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.959 
that they don't want to do or in some

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
cases just don't feel comfortable doing

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.359 
cases just don't feel comfortable doing
right<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:57.899> not<00:01:57.990> like<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.259> xbox<00:01:58.649> 360<00:01:59.130> slim

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
right it's not like the xbox 360 slim

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.219 
right it's not like the xbox 360 slim
which<00:01:59.670> would<00:01:59.820> allow<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.329> just<00:02:00.600> pop<00:02:01.079> open

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
which would allow you to just pop open

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.840 
which would allow you to just pop open
the<00:02:01.380> bottom<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.860> remove<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.310> hard<00:02:02.520> drive<00:02:02.579> and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
the bottom and remove the hard drive and

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.789 
the bottom and remove the hard drive and
replace<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.180> with<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.420> bigger<00:02:03.689> one<00:02:03.930> or<00:02:04.079> whatever

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
replace it with a bigger one or whatever

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.249

okay<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.549> could<00:02:05.700> do<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.149> was<00:02:06.270> easy<00:02:06.540> okay

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
okay you could do that it was easy okay

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.139 
okay you could do that it was easy okay
when<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.469> wanted<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.069> upgrade<00:02:08.250> my<00:02:08.520> original

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.300 
and find a guy who lived who operated
out<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.450> like<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.690> back<00:02:16.990> alley<00:02:17.320> not<00:02:17.950> too<00:02:18.130> far

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
out of like a back alley not too far

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.850 
out of like a back alley not too far
from<00:02:18.370> where<00:02:18.550> i<00:02:18.700> lived<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.270> order<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.930> get<00:02:20.140> what

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
from where i lived in order to get what

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.410 
from where i lived in order to get what
I<00:02:20.920> wanted<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.550> while<00:02:21.970> saying<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.300> was

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
I wanted and while saying it was

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.910 
I wanted and while saying it was
creepier<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.930> was<00:02:23.050> dirty<00:02:23.320> or<00:02:23.410> it<00:02:23.590> was<00:02:23.710> wrong

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
creepier it was dirty or it was wrong

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.290 
creepier it was dirty or it was wrong
but<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.280> was<00:02:24.400> just<00:02:24.430> one<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.760> those<00:02:24.850> things<00:02:24.940> were

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
but it was just one of those things were

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.350 
but it was just one of those things were
it<00:02:25.720> was<00:02:26.050> it<00:02:26.260> was<00:02:26.320> not<00:02:26.680> insured<00:02:27.040> if<00:02:27.790> he<00:02:28.060> fucked

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
it was it was not insured if he fucked

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.570 
it was it was not insured if he fucked
up<00:02:28.570> and<00:02:28.750> bricked<00:02:29.500> my<00:02:29.620> system<00:02:30.160> there'd<00:02:30.580> be

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
up and bricked my system there'd be

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.190 
up and bricked my system there'd be
nothing<00:02:31.180> I<00:02:31.270> could<00:02:31.420> do<00:02:31.510> about<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.750> I<00:02:31.930> would<00:02:32.080> be

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
nothing I could do about it I would be

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.140 
nothing I could do about it I would be
out<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.380> few<00:02:32.650> hundred<00:02:32.800> dollars<00:02:33.280> but<00:02:33.970> at<00:02:34.060> least

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
out a few hundred dollars but at least

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.930 
out a few hundred dollars but at least
this<00:02:34.570> kind<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.020> allows<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.710> happen<00:02:35.940> with

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
this kind of allows that to happen with

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.060 
this kind of allows that to happen with
an<00:02:37.180> insurance<00:02:37.690> policy<00:02:37.840> or<00:02:38.380> at<00:02:38.500> least<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.770> return

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
an insurance policy or at least a return

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.970 
an insurance policy or at least a return
policy<00:02:39.310> right<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.300> so<00:02:41.050> that's<00:02:41.230> good<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.680> think

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
policy right and so that's good I think

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.620 
policy right and so that's good I think
that's<00:02:42.190> good<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:42.640> is<00:02:42.670> games<00:02:43.030> up<00:02:43.270> getting

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
that's good this is games up getting

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.720 
that's good this is games up getting
ahead<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.050> curve<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.580> even<00:02:45.580> though<00:02:45.700> I

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
ahead of the curve and even though I

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.480 
ahead of the curve and even though I
rarely<00:02:46.090> shop<00:02:46.720> at<00:02:46.990> gamestop<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:47.770> know<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.190> lot<00:02:48.460> of

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
rarely shop at gamestop I know a lot of

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.970 
rarely shop at gamestop I know a lot of
people<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:49.000> still<00:02:49.300> do<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.870> this<00:02:50.620> could<00:02:50.830> be

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
people that still do and this could be

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.070 
people that still do and this could be
good<00:02:51.160> for<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.520> newcomers<00:02:51.880> into<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.360> current

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
good for the newcomers into the current

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.620 
good for the newcomers into the current
console<00:02:53.530> generation<00:02:54.100> because<00:02:54.970> let's<00:02:55.270> face<00:02:55.330> it

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
console generation because let's face it

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.110 
console generation because let's face it
like<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:55.960> said<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.350> 500<00:02:56.800> gigabytes<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.640> looks

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
like I said the 500 gigabytes it looks

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.210 
like I said the 500 gigabytes it looks
like<00:02:58.240> a<00:02:58.390> lot<00:02:58.600> on<00:02:58.780> paper<00:02:59.050> but<00:02:59.350> it<00:02:59.410> doesn't<00:02:59.950> go<00:03:00.040> as

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
like a lot on paper but it doesn't go as

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.500 
like a lot on paper but it doesn't go as
far<00:03:00.250> as<00:03:00.550> you<00:03:00.670> might<00:03:00.850> think<00:03:00.880> when<00:03:01.390> you're

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
far as you might think when you're

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.020 
far as you might think when you're
actually<00:03:01.980> picking<00:03:02.980> up<00:03:03.130> all<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.460> games<00:03:03.700> you

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
actually picking up all the games you

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.970 
actually picking up all the games you
want<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.750> get<00:03:04.930> there's<00:03:05.440> almost<00:03:05.620> nothing

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
want to get there's almost nothing

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.880 
want to get there's almost nothing
