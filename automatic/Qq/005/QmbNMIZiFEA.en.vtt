in or before the dancers start dancing

00:02:58.739 --> 00:02:59.570 
in or before the dancers start dancing
because<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.129> the<00:02:59.220> part<00:02:59.430> where

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
because this is the part where

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.670
