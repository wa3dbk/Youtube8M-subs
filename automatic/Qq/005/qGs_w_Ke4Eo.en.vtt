 individuals living together do not recognize 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.950
 perceptions until you do not 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.479
 reality and beyond these 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:50.490
 auditory and tactile visual perceptions 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.049
 are not real with the argument both 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.840
 of the health professional 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.430
 when relatives do not change this 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.469
 sure and roni 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.909

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.680
 are largely 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.270
 organize 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.850
 and I speak very disorganized speech 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.870
 schizophrenia have as one of the 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:19.190
 treatment possibilities 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:22.490
 drugs to quetiapine psychiatry 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.810
 often the same medication 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:29.810
 medication is respected is indicated for 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.850
 different types of illness is very 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.390
 common patients and family members 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.640
 ask the following I was diagnosed 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.940
 my relative was diagnosed as 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.530
 carrier for example of disorder 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:49.340
 bipolar affection and the doctor prescribes 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.280
 that had pina that is an indication that 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.390
 in good is written all for treatment 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.209
 of schizophrenia 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.209
 then this is very common and indeed 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.680
 had an example tire of medicine that 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:05.270
 is part of both the medical options 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.070
 medicines for the treatment of 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.560
 both family research and 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:14.330
 then more serious illness as well as 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:17.840
 of the bipolar affective disorder that had 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.970
 aquino has some side effects 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.900
 some common ones reported by 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:27.410
 patients are dry mouth weight 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.410
 some shivering skin changes 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.080
 change in the dietary pattern 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.380
 Anyway, I already have some 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:40.280
 people have side effects that can 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.269
 be reduced but rather as one of the 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.480
 medication 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.760
 with other medications than to reduce the 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.269
 side effects as well as the 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:55.040
 change and distribution of the doses 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:58.670
 Divine does not cause dependence on or 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:03.380
 whether the patient is the doctor and 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:06.049
 dose reduction program or 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:10.459
 withdraw the medication from the patient 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:14.120
 in use of ti to thin will not have symptoms 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.710
 will not have symptoms of 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.000
 lack 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:22.480
 of which he was sorry because despite being 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.510
 prescribed in special white prescription 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.570
 two ways does not cause dependence 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.910
 I scored a lot of patients and 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.120
 receiving the prescription 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.430
 that it had in its high cost 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.950
 in fact for our country is a 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.440
 medication that has a purchase cost a 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.530
 relevant financial cost 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.520
 The good news is that several in several 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.770
 health care systems already 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.460
 available quetiapine at no cost 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.390
 for the patient and the security that only 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.770
 is a medication that initially 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.700
 was used for the treatment of 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.250
 schizophrenia 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.490
 currently already has an indication of 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:10.900
 use of affective disorder and which is 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:13.270
 does not cause dependence and due to 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.960
 fortunately for the systems 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.010
