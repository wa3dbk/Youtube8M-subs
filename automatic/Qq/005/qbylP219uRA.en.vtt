 perfectly but in my case and that of 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:16.070
 many also is that we have 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.289
 not very good computers that do not 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.750
 those games so longed for 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.340

 number 7 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.769
 Prince of Persia is an action game 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.390
 frenetic and acrobatic skill that 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.879
 immerse the player in an exotic 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.250
 oriental universe where strength and 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.989
 power to master time come together to 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.750
 end the evil unleashed by the 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.059
 curse of the sands is a game a 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.589
 little old but after so many years 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.589
 still giving of what to talk

 which extends from the mountains 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.280
 snowfall to the plains in my opinion is 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.300
 the best cowboy game he has 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.300

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.830
 from this point you will see games 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.900
 they ask for a little more requirements but 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.900
 equally the requirements are low

 evil 'that I've played in my life I play very 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.320

 first-person shooter with a 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.000

 I've never really tried it but this one 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.890
 game they rate very well in forums 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.480
 videogames I think we should give it 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.480
 an opportunity to this game 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.570
 number 3 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.310

 of anomalous materials from the center of

 disused located in the desert again 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:03.229
 mexico this place has many 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.919
 similarities with the national laboratory 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:08.900
 of the poplars and area 51 apart from being 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.690
 a very good game with few requirements 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.710
 It is also super fun to play with 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.710
 friends in online mode 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.240
 number 2 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.780
 number 1 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.830
 this position was very discussed was 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.770
 between operation 7 and call of duty 4 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.470
 modern warfare but to my tastes the one 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:52.310
 win is call of duty 4 modern warfare e 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:54.620
 because first operation 7 asks for a bit 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.920
 more than requirements of the call of duty and 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:01.010
 second operation 7 is a very game 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.590
 unstable when it comes to gameplay is not 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.810
 to be skillful is more the one who buys 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.690
 The virtual currency of the game is the one 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:11.480
 play more I think everyone already knows how 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:15.050
 It's call of duty 4 but if you do not know it 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.700
 this is the game in 2011 bursts a 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.490
 civil war in russia between his government 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.470
 and the ultranationalists who seek 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.100
 restore russia to its glamor of the era 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.100
