00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello how is it good now let's go 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.220
 with the third party now that 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.990
 we had the stock expander and the hj 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.589
 spirit we can begin to lower the 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.059
 files that we have in the blog then 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.390
 The first thing we 're going to do is let's go 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.090
 to my blog corner of the hub or point 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.580
 wordpress.com and suppose we're going to 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.890
 download a file that weighs less than 200 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.920
 megas 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.950
 and it's compressed in the spam stick 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.480
 then suppose we're going to lower the 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.480
 movie of publishing a book 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.649
 just like point this is for 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.120
 normal collector and does not have any 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.100
 nothing sang to me 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.370
 the things that we go here where can 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.170
 to download 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.170
 the password that is in mule 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.470
 shows us the server folder that 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:05.390
 we are occupying we go to the server 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.000
 and that we can download if they look at 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.670
 the 7x extensions and appear sign of 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.160
 interrogation means that the server 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.160
 do not know what kind of files 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.970
 we put the two words 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:39.860
 and let's say the download goes down but one 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.780
 Once you finish downloading it's here 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.259
 same or go to the download folder 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:50.360
 where he is and what he is doing 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.679
 open automatically is to expand 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.020
 As you can see here is the icon that already 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.580
 it opened on its own then they tell us where 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.140
 he wants to download these in July- 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.479
 good that we are going to download in the 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.360
 desktop let's create a folder that 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.360
 know more chapters lowered 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:20.780
 and asks us for the passage the password is 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.930
 example we put spam 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.290
 automatically begins to expand the 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.290
 archive 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.040
 then I liked this interface more 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.560
 and we give him to finish 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.560
 we close the expander we go to the desk 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.420
 there is a folder that is more chapters 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.040
 lowered that so we can see what they did 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:02.630
 the folder 0 024 0 1 appears that its 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.760
 code since the public movie is 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.860
 and we will be able to see in our 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.480
 player about why this one does not 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.790
 has no player installed like this 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.950
 that is going to open in 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.950
 the medium 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.550
 obviously I do not recommend that in 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.300
 windows media 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.300
 but good 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.670
 how can you watch the movie 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.310
 directly and I do not expect anything more from the 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.310
 times 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.480
 and that would be how we are ready with the 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.849
 file downloaded when the file weighs 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.959
 less than 200 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.959
 I hope you liked it
