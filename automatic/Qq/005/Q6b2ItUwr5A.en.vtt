00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.319
 for a hands raising 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.760
 the next candidate is robert one 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.940
 farmer's son from bocholt who likes to be with the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.620
 backpack travels around the world 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.870
 yes for me backpacking is actually 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.090
 grown and passion I love to travel 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.320
 with as little baggage as possible and then 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.029
 every job matters as much as possible 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.590
 save weight so as not to have to 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.510
 to wait 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.970
 airport your luggage in soil can 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.800
 leave and on toe seam differently 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.580
 so for me is actually so little 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.410
 possible luggage 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.290
 we have a form of freedom like me 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.180
 am traveling and so robert came on it 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.800
 idea to put a very special shoe for that 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.800
 develop backpack tourists 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.200
 wondering what shoes men water bursts 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.200
 think of it 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.590
 they receive multifunctional cleaning 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.460
 and your disk based on that 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.989
 so 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.730
 can be clicked around mind and cissÃ© 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.859
 then a bi can be sex and see 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.960
 a hike extension or a formal one 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.930
 extension and that way I always have 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.189
 the sole and extension of useful maximum 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.189
 two extensions in your backpack 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.479
 a smart invention of robert 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.010
 maybe too smart for some 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.409
 People can take three pairs three times less 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.719
 shoes are coming 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.200
 I'm going to remember my mother's porch 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:23.090
 products in the warned 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.920
 but it gets worse distrust plate 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.829
 wild shoes not only in stores 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.899
 we can sell like 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:33.350
 i would like to go online and that it 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.060
 international product is primarily 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.219
 Great Britain Australia that it is a lot 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.420
 how many years lonely planet audience 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.149
 backpacking public 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.490
 so especially the market I want to appeal to 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.990
 robert will quickly two years 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.610
 the only one she doesn't have the opinion yet 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.020
 yes , yes , it will be 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.759
 specialists house that very creatively 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.170
 went up with a store because that has now 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.700
 three pairs sell but a few sell 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.560
 but that is also cost-term 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.479
 actually an at ibm and very new 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.000
