00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
a smoky eye is to make sure that it's

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.639

between a smoky eye and a black eye and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.590 
between a smoky eye and a black eye and
you<00:00:49.249> don't<00:00:49.460> want<00:00:49.579> it<00:00:49.670> to<00:00:49.820> look<00:00:49.940> messy<00:00:50.359> because

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
you don't want it to look messy because

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.150 
you don't want it to look messy because

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.649 
so I have this right on her lid and then
I'm<00:01:48.009> going<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.220> go<00:01:48.340> ahead<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:48.700> blend<00:01:48.970> that<00:01:49.270> out

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.770 

by<00:01:52.659> using<00:01:52.869> circular<00:01:53.200> motions<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:55.509> we<00:01:55.600> want<00:01:55.750> to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
by using circular motions so we want to

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:11.640 
by using circular motions so we want to
make<00:01:55.840> sure<00:01:55.960> it's<00:01:56.259> really<00:01:56.439> blended

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.589 

so<00:02:12.650> we've<00:02:12.739> got<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:12.950> blended<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:13.790> that's<00:02:14.420> the
