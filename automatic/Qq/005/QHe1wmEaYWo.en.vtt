00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.930
 There are animals today, that is, blue whales, beyond the dinosaurs. 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.549
 Become the largest animal in the history of the earth. 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.141
 But now there is no animal that is walking on land. 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.830
 The size can reach huge dinosaurs. 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.540
 The biggest dinosaur of all time is probably the "fragile double-cavity dragon". 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.500
 Up to 60 meters long and weighs 122 metric tons! 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.399
 In contrast, the modern largest land animal, the African elephant 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.180
 Only 3 to 4 meters high and 5.5 tons heavy, flat is a herbivore! 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.239
 Why aren't the current mammals as big as dinosaurs? 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.900
 The fossil record gave us some clues. 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.000
 The time, process, and even the exact reason why a mammal reaches its upper body weight. 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.640
 65 million years ago, after the last dinosaur disappeared 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.480
 Mammal size and diversity 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.539
 Crazy growth... until the grand event is no longer. 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.760
 About 30 million years ago, a behemoth like a rhinoceros and a giraffe 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.999
 Up to 5 meters high and 7.5 meters long, 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.839
 It has reached the largest record of mammals on land. 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.460
 Scientists believe that there are several factors that limit modern onshore mammals 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.159
 Unable to reach the size of a huge dinosaur. 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.229
 First of all, mammals must produce young cubs from the body - in contrast, dinosaur mothers can get out of the nest with just a nest of eggs. 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.560
 But mammals need to be pregnant and take care of raising their babies, which costs a lot of energy. 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.720
 Large mammals also have a long pregnancy. 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.159
 Giraffe and rhinoceros have to be pregnant in fifteen months 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.630
 And the elephant's pregnancy is close to two years! 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.340
 The longer the pregnancy period, the more dangerous the mother and child are. 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.759
 Therefore, the ancient giant grass-feeding mammals may experience a period that is too long. 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.100
 Also dangerous during pregnancy. 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.659
 Another theory says that dinosaurs can become huge thanks to the earth. 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.130
 The climate and ecology at the time. 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.320
 Warmer and humid climate with higher carbon content in the atmosphere 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.000
 Make plants grow through the sky. 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.920
 The sauropod dinosaurs basically live in a full table. 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.200
 It is purely because of environmental permits. But after the environment changes 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.380
 The environment of modern herbivores is not so good. The third reason is 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.580
 Today's mammals on land are more restricted by the skeletal system. 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.399
 Saxid fossil evidence shows 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.660
 A bird-like balloon has a skeleton that is much lighter than a mammal of the same size. 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.040
 Some of them are 30 meters long and the weight is estimated to be only 40 tons. 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.230
 A modern mammal of the same size may have twice as much weight 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.230
 And almost impossible to move. Last fourth 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.230
 Perhaps the coolest reason is giant mammals 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.570
 May roast your own organization. (In vivo heat production is greater than body heat dissipation) You may know that mammals are 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.020
 Internal temperature or warm-blooded animals. Our body manufactures and maintains body temperature. 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.140
 In contrast, reptiles are external temperature or cold-blooded animals. 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.550
 Breathing heat from the environment, such as snakes basking in the sun on rocks. 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.900
 In fact, there is controversy about whether some dinosaurs are as warm as birds. 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.340
 Or between cold and warm blood. (This has created a word "mesotherm") 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.060
 But no matter how mammals use more energy than the same type of reptiles. 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.780
 Therefore, modern land mammals may not be much larger than elephants. 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.510
 Don't cook yourself because of internal heat. 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.980
 This makes me quite satisfied with my current body. 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.570
