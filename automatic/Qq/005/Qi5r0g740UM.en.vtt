film

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:51.480 

I'm<00:01:38.770> gonna<00:01:39.040> heat<00:01:39.220> some<00:01:39.400> water<00:01:39.430> up<00:01:39.850> here<00:01:50.490> there

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
I'm gonna heat some water up here there

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:02.279 
I'm gonna heat some water up here there
250<00:01:52.270> mils<00:01:53.520> no<00:01:54.520> lid<00:01:54.850> about<00:01:57.630> 65<00:01:58.630> degrees<00:02:01.289> looked

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
250 mils no lid about 65 degrees looked

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.690 
250 mils no lid about 65 degrees looked
a<00:02:02.380> little<00:02:02.500> more<00:02:02.740> level<00:02:03.009> when<00:02:03.220> I<00:02:03.310> first<00:02:03.520> got

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
a little more level when I first got

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:12.650 
a little more level when I first got
here<00:02:03.759> I<00:02:09.509> think<00:02:10.509> that's<00:02:10.720> gonna<00:02:10.840> work

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
here I think that's gonna work

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.560 
here I think that's gonna work
yeah<00:02:13.660> we're<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.930> lot<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.680> brain

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.920 

so<00:02:19.570> I<00:02:20.910> bought<00:02:21.910> this<00:02:22.120> because<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.600> did<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.780> little

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
so I bought this because I did a little

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.150 
so I bought this because I did a little
research<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.470> seem<00:02:23.650> like<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.800> really<00:02:24.040> good

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
research to seem like a really good

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.940 
research to seem like a really good
stove<00:02:24.720> I'm<00:02:25.720> pretty<00:02:25.960> happy<00:02:26.170> with<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.650> but<00:02:26.770> one

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
stove I'm pretty happy with it but one

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.100 
stove I'm pretty happy with it but one
thing<00:02:27.900> it's<00:02:28.900> hard<00:02:28.960> to<00:02:29.140> get<00:02:29.230> accessory<00:02:29.770> store

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
thing it's hard to get accessory store

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.490 
thing it's hard to get accessory store

actual stove itself the oats talked a

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.890 
actual stove itself the oats talked a
lot<00:02:40.930> in<00:02:40.990> the<00:02:41.170> accessories<00:02:41.770> for<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:43.690> have

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
lot in the accessories for it so I have

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.380 
lot in the accessories for it so I have

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.100 

so<00:02:51.819> what<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:51.970> was<00:02:52.120> looking<00:02:52.390> for<00:02:52.599> was<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.810> auto

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
so what I was looking for was the auto

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.640 
so what I was looking for was the auto
igniter<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.800> go<00:02:54.040> with<00:02:54.220> it

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.140 

and

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
and

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.309 
and
I<00:02:58.239> couldn't<00:02:58.569> get<00:02:58.629> it<00:02:58.780> here<00:02:58.930> in<00:02:59.019> town

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
I couldn't get it here in town

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.740 
I couldn't get it here in town
so<00:03:00.950> I'm<00:03:01.129> not<00:03:01.280> sure<00:03:01.340> that's<00:03:02.000> going<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.540> be<00:03:02.599> an

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
so I'm not sure that's going to be an

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.119 
so I'm not sure that's going to be an
issue<00:03:02.870> or<00:03:03.379> or<00:03:03.709> not<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:04.959> we'll<00:03:05.959> see<00:03:06.170> how<00:03:06.319> it<00:03:06.349> goes

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.069 

we'd<00:03:10.129> like<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.370> say<00:03:10.549> it's<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:11.090> stark<00:03:11.510> contrast

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
we'd like to say it's a stark contrast

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:18.030 
we'd like to say it's a stark contrast
from<00:03:12.349> the<00:03:13.569> alcohol<00:03:14.569> snows<00:03:15.019> of<00:03:15.260> amazing

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:26.320 

apparently<00:03:19.040> loud

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:46.540 

bubbles<00:03:27.020> haven't<00:03:27.440> already<00:03:29.680> -<00:03:45.280> just<00:03:46.280> give<00:03:46.460> you
