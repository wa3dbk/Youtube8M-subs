00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
so I get the smallest possible loop and

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.990 
so I get the smallest possible loop and
wrap<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:17.160> wire<00:03:19.280> hold<00:03:20.280> on<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.490> that<00:03:20.610> nice<00:03:20.820> and

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
tight wrap the wire around the loop as

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.300 
tight wrap the wire around the loop as
far<00:03:27.120> as<00:03:27.240> it'll<00:03:27.450> go<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.870> will<00:03:28.050> only<00:03:28.260> go<00:03:28.650> so<00:03:28.680> far

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
open a jump ring next onto that jump

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.920 
open a jump ring next onto that jump
ring<00:04:55.770> you're<00:04:56.280> going<00:04:56.520> to<00:04:56.639> add<00:04:56.789> the<00:04:57.180> dangle<00:04:57.690> that

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
ring you're going to add the dangle that

ring you're going to add the dangle that
we<00:04:58.770> just<00:04:59.039> made<00:05:00.410> your<00:05:01.580> hoop<00:05:02.780> and<00:05:05.000> another

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
we just made your hoop and another

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.589 
we just made your hoop and another
closed<00:05:06.660> jump<00:05:07.260> ring<00:05:08.030> notice<00:05:09.030> I'm<00:05:09.150> holding<00:05:09.300> on

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
closed jump ring notice I'm holding on

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.180 
closed jump ring notice I'm holding on
to<00:05:09.630> the<00:05:09.810> jump<00:05:10.050> ring<00:05:10.260> with<00:05:10.289> one<00:05:10.710> of<00:05:10.889> the<00:05:10.950> pairs

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
to the jump ring with one of the pairs

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.680 
to the jump ring with one of the pairs
of<00:05:11.370> pliers<00:05:11.550> so<00:05:11.940> I<00:05:11.970> don't<00:05:12.180> have<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.389> try<00:05:12.630> to

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
of pliers so I don't have to try to

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.940 
of pliers so I don't have to try to
reposition<00:05:13.139> it<00:05:14.060> and<00:05:15.060> then<00:05:16.050> I'll<00:05:16.349> just<00:05:16.560> use<00:05:16.770> the

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
reposition it and then I'll just use the

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.600 
reposition it and then I'll just use the
other<00:05:16.979> pair<00:05:18.260> to<00:05:19.260> reverse<00:05:19.590> the<00:05:19.830> process<00:05:20.039> and

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
other pair to reverse the process and

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:28.080 
other pair to reverse the process and
close<00:05:20.970> it<00:05:21.380> back<00:05:22.380> up<00:05:22.620> again

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.500 

the<00:05:29.090> last<00:05:29.330> step<00:05:29.780> is<00:05:30.140> to<00:05:31.040> open<00:05:31.070> the<00:05:31.850> ear<00:05:32.270> wire

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
the last step is to open the ear wire

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.950 
the last step is to open the ear wire
the<00:05:32.960> same<00:05:33.200> way<00:05:33.410> by<00:05:34.450> twisting<00:05:35.450> one<00:05:35.660> side

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
the same way by twisting one side

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.410 
the same way by twisting one side
towards<00:05:36.620> me<00:05:36.830> instead<00:05:37.580> of<00:05:37.700> pulling<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.240> loop

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
towards me instead of pulling the loop

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.100 
towards me instead of pulling the loop
apart<00:05:39.850> then<00:05:40.850> you<00:05:40.880> need<00:05:41.180> to<00:05:41.330> take<00:05:41.540> that<00:05:41.780> left

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
apart then you need to take that left

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.020 
apart then you need to take that left
jump<00:05:43.010> ring<00:05:43.250> that<00:05:43.610> you<00:05:43.790> put<00:05:44.090> on<00:05:45.460> the<00:05:46.460> one<00:05:46.700> that

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
jump ring that you put on the one that

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.720 
jump ring that you put on the one that
didn't<00:05:47.600> ever<00:05:47.780> get<00:05:48.080> opened<00:05:49.540> pop<00:05:50.540> your<00:05:50.810> ear<00:05:51.080> wire

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
didn't ever get opened pop your ear wire

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.800 
didn't ever get opened pop your ear wire
through<00:05:52.730> that<00:05:54.370> use<00:05:55.370> your<00:05:55.610> pliers<00:05:55.910> to<00:05:56.570> close

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
through that use your pliers to close

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:03.910

also<00:06:23.840> do<00:06:24.170> this<00:06:24.440> with<00:06:24.500> round<00:06:25.310> with<00:06:26.090> oval<00:06:26.540> hoops

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
also do this with round with oval hoops

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.690 
also do this with round with oval hoops
you<00:06:27.290> could<00:06:27.500> try<00:06:27.740> different<00:06:28.100> kinds<00:06:28.610> of

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
you could try different kinds of

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.240 
you could try different kinds of
materials<00:06:29.390> so<00:06:29.750> look<00:06:30.560> around<00:06:30.680> see<00:06:31.100> what<00:06:31.220> you

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
materials so look around see what you

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.670 
materials so look around see what you
can<00:06:31.520> find<00:06:31.700> and<00:06:31.970> experiment<00:06:32.600> I<00:06:32.810> hope<00:06:33.500> you've

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
can find and experiment I hope you've

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.990 
can find and experiment I hope you've
enjoyed<00:06:33.740> this<00:06:34.160> project<00:06:34.790> thanks<00:06:35.450> for<00:06:35.600> watching
