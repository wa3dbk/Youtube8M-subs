yes but Turner has been testing this

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.210 
yes but Turner has been testing this
setup<00:00:34.260> too<00:00:34.470> early<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:34.890> given<00:00:35.160> that

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
some serious weight on the frame just

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.660 
some serious weight on the frame just
saving<00:00:40.200> some<00:00:40.470> weight<00:00:40.650> was<00:00:40.830> not<00:00:41.040> quite<00:00:41.430> good

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
saving some weight was not quite good

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.370 
saving some weight was not quite good
enough<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.450> they<00:00:42.570> beefed<00:00:42.750> up<00:00:42.870> their<00:00:43.020> rockers

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
enough so they beefed up their rockers

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.320 
enough so they beefed up their rockers
to<00:00:43.500> stiffen<00:00:43.740> the<00:00:43.920> frame<00:00:44.130> laterally<00:00:44.640> yes<00:00:45.180> this

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
to stiffen the frame laterally yes this

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.910 
to stiffen the frame laterally yes this
adds<00:00:45.630> weight<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.320> overall<00:00:46.650> weight

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
adds weight but the overall weight

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.380 
adds weight but the overall weight
savings<00:00:47.340> on<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.520> frame<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.880> still<00:00:48.030> roughly

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
savings on the frame is still roughly

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.230
