00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.840
 so good afternoon to tell you today 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.389
 how to install the ciss on canon m2 printer 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:17.279
 2440 we need such a pretty girl 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:21.260
 cow so I model here is the principle of 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.260
 printer cover on disassembled 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.869
 junk snpch 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.010
 here is our printer and so that it 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.390
 disassemble 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.480
 here I take all the suspensions for paper 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.070
 trays twist here and here two 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.860
 bolt all that part of the podkovyrivaem 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.020
 open the jumper more precisely latch here 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.699
 you can also click with a sloppy 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.539
 break on if not break in principle 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:02.250
 trouble lift the top of this 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:05.150
 That's neat because she 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.580
 attached to the Komi train 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.760
 remember how the clock stood and 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.600
 disconnect 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.760
 they stay on top and over there 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.400
 and the filling of the printer so that already 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.670
 set ciss 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:25.460
 so what we do we have brought 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:30.180
 tubes sleep why here stuck on 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.570
 self-bonding and then another hot melt 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.570
 the length 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.210
 that's exactly without stretching exactly close to 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.450
 raw in black check 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.549
 drilled hole side that is below 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.429
 center here so here will show you but a 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.459
 all colored as standard tubules on 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:56.479
 color cartridge yellow blue I trimmed 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:59.819
 what was exactly has not much longer 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.549
 we do not need such here I fixed 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:06.450
 glue as you see all taped 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.069
 and here such vtulochka goes to 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:14.010
 complete with all the patches and also 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:18.959
 used pressed snits hoses and planted 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:28.819
 on hot melt assembly from above it looks 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:28.819
 so we see everything works 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.549
 work does not fall asleep all all 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.549
 until we meet again
