so the mod sticks awesome super when the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.340 
so the mod sticks awesome super when the
triggers<00:00:43.170> are<00:00:43.410> installed<00:00:44.570> however<00:00:45.570> they<00:00:46.320> have

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
triggers are installed however they have

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.580 
triggers are installed however they have
some<00:00:46.620> pros<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.010> cons<00:00:47.690> they<00:00:48.690> work<00:00:48.930> they're<00:00:49.559> a

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
some pros and cons they work they're a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.490 
some pros and cons they work they're a
little<00:00:49.739> bit<00:00:49.920> louder<00:00:50.899> they<00:00:51.899> make<00:00:52.079> noise<00:00:52.289> when

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
little bit louder they make noise when

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.310 
little bit louder they make noise when
you<00:00:52.620> pull<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.219> other<00:00:53.370> thing<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:54.320> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
you pull on the other thing is the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.849 
you pull on the other thing is the
springs<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.640> get<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.989> soft<00:00:58.320> ones<00:00:58.590> are

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
springs that you get the soft ones are

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.790 
springs that you get the soft ones are
so<00:00:59.070> soft<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.730> I<00:01:00.420> found<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.410> triggers

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
so soft that I found that the triggers

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.990 
so soft that I found that the triggers
when<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.039> push<00:01:02.219> them<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.489> would<00:01:02.699> not<00:01:02.850> even

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
when you push them in would not even

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.609 
when you push them in would not even
have<00:01:03.149> enough<00:01:03.480> strength<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.080> springs<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
have enough strength the springs the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.960 
have enough strength the springs the
soft<00:01:04.830> springs<00:01:05.070> don't<00:01:05.280> even<00:01:05.460> push<00:01:05.700> them<00:01:05.850> back

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
soft springs don't even push them back

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.120 
soft springs don't even push them back
out<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.439> wanted<00:01:07.680> something<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.950> think

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
out so if you wanted something you think

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.490 
out so if you wanted something you think
in<00:01:08.220> super<00:01:08.520> soft<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:10.049> count<00:01:10.350> them

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
in super soft so you can can count them

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.920 
in super soft so you can can count them
super<00:01:10.860> fast<00:01:11.270> that's<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.479> answer<00:01:12.689> that's

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
super fast that's not the answer that's

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.960 
super fast that's not the answer that's
not<00:01:13.110> what<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:14.189> don't<00:01:14.640> even<00:01:14.729> know<00:01:14.880> why

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
not what they do I don't even know why

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.280 
not what they do I don't even know why
they're<00:01:15.119> included<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.689> honest<00:01:15.990> there's<00:01:16.140> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
they're included to be honest there's a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.630 
they're included to be honest there's a
week<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:17.820> strong<00:01:18.150> ones<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.570> gold<00:01:18.810> ones<00:01:19.020> are<00:01:19.640> so

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
week the strong ones of gold ones are so

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.280 
week the strong ones of gold ones are so
hard<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:22.700> it's<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.659> me<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:25.110> too

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
hard that it's just to me it was too

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.749 
hard that it's just to me it was too
much<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.650> contrast<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.430> such<00:01:26.729> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
much of a contrast you have such a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.899 
much of a contrast you have such a
smooth<00:01:27.210> feel<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.140> action<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.740> these<00:01:28.909> of

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
smooth feel in the action of these of

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.520 
smooth feel in the action of these of
the<00:01:30.299> sticks<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.020> had<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.170> really

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the sticks and then you had to really

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.530 
the sticks and then you had to really
push<00:01:31.860> hard<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.189> them<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.759> played<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> game<00:01:33.479> of

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
push hard on them so I played a game of

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.840 
push hard on them so I played a game of
halo<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:34.020> them<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.490> couple<00:01:35.640> other

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
halo with them and in a couple other

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.810 
halo with them and in a couple other
games<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.950> decided<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.070> take<00:01:38.220> them<00:01:38.400> out<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
games and decided to take them out the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.149 
games and decided to take them out the
good<00:01:39.030> news<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.590> once<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.710> have<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.860> triggers

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
good news is once you have the triggers

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.039 
good news is once you have the triggers
installed<00:01:41.520> all<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.909> do<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.180> take<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
installed all you have to do is take the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.840 
installed all you have to do is take the
black<00:01:43.259> case<00:01:43.470> off<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.100> swap<00:01:44.549> them<00:01:44.759> out

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
black case off and you can swap them out

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.789 
black case off and you can swap them out
there's<00:01:45.240> there's<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.380> not<00:01:46.740> enough

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
there's there's just not enough

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.749 
there's there's just not enough
clearance<00:01:47.430> right<00:01:47.790> here<00:01:48.500> in<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.399> don't

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
clearance right here in that I don't

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.130 
clearance right here in that I don't
know<00:01:50.850> if<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.240> better<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.930> turn<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
know if this you better if I turn the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.499 
know if this you better if I turn the

there's<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:55.020> not<00:01:55.140> enough<00:01:55.200> clearance<00:01:55.740> here

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
there's just not enough clearance here

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.679 
there's just not enough clearance here
to<00:01:57.049> take<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.200> screw<00:01:58.590> out<00:01:58.740> without<00:01:59.689> damaging

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
to take that screw out without damaging

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.270 
to take that screw out without damaging
the<00:02:00.810> case<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.350> do<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.770> take<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.040> out

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the case so you do have to take this out

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.700 
the case so you do have to take this out
and<00:02:02.310> my<00:02:02.729> advice<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.270> do<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.649> once<00:02:04.649> you

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
and my advice if you do that once you

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.749 
and my advice if you do that once you
get<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.920> screws<00:02:05.159> out<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.520> battery

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
get the screws out in the battery

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.029 
get the screws out in the battery
removed<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.990> pry<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.320> from<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:07.979> side

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
removed is to pry it from this side

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.020 
removed is to pry it from this side
because<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.090> do<00:02:09.270> have<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.869> pull<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.410> away<00:02:11.030> this

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
because you do have to pull it away this

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
because you do have to pull it away this
way

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
way

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.730 
way
to<00:02:13.680> clear<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.160> triggers<00:02:14.930> cleanly<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.110> then

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
to clear the triggers cleanly and then

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.370 
to clear the triggers cleanly and then
you<00:02:16.890> can<00:02:17.180> remove<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.390> set<00:02:18.600> screws<00:02:18.900> here<00:02:19.170> and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
you can remove the set screws here and

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.350 
you can remove the set screws here and
replace<00:02:20.100> your<00:02:20.370> spring<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.000> was<00:02:21.090> kind<00:02:21.300> of

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
replace your spring so that was kind of

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.410 
replace your spring so that was kind of
handy<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:22.530> do<00:02:22.770> like<00:02:23.100> them<00:02:23.340> for<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.640> look<00:02:23.910> you

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
worth it it's really smooth I did

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.620 
worth it it's really smooth I did
another<00:02:37.140> thing<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:37.980> noticed<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.730> at<00:02:39.270> first<00:02:39.450> they

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
another thing I noticed is at first they

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.570 
another thing I noticed is at first they
were<00:02:39.720> rubbing<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.980> was<00:02:41.130> they<00:02:41.430> weren't

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
were rubbing and it was they weren't

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
moving smooth they stuck and I found

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.140 
moving smooth they stuck and I found
that<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.070> must<00:02:44.370> not<00:02:44.520> have<00:02:44.670> pushed<00:02:44.910> him<00:02:45.030> down

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
that I must not have pushed him down

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.280 
that I must not have pushed him down
hard<00:02:45.360> enough<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:45.690> once<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:45.960> get<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.200> whole

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
hard enough so once you get the whole

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.320 
hard enough so once you get the whole
thing<00:02:46.500> put<00:02:46.620> together<00:02:46.740> if<00:02:47.190> it's<00:02:47.370> like<00:02:47.520> that<00:02:47.730> you

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
thing put together if it's like that you

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.590 
thing put together if it's like that you
just<00:02:48.510> mash<00:02:49.140> down<00:02:49.440> on<00:02:49.700> real<00:02:50.700> firmly<00:02:51.030> not<00:02:51.360> too

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
just mash down on real firmly not too

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.840 
just mash down on real firmly not too
hard<00:02:51.870> but<00:02:51.960> hard<00:02:52.410> enough<00:02:52.710> and<00:02:52.920> then<00:02:53.550> all<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.730> a

hard but hard enough and then all of a

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.190 
hard but hard enough and then all of a
sudden<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.540> was<00:02:54.660> night<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:54.960> day<00:02:55.110> difference

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
head but if I just move it around like

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.220 
head but if I just move it around like
that<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.940> can't<00:03:03.120> hear<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:03.780> they're<00:03:03.900> super

review these are a thumbs up these are

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.820 
review these are a thumbs up these are
kind<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.330> okay<00:03:30.750> they<00:03:30.989> they<00:03:31.380> have<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.620> cool

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
kind of a okay they they have the cool

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.229 
kind of a okay they they have the cool
factor<00:03:33.110> but<00:03:34.160> I<00:03:35.160> don't<00:03:35.790> know<00:03:35.880> if<00:03:35.970> they're<00:03:36.090> worth

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
factor but I don't know if they're worth

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.810 
factor but I don't know if they're worth
the<00:03:36.450> cost<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.620> lack<00:03:37.890> of<00:03:37.920> instructions<00:03:38.640> is

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
the cost and the lack of instructions is

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.800 
the cost and the lack of instructions is
horrible<00:03:40.580> so<00:03:41.580> they<00:03:41.880> just<00:03:42.120> came<00:03:42.239> out<00:03:42.360> though<00:03:42.570> so
