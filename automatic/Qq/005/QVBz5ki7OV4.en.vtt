all right so after you play these five

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.430 
all right so after you play these five
games<00:02:13.100> you'll<00:02:13.370> be<00:02:13.460> put<00:02:13.700> into<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:14.210> lead<00:02:14.750> based

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
games you'll be put into a lead based

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.040 
games you'll be put into a lead based
off<00:02:15.680> of<00:02:15.710> your<00:02:16.070> wins<00:02:16.340> versus<00:02:17.060> losses<00:02:17.510> or<00:02:17.810> your

off of your wins versus losses or your

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.150 
off of your wins versus losses or your
k/d<00:02:18.500> ratio<00:02:19.420> now<00:02:20.470> for<00:02:21.470> here<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.650> wasn't<00:02:21.980> placed

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
k/d ratio now for here I wasn't placed

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.250 
k/d ratio now for here I wasn't placed
so<00:02:22.460> I<00:02:22.490> haven't<00:02:22.730> really<00:02:22.910> done<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.720> because<00:02:23.870> this

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
so I haven't really done it because this

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.850 
so I haven't really done it because this
mode<00:02:24.980> is<00:02:25.010> dead<00:02:25.430> it's<00:02:26.500> okay<00:02:27.500> as<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.710> can<00:02:27.740> see

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
here it says 89 online but it takes

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.710 
here it says 89 online but it takes

I'm into subdivision python 45 now these

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.720 
I'm into subdivision python 45 now these
subdivisions<00:03:29.300> basically<00:03:30.290> there<00:03:30.580> you<00:03:31.580> have

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
subdivisions basically there you have

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.490 
subdivisions basically there you have
here<00:03:31.970> your<00:03:32.420> gold<00:03:32.660> division<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.350> have

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
here your gold division and you have

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.980 
here your gold division and you have
four<00:03:33.800> divisions<00:03:34.640> within<00:03:34.850> that<00:03:35.150> subdivisions

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
four divisions within that subdivisions

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.580 
four divisions within that subdivisions
now<00:03:36.500> I<00:03:36.860> don't<00:03:37.460> know<00:03:37.760> what<00:03:38.390> python<00:03:38.840> 45<00:03:39.290> is<00:03:39.500> I

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
now I don't know what python 45 is I

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.630 
now I don't know what python 45 is I
don't<00:03:39.650> know<00:03:39.770> if<00:03:39.890> it's<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.070> best<00:03:40.250> one<00:03:40.490> of<00:03:40.520> the

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
don't know if it's the best one of the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.160 
don't know if it's the best one of the
lowest

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
lowest

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.040 
lowest
but<00:03:41.920> anyway<00:03:42.250> if<00:03:42.970> as<00:03:43.209> you<00:03:43.240> progress<00:03:43.569> you<00:03:43.900> might

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
but anyway if as you progress you might

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.570 
but anyway if as you progress you might
get<00:03:44.200> put<00:03:44.319> into<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.530> different<00:03:44.860> subdivision<00:03:45.459> and

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
get put into a different subdivision and

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.760 
get put into a different subdivision and
then<00:03:45.970> ultimately<00:03:46.300> you'll<00:03:46.930> get<00:03:47.080> to<00:03:47.260> platinum

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
then ultimately you'll get to platinum

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.020 
then ultimately you'll get to platinum
division<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:49.450> play<00:03:50.230> that<00:03:50.440> so<00:03:51.430> basically<00:03:51.550> once

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
division and play that so basically once

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.350 
division and play that so basically once
you<00:03:52.209> get<00:03:52.330> your<00:03:52.480> your<00:03:53.349> rank<00:03:54.280> over<00:03:54.580> here<00:03:54.790> you'll

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
you get your your rank over here you'll

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.059 
you get your your rank over here you'll
be<00:03:55.450> only<00:03:55.780> be<00:03:55.959> playing<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.440> people<00:03:56.739> that<00:03:57.040> are

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
league system is flawed on PC because

not enough people play it ah so I'm kind
of<00:04:23.200> making<00:04:23.440> this<00:04:23.530> video<00:04:23.680> so<00:04:24.070> more<00:04:24.250> people<00:04:24.370> are

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
of making this video so more people are

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:25.890 
of making this video so more people are
aware<00:04:24.880> of<00:04:25.060> it<00:04:25.300> because<00:04:25.419> I<00:04:25.600> don't<00:04:25.750> know<00:04:25.810> if

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
aware of it because I don't know if

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.230

you're<00:04:26.020> not<00:04:26.220> but<00:04:27.220> it<00:04:27.550> would<00:04:27.639> be<00:04:27.760> awesome<00:04:27.940> to

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
you're not but it would be awesome to
