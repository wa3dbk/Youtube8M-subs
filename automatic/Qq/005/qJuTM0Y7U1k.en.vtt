00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:11.799 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:13.890 

how<00:00:12.339> would<00:00:12.400> you<00:00:12.580> feel<00:00:12.820> if<00:00:13.150> you<00:00:13.570> could<00:00:13.690> hold

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
how would you feel if you could hold

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.720 
how would you feel if you could hold
some<00:00:14.169> of<00:00:14.199> your<00:00:14.410> designs<00:00:14.679> in<00:00:14.860> your<00:00:14.980> hand<00:00:15.190> anyone

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
some of your designs in your hand anyone

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.140 
some of your designs in your hand anyone
like<00:00:15.910> that

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
like that

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.550 
like that
that's<00:00:16.390> impossible<00:00:16.900> as<00:00:17.020> well<00:00:17.230> that's

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
that's impossible as well that's

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.600 
that's impossible as well that's
assuming<00:00:17.949> as<00:00:18.070> possible

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610

I'm<00:00:20.090> not<00:00:20.270> a<00:00:20.300> designer<00:00:20.660> but<00:00:20.810> you<00:00:21.260> know<00:00:21.350> now<00:00:21.530> that

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
I'm not a designer but you know now that

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.990 
I'm not a designer but you know now that
I'm<00:00:21.800> seeing<00:00:22.100> the<00:00:22.190> possibilities<00:00:22.730> of<00:00:22.760> this

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
I'm seeing the possibilities of this

technology you start to see the world

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.019 
technology you start to see the world
differently<00:00:24.920> and<00:00:25.040> you<00:00:25.220> start<00:00:25.490> to<00:00:25.640> reimagine

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
differently and you start to reimagine

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.410 
differently and you start to reimagine

realize<00:00:57.250> how<00:00:57.550> much<00:00:57.730> I<00:00:58.030> was<00:00:58.300> restrained<00:00:58.750> by<00:00:59.140> a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
realize how much I was restrained by a

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.080 
realize how much I was restrained by a
lot<00:00:59.769> of<00:00:59.860> the<00:00:59.920> technologies<00:01:00.489> that<00:01:00.519> we<00:01:00.820> ran

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
lot of the technologies that we ran

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.020 
lot of the technologies that we ran
before<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.800> something<00:01:03.220> new<00:01:03.340> comes<00:01:03.670> to<00:01:03.910> this

have you made it
if<00:01:09.200> you<00:01:09.320> look<00:01:09.470> around<00:01:09.770> us<00:01:09.950> we<00:01:10.430> can<00:01:10.460> buy<00:01:11.000> any

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
if you look around us we can buy any

product we need to do whatever we want

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.780 
product we need to do whatever we want
what's<00:01:13.250> missing

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
what's missing

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.240 
what's missing
however<00:01:14.090> is<00:01:14.390> our<00:01:14.960> personal<00:01:15.470> input<00:01:15.860> into<00:01:16.130> those

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
however is our personal input into those

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.580 
however is our personal input into those
products

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.670 

we<00:01:20.130> have<00:01:20.340> an<00:01:20.460> idea<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.000> then<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.229> mail<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
we have an idea and then in the mail the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.130 
we have an idea and then in the mail the
idea<00:01:22.920> comes<00:01:23.280> sort<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:23.909> an<00:01:24.450> object<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.960> like

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
idea comes sort of as an object and like

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.710 
idea comes sort of as an object and like
that's<00:01:25.829> never<00:01:26.070> existed<00:01:26.579> before<00:01:26.700> as<00:01:27.270> a

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that's never existed before as a

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.380 
that's never existed before as a
designer<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.649> concentrate<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.390> making

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
designer you can concentrate on making

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.420 
designer you can concentrate on making
the<00:01:30.810> best<00:01:30.930> object<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.770> best<00:01:31.979> product<00:01:32.369> that

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the best object the best product that

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.310 
the best object the best product that
you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.329> shape<00:01:33.570> place<00:01:33.689> there's<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.079> list

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
you can the shape place there's a list

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.469 
you can the shape place there's a list
so<00:01:35.100> we<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.250> make<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.850> something<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.330> test

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
so we can make one of something and test

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.330 
so we can make one of something and test
it<00:01:36.600> out<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.899> all<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.679> doesn't<00:01:38.009> make<00:01:38.220> any

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
it out and all of this doesn't make any

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.499 
it out and all of this doesn't make any
difference<00:01:38.460> because<00:01:38.820> there's<00:01:38.970> no<00:01:39.090> tooling

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
difference because there's no tooling

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.270 
difference because there's no tooling
there's<00:01:39.780> no<00:01:39.899> holding<00:01:40.289> there's<00:01:40.590> no<00:01:40.920> investment

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
there's no holding there's no investment

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.919 
there's no holding there's no investment
for<00:01:41.490> designer<00:01:41.759> maintenance<00:01:42.659> how<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.840> can

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
for designer maintenance how you can

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.080 
for designer maintenance how you can
innovate<00:01:43.170> faster<00:01:43.470> there's<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.549> pretty<00:01:44.789> fit

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
innovate faster there's a pretty fit

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.010 
innovate faster there's a pretty fit
innovation

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
innovation

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.500 
innovation
this<00:01:47.590> gives<00:01:48.250> rise<00:01:48.369> to<00:01:48.549> a<00:01:48.759> whole<00:01:49.000> new

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
this gives rise to a whole new

this gives rise to a whole new
way<00:01:50.080> of<00:01:50.380> solving<00:01:50.650> problems

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
way of solving problems

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.970 
way of solving problems
it's<00:01:52.750> mine<00:01:53.020> willing<00:01:53.320> to<00:01:53.380> think<00:01:53.530> that<00:01:53.680> we<00:01:53.830> can

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
it's mine willing to think that we can

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.160 
it's mine willing to think that we can
build<00:01:54.160> something<00:01:54.460> today<00:01:55.180> that<00:01:55.690> was<00:01:55.900> literally

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
build something today that was literally

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.990 
build something today that was literally
impossible<00:01:56.730> yesterday

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
impossible yesterday

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.030 
impossible yesterday
Oh
