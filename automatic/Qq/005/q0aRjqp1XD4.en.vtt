00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.150
 very good kids and girls I am 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.500
 remember v2 and good then in this 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.480
 tutorial by calling it somehow 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.150
 well let's continue a little bit with the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.770
 rabonas is worth I teach a thing a bit 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.110
 curious that surely many of 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.690
 you do not know and it's to get a 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.680
 missing a free kick to get it out of rabona 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.600
 unfortunately this service 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.250
 Missing does not work with any player 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.190
 OK 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.410
 I have tried several with some 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.810
 how many for example does not work with 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.920
 messi vale does not work either with 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:58.230
 ribery does not work either with neymar not 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.750
 works with ronaldinho and good the only one 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.699
 with whom I get this serve 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.280
 of lack is with Christian ronaldo 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.979
 I do not know if any player another player for 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.110
 there will also have this feature 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.520
 but good to me only and exclusively 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.520
 I get with Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.120
 well let's make it good as 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.740
 normally usually do well let's go 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.880
 first to the field workouts I'm going to 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.260
 teach how to do it then let's 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.040
 put it a little bit in practice is worth 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.960
 the match training and then already 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.000
 Let's go I'll give you some examples 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.200
 how it's done in a normal game 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.280
 but good, what exactly is the same 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.890
 we go to the training camp and 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.590
 Here I will show you how this is done 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.320
 this free shot is worth rabona 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.259
 we are already here and only and exclusively 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.670
 from the right side do not try it 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.259
 from the left but it will come out 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.270
 good to try it if you want but it's going 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.789
 to come out good let's press the crosshead 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.520
 ok to throw a foul for example 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.530
 from here it's good to press the 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.599
 crosshead and you see 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.879
 let's take a foul and let's turn 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.590
 the joystick is worth what we are going to put 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:16.099
 totally to the left and with the 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.370
 joystick still we keep it going and 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.200
 You see nothing nothing loaded or less or 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.120
 a bar half bar or a 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.980
 I touch the lightest thing to the X that 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.079
 you can 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.910
 x square 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:33.660
 good the button that you have to center 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:37.080
 Okay and that piece of pass will come out 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.940
 for a free kick not good is 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.240
 moment at least that I do not know 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.270
 can shoot straight rabona to the lack 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.520
 direct to goal but good you can 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.319
 make that pass not 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.450
 let's see it again 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.790
 now good Christian ronaldo but with 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.920
 the shirt of portugal is that it's because 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.409
 I was testing other players and others 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.999
 and good at the end with Christian when 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:07.329
 see as takes the free kick 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:09.069
 rabona not at least is curious for 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.719
 that you see what is what I said 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.209
 before let's try it from this other 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:16.889
 from this other side it is worth from the 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:20.169
 left side and well you see that it gives 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:22.030
 it hits the outside of the foot that remains 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.410
 well I also do not say no but good 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.030
 no it is not the same no 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.970
 now let's put it a little on 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.980
 good practice you know press the button 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.390
 back good this already explains it 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.000
 previously 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.459
 to make this rehearsed play that 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.740
 I was doing good did not explain 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.750
 how it is because neither just nor 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.430
 nothing in clear is 25 minutes why I saw 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.430
 the lines is salseando a little but 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.770
 well and later maybe I'll do 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.890
 some for this type of rabona serve 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.020
 Well, as I said before, it's worth 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.990
 hirai shelios cic to the left with 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:02.100
 the maintained joystick you still play the 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:05.550
 center button and you're going to do that 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.100
 I took out the rabona, the only thing 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.260
 that only good I only I 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.180
 got with ronaldo Christian is worth not 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.459
 with none more than in previous 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.310
 games with ronaldinho also this time 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.049
 I tried it with him and no and he does not come out 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.310
 good and then we'll go to a 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.840
 match is worth a good foul 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.270
 logically a ronaldo Christian and 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.490
 I repeat the joystick again 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.030
 cast to the left is worth and what 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.680
 we keep and then a little tap on the button 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.230
 that you have to center is worth to the button 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.100
 in the center 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:42.110
 it does not matter if you have it automatically in 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.750
 manual semiautomatic manual does not matter 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.190
 what is going to be the same, the only thing is that is 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.310
 the penalty is that not because you can not 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.740
 do with any I have already said 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.810
 before he tried a few cracks 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.850
 world and players who have five 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.340
 stars and does not come up with any vale 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.110
 it has only left me with a Christian 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.680
 ronaldo I guess not the only 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.060
 It's worth it if someone knows someone else and what 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.790
 want to leave in the comments then 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.510
 so that the rest of the people who 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.670
 Follow the channel, then find out 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.220
 the same thing we do not find out I want to say 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.370
 with which other player can you draw 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.340
 of it this way so perfect but 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:26.150
 come on I've already said I've tried neymar 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.710
 ronaldinho messi and ribery good memory 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.680
 ribery 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.380
 Ronaldinho and Neymar have five 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.470
 stars like Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.780
 and good and messi has the same good 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.700
 they are not, but they are closer to 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.740
 qualities of Christian ronaldo also 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.259
 in ball control 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.289
 but even ball control and so on 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:50.750
 etcetera and good if not and it has not left me 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.270
 with messi also not good 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.340
 messi is left-handed and then from the 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.349
 left side does not come out clear should 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.120
 leaving with months should go out from 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:01.870
 the left side and not from the right 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.940
 not to be left-handed but 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.530
 with month and it does not work out then I do not know if 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.470
 there will be some other left-handed player with the 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:11.050
 that is here with which this is this 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.950
 kick of rabona kick of lack of rabona 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.650
 and well, the 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.930
 different well it's not that I have 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.080
 bothered a lot not done a couple of 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:25.680
 partidillos here with the real Madrid then 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.510
 to get this is these faults 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.900
 not these faults that I have managed to take 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:33.300
 from that side and good as you see the 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.300
 amago comes out then the play or what 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.950
 do yourselves and that's what your 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.260
 account of imagination that each 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:44.010
 each to create a rehearsed play 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.340
 and make this rabona serve effective and 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:49.010
 well then 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.800
 this is what there is this is what what 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:54.910
 I wanted to teach you today is worth that kick 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.520
 rabona lack of Christian ronaldo 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:00.440
 good and I repeat again one more time 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.500
 to finish how it's done 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.110
 the address of the lack you have to 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.700
 throw everything to the left side 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:10.040
 because the fault only works from the 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.720
 right side you have to throw everything towards 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.550
 the left side and leave the joystick 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.480
 you keep the joystick to the side 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:19.610
 left and you play softly what 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.590
 minimum that you can the button that you have 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.380
 what do you use to focus on? 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.510
 so I avoid saying that if x what if 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.510
 square that if I do not know that the button 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.400
 center is worth and nothing more good kids 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.650
 as always I leave you there are some things 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.030

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:41.210
