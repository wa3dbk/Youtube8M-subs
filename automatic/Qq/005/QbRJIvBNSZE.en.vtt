00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.580 
tanky and what it is is a tank top
that's<00:00:35.820> all<00:00:36.059> made<00:00:36.239> with<00:00:36.540> spandex<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.410> has

that's all made with spandex and it has

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.709 
that's all made with spandex and it has
a<00:00:37.620> bra<00:00:38.010> shelf<00:00:38.820> made<00:00:39.059> into<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:40.700> so<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.540> I

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
a bra shelf made into it so that is I

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.850 
a bra shelf made into it so that is I
think<00:00:43.050> nine<00:00:43.290> dollars<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.129> then<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:45.860> shorts

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
think nine dollars and then the shorts

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.860 
think nine dollars and then the shorts
that<00:00:47.100> are<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.730> spandex<00:00:48.059> shorts<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:48.719> they're

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that are like spandex shorts but they're

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.090 
that are like spandex shorts but they're
the<00:00:48.960> girdle<00:00:49.230> longline<00:00:50.010> shorts<00:00:51.770> well<00:00:52.770> they're
