quite a bit and this guy just wrecks
just<00:02:37.950> 20<00:02:38.459> p<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.319> that<00:02:40.319> is<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.560> very<00:02:40.890> useful

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
just 20 p and that is a very useful

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.220 
just 20 p and that is a very useful
guard<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.599> it<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:44.040> can<00:02:44.220> consider<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.790> as<00:02:45.090> a

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
guard I like it you can consider it as a

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.020 
guard I like it you can consider it as a
kind<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.590> replacement<00:02:47.310> for<00:02:47.959> are<00:02:49.819> all<00:02:50.819> set

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
kind of a replacement for are all set

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.750 
kind of a replacement for are all set
goals<00:02:51.269> I'm<00:02:51.780> straddle<00:02:52.200> yeah<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:53.129> think

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
goals I'm straddle yeah so I think

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.940 
goals I'm straddle yeah so I think
people<00:02:54.000> play<00:02:54.299> three<00:02:54.629> in<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.989> deck<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.530> this

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
people play three in the deck and this

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.970 
people play three in the deck and this
makes<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.549> deck<00:02:56.730> so<00:02:57.360> much<00:02:57.540> better<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.739> it's

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
makes the deck so much better and it's

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.140 
makes the deck so much better and it's
