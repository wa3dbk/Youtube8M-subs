grew in the period where the art market
had<00:04:53.419> collapsed<00:04:53.949> so<00:04:54.949> when<00:04:55.309> we<00:04:55.639> started<00:04:56.360> doing

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:56.959 
had collapsed so when we started doing

00:04:56.959 --> 00:05:00.189 
had collapsed so when we started doing
that<00:04:57.139> kind<00:04:57.499> of<00:04:57.709> work<00:04:58.360> we<00:04:59.360> had<00:04:59.539> sort<00:04:59.839> of<00:04:59.899> thrown

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
that kind of work we had sort of thrown

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.629 
that kind of work we had sort of thrown
out<00:05:00.409> the<00:05:00.619> notion<00:05:00.949> we<00:05:01.069> were<00:05:01.159> going<00:05:01.339> to<00:05:01.429> sell

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
out the notion we were going to sell

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.779 
out the notion we were going to sell
anything<00:05:02.049> and<00:05:03.049> we<00:05:03.229> thought<00:05:03.469> well<00:05:04.459> we<00:05:04.489> might<00:05:04.729> as

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
anything and we thought well we might as

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.609 
anything and we thought well we might as
well<00:05:04.999> do<00:05:05.269> what<00:05:05.449> we're<00:05:05.599> interested<00:05:05.869> in<00:05:06.259> let's

00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:06.619 
well do what we're interested in let's

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:09.719 
well do what we're interested in let's
try<00:05:06.949> and<00:05:07.099> tackle<00:05:07.309> it<00:05:07.549> how<00:05:08.269> do<00:05:08.329> we<00:05:08.599> do<00:05:08.779> it<00:05:08.809> and<00:05:09.169> we

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
try and tackle it how do we do it and we

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.889 
try and tackle it how do we do it and we
didn't<00:05:10.729> know<00:05:10.789> how<00:05:11.029> to<00:05:11.089> do<00:05:11.329> it<00:05:11.449> so<00:05:11.479> we<00:05:11.719> just

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:11.899 
didn't know how to do it so we just

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:14.799 
didn't know how to do it so we just
tried<00:05:12.199> different<00:05:12.499> things<00:05:13.329> now<00:05:14.329> the<00:05:14.389> strange

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:14.809 
tried different things now the strange

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:17.259 
tried different things now the strange
thing<00:05:15.079> about<00:05:15.199> that<00:05:15.679> was<00:05:16.189> that<00:05:16.249> he'd<00:05:16.639> opened<00:05:17.089> up

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:17.269 
thing about that was that he'd opened up

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:20.949 
thing about that was that he'd opened up
a<00:05:17.509> whole<00:05:17.779> way<00:05:18.589> of<00:05:18.619> working<00:05:19.249> from<00:05:20.179> performance

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:20.959 
a whole way of working from performance

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:24.789 
a whole way of working from performance
to<00:05:22.149> two<00:05:23.149> different<00:05:23.629> kinds<00:05:24.110> of<00:05:24.229> media<00:05:24.379> and

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:24.799 
to two different kinds of media and

00:05:24.799 --> 00:05:26.919 
to two different kinds of media and
because<00:05:25.669> we<00:05:25.789> were<00:05:25.879> trying<00:05:26.119> to<00:05:26.209> find<00:05:26.389> out<00:05:26.659> well

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:26.929 
because we were trying to find out well

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:28.989 
because we were trying to find out well
how<00:05:27.049> do<00:05:27.110> we<00:05:27.289> tackle<00:05:27.499> subject<00:05:28.129> matter<00:05:28.309> because

00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:28.999 
how do we tackle subject matter because

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:30.549 
how do we tackle subject matter because
that's<00:05:29.179> the<00:05:29.360> heart<00:05:29.569> of<00:05:29.749> what<00:05:29.929> we<00:05:29.959> want<00:05:30.259> to<00:05:30.409> do

00:05:30.549 --> 00:05:30.559 
that's the heart of what we want to do

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:33.159 
that's the heart of what we want to do
rather<00:05:31.279> than<00:05:31.399> style<00:05:31.909> we<00:05:32.569> were<00:05:32.659> reacting

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
rather than style we were reacting

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:38.169 
rather than style we were reacting
against<00:05:33.589> previous<00:05:34.399> styles<00:05:36.009> now<00:05:37.009> when<00:05:37.489> I<00:05:37.729> think

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:38.179 
against previous styles now when I think

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:40.389 
against previous styles now when I think
when<00:05:38.479> the<00:05:38.629> market<00:05:39.050> started<00:05:39.529> to<00:05:39.679> grow<00:05:39.919> quite

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:40.399 
when the market started to grow quite

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:45.040 
when the market started to grow quite
rapidly<00:05:42.279> those<00:05:43.279> younger<00:05:43.939> artists<00:05:44.539> picked<00:05:44.839> up

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
rapidly those younger artists picked up

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.549 
rapidly those younger artists picked up
on<00:05:45.319> some<00:05:45.559> of<00:05:45.589> those<00:05:45.769> ideas<00:05:46.039> on<00:05:46.839> now<00:05:47.839> particular

00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:48.559 
on some of those ideas on now particular

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:50.949 
on some of those ideas on now particular
tracy<00:05:49.009> i<00:05:49.369> think<00:05:49.759> was<00:05:50.059> influenced<00:05:50.599> by<00:05:50.629> a<00:05:50.749> woman

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:50.959 
tracy i think was influenced by a woman

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:55.809 
tracy i think was influenced by a woman

influenced by that but it was never
acknowledged<00:06:07.969> and<00:06:08.179> it<00:06:08.299> came<00:06:08.479> at<00:06:08.689> a<00:06:08.719> moment

00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:09.439 
acknowledged and it came at a moment

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:12.549 
acknowledged and it came at a moment
