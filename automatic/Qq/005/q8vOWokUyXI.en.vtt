Outfitters so we're just cutting off all
the<00:03:59.019> edges<00:03:59.170> so<00:03:59.560> that<00:03:59.590> it<00:03:59.980> fits<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:00.670> little<00:04:00.880> bit

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
the edges so that it fits a little bit

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.460 
the edges so that it fits a little bit
better<00:04:01.150> onto<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:01.959> front<00:04:02.080> of<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.290> notebook

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
and contact paper is really sticky on

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.570 
and contact paper is really sticky on
the<00:04:05.140> back<00:04:05.260> so<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.709> can<00:04:05.830> just<00:04:05.980> peel<00:04:06.220> this<00:04:06.370> off

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
the back so you can just peel this off

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.210

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
and place it down and it is a little bit

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.400 
and place it down and it is a little bit
tricky<00:04:09.580> to<00:04:09.760> knock<00:04:09.910> at<00:04:10.090> any<00:04:10.360> air<00:04:10.569> bubbles<00:04:10.959> so<00:04:11.200> be
