00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
oh my gosh I thought it yeah so

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.000 
oh my gosh I thought it yeah so
basically<00:00:45.690> what<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.320> did<00:00:46.410> was<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:48.770> went<00:00:49.770> back

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
basically what I did was I went back

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.130 
basically what I did was I went back
here<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.550> covered<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.480> whole<00:00:51.510> thing<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.020> that

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
here I covered the whole thing in that

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.090 
here I covered the whole thing in that
and<00:00:52.379> then<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.530> put<00:00:52.890> from<00:00:53.579> two<00:00:53.879> blocks<00:00:54.030> out<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:55.100> I

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
and then I put from two blocks out I I

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.840 
and then I put from two blocks out I I
sealed<00:00:57.030> off<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.449> little<00:00:57.780> area<00:00:57.989> right<00:00:58.140> here

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
sealed off this little area right here

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.430 
sealed off this little area right here
mainly<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.390> they<00:01:00.780> wouldn't<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.170> stuck

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
mainly so that they wouldn't get stuck

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.729 
mainly so that they wouldn't get stuck
behind<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.960> get<00:01:03.960> trapped<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.530> then

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
behind here and get trapped and then

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.580 
behind here and get trapped and then
because<00:01:05.519> from<00:01:05.760> back<00:01:05.970> here<00:01:06.330> they<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.170> see<00:01:07.409> your

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
because from back here they can see your

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.649 
because from back here they can see your
face<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.070> if<00:01:08.220> they<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.549> see<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.790> then

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
face and if they can see you then

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.980 
face and if they can see you then
they'll<00:01:10.049> attack<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.540> lot

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990
