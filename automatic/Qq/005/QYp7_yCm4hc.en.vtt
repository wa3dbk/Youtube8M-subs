00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.390 
block size we hit store and above block
it<00:01:25.790> says<00:01:26.030> block<00:01:26.840> size<00:01:27.110> so<00:01:27.409> we've<00:01:27.590> now<00:01:27.770> stored

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
it says block size so we've now stored

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.550 
it says block size so we've now stored
it<00:01:28.520> as<00:01:28.610> 32<00:01:29.030> square<00:01:29.270> inches<00:01:29.540> so<00:01:30.080> now<00:01:30.260> when<00:01:30.470> we

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
it as 32 square inches so now when we

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.680 
it as 32 square inches so now when we
have<00:01:30.680> a<00:01:30.740> hundred<00:01:31.100> square<00:01:31.280> foot<00:01:31.430> patio<00:01:31.700> 100
