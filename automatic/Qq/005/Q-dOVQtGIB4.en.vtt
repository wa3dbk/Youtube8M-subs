00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.170
 good afternoon today we decided to take off 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.540
 continued production of jig heads 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.280
 Now we will make a video about how we 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:20.010
 pouring collapsible cheburashki he is such a kind 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:24.570
 opens from our window this is the Dnieper in 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.080
 which fish today we decided from casting 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.439
 jig heads 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.800
 collapsible so-called cheburashki such 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.590
 we have forms 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.450
 two forms 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.200
 here they are a little bit others are present 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:52.110
 such a shutter keel captain 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:56.820
 for the air here are these molds now 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:02.989
 take off a little hope cognitive 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.989
 video how it all happens 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:35.490
 scored lead open turns here 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.490
 such garlands 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:55.980
 slightly different technology than with 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:02.730
 corkscrew these seems to me a little 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:06.230
 complicated on but uncomfortable on the miracle there is and 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.230
 convenience of trial you plate 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.500
 such are obtained 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.960
 product what we do next with us 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.130
 obtain such blanks are some 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.960
 we have already done 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:38.420
 Well, a little bit just show how we are 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:44.870
 we understand it is done what we do it 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:51.910
 for the first time in principle we fold it like this 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.910
 here is and boom 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:26.680
 it turns out such a bracket that we 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:29.129
 insert itself directly here 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.129
 sinker 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.680
 It turns out such a thing 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.530
 So 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.590
 on the internet we saw a video where guys 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:02.830
 their cheburashka checked and 16 pounds 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:06.569
 but we are interested in how to sustain themselves or 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:10.120
 unbend this all connections 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:13.690
 I want to try too, but here it is 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:17.130
 we all know cellophane bags in 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:21.840
 him how many 4 bricks 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:29.100
 33 devils all but sums apparently about 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.100
 comes off the floor before the war war what 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:42.669
 happens rose surprise develops 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.090
 ok this friction is adjusted 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:52.810
 there we hardly need so much in statics 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:56.160
 need a little bit in principle 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.160
 test passed
