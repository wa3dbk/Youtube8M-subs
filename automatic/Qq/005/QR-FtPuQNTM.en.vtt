00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
seemed to me that for the rest of the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.780 
seemed to me that for the rest of the
fight<00:02:19.010> there<00:02:19.610> was<00:02:19.850> more<00:02:20.180> or<00:02:20.330> less<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:21.100> draw<00:02:22.100> so

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.460 
fight there was more or less a draw so
it<00:02:22.940> seemed<00:02:23.270> to<00:02:23.510> me

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
it seemed to me

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.730 
it seemed to me
the<00:02:24.830> performance<00:02:25.550> that<00:02:25.640> manny<00:02:26.030> pacquiao<00:02:26.740> had

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
the performance that manny pacquiao had

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.830 
the performance that manny pacquiao had
put<00:02:28.040> in<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.250> first<00:02:28.490> six<00:02:28.910> rounds<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:29.570> mean<00:02:29.750> he

dominated<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.980> fight<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.970> seemed<00:02:32.270> to<00:02:32.420> me<00:02:32.600> that

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
dominated the fight it seemed to me that

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.590 
dominated the fight it seemed to me that
it<00:02:32.960> would<00:02:33.080> make<00:02:33.320> manny<00:02:33.650> pacquiao<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:35.030> victim

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600
