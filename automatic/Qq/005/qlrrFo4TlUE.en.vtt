00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.170
 Hello 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.770
 from Madrid 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.010

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.010
 of the majorero cheese 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.900
 of oil 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.080
 then we put him monero 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.400
 3 ok I think inside what we do 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.959
 is close many and to be able to do that 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.170
 that I'm singing from the movies with 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.170
 all 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.239
 and point 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.470
 up an iron we give you a little 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.019
 of heat is only a little patient not 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.700
 I'm warm but if I as an agent and 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.650
 ready we have a little bit of pastrami 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.400
 grams 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.230
 spectacular I'm going to cut the funds 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.590
 stolen 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.740
 the past 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.740
 at your service 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.740
 all right 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.380
 yes 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.860
 as you have already pointed to this 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.300
 solidarity initiative because it is a 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:38.080
 privilege because you can not say that one 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:40.750
 can not because you think I'll see everything 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.810
 I'm riding this story for him 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.440
 is missing and I would like so 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.440
 unless you can 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.120
 this because in the end sincerely for 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.540
 our over force 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.540
 cooking what I like and I'm passionate 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:11.060
 I feel absolutely and will not be 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.060
 worst 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.830
 it is important that in addition to these 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.510
 hard times that help is valued more 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.220
 that everything is going wrong 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.430
 conversing we dedicate a little bit of what 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.430
 our 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:26.759
 for everyone we always count 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.289
 aesthetically rewarding and this morning 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.289
 lifts me up for the joy of the body 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:42.000
 and especially the result that can 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:46.310
 have what a fantastic occasion 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.310
 of power that Colombia can enjoy 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:55.870
 but if someone thinks that the 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.669
 people can serve so that someone from 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.190
 truly benefit what you are doing 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.900
 much much missing then I can not 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.190
 less than thanking as they have 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.190
 baptized your sandwich for 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.729
 right now 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:14.279
 of pastrami a majorero cheese 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.580
 and so that it is to give a name a man 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:16.580
 solidary 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:30.419
 the illusion is good
