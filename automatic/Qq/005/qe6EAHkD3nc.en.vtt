these<00:02:03.040> fiber<00:02:03.399> plates<00:02:03.729> well<00:02:04.570> then<00:02:05.079> we<00:02:05.170> got<00:02:05.350> to

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
these fiber plates well then we got to

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.669 
these fiber plates well then we got to
the<00:02:05.590> then<00:02:06.490> we<00:02:06.549> got<00:02:06.729> to<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.000> steel<00:02:07.299> plates<00:02:07.679> the

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
the then we got to the steel plates the

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.410 
the then we got to the steel plates the
the<00:02:08.950> first<00:02:09.190> rule<00:02:09.459> with<00:02:09.580> them<00:02:09.789> is<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.179> stack

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
the first rule with them is you stack

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.170 
the first rule with them is you stack
all<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.810> steel<00:02:11.020> plates<00:02:11.319> up<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:11.860> sort<00:02:12.550> of<00:02:12.700> hold

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
all the steel plates up and sort of hold

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.699 
all the steel plates up and sort of hold
them<00:02:13.300> up<00:02:13.450> against<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.780> light<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.290> see<00:02:14.319> if<00:02:14.530> any

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
them up against the light to see if any

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.589 
them up against the light to see if any
of<00:02:14.890> them<00:02:15.099> are<00:02:15.220> really<00:02:15.250> warped<00:02:15.940> nothing

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
of them are really warped nothing

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.650 
of them are really warped nothing
nothing<00:02:17.080> went<00:02:17.260> bad<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:18.069> so<00:02:18.849> what<00:02:19.060> we<00:02:19.269> do<00:02:19.420> then

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
nothing went bad so so what we do then

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.470 
nothing went bad so so what we do then
is<00:02:19.720> really<00:02:20.709> get<00:02:21.069> into<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.400> detail<00:02:21.880> work<00:02:22.150> well

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
is really get into the detail work well

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.509 
is really get into the detail work well
I<00:02:23.700> pulled<00:02:24.700> out<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:25.000> inner<00:02:25.150> basket<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.680> you

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
I pulled out the inner basket and you

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.580 
I pulled out the inner basket and you
know<00:02:27.640> all<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.150> steel<00:02:28.390> plates<00:02:28.720> should

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
know all of the steel plates should

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.430 
know all of the steel plates should
slide<00:02:30.010> over<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.549> inner<00:02:30.700> hub<00:02:31.000> nice<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.230> free

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
slide over the inner hub nice and free

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.530 
slide over the inner hub nice and free
there<00:02:33.130> really<00:02:33.310> shouldn't<00:02:33.670> be<00:02:33.819> any<00:02:33.910> there

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
there really shouldn't be any there

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.600 
there really shouldn't be any there
really<00:02:34.690> shouldn't<00:02:34.959> be<00:02:35.110> any<00:02:35.170> resistance<00:02:35.890> when

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
really shouldn't be any resistance when

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.330 
really shouldn't be any resistance when
you<00:02:36.730> when<00:02:36.940> they<00:02:37.060> slide<00:02:37.269> back<00:02:37.569> and<00:02:37.750> forth<00:02:37.860> we<00:02:38.860> we

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
you when they slide back and forth we we

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.910 
you when they slide back and forth we we
always<00:02:39.640> run<00:02:39.940> our<00:02:40.150> run<00:02:40.810> your<00:02:40.959> thumbnail<00:02:41.410> across

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
always run our run your thumbnail across

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.490 
always run our run your thumbnail across
the<00:02:42.310> cross<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.540> hub<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.750> make<00:02:44.049> sure<00:02:44.260> there

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
the cross the hub to make sure there

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.589 
the cross the hub to make sure there
aren't<00:02:44.650> any<00:02:44.799> notches<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.880> know<00:02:45.970> this<00:02:46.209> is<00:02:46.420> the

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
aren't any notches you know this is the

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.570 
aren't any notches you know this is the
this<00:02:47.319> bikes<00:02:47.560> been<00:02:47.709> down<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:47.980> track<00:02:48.190> plenty

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
this bikes been down the track plenty

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.580 
this bikes been down the track plenty
and<00:02:49.330> we<00:02:49.540> replace<00:02:49.870> our<00:02:50.049> hubs<00:02:50.319> pretty

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
and we replace our hubs pretty

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.860 
and we replace our hubs pretty
frequently<00:02:51.130> so<00:02:51.340> they<00:02:52.000> should<00:02:52.209> all<00:02:52.330> slide<00:02:52.630> well

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
frequently so they should all slide well

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.979 
frequently so they should all slide well
well<00:02:53.530> what<00:02:53.890> happened<00:02:54.370> was<00:02:54.549> as<00:02:55.150> soon<00:02:55.450> as<00:02:55.630> I<00:02:55.750> got

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
well what happened was as soon as I got

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.830 
well what happened was as soon as I got
to<00:02:56.019> some<00:02:56.440> of<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.620> plates<00:02:57.269> we<00:02:58.269> started<00:02:58.690> running

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
to some of the plates we started running

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.599 
to some of the plates we started running
into<00:02:59.260> some<00:02:59.440> issues<00:02:59.590> and<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.070> can<00:03:00.250> see<00:03:00.430> this

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
into some issues and you can see this

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.160 
into some issues and you can see this
one<00:03:00.820> that's<00:03:01.299> what<00:03:01.420> we<00:03:01.570> don't<00:03:01.660> want<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.959> go<00:03:02.019> on

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
one that's what we don't want to go on

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.569 
one that's what we don't want to go on
even<00:03:02.560> even<00:03:02.859> though<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.100> didn't<00:03:03.340> look<00:03:03.519> too

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
even even though it didn't look too

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.349 
even even though it didn't look too
severely<00:03:04.420> warped<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:06.220> doesn't<00:03:06.850> want<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.120> slide

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
severely warped it doesn't want to slide

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.150 
severely warped it doesn't want to slide
well<00:03:07.600> so<00:03:08.170> even<00:03:08.560> even<00:03:08.769> my<00:03:09.190> light<00:03:09.549> test<00:03:10.950> holy<00:03:11.950> cow

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
well so even even my light test holy cow

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.940 
well so even even my light test holy cow
you<00:03:12.579> can<00:03:12.760> see<00:03:12.910> this<00:03:13.049> this<00:03:14.049> one<00:03:14.230> here<00:03:14.440> just<00:03:14.470> it

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
you can see this this one here just it

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.809 
you can see this this one here just it
doesn't<00:03:15.250> want<00:03:15.519> to<00:03:15.579> play

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
doesn't want to play

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.220 
doesn't want to play
and<00:03:16.120> there<00:03:16.989> were<00:03:18.450> there's<00:03:19.450> there's<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.930> couple

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
and there were there's there's a couple

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.099 
and there were there's there's a couple
of<00:03:20.410> others<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:21.870> are<00:03:22.870> quite<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.590> bad<00:03:25.109> but

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
of others that are quite that bad but

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.509 
of others that are quite that bad but
they<00:03:26.290> were<00:03:26.350> they're<00:03:26.739> still<00:03:27.069> they're<00:03:27.489> still

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
they were they're still they're still

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.309 
they were they're still they're still
nachi<00:03:28.030> they<00:03:28.510> don't<00:03:28.720> they<00:03:28.959> don't<00:03:28.989> want<00:03:29.260> to

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
nachi they don't they don't want to

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:36.270 
nachi they don't they don't want to
slide<00:03:30.150> well<00:03:31.150> what<00:03:31.329> happens<00:03:31.780> there<00:03:32.139> is<00:03:35.280> when

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
slide well what happens there is when

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.140 
slide well what happens there is when
you<00:03:37.410> win<00:03:38.410> that<00:03:38.650> when<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.489> pressure<00:03:39.760> plate

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
you win that when the pressure plate

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.599 
you win that when the pressure plate
goes<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.750> compress<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.440> entire<00:03:41.829> clutch<00:03:42.250> and

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
goes to compress the entire clutch and

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.620 
goes to compress the entire clutch and
those<00:03:43.389> fields<00:03:44.079> don't<00:03:44.350> float<00:03:44.859> correctly<00:03:45.630> it's

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
those fields don't float correctly it's

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.629 
those fields don't float correctly it's
pressing<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.350> clutch<00:03:47.590> but<00:03:48.100> it<00:03:48.250> may<00:03:48.400> not<00:03:48.430> be

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
pressing the clutch but it may not be

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.849 
pressing the clutch but it may not be
compressing<00:03:49.480> in<00:03:49.600> entirely<00:03:49.989> now<00:03:50.530> if<00:03:50.650> one<00:03:50.829> of

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
compressing in entirely now if one of

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.759 
compressing in entirely now if one of
those<00:03:51.040> Steel's<00:03:51.430> gets<00:03:51.790> warped<00:03:52.239> and<00:03:53.109> just<00:03:53.530> hold

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
those Steel's gets warped and just hold

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.190 
those Steel's gets warped and just hold
slide<00:03:54.100> you'll<00:03:54.970> only<00:03:55.150> compress<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.930> clutch

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
slide you'll only compress the clutch

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.289 
slide you'll only compress the clutch
from<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.709> wart<00:03:57.010> steel<00:03:57.400> out<00:03:57.670> to<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.030> pressure

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
from that wart steel out to the pressure

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.800 
from that wart steel out to the pressure
plate<00:03:58.630> and

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
plate and

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.090 
plate and
and<00:03:59.900> sometimes<00:04:00.350> it<00:04:00.560> will<00:04:00.650> leave<00:04:00.860> the<00:04:01.069> other

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
and sometimes it will leave the other

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.820 
and sometimes it will leave the other
other<00:04:01.760> fibers<00:04:02.300> will<00:04:02.450> be<00:04:02.540> fine<00:04:02.750> sometimes<00:04:03.440> it

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
other fibers will be fine sometimes it
