next<00:03:26.800> one<00:03:26.920> up<00:03:27.040> is<00:03:27.130> a<00:03:27.190> pump<00:03:27.490> shotgun<00:03:27.520> this

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
next one up is a pump shotgun this

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.360 
next one up is a pump shotgun this
happens<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:28.990> be<00:03:29.020> a<00:03:31.020> Remington<00:03:32.020> 870<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.680> 410

happens to be a Remington 870 and 410

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.910 
happens to be a Remington 870 and 410
gauge<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:34.180> smallest<00:03:34.480> gauge<00:03:36.180> suitable<00:03:37.180> for

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
small game also suitable for shooting at

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.630 
small game also suitable for shooting at

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
at clay birds as well at very close

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.840 
at clay birds as well at very close
ranges<00:03:49.090> on<00:03:49.450> say<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:50.130> sporting<00:03:51.130> clays<00:03:51.340> or<00:03:51.610> skeet

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
ranges on say a sporting clays or skeet

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.280 
ranges on say a sporting clays or skeet
field<00:03:53.520> so<00:03:54.520> this<00:03:55.210> as<00:03:55.450> you<00:03:55.570> can<00:03:55.810> see<00:03:55.990> with<00:03:56.200> the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
field so this as you can see with the

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.980 
field so this as you can see with the
pump<00:03:56.530> operation<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:58.180> action<00:03:58.540> bar<00:03:58.720> comes

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
pump operation the the action bar comes

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.510 
pump operation the the action bar comes
back<00:04:00.750> spent<00:04:01.750> shells<00:04:02.080> ejects<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:02.770> ejected<00:04:03.340> in<00:04:03.490> a

back spent shells ejects it ejected in a
new<00:04:03.670> shell<00:04:04.590> is<00:04:05.590> charged<00:04:06.400> with<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:07.240> handle<00:04:07.630> so

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
new shell is charged with the handle so

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.940 
new shell is charged with the handle so
that's<00:04:08.890> that's<00:04:09.280> how<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:09.640> operates<00:04:10.090> in<00:04:10.240> essence

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
that's that's how it operates in essence

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.380 
that's that's how it operates in essence
the<00:04:11.950> type<00:04:12.160> of<00:04:12.340> shotgun<00:04:12.580> that<00:04:12.970> will<00:04:13.090> be<00:04:13.180> right

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
the type of shotgun that will be right

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.740 
the type of shotgun that will be right
for<00:04:13.420> you<00:04:14.790> will<00:04:15.790> depend<00:04:15.940> a<00:04:16.180> lot<00:04:16.330> on<00:04:16.390> what<00:04:16.540> you
