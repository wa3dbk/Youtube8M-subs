 direction brisbane in australia peter mc 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.920
 alister anthropologist concentrates his 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.210
 studies on how man has 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.400
 physically evolved since the 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.780
 prehistory 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.370
 the main difference between 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.830
 exercises practiced by men 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.610
 prehistoric and modern men 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.180
 is that prehistoric men 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.410
 work and their bodies in their entirety 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.240
 today we work groups 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.640
 of specific muscles with 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.080
 specific exercises the men and the 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.300
 prehistoric women develop their 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.190
 overall muscular strength simply thanks 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.640
 to the physical activity necessary the life 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.640
 daily 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.730
 to work the body in its entirety 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.270
 that's what roanne is proposing 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.700
 the body in its courses here no abs 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.950
 glutes nor pump each exercise 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.720
 mobilizes the body in its entirety 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.770
 and we learn how to chain the movements 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.770
 rather than dissociating them 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.000
 and it's not always obvious even 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.000
 for the most muscular 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.030
 we can have tastes from groups of 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.829
 big biscotos and not being able to 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.409
 move his body in a useful way to be 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.759
 very steep lack of balanced missed out 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.770
 joint mobility 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.170
 I saw a lot of people coming 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.229
 of a so-called classic fitness says 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.759
 conventional muscle building 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:21.320
 general things like that being unable 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:23.090
 to climb to the top of a bar that's for sure 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.580
 that if prehistoric men come up 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.920
 to the trees with the velocity of roanne he 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.409
 had to be in good physical condition 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.700
 but by the way, what do we know 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.440
 peter mc allister to compare the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.890
 performances of prehistoric men to 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.090
 that of our current champions the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.729
 men and women prehistoric us 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.920
 would have beaten systematically I did 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.110
 a fascinating calculation that shows that a 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.490
 Neanderthal woman would have beaten arnold 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.789
 schwazenegger at the arm wrestling 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.590
 he was really very strong and that's the 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.390
 same thing for the race we have 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.000
 the example of Australian runners from 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.560
 the ice age at mango lake thanks to 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.899
 footprints we know that one of the individuals 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.829
 run faster than bolt 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:06.049
 our world champion difficult to 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.560
 believe and yet to come to this 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.479
 conclusion 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.480
 the anthropologist was based on facts 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.400
 very real on he jumps franÃ§oise of 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.170
 fossilized footprints have been 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.049
 found at mango lake in australia in 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.840
 2003 these footprints revealed that a 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.519
 individual we call t8 a homo 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.940
 sapiens who lived twenty thousand years ago 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.680
 was able to run about 37 km 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.290
 hour archaeologists were able to calculate 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.540
 this speed by measuring the length of 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.019
 its strides as we know what 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.760
 is its size 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.410
 we were able to calculate the speed at 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.000
 which he ran to make 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.800
 Footprints so far apart from each other 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.080
 other 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.690
 the homo sapiens of twenty thousand years ago 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.690
 could run up to 37 km 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.200
 in comparison the peak speed of the cndd 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.930
 bolt is 44 km hour only seven 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.090
 kilometers more hour but why 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.970
 peter mc allister claims he then 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.470
 that anus bolt would be defeated all 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.710
 simply because he took into account 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.630
 factors external to the race t8 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.220
 was running on mud gold no matter 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.510
 what person running on a floor 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.430
 furniture loses about 30% of its energy 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.050
 if we could have run t8 on 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.120
 an Olympic track with the same 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.920
 shoes cusems bolt I calculated 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.880
 that he would have been able to run a 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.560
 speed of 48 kilometers hour some 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.360
 prehistoric men could have been 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.170
 to be as good as our champions 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.170
 of the current world
