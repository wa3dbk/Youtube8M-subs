 of his mediumship for a long time 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.740
 it was difficult to distinguish spirits 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.020
 incarnated because they appeared 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.970
 exactly how I see you 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.400
 in the case of unhappy appearance spirits 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.110
 bestial monstrous appearance and what 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.690
 I was in favor because they were there 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.690
 almost physically apparent right 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:15.130
 but they are merchants they are florists 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.620
 even the two work with flowers is the

 east of sÃ£o paulo and goods or medium since 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.680
 I was born and had the privilege I imagine 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.450
 to be born into a spirit family I 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.030
 I started my spiritual walk there 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.440
 on the house perseverance a on the east side 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.090
 are also one of the largest centers 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.470
 Spiritists of the world there with Dona Guiomar 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.119
 disciple of the boy and from an early age 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.580
 very mediumistic manifestations began. 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.900
 intense distinct light in me will 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.909
 to say that hollywood should be inspired 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.310
 very spiritually to put 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.409
 their monsters on the screen or maybe they 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.130
 in the tuning of these creatures and 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.130
 put there 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.960
 noises scares transformations of those 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.310
 spirits on monsters that I 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.659
 eventually scaring me 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.690
 It's an episode that I remember very well. 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.870
 even in the book that wrote the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.090
 The first book I wrote is I Watched 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.680
 the movie here movie of the combro mummy 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.930
 He did not even a super silly movie 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.240
 Very cool adventure but the observers 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.580
 They are delighted that and became 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.200
 those women for months and I 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.550
 I knew they were not very mummies. 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.410
 that they have become what I 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.330
 it scared but it was still terrible 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:39.550
 see a lot of them in my room 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:41.410
 screaming and scratching me I'll say 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.209
 that the spirits who give me the most are 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.260
 but I was not afraid of those 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:56.019
 that came with teeth and 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:58.690
 this animalistic appearance of the most 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.600
 I was afraid they were those with a 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.959
 almost angelic appearance but a 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.489
 clothing that is seen that was not there they 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.780
 do not use so much stereotype when 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.820
 people think then some had 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.600
 very good appearance the light and 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.790
 everything but you noticed the look of them one 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.220
 malice malice a will 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.160
 intentional to cause any malaise 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.170
 and it made you afraid to think there is a 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.530
 physical incarnation 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.680
 disembodied non-physical physical being 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.459
 intentionally devotes himself to harming 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.070
 Someone is too scary and too censorious . 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.930
 I passed evil and graveyard via spirits 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.640
 of people many footprints still body 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.400
 wanting to stay there for 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.780
 buried 10 the despair in account a 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.360
 That's the beginning of my new story. 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.220
 The book that will be released soon is 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.190
 a car accident in which the spirit 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.989
 disembodied jumped into the 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.090
 My father's fiorino and my love to you 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.870
 I was there behind me brothers and I suddenly 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.739
 I felt a chill and then when I look at 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.350

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.150

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.769
 Young man I did not even tell my parents looks 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.580

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.470

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.880

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.230

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.269

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.830
