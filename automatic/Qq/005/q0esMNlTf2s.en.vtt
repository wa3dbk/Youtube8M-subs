00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:16.680
 good afternoon fishing brotherhood this 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.480
 issued a clip about a tackle pin and in 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.150
 comments people ask in more detail 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.060
 tell you about it, I 'll show you now 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.090
 As we clear down will not make 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.039
 just try to show you closer 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.099
 understood and then I'm still the second option 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.010
 more simple that is like without 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.690
 problems for people who can not be there 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.690
 shelf bend or what is 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:54.270
 let's start by ourselves 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:58.170
 so say the end here is the sinker tying 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.960
 so it the line well, I suppose I lace 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.529
 already over the forest when he refused everything on 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.920
 put this line and 

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:10.859
 cambric here I have such a silicone but 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.409
 it's not fundamentally able and pvc cool 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:15.509
 insulation with electrical wires here 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.999
 such a piece of cambric on it 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.670
 stick and goes on the thong 

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:23.779
 is tied 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:29.039
 in wire five 

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:31.439
 the loop is always that we toffee 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:35.069
 tied and immediately tied to it 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.219
 hook leash here goes on 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:42.329
 The wire here is doing a twist 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:45.810
 it turns out the second loop and the remaining 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.919
 a piece of shelf then a little bit longer 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.369
 here is this little ring 

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:51.569
 comes out there is a pin here 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.239
 us too 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:02:00.389
 back with plastic and snap it 

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:02.609
 squeezed ishop bread snap pin 

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:08.849
 this cambric just put on finally 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:09.880
 procrastination left here these then travels by whom 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:19.630
 kit 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:22.630
 we put it on here this way 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.970
 it turns out the pin is closed 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.380
 the advantage of such a wire that took 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:35.180
 on 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:37.580
 case calls on skype so case 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.240
 hitch some otvetochka get here 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.710
 she just throw it in the cambric and 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.280
 break free 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.380
 this pin so now i'm now 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.730
 I'll tell you how to make it easier to not 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.430
 arch these passages are not 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:03:01.880
 bother just take go in 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:06.140
 the store is just an ordinary store where ray 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:10.010
 called where they sell thread and needles 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.380
 and pins and buy come up and 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.200
 girl flies as I understand what you have 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.790
 the pin is the largest here and it is for you 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.580
 show that he has such 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.850
 pins in principle 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.340
 notion of what they are made of 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.430
 you can write there and not use i don't 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.120
 I know how it used to be there in the 70s 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.730
 happy years 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.120
 It was a honor to find such a pin 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.160
 the bigger ones there pin up your jeans 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.890
 Well, in short, no, not in this case buy 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.500
 just such a pin they're different there 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.350
 smaller in size and attacking bigger took 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.620
 once i'm basically where does the tackle 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:52.540
 I wanted to do on such a dead fish 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:56.450
 strand saw bought 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:01.150
 are our many of these boxes 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:04.219
 here come buy home and 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.829
 there is literally a ten to fifteen replacement 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:13.299
 you are making a tackle like that she 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:15.739
 will look like these plunged loop 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.139
 tether and then tether to this 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:22.539
 pins without any ringlets without anything 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:27.259
 for a simple trick here you will 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:30.080
 With a hook Tupi on plastic here on 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:34.070
 the other end you will have too 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:38.630
 snood or nets will go on friend 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:42.860
 carabiner u is further carabiner then 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:46.330
 have a donut take some bun 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:50.030
 take a piece of bread this thing 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.699
 puts it in here and close it 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.410
 have it don't bother with 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.639
 wire there kembrikami 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:02.930
 send bought tied and catch 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:06.560
 so by the way I also want to advise you on 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.690
 bread can, in principle, not very smell 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.479
 has a strong compared to the workshops 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.419
 Baki Hami java recommend buy 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:16.909
 stinkers all sorts here I would my favorite 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.520
 let's say tiger nut Lukyan where am I 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:23.659
 its not a brut everywhere she works important 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:27.949
 worms all there blood may well mass 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:31.220
 all sorts of stinkers in short can on bread 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:33.889
 swell i think the fish is faster 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.620
 will attract instead of foam can here 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:41.810
 such cooker and Hungarians came up with these 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:44.210
 down-down thermo here they are there immediately from 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:48.110
 heart with but now just did not work well 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:51.349
 there are such little strawberries there 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.740
 these are the fruit smell of records well 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:56.289
 polyfoam principle holds securely 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.330
 for experiment you can try 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:02.090
 principle on this all hope this time 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.699
 I already fully told and showed 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.340
 if something is not clear, I will not be offended, I will 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.930
 all until you understand everything 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:13.449
 tell all to new meetings 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.449
