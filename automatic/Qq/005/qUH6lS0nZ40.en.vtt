00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.980
 you are basically invincible he is 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.320
 called the god mode delight 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.600
 god mode where nothing can destroy 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.700
 nothing at all and to do it is 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.920
 extremely simple is impressive 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.719
 how this beach is efficient and simple to 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.579
 same time to do a first thing 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.920
 What you need to do is buy this 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.390
 garage you have here is a garage're there 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.460
 near the globe street 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.129
 on the side of a train line it costs 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.510
 29 thousand km2 car is not so expensive that 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.000
 everyone plays as barely 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.129
 raise 29,000 is not so complicated 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.409
 And you, how are you? 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.330
 then you will get the sim 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.979
 It has to be the environment I did not test. 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.720
 against the cars I saw no other 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.760
 showing club with another car then 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.650
 gotta be around the ok now you 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.670
 make simple you enter the super act 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.020
 with the surroundings 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.330
 if you have a playstation 3 you 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.939
 connects the cable of your control and 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.490
 load knows on your console and your 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.680
 control and leaves it connected 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.409
 if you play in xbox it also works 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.360
 xbox as I do not have the movie with you 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.890
 will use the same method except that the stack 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.780
 of your xbox 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.860
 now what are you going to do is you 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.930
 will click triangle or y xbox creating 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.430
 no playstation 3 to get in your car 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.450
 and immediately after you 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.890
 pull the cable 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.899
 So you press the Enter button . 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.509
 and I already had the cable of your 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.220
 playstation 3 that is in control or 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.680
 transferee box you do the same role 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.729
 same process but then you take the stack 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.920
 of your xbox 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.049
 right after pressing the triangle o and 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.640
 in the case of xbox and there will appear that 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.530
 message on the alert screen that the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.360
 control was disconnected is it takes 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.460
 a little bit so as not to lose all three 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.049
 live seconds for him to find back 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.879
 control network nÃ© 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.890
 and if the bank worked out you will see that 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.080
 Your doll is your character in the background. 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.480
 it will start to fall 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.160
 limbo then immediately after that 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.990
 you'll press the garage 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.000
 If this happens to you it is because the 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.650
 Milk already worked out if it did not happen 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.330
 You try again several times as 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.220
 I also tried a few times until 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.200
 to run touch have people get on 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.580
 first but I tried the fourth time in 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.620
 Fourth try, I'll be able to do it. 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.960
 if you appear outside the 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.240
 garage ready the ticket is already made 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.770
 You 're already completely invincible. 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.110
 very simple to do 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.030
 It's very efficient and it's impressive. 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.980
 in this politician it is very simple really 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.330
 easy to do but it has a power 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.770
 very large 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.270
 Until today I had never seen a group 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.520
 like the one that leaves you completely 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.750
 insensitive inside the game 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.310
 we found a note that sees the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.330
 opportunity that a car has left 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.650
 you inventive 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.300
 but it was just the car anyway 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.959
 They got it out of your window. 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.850
 huh 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.110
 now with the face invincible face 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.820
 very cool 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.380
 Good guys, let's get together for you. 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.600
 have to give some warning about this 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.030
 politician you're really invincible there 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.370
 nothing destroys cars can go through 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.140
 The top of you can hit you. 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.690
 other players can shoot you in 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.630
 any gun rpg stuff not heavy 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.090
 nothing kills everything and all the same tank 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.070
 especially now what I say to you 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.480
 staff who do not use great to stay 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.890
 killing between the guys inside the 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.860
 sessions because this is a lot of sucanagem 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.260
 seriously you invincible the other guy does not 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.540
 It's so very unfair if you do that 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.830
 so you do not do this to stay 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.500
 killing three stories within the 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.610
 This is a lot of slutty sessions. 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.280
 unfortunately from yesterday to here the following 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.200
 left yesterday on a big channel on youtube 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.940
 Brazil because of this cry and indeed 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.350
 already existed a few weeks ago it was only 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.540
 posted yesterday here in Brazil for a 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.610
 channel and then it only happens in the 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.340

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.030
 active ticket ta 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.590
 What I did for example was 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.239
 showing to the other guys is the best 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.800
 thing you can do even cooler 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.170
 more fun to kill others 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.519
