00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 and hello everyone with you today I will give you again 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.260
 I will show three interesting facts minecraft 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.260
 do not switch 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.580
 have you ever seen in vanilla 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.410
 minecraft cyclops if not then listen 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.580
 carefully dear friends thanks 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:37.030
 snapshot about 14w 25th which brought us 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.900
 here is such a monster and ordinary 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.420
 zombie 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.390
 we can do it in a straightforward way 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.920
 Cyclops me as usual command leave 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.690
 in the description go copy and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.680
 use it for their insidious purposes 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.400
 but we are not watching 2 photos 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.440
 the second fact appeared on snapshot 14w 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.480
 25th principle is not surprising 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.850
 As in this, becoming essentially a bunch of all added 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.740
 but now is not about that now all the same 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.500
 guys let's talk about fact a 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.830
 just a stupid like a wet stupid which 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.810
 added in this snaps u not many people 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.020
 believe that these sponges in any way 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.380
 you can not dry oh how are they wrong 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.600
 guys they can be dried thanks to the stove 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.509
 and ordinary coal oddly enough 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.240
 for minecraft we have to melt lips 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.140
 at the stove after which we can again 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.100
 use 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.439
 but we translate viewing 3 facts one 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.350
 since i dabbled with a command etc. at 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.850
 minecraft and noticed one little known 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.979
 a fact which I will show you now 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.380
 guys it turns out if the last 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.520
 snapshot app minecraft version 18 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.820
 climb in the rain to a height of 460 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.299
 blocks or even more then instead of rain in 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.149
 any biome snow does not even snow 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:05.490
 snow guys you just look at 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:08.310

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.630

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.410
 until 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.870

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.190
