 click on 4 here we can 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.880
 teleport to 1 click on first 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.040
 but I'm better about jumping so we press 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.019
 start back and start 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.930
 train your reach for these 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:49.160
 red circle 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:53.150
 here and also train and you just 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.470
 aim at the target and shoot so 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.470
 train hit 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.109
 can shoot several times you 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:06.700
 nothing changes the main thing get into 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:08.799
 circle after you have 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.950
 shows how much you hit and here it is 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:16.569
 here is that file you then how much bullet do you have 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:20.139
 went wrong but we do not quite 997 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:23.019
 water ok here we can choose 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.700
 absolutely any weapon even in the png is not well 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.680
 not even just for example vp 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.000
 and let's see for example what it is 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.959
 is reflex training to train 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.840
 reflexes 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.389
 have my own I turn in the usual 3 left and 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.269
 I press start appears in the center 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.760
 red circle i gotta get into that 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:47.040
 dark moment when will be the best so I 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.569
 did not hit his varnish are trained reflexes 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.379
 my reflex level is bad 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.000
 so I just show by example we 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:59.560
 we can at any time press the foot and 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.970
 stop training but i guess i 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:09.459
 hit stop now or else something 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:11.859
 will show who needs to train recoil ks 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.069
 go for example automaton as you know 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:19.380
 recoil machine 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:23.560
 death are drawn figure 7 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.970
 so we press burst trading and y 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.090
 we have such a small circle 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:33.710
 and we have to get into it we clamp 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.900
 and here are 10 shots with us we hit and 10 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.410
 shots we missed also 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.360
 to train and so here it is all 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.760
 trains 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.199
 I seem to have told everything and although not yet 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:51.800
 not everything is composed so we can choose here 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:57.020
 the size of our mug can be chosen head 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:05:04.220
 and shoot in the head here such heads but 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:05.930
 and generally unrealistic to get there I think though 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.380
 if you can shoot like that 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:13.520
 I don't have time to get caught 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:17.780
 just can't even notice so stop 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.700
 and also we can choose here our color 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:25.810
 mug i choose red because how 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:28.639
 they say red enhances the reaction 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.990
 requests and now I have told everything 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.580
 so thanks everyone for watching 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.300
 subscribe to my channel put like 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.300
 and all bye
