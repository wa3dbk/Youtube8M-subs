00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:10.359
 Farfan conductor Karl a 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:13.359
 he has already seen yellow current yellow-red 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:17.409
 what is that for Oliver Forster 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.539
 What's that crazy Father "and" Carlo is 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.539
 but now everything is going against a tree 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.150
 At this moment the pitiful of the FC St Pauli they have made their goal it 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.869
 was 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.869
 and centimeters irregular they get this only for 2 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.640
 and then this foul of Carla against Farfan who has seen the yellow card 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.980
 since of course no longer complain now 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.340
 I'm the central defender 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.340
 disturbing network at 2 0-leadership procedure 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.170
 given the next free kick for Schalke 04 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.310
 there is the red card for Bartels 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.580
 Red card 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.740
 for Bartels 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.520
 what's going on here 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.790
 what is is 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.540
 Velos 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.950
 Bartels is coming 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.430
 a split second 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.480
 so no question at all that is a clear foul 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.480
 no question at all that is also a clear yellow card 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.560
 Hordel Barrot scandals 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.560
 and at least discuss it 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 but he's getting through right 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.460
 still life 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.460
 again Edu 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.880
 Proteins on 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.590
 Ã¤mter and now interrupts 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.850
 the referee the game because Thorandt 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.850
 was obviously hit in the free kick 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.530
 Of course we think immediately 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.210
 you have a similar scene 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.219
 the ball right there 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.469
 knew you could least tolerate 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.339
 the one sees himself the sentence we were not so bad from the worker 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:17.379
 should have been Borussia Dortmund 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.479
 the goal is conceded and the referees 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.489
 Parton pretends he explains 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.129
 scored the best of all worlds done everything right so you have to 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.079
 Pipes 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.549
 So as a multi-day IT question all material z 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.459
 1 sentence 3 BUrlG 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.459
 and then Hoffenheim against Hamburg and 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:41.369
 umpire assistant Torsten Schiffner 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.939
 he is open now 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.039
 a beer mug 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.409
 Yesterday head was flown on that will have consequences 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.959
 for FC St Pauli and I have to say it clearly again 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.999
 but awakens 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:01.439
 before Fenske in this situation 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:02.639
 suffer with 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:03.729
 but that 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:05.499
 Mesen outrageous 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:07.209
 and it does not matter 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.269
 whether Thorsten Schiffner something wrong or not, the market is everything 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.779
 done right and that is something that just allows Olimar not to happen 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:17.989
 might 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.339
 which to the back of the head to spin 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:24.989
 that's inhumane that's my first and I'm pretty sure 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.359
 that FC St Pauli was considered as having a position as well 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.379
 Sailer says 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.079
 I will continue 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.649
 there comes the one 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:38.769
 the ACE Wolf and that is not 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.769
 St Pauli lends 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:45.619
 just as a reminder what these own viewers 

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:48.559
 Back then, organizers did that is nonsense 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:51.669
 and now this game will be 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.809
 and if I had said this game was 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:57.809
 written so many crazy story 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:00.369
 HB s 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:01.509
 the 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:03.269
 according to Rische 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.949
 Place malice Etienne 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:07.699
 to explain 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.459
 that this is a player 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.859
 90 seconds 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.109
 Nobody can do that before the end of the game 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.389
 Were whistling 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.549
 that is, this game becomes an aftermath 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.469
 Green CSP stand 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:22.039
 Nature always safe 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.819
 that Schalke 04 is declared the winner what else I'm one hundred percent 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.129
 for sure 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:30.029
 but at FC St Pauli 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:33.389
 much more has been lost here and now 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:37.659
 three points as two players who will not play next time 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.289
 is a very sad end 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.599
 a remarkable one 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.520
 Football evenings game 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.509
 in the football league not Fr 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:50.749
 because of fog 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.749
 not because of suddenly 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.699
 Comparing the classic voice 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.699
 the advocates of the former GDR lived 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.470
 a referee assistant was hit by a beer mug 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.629
 one thing is clear 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:13.029
 a referee assistant 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:14.729
 Autumn and sufferers 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.729
 then the men in yellow have nothing to blame for today 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.740
 that leaves 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.889
 this game 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.069
 cancel 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:27.529
 unbelievably incredible 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:29.379
 there are more 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:34.770
 Anyone who has ever stood on the stand grandstand everyone 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.710
 who is feverish with his club 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.289
 and suffers soft as hard at the moment everything is for the supporters of 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.550
 FC St Pauli but nonetheless there are things 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.959
 for which there is no excuse
