00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
it will also show me if 2,200 calories

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.749 
it will also show me if 2,200 calories
is<00:01:18.750> enough<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.320> me<00:01:19.500> now<00:01:20.130> during<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.490> time<00:01:20.549> I

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
is enough for me now during this time I

will be splitting firewood I'm gonna be

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.740 
will be splitting firewood I'm gonna be
working<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.369> some<00:01:23.430> fencing<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.600> some

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
working on some fencing I have some

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.570 
working on some fencing I have some
manual<00:01:25.140> labor<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.220> not<00:01:26.340> gonna<00:01:26.520> be

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
manual labor to do so it's not gonna be

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.679 
manual labor to do so it's not gonna be
just<00:01:26.640> sitting<00:01:26.939> around<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.420> front<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.630> a

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
just sitting around in front of a

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.630 
just sitting around in front of a
computer<00:01:27.869> I'll<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.799> working<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.400> simulate

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
computer I'll be working to simulate

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.080 
computer I'll be working to simulate
what<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.060> would<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.299> doing<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.720> raw<00:01:30.900> situation

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
what I would be doing in a raw situation

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.039 
what I would be doing in a raw situation
so<00:01:33.350> 2,200<00:01:34.350> calories<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:35.090> have<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.360> have<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> year

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
so 2,200 calories I have to have a year

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.740 
so 2,200 calories I have to have a year
supply<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.650> item<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.820> house<00:01:39.000> or<00:01:39.479> in

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
supply that item in the house or in

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.200 
supply that item in the house or in
storage<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.829> family<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.220> four<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.820> can't

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
storage for a family of four so I can't

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.520 
storage for a family of four so I can't
cheat<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.630> go<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.840> there<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.079> find<00:01:43.290> something

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
cheat and go in there and find something

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.050 
cheat and go in there and find something
good<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> eat<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.280> only<00:01:44.399> have<00:01:44.549> three<00:01:44.790> cans

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
good to eat that I only have three cans

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.999 
good to eat that I only have three cans
up<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.689> will<00:01:46.020> not<00:01:46.229> cut<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.829> this

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
up that will not cut it in this

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.010 
up that will not cut it in this
experiment<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.210> going<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.360> be<00:01:48.450> my<00:01:48.570> basics

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
experiment so it's going to be my basics

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.440 
experiment so it's going to be my basics
I<00:01:49.229> do<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> lot<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.860> canned<00:01:50.070> goods<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.119> can

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
I do have a lot of canned goods so I can

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.569 
I do have a lot of canned goods so I can

know<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.390> need<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.870> determine<00:02:19.050> this<00:02:19.410> because

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
know I need to determine this because

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.260 
know I need to determine this because
this<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:19.980> how<00:02:20.069> I'm<00:02:20.250> determined<00:02:20.760> how<00:02:20.819> much<00:02:21.000> food

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
this is how I'm determined how much food

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.980 
this is how I'm determined how much food
I<00:02:21.450> have<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:22.380> have<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.950> lot<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.459> food<00:02:23.730> I'm<00:02:24.569> hoping<00:02:24.900> I

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
I have I have a lot of food I'm hoping I

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.070 
I have I have a lot of food I'm hoping I
have<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> two-year<00:02:25.530> supply<00:02:25.650> but<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.069> doubt<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.550> I

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
have a two-year supply but I doubt it I

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.390 
have a two-year supply but I doubt it I
think<00:02:28.080> I'm<00:02:28.200> probably<00:02:28.290> eighteen<00:02:28.770> months<00:02:29.070> after

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
think I'm probably eighteen months after

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.740 
think I'm probably eighteen months after
I<00:02:29.610> do<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.970> calorie<00:02:30.330> count

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
I do the calorie count

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.030 
I do the calorie count
so<00:02:30.900> after<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:31.290> experiment<00:02:31.770> I'm<00:02:31.830> gonna<00:02:31.950> do

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
so after this experiment I'm gonna do

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.740 
so after this experiment I'm gonna do
the<00:02:32.160> calorie<00:02:32.490> count<00:02:32.730> determine<00:02:33.480> how<00:02:33.600> many

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
the calorie count determine how many

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.540 
the calorie count determine how many

this<00:04:06.090> product<00:04:06.540> has<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:06.750> serving<00:04:07.380> size<00:04:07.530> as<00:04:07.739> a

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
this product has a serving size as a

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.910 
this product has a serving size as a
half<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.100> cup<00:04:08.570> serving<00:04:09.570> per<00:04:09.750> container<00:04:10.049> is<00:04:10.260> 3.5

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
half a cup serving per container is 3.5

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.729 
half a cup serving per container is 3.5
servings<00:04:11.370> per<00:04:11.400> container<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:11.970> there's<00:04:12.120> 80

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
servings per container and there's 80

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.349 
servings per container and there's 80
calories<00:04:13.739> per<00:04:14.310> serving<00:04:14.609> so<00:04:14.850> you<00:04:15.030> would<00:04:15.209> take

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
calories per serving so you would take

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.759 
calories per serving so you would take
the<00:04:15.480> 80<00:04:15.919> times<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.130> container<00:04:17.519> 3.5<00:04:18.769> and

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
the 80 times the container 3.5 and

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.339 
the 80 times the container 3.5 and
that's<00:04:19.979> like<00:04:20.130> 260<00:04:21.000> calories<00:04:21.660> so<00:04:21.989> if<00:04:22.080> I<00:04:22.169> eat

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
that's like 260 calories so if I eat

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.350 
that's like 260 calories so if I eat
that<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:22.620> have<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:22.950> count<00:04:23.099> 260<00:04:23.910> if<00:04:24.030> I<00:04:24.120> eat<00:04:24.240> the

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
that I have to count 260 if I eat the

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.220 
that I have to count 260 if I eat the
whole<00:04:24.390> thing
