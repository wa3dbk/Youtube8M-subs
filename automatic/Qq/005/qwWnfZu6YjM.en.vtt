 June apple marathon continues on 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.889
 queue review 1 developer 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.380
 beta ios stand 1011 el captain 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.120
 the name is not taken from the sky is 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.839
 big mountain in national park 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.270
 yosemite 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.070
 not far from the previous name 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.650
 This is exactly what is said about guilt. 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.830
 updates compared to last year 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.420
 version of the stork n it looks not so 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.460
 impressive update did not work 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.550
 extensive both in terms of design and in terms of 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.570
 new features but much more important 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.640
 apple performance 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.239
 applications open 1 and 4 times 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.399
 faster 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.770
 switching between programs in two 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.590
 times faster a pdf file open in 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.960
 four times faster and everything is not easy 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.690
 in words even 1 abketka on macbook pro 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.180
 retina 15 and on old apple laptops 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.579
 works much faster than even the last 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.789
 versions from have and you can even say in 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.739
 times on macbook air 14 year difference 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.859
 apparent not so much her new macbook 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.439
 12 generally almost imperceptible story 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.720
 with pdf files even more interesting we take 4 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.970
 gigov dictionary of chinese characters and 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.210
 for comparison let's open it old 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.799
 west end 10 9 mavericks in general pdf and 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.110
 rather four times slower 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.180
 open the faster let's hope 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.580
 that it will correct let's go now by 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.619
 Changes small and pleasant 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.080
 the cursor increase feature when 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.090
 fast moving fingers patrick padu 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.490
 it happens that you sit and go somewhere 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.159
 lost the cursor now it is easy to find 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.590
 like its ios9 updated west end 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.790
 got a new system font 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.920
 San Francisco looks much better 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.740
 than little man but i'm at least on 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.750
 more serious as it was updated spotlight in 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.759
 first you can move it from the middle 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.829
 in a more convenient place but after 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.470
 rebooting the system it returns to 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.390
 your old place would still be allowed 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.479
 change its size would be super 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.149
 the search itself has become smarter but not for Russia and 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.369
 Russian language while safari added 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.770
 2 useful features first pinning 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.390
 tabs in small icons and even if 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.149
 turn off the browser and restart 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.890
 tab will remain practically this 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.110
 rethought bookmarks 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.950
 the second mute function in 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.140
 certain 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.060
 trays to the word in experimental 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.920
 In the chrome settings, this has already appeared 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.450
 a long time ago 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.730
 application notes updated it is 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.739
 same as in ayos 9 you can draw to create 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.900
 checklists attach image 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.250
 and in the photo attachment appeared 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.680
 advanced settings 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.489
 editing now true it also 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.190
 unavailable 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.560
 Mishin control trained to group windows 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.260
 on applications even better in el captain 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.739
 as windows 8 and 10 have work with 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.630
 by windows 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.019
 cartoon about us turn on hold 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.130
 green full screen button 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.470
 the base window rises to the left on the right 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.989
 Mishin control is activated by running 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.420
 applications here choose the right and 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.819
 voila 2 conveniently grouped windows 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.470
 pulling the strip you can change the proportion 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.540
 fill the screen one way or another 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.970
 window application opens in a new 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.099
 desktop so you can brush for 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.840
 return back or open mishin 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.120
 control which now collapses 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.459
 desktops in very miniature icons 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.099
 this whole story with windows done on a hundred 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.930
 percent and 100 is really very convenient when 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.660
 what is initially supported by all 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.430
 even third-party applications really worth it 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.549
 note that all this is convenient is basically 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.620
 on large displays more than 15 inches by 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.019
 macbook air it looks like that 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.450
 actually further a new feature for 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.400
 makbukov owners to force touch in 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.310
 trackpad settings appeared item 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.440
 noiseless pressed with its activation sound 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.540
 click on the track go quietly 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.790
 also in the screen settings took 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.010
 from somewhere point scattered compensation 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.230
 light is something like auto-brightness but 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.730
 At the same time , the saturation in 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.280
 depending on lighting 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.380
 and now the main news is fine dori 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.049
 brought the action back by brushing with three 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.329
 fingers on the track padu finally this 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.430
 wonderful and convenient function was removed 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.920
 still in the mavericks and now she is again with 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.940
 we have good news for gamers 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.310
 on mac os 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.630
 although scientists have not yet discovered this kind 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.359
 man but he has every chance 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.579
 appear from a weight moved here 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.500
 metal game technology now do 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.889
 easier and resources will be required for them 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.660
 less so everyone is waiting for gta 5 on mac but 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.700
 if no joke then metal will allow 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.190
 accelerate in general all the processes associated with 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.210
 graphics and this is after effects file cad 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.190
 about cinema 4d and so on 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.770
 all rendering frauds can 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.650
 work up to 10 times faster application is very 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.229
 serious and with the release of apple music 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.889
 the aytyuns icon will change in color looks 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.530
 not bad 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.539
 Of the other interesting things seen, 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.720
 even the board it was 10 years ago 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.319
 so he remained stability in general 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.060
 it's all 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:45.370
 and seemingly small changes but 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.830
 the system began to work much faster and 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.139
 perhaps itâ€™s better to be the biggest plus 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.030
 el captain is uniquely excellent 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.949
 update even for those who prefer 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.110
 stay on mavericks a year ago 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:59.259
 in the fall can be easily updated 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.690
 train n 10 11 is already available to developers 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.580
 In July, a public beta will appear. 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.130
 in the fall will be a full release 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.900
 all poppy owners can be updated 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.900
 cars support yosemite
