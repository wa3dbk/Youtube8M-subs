and I look at this fluffy rice that we

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.130 
and I look at this fluffy rice that we
have<00:03:34.950> these<00:03:35.340> kernels<00:03:35.730> are<00:03:36.090> burst<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.900> if<00:03:36.990> I

brown rice let's take a look at the pot

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.920 
brown rice let's take a look at the pot
where<00:03:53.280> we<00:03:53.400> have<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.670> water<00:03:53.910> boiling<00:03:54.300> first

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
where we have the water boiling first

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.470 
where we have the water boiling first
and<00:03:55.260> if<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:55.710> notice<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:56.430> is<00:03:56.490> dried<00:03:56.970> out<00:03:57.270> on

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
and if you notice this is dried out on

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.480 
and if you notice this is dried out on
the<00:03:57.600> bottom<00:03:57.930> this<00:03:58.110> pot<00:03:58.380> is<00:03:58.590> dried<00:03:59.010> because<00:03:59.370> a

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
the bottom this pot is dried because a

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.760 
the bottom this pot is dried because a
lot<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.790> that<00:04:00.000> water<00:04:00.240> that<00:04:00.570> boiled<00:04:01.140> originally

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
lot of that water that boiled originally

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.700 
lot of that water that boiled originally
turned<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.580> steam<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.210> boiled<00:04:03.570> off<00:04:03.750> pot<00:04:04.560> on

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
turned to steam and boiled off pot on

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.950 
turned to steam and boiled off pot on
the<00:04:04.770> left<00:04:05.070> that<00:04:05.430> started<00:04:05.940> cold<00:04:06.270> let's<00:04:06.720> take<00:04:06.930> a

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
the left that started cold let's take a

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:14.780 
the left that started cold let's take a
taste<00:04:07.320> of<00:04:07.470> our<00:04:07.650> rice<00:04:10.640> it's<00:04:11.640> soft<00:04:13.640> kind<00:04:14.640> of

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
taste of our rice it's soft kind of

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.030 
taste of our rice it's soft kind of
nutty<00:04:16.400> moist<00:04:17.690> very<00:04:18.690> watery<00:04:19.200> now<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:19.440> used<00:04:19.739> water

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
nutty moist very watery now I used water

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.560 
nutty moist very watery now I used water
I<00:04:20.130> would<00:04:20.280> normally<00:04:20.730> use<00:04:20.760> some<00:04:21.060> kind<00:04:21.210> of<00:04:21.330> broth

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
I would normally use some kind of broth

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.350 
I would normally use some kind of broth
for<00:04:21.930> flavor<00:04:22.230> but<00:04:22.800> let's<00:04:23.520> compare<00:04:23.730> that<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.120> the

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
for flavor but let's compare that to the

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.090 
for flavor but let's compare that to the
race<00:04:24.510> where<00:04:24.780> we<00:04:24.810> started<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.560> water<00:04:25.800> in<00:04:26.010> a

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
race where we started the water in a

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.230 
race where we started the water in a
boil<00:04:26.340> first

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.840 

much<00:04:30.240> harder<00:04:31.400> much<00:04:32.400> crunchy<00:04:33.090> er<00:04:33.290> much<00:04:34.290> nuttier

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
much harder much crunchy er much nuttier

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.939 
much harder much crunchy er much nuttier
still<00:04:35.850> done<00:04:36.290> well<00:04:37.290> some<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.530> that<00:04:37.680> water

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
still done well some of that water

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.460 
still done well some of that water
boiled<00:04:38.400> out<00:04:38.550> at<00:04:38.729> first<00:04:38.970> this<00:04:39.540> is<00:04:39.720> just<00:04:40.050> as<00:04:40.229> good

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
boiled out at first this is just as good

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.530 
boiled out at first this is just as good
but<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:40.919> get<00:04:41.130> two<00:04:41.370> different<00:04:41.550> flavours<00:04:42.180> from

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
but I get two different flavours from

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.450 
but I get two different flavours from
two<00:04:42.780> different<00:04:43.110> methods<00:04:43.470> of<00:04:43.590> cooking<00:04:43.860> rice<00:04:44.220> so

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
two different methods of cooking rice so

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.460 
two different methods of cooking rice so
what's<00:04:44.699> the<00:04:44.880> one<00:04:45.060> way<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.330> cook<00:04:45.630> rice<00:04:45.870> there<00:04:46.350> is

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
what's the one way to cook rice there is

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.560 
what's the one way to cook rice there is
no<00:04:46.620> one<00:04:46.889> way<00:04:47.100> it's<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.669> one<00:04:47.850> way<00:04:48.000> that's<00:04:48.180> best

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
no one way it's the one way that's best

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.080 
no one way it's the one way that's best
for<00:04:48.750> you
