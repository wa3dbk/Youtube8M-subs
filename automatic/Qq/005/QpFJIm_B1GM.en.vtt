00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello friends, everything good knows about this 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.170
 video here very fast is time already 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.019
 when stutter used to at least post 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.809
 a video two a week but I decided 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.090
 save this one quickly and cellular 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.070
 even just to show my indignation 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.199
 You know how bad it is that I came to see 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.840
 now just a matter exhibited by the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.840
 record network 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.989
 honestly my friends today we 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.170
 We know how hard you are. 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:43.860
 What do you want the author of a public work 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:49.890
 and speaking is a biography which is 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.719
 is the literary genius is very difficult and 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.300
 this speaks with awareness 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:00.539
 because I have a juvenile book 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:06.540
 in which I had the opportunity to be a 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:09.689
 illustrator of books and saw the difficulty 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.770
 that you are launching a literary work in the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.049
 our country 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.340
 even more when you have no recourse 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:21.299
 None, you decide to invest in this 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.400
 writing to run after who 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.869
 want to publish and when the world you 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.350
 you have to invest money of your own 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.770
 pocket or else you spend to publish 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.560
 a work and its profit is derisory 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.030
 You make a treat for yourself. 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.400
 simply this 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.450
 I saw a story just now in the area 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.009
 cut and left me in a fuck 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.350
 you will soon place after that 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.720
 You will see the car comment you 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:54.110
 I want to see that you think this is not from 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:57.829
 to be angry because my friends are very 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.180
 It's hard for you to do certain things. 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.759
 happening around you and seems to 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.070
 you're more afraid of people being able to 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.800
 see them being deceived 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.690
 persons being exploited by persons 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.330
 they are deceived 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.300
 and it seems like they like basra 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.770
 conquest knows cosmos explored 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.620
 deceived know and the justice of our country 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.900
 It is very slow justice not only our 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.840
 country I just saw that it's not just here 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.130
 in Brazil is not in the whole world 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.380
 north america of the african continent 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:40.160

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:44.270
 the people's pick spree 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:48.650
 What do you do wrong on the hard face? 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:51.830
 nobody does the thá are people and ludic 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.200
 that there is the cry that they like because 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.220
 is that person an example of life is 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.489
 followed 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.340
 we have incredible literary works 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.800
 not only great literature names here 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.500
 In Brazil, but in the world. 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.590
 are books that go unnoticed 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.760

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:17.209

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.850
 disclosed 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.340
 people do not know the works and I 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.310
 I do not know what on earth people 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.440

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:42.350
 This is my outrage I'm angry 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:45.500
 I feel really bad when 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.590
 this kind of news of seeing the people as 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.799
 people are so stupid forgive me but that's it 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:55.310
 that I asked for a very alienated people 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:57.350
 I think the references are over 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.650
 of heroism ended the 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:04.730
 people is someone who is 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.940
 mirror and now expect an any 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.260
 thing is what is happening because 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.230

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:20.449

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:25.460
 I honestly do not have the words 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:27.530
 okay with it even more but it's your 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.229
 far from the place where it is happening 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.180
 the launch of the book are people who 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.930
 they come with their children 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.979
 Look at the mothers who come 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.710

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:43.490
 they also bring boxes like that here 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:47.180
 Look to take them in peace. 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:59.630
 I'll try to show who 's away from the 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:05:03.139
 We're pretty early in the line. 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:08.660

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:11.120
 continue with this good the queue 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.389

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:24.639
 You can not see at the end of the line either. 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.639
 that in reality the beginning 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.520
 entrepreneurs to participate in the 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.340

 he states that the story of edir macedo 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.340
 has several obstacles but also shows 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.090
 that it's possible to get over it just to hear my 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.070
 name 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.620

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.020
 despite everything very organized people 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.750
 notice a little confusion here 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.030
 on the door because there are two rows 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.510
