hi I'm Vic and we're introducing you to

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.410 
hi I'm Vic and we're introducing you to
the<00:00:06.899> game<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.290> backgammon<00:00:07.910> now<00:00:08.910> we'd<00:00:09.179> like<00:00:09.210> to

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
the game of backgammon now we'd like to

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.120 
the game of backgammon now we'd like to
look<00:00:09.780> at<00:00:09.990> some<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.469> rules<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.950> govern

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
look at some of the rules that govern

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.780 
look at some of the rules that govern
checker<00:00:11.969> movement<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.139> game<00:00:13.349> one<00:00:14.219> thing<00:00:14.519> I

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
checker movement in the game one thing I

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.150 
checker movement in the game one thing I
want<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.330> also<00:00:15.719> cover<00:00:16.440> here<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:18.920> you'll<00:00:19.920> notice

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
want to also cover here is you'll notice

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.220 
want to also cover here is you'll notice
it's<00:00:20.580> possible<00:00:21.590> for<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:24.150> dice<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.779> land<00:00:25.019> on

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
it's possible for the dice to land on

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.109 
it's possible for the dice to land on
the<00:00:25.380> same<00:00:25.650> number<00:00:26.449> if<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.590> happens<00:00:29.119> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
the same number if that happens the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.450 
the same number if that happens the
special<00:00:30.720> rule<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:30.990> playing<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.189> in

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
special rule for playing this in

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.590 
special rule for playing this in
backgammon<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:33.649> that<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.890> get<00:00:35.190> not<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:36.090> two

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
backgammon is that you get not just two

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.700 
backgammon is that you get not just two
fives<00:00:36.989> here<00:00:37.770> but<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.670> get<00:00:39.020> four<00:00:40.020> fives<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:42.710> if

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
fives here but you get four fives and if

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.900 
fives here but you get four fives and if
you<00:00:44.070> had<00:00:44.399> four<00:00:44.850> fives<00:00:45.379> you<00:00:46.379> could<00:00:46.680> move<00:00:46.980> one

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
you had four fives you could move one

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.770 
you had four fives you could move one
checker<00:00:48.420> all<00:00:48.930> four<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.680> those<00:00:49.890> five<00:00:50.780> sometimes

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
checker all four of those five sometimes

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.610 
checker all four of those five sometimes
this<00:00:52.140> happens<00:00:52.469> suppose<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.670> were<00:00:53.940> hit<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.620> sent

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
this happens suppose I were hit and sent

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.400 
this happens suppose I were hit and sent
to<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.039> bar<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.670> then<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.180> roll<00:00:57.570> double<00:00:58.109> fives

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
to the bar and then I roll double fives

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.510 
to the bar and then I roll double fives
I<00:00:58.980> could<00:00:59.520> move<00:00:59.730> one<00:01:00.000> five<00:01:00.390> two<00:01:00.989> fives<00:01:01.520> three

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
I could move one five two fives three

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.690 
I could move one five two fives three
fives<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.619> come<00:01:04.619> all<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.830> way<00:01:04.979> back<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
fives and come all the way back to the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.250 
fives and come all the way back to the
beginning<00:01:06.500> or<00:01:07.500> if<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.430> roll<00:01:08.700> doubles<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.990> can

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
beginning or if you roll doubles you can

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.710 
beginning or if you roll doubles you can
roll<00:01:10.640> or<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:12.030> can<00:01:12.240> move<00:01:12.540> any<00:01:12.930> other

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
roll or you can move any other

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.649 
roll or you can move any other
combination<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.229> not<00:01:16.619> blocked<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:18.030> you

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
combination that is not blocked so you

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.020 
combination that is not blocked so you
could<00:01:18.869> move<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.110> checkers<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.280> at<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.640> time

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
could move to checkers of it at a time

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.620 
could move to checkers of it at a time
down<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.200> move<00:01:22.920> these<00:01:23.580> two<00:01:23.939> checkers

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
down here and move these two checkers

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.060 
down here and move these two checkers
each<00:01:25.490> ten<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.820> make<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.689> three<00:01:27.990> point<00:01:28.290> with

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
each ten and make the three point with

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.330 
each ten and make the three point with
double<00:01:29.520> fives<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.540> doubles<00:01:31.079> are<00:01:31.439> particularly

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
double fives so doubles are particularly

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.569 
double fives so doubles are particularly
important<00:01:33.180> because<00:01:33.390> they<00:01:33.960> give<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.500> more<00:01:35.130> of

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
important because they give you more of

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.420 
important because they give you more of
a<00:01:36.030> dice<00:01:36.299> roll<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.409> get<00:01:37.590> four<00:01:37.979> numbers

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
a dice roll in that you get four numbers

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.830 
a dice roll in that you get four numbers
and<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:39.150> can<00:01:39.360> also<00:01:39.950> make<00:01:40.950> points<00:01:41.670> much<00:01:42.509> better

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and you can also make points much better

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.780 
and you can also make points much better
if<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.350> roll<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> double<00:01:43.890> because<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.610> can

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
if you roll a double because you can

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.170 
if you roll a double because you can
move<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.270> checkers<00:01:45.600> together<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.880> want<00:01:48.090> to

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
move to checkers together I just want to

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.389 
move to checkers together I just want to
make<00:01:48.329> one<00:01:48.720> point<00:01:49.259> about<00:01:51.140> what<00:01:52.140> happens<00:01:52.829> when<00:01:53.340> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
make one point about what happens when a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.200 
make one point about what happens when a
checker<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.680> hit<00:01:57.049> if<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.579> checker<00:02:00.060> on

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
checker is hit if you have a checker on

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.139 
checker is hit if you have a checker on
the<00:02:00.540> bar<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.229> situation<00:02:02.130> White<00:02:02.460> has<00:02:02.820> been

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the bar in this situation White has been

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.630 
the bar in this situation White has been
hit<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.750> has<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.950> checker<00:02:05.700> on<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.810> bar<00:02:07.640> and

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
hit and has a checker on the bar and

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.470 
hit and has a checker on the bar and
then<00:02:09.060> blue<00:02:09.539> moved<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.860> point

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
then blue moved in to this point

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.020 
then blue moved in to this point
you<00:02:13.019> cannot<00:02:13.560> move<00:02:13.890> any<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.550> your<00:02:14.849> other

you cannot move any of your other

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.080 
you cannot move any of your other
checkers<00:02:15.750> until<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.950> enter<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.640> checker

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
checkers until you enter that checker

checkers until you enter that checker
from<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.690> bar<00:02:19.129> now<00:02:20.129> notice<00:02:20.819> in<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.780> situation

from the bar now notice in a situation

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.479 
from the bar now notice in a situation
like<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:23.269> blue<00:02:24.269> has<00:02:24.750> every<00:02:25.470> point<00:02:26.030> made<00:02:28.489> what

like this blue has every point made what

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.070 
like this blue has every point made what
count<00:02:30.420> as<00:02:30.750> blocking<00:02:31.349> points<00:02:32.280> if<00:02:33.080> you're

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
count as blocking points if you're

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.059 
count as blocking points if you're
moving<00:02:34.440> around<00:02:34.799> the<00:02:35.400> board<00:02:36.110> also<00:02:37.110> count<00:02:37.890> as

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
moving around the board also count as

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.330 
moving around the board also count as
blocking<00:02:38.459> points<00:02:39.269> that<00:02:39.510> block<00:02:39.810> your<00:02:40.110> entry<00:02:40.860> in

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
blocking points that block your entry in

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.589 
blocking points that block your entry in
if<00:02:42.120> you're<00:02:42.390> on<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.900> bar<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:44.129> in<00:02:44.489> a<00:02:44.700> situation

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
if you're on the bar so in a situation

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.430 
if you're on the bar so in a situation
like<00:02:45.629> this<00:02:45.900> white<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:47.629> not<00:02:48.629> in<00:02:48.870> good<00:02:49.110> shape

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
like this white is not in good shape

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.119 
like this white is not in good shape
because<00:02:50.340> white<00:02:50.970> needs<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.480> specific<00:02:51.810> v<00:02:52.530> not<00:02:53.099> a

three-two not a 4-1 but white has to

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.020 
three-two not a 4-1 but white has to
specifically<00:02:57.569> roll<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.200> number<00:02:58.560> 5<00:02:58.890> in<00:02:59.730> order

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
specifically roll the number 5 in order

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.050 
specifically roll the number 5 in order
to<00:03:00.720> enter<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.349> checker<00:03:01.799> from<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.400> bar<00:03:02.700> and

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
to enter that checker from the bar and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.729 
to enter that checker from the bar and
white<00:03:03.750> can<00:03:04.049> move<00:03:04.290> no<00:03:04.650> other<00:03:04.890> checkers<00:03:06.739> until

white can move no other checkers until

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.220 
white can move no other checkers until
this<00:03:08.040> checker<00:03:08.489> has<00:03:08.910> been<00:03:09.359> entered<00:03:09.780> from<00:03:10.019> the

this checker has been entered from the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.180 
this checker has been entered from the
bar<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:11.160> it's<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.430> very<00:03:11.849> important<00:03:13.010> point<00:03:14.010> to

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
bar so it's a very important point to

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.970 
bar so it's a very important point to
remember<00:03:15.049> in<00:03:16.049> terms<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:17.630> of<00:03:18.630> what<00:03:19.139> happens<00:03:19.739> and

remember in terms of of what happens and

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.729 
remember in terms of of what happens and
the<00:03:20.130> rules<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.880> backgammon<00:03:21.510> concerning<00:03:22.440> being

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.259 
on the bar if you were on the bar here
as<00:03:26.250> white<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.090> do<00:03:27.690> not<00:03:27.959> roll<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.709> 5<00:03:29.130> roll<00:03:29.940> any

as white and do not roll a 5 roll any

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.330 
as white and do not roll a 5 roll any
other<00:03:30.599> number<00:03:32.239> combination<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:34.709> basically

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
other number combination you basically

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.539 
other number combination you basically
cannot<00:03:36.030> come<00:03:36.389> in<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:37.380> cannot<00:03:37.859> move<00:03:38.190> any

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
cannot come in and you cannot move any

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.640 
cannot come in and you cannot move any
of<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.970> other<00:03:39.120> numbers<00:03:39.660> on<00:03:39.900> your<00:03:40.079> dice<00:03:40.319> so

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
of the other numbers on your dice so

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.220 
of the other numbers on your dice so
your<00:03:40.919> role<00:03:41.280> for<00:03:41.639> that<00:03:41.819> turn<00:03:42.180> is<00:03:42.829> forfeited<00:03:43.829> and

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
your role for that turn is forfeited and

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.729 
your role for that turn is forfeited and
one<00:03:46.230> more<00:03:46.500> thing<00:03:46.829> about<00:03:48.530> rolling<00:03:49.530> and

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
one more thing about rolling and

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.599 
one more thing about rolling and
backgammon<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:51.269> cannot<00:03:51.930> pass<00:03:52.380> on<00:03:52.859> your<00:03:53.280> turn

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
backgammon you cannot pass on your turn

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.580 
backgammon you cannot pass on your turn
and<00:03:55.129> so<00:03:56.129> you<00:03:56.190> must<00:03:56.819> roll<00:03:57.269> whether<00:03:57.989> or<00:03:58.200> not<00:03:58.349> it's

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
and so you must roll whether or not it's

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.089 
and so you must roll whether or not it's
to<00:03:58.859> your<00:03:58.980> advantage<00:03:59.090> to<00:04:00.090> do<00:04:00.329> so<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:01.049> you<00:04:01.769> must

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
to your advantage to do so and you must

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.920 
to your advantage to do so and you must
play<00:04:02.400> all<00:04:02.730> of<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.359> numbers<00:04:03.750> on<00:04:04.049> the<00:04:04.470> dice<00:04:04.849> if

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
play all of the numbers on the dice if

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.740 
play all of the numbers on the dice if
there<00:04:06.930> is<00:04:07.109> any<00:04:07.379> legal<00:04:08.220> way<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.459> do<00:04:09.180> so<00:04:09.859> in<00:04:10.859> some

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
there is any legal way to do so in some

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.659 
there is any legal way to do so in some
situations<00:04:12.750> where<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.319> can<00:04:13.680> only<00:04:13.859> play<00:04:14.310> one

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
situations where you can only play one

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:18.259 
situations where you can only play one
number<00:04:14.970> legally<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:16.769> must<00:04:17.099> at<00:04:17.400> least<00:04:17.789> play

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
number legally you must at least play

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.860 
number legally you must at least play
that<00:04:18.660> number<00:04:19.229> now<00:04:19.739> there<00:04:20.070> are<00:04:20.190> certain<00:04:20.549> odds

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
that number now there are certain odds

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.720 
that number now there are certain odds
situations<00:04:21.870> where

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
situations where

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.560

two<00:04:23.600> numbers<00:04:24.110> are<00:04:24.350> different<00:04:25.010> and<00:04:25.300> you<00:04:26.300> can

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
two numbers are different and you can

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.710 
two numbers are different and you can
play<00:04:26.870> one<00:04:27.230> number<00:04:27.530> or<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.670> other<00:04:28.880> but<00:04:29.450> not

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
play one number or the other but not

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.140 
play one number or the other but not
both<00:04:30.490> in<00:04:31.630> those<00:04:32.680> unusual<00:04:33.730> situations<00:04:34.730> there

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
both in those unusual situations there

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.480 
both in those unusual situations there
is<00:04:35.330> a<00:04:35.360> rule<00:04:35.720> governing<00:04:36.380> that<00:04:36.620> where<00:04:37.010> you<00:04:37.220> must

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
is a rule governing that where you must

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.480 
is a rule governing that where you must
play<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:38.540> higher<00:04:38.900> number<00:04:39.560> whether<00:04:40.130> that's

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
play the higher number whether that's

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.170 
play the higher number whether that's
the<00:04:40.790> number<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.390> would<00:04:41.570> wish<00:04:41.810> to<00:04:42.080> play<00:04:42.320> or<00:04:42.560> not

the number you would wish to play or not

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.690 
the number you would wish to play or not
so<00:04:44.180> if<00:04:44.240> it's<00:04:44.450> a<00:04:44.540> situation<00:04:44.810> where<00:04:45.490> you<00:04:46.490> can
