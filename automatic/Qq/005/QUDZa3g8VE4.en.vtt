00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
from all my other videos and that's

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.200 
from all my other videos and that's
because<00:00:08.010> over<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.309> weekend<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.790> decided<00:00:09.059> to

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
because over the weekend I decided to

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.910 
because over the weekend I decided to
move<00:00:09.360> my<00:00:09.570> office<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.170> different<00:00:10.620> room<00:00:10.769> of

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
move my office to a different room of

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.280 
move my office to a different room of
our<00:00:11.010> house<00:00:11.219> with<00:00:11.969> Molly<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.630> expecting<00:00:13.230> a

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
our house with Molly and I expecting a

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.350 
our house with Molly and I expecting a
baby<00:00:13.440> here<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.950> few<00:00:14.130> months<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.610> kind<00:00:15.330> of

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
baby here in a few months I kind of

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.480 
baby here in a few months I kind of
figured<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:16.440> office<00:00:16.800> space<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.310> was

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
figured that the office space that I was

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.340 
figured that the office space that I was
using<00:00:17.789> would<00:00:18.150> be<00:00:18.270> better<00:00:18.480> utilized<00:00:18.690> as<00:00:19.320> a

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
using would be better utilized as a

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.279 
using would be better utilized as a
family<00:00:19.890> room<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.730> was<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> huge<00:00:21.359> space<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.080> I

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
family room it was a huge space and I

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.840 
family room it was a huge space and I
don't<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.680> don't<00:00:22.920> think<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.160> was<00:00:23.310> really<00:00:23.580> using

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
don't I don't think I was really using

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.540 
don't I don't think I was really using
all<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.570> space<00:00:24.810> there<00:00:25.140> my<00:00:25.949> darkroom<00:00:26.250> is

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
all of that space there my darkroom is

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.130 
all of that space there my darkroom is
still<00:00:26.760> down<00:00:26.970> there<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.510> kind<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.840> figured

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
still down there but I kind of figured

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.390 
still down there but I kind of figured
the<00:00:28.289> rest<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.680> room<00:00:28.859> would<00:00:28.980> make<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> much

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
the rest of the room would make a much

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.160 
the rest of the room would make a much
better<00:00:29.580> family<00:00:29.910> room<00:00:30.269> than<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.689> an<00:00:30.810> office

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
better family room than just an office

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.759 
better family room than just an office
for<00:00:31.410> me

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
for me

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.280 
for me
so<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.000> room<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.870> actually<00:00:34.170> one

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
so with this room this is actually one

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.770 
so with this room this is actually one
of<00:00:34.320> my<00:00:34.410> old<00:00:34.620> childhood<00:00:34.890> bedrooms<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.850> we

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
of my old childhood bedrooms and we

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.970 
of my old childhood bedrooms and we
weren't<00:00:36.930> really<00:00:37.079> doing<00:00:37.200> anything<00:00:37.710> with<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
weren't really doing anything with the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.440 
weren't really doing anything with the
space<00:00:38.219> for<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.489> time<00:00:38.700> being<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.180> kind<00:00:39.420> of

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
space for the time being so I kind of

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.940 
space for the time being so I kind of
figured<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.780> would<00:00:39.899> make<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> good<00:00:40.260> office<00:00:40.320> and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
figured it would make a good office and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.310 
figured it would make a good office and
you<00:00:41.850> know<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.000> wanted<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> change<00:00:42.450> things<00:00:42.809> up<00:00:43.020> so

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
you know I wanted to change things up so

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.500 
you know I wanted to change things up so
over<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.680> weekend<00:00:44.100> Friday<00:00:45.000> morning<00:00:45.420> I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
light I wanted to try something

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.219 
light I wanted to try something
completely<00:01:03.000> different<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.930> was<00:01:04.019> kind<00:01:04.199> of

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
completely different and it was kind of

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.560 
completely different and it was kind of
a<00:01:04.350> gamble<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.339> decided<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.150> go<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.420> black

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
a gamble but I decided to go with black

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.780 
a gamble but I decided to go with black
walls<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.320> luckily<00:01:07.950> enough<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.490> ended<00:01:08.729> up

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
walls and luckily enough I ended up

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.219 
walls and luckily enough I ended up
loving<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.240> way<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.540> turned<00:01:09.750> out

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
loving the way this turned out

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.870 
loving the way this turned out
I<00:01:10.260> really<00:01:10.830> really<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.400> way<00:01:11.520> everything

I really really like the way everything

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.030 
I really really like the way everything
looks<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.619> being<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.890> little

even photo editing stuff like that it's

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.249 
even photo editing stuff like that it's
just<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.860> really<00:01:22.970> you<00:01:23.970> know<00:01:24.000> kind<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.509> cozy

just a really you know kind of cozy
atmosphere<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.369> really<00:01:26.670> really<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.090> that

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
atmosphere and I really really like that

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.109 
atmosphere and I really really like that
so<00:01:27.840> after<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.860> after<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.310> walls<00:01:29.520> were<00:01:29.820> done

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
so after that after the walls were done
