00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
but what I've done is I actually had to

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.840 
but what I've done is I actually had to
eliminate<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:43.050> poor<00:00:43.290> pony<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.950> inside<00:00:44.309> as

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
you can see it is kind of maybe where a

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.770 
you can see it is kind of maybe where a
pony<00:00:46.920> used<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.370> be<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:48.030> kind<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.360> see<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> tail

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
over here is grind a lot of the plastic

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.000 
over here is grind a lot of the plastic
down<00:01:07.260> now<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.549> doesn't<00:01:08.970> live<00:01:09.240> quite<00:01:10.049> flat<00:01:10.590> as<00:01:10.950> I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
down now it doesn't live quite flat as I

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.260 
down now it doesn't live quite flat as I
would<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.740> anyway<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.700> pretty

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
would like to anyway but it's pretty

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.130 
would like to anyway but it's pretty
darn<00:01:15.630> close<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:17.310> utilizing<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.180> 3m<00:01:18.630> tape<00:01:18.659> and

the instructions that emblem art gave it

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.420 
the instructions that emblem art gave it
should<00:01:22.170> go<00:01:22.290> ahead<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.680> fit<00:01:22.950> down<00:01:23.130> there

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
should go ahead and fit down there

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.399 
should go ahead and fit down there
without<00:01:23.670> much<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.119> an<00:01:24.240> issue<00:01:24.360> at<00:01:24.600> all<00:01:24.720> then

however is the emblem arts they're
measurements<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.829> far<00:01:38.040> as<00:01:38.189> what's<00:01:38.460> supposed

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
measurements as far as what's supposed

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.620 
measurements as far as what's supposed
to<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> inside<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:40.369> this<00:01:41.369> faux<00:01:42.000> gas<00:01:42.299> cap

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
to be on the inside of this faux gas cap

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.850 
to be on the inside of this faux gas cap
is<00:01:42.659> one<00:01:43.110> particular<00:01:43.439> size<00:01:44.210> but<00:01:45.590> this<00:01:46.590> guy

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
is one particular size but this guy

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.830 
is one particular size but this guy
right<00:01:47.070> here<00:01:47.100> being<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.939> size<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.420> fine

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
right here being that size is fine

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.039 
right here being that size is fine
however<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:50.700> internal<00:01:51.479> diameter<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:53.040> this

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
however the internal diameter of this

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.679 
however the internal diameter of this
faux<00:01:55.049> gas<00:01:55.350> cap<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.860> actually<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:56.689> slightly

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
faux gas cap is actually just slightly

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.649 
faux gas cap is actually just slightly
bigger<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.430> don't<00:01:59.670> know<00:01:59.729> if<00:01:59.880> you<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.119> see<00:02:00.509> it

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
bigger so I don't know if you can see it

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.600 
bigger so I don't know if you can see it
but<00:02:01.290> as<00:02:01.560> I've<00:02:01.860> got<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.460> guy<00:02:02.700> evened<00:02:03.479> out<00:02:03.659> here

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
but as I've got this guy evened out here
