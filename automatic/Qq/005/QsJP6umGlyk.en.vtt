 [Music] 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.899
 Hello 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.260
 Today we are going to learn a very secret. 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.969
 important as does french fries 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.130
 I know for sure you're going to 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.969
 home or if you do not like 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.680
 French fries 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.779
 must have someone in the family or 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.160
 friends who like and the big secret is 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.740
 potato chips you 'll learn now 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.600
 here with us to start we have 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.160
 who choose the potato very well 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.109
 people are going to work and have a difference 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.369
 great among the potatoes that people 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.500
 find on the market 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.600
 this potato here called toast potato 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.880
 it's not for frying and that's what we 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.250
 forget it now and we should use this 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.230
 here is the potato called asterix or 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.149
 that potato that has a 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.239
 more rosy but you 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.340
 You will now see peeling inside it 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.440
 well any white 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.010
 because we use this and do not use that 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.989
 this one has less water 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.300
 inside it, which means that at the time of 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.430
 fry it crisp and more 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.500
 perfect and then there is no secret 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.420
 and you do not need to put alcohol 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.189
 more flour 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.960
 none of this is just cut her size 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.670
 sure and put to fry the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.110
 temperature in the oil also 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:17.540
 Right temperature let's dig potatoes 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:19.500
 [Music] 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.390
 then she peeled 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.430
 We already start cutting her in the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.900
 right size so we can 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.159
 make the potato chips its size is the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.659
 the size of the potato we call 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.229
 French fries 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.229
 so she's about the same size 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.799
 [Music] 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.380
 Good, the potato is already cut. 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.000
 they are all a very similar size 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.160
 Of course if you want a potato 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.590
 perfect if you have to eliminate some 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.360
 potatoes like these here now to make 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.510
 at home for the family to be very tasty 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.420
 a little secret and I recommend you to 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.390
 house have thermometer on a thermometer 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.709
 cheap does not have to be expensive but it has 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.050
 to get to a more temperature 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.000
 or minus 250 degrees with that 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.650
 I'm going to measure the temperature of the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.050
 oil and that's what will make the potato 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.640
 It looks so delicious and so crispy I have 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.700
 that having the eye now at a temperature 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.160
 more or less 180 degrees 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.310
 well then how do you see he's there? 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.720
 in plus or minus 180 degrees 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.870
 You do not have to worry either. 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.970
 so I'll put it and now please 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.950
 be very careful about the potato ladet if you do not 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:46.760
 feel secure can put with a 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:49.850
 skimmer can put here with some 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.980
 other some other tool the 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.980
 important is you do not get burned 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:09.030
 the potato chips ready now I go 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:13.650
 to line a baking sheet with enough paper 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.400
 absorbing so I can choose this 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.400
 French fries 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.810
 here all our chips 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.330
 now after she takes a shower she is 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.340
 Time for us to put the salt and for her 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.340
 stay at that point she stole more or 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.080
 less there about 20 to 25 minutes but the 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:52.319
 her point when she arrives at this 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:55.870
 so we can be healthy and 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:04.300
 so we make french fries 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:04.300
