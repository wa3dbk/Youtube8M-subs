00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
with people in rejuvenation medicine so

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.880 
with people in rejuvenation medicine so
I<00:00:24.000> work<00:00:24.300> with<00:00:24.449> people<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:25.320> really<00:00:25.470> recover

the<00:01:35.220> same<00:01:35.430> way<00:01:35.640> most<00:01:36.299> people<00:01:36.479> try<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.869> and

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
the same way most people try and and

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.380 
the same way most people try and and
chase<00:01:37.860> energy<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> surface<00:01:38.939> by<00:01:39.090> doing

chase energy on the surface by doing

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.850 
chase energy on the surface by doing
things<00:01:39.509> like<00:01:39.720> caffeine<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.290> nicotine<00:01:40.320> which

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
things like caffeine and nicotine which

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.069 
things like caffeine and nicotine which
gives<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.220> these<00:01:41.369> peaks<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.880> valleys

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
gives you these peaks and valleys

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.990 
gives you these peaks and valleys
without<00:01:43.079> supporting<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.220> reservoir<00:01:44.850> of
