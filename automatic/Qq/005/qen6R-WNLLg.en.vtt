00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.090
 recomposed and five 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.219
 hello everyone today I bring you the myth 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.190
 number 91 this time in call of duty world 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.360
 at war in call of duty 5 as you see now 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.340
 same I am become a zombie and 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.440
 I'm using a patch of those 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.870
 Old old men and a hack 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.090
 those old ones and good is a little 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.680
 rough but good here as you see I'm 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.110
 become a zombie that is not the myth 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.760
 the myth mainly a very sound 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.620
 Old meaning that is older than the 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.079
 to shit to imagine when shitting to go shit 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.420
 I'm old that this myth is the same video 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.280
 it's worth saying that I know this from 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.410
 about the year 2008 that I think was 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.930
 that this map came out this game from this 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.550
 map we are on the map of dog and good 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.350
 there is a verse now that gives them 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.120
 for saying things that people think that 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.030
 he has found them they are 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.030
 wrong 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.820
 well they say that being out there 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.079
 the patio that we're going to be now 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.150
 they say that in principle you could be 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.100
 there such playing normal but they are 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.170
 wrong we're going to forget 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.299
 this the myth basically is that they say 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.979
 here is a submachine gun in it 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.050
 this source there is a submachine gun worth in 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.240
 concrete the ms 42 as you are seeing 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.250
 now let me press the square and if I 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.770
 lets shoot the truth that if you're 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.080
 submachine gun there but in principle the myth 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.070
 is that under this source is that 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.690
 machine gun 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.640
 Now you're going to see that I'm going to 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.619
 take the use mode I put it under there 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.560
 and you will see what is good 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.509
 it's mostly worth how are you going to see 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.970
 Well now you're going to see it a little better 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.940
 there is a pillar just below a 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.140
 small tower a tower there small one 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.869
 pillar vale 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.640
 below what is this source and yes that 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.770
 it's totally true yes it's true what 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.240
 you're going to see a little better so it 's 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.580
 that machine gun and bass and that you are 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.130
 amg 42 there 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.220
 what is the point of none of them because 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.900
 we're off the map, I 'm saying that 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.810
 I do not know why the truth is here 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.510
 but I think it's more of a failure 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.940
 worth or directly something they have wanted 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.060
 put there because if there are bad people who 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.620
 says that in principle this yard is worth 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.840
 was going to be an area of â€‹â€‹the game where 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.850
 we will be able to play normally normal 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.100
 we will put it around spinning and 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.840
 but how was it going to be too easy 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.760
 that they eliminated him if they wanted 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.380
 eliminate it would have eliminated that 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.450
 also if they have not removed it because 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.100
 I like them, so I think 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.450
 that this is there because if they have 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.000
 I felt the truth but I do not think that 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.880
 outside because this patio was going to be a 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.220
 playable zone not playing normal more than 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.270
 nothing because if not all the windows that 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.950
 there's out there would not make any sense 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.720
 are those windows are for something 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.850
 because zombies are supposed to always 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.520
 they come from outside the map inside the 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.380
 map are not giving do not enter from or 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.760
 I do not mean do not enter from within 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.440
 of the map within the map do not enter 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.480
 always come from the outside in 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.670
 once they are inside the map they do not return 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.870
 to leave or re-enter is a bit 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.150
 I'm messing up what I'm saying but good 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.740
 sure someone understands me 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.540
 I mean that this patio is in a 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.730
 principle I doubt very much that from a 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.440
 would have thought that it would be 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.460
 playable that then it was not going to be playable 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.190
 because if this had not been eliminated 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.630
 just like they eliminate other kinds of things 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.930
 you can eliminate this too if you do not 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.120
 they have removed because they have not wanted 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.340
 Total always knows that if my 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.620
 cousin that if my friend that if the other that 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.909
 they have been told which I am coming 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.439
 folio in a thousand such a good story the 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.719
 myth is totally true if true 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:34.389
 is this machine gun here in the m 42 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:36.250
 this is not new as I say this as 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.049
 minimum of the year 2008 around more or less 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.200
 that was when this map came out 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.670
 game in particular too and they are not things 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.079
 new that because someone says it now 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.200
 does not mean that this is new to me 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.189
 you are but come on, you are there to me 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.220
 with this myth 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:53.169
 there is a there is a 42 is the submachine gun yes 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.959
 but I'm very old this is already known 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:57.280
 marico, I think you already know but well 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.560
 I think a lot of you do not 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.139
 well knew why I bring you good 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.269
 this myth number 91 is totally true 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.340
 if this submachine gun and what sense 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.439
 has none because it is off the map 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.870
 that people want to think that that was 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.219
 a playable area because they think that 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.980
 think about it I think that I do not believe that 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:17.799
 they have put or because it has been a grace 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.289
 of one of the creators or because 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.210
 just me that I know I do not know what sense 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.039
 it has to be there the truth I do not know but 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.080
 I doubt very much that's why because if 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.400
 that's why the windows there are 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.020
 there the stairs everything there is for 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.659
 there would not have any sense of 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.789
 done if we went through one of the tunnels 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:35.409
 what's out there that the map is not 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.330
 full there are missing walls there 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:39.159
 things that are missing there is that is 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.349
 let's say ah and there's no shortage of walls in that 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:43.659
 patio because from inside the map we see 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:45.699
 the yard is worth it but usually when 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:48.130
 there is an area where you do not see many 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.690
 sometimes they save having to put a 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.849
 wall are saved in having to put the 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.169
 piece of soil and things like that so 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:55.000
 I doubt it was because of that but that the 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.409
 myth if it's totally true so 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.970
 I do not expect you to like it if it has 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:59.470
 liked to vote i like it and favorites and 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.699
 especially leave my mom behind the 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.230
 comments so we can continue with 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:07.070
 this series greetings to all 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.070
 the cataract 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.729
 re contenta and fire
