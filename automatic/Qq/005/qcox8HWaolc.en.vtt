00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
so anyway moving on there's also another

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.940 
so anyway moving on there's also another
slightly<00:02:27.820> different<00:02:28.680> graphical<00:02:29.680> mode<00:02:29.800> that

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
slightly different graphical mode that

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.140 
slightly different graphical mode that
you<00:02:30.040> can<00:02:30.130> actually<00:02:30.250> download<00:02:30.520> if<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:30.880> want<00:02:31.060> to

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
again this one actually improves the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.860 
again this one actually improves the
brightness<00:02:33.250> contrast<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.330> colors<00:02:34.660> and

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
brightness contrast and the colors and

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.300 
brightness contrast and the colors and
again<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.170> can<00:02:35.200> actually<00:02:35.440> tell<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:35.980> looks<00:02:36.160> a

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
again you can actually tell it looks a

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.920 
again you can actually tell it looks a
lot<00:02:36.520> better<00:02:36.850> especially<00:02:37.090> when<00:02:37.600> you<00:02:37.660> look<00:02:37.840> at

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
lot better especially when you look at

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.840 
lot better especially when you look at
the<00:02:37.990> cause<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.650> reflections<00:02:39.250> on<00:02:39.400> them<00:02:39.580> they

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
the cause the reflections on them they

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.640 
the cause the reflections on them they
look<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.150> lot<00:02:40.360> brighter<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.200> em<00:02:41.440> they<00:02:41.620> just

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
look a lot brighter and em they just

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.860 
look a lot brighter and em they just
look<00:02:41.950> so<00:02:42.220> much<00:02:42.550> more<00:02:42.610> HD<00:02:43.360> so<00:02:43.540> much<00:02:43.690> more

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
look so much more HD so much more

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.500 
look so much more HD so much more
realistic<00:02:44.470> than<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.550> usually<00:02:45.730> does<00:02:45.970> obviously

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
realistic than it usually does obviously

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.330
