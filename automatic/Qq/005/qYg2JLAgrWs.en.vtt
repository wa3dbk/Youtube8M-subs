you<00:01:39.119> will<00:01:39.240> get<00:01:39.360> better<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.020> long<00:01:40.290> run<00:01:40.500> and

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.250 
and they're getting better feedback is
important<00:02:14.850> because<00:02:15.000> even<00:02:15.450> if<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.810> just<00:02:15.990> watch

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
important because even if you just watch

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.380 
important because even if you just watch
a<00:02:16.680> video<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.700> know<00:02:17.820> sometimes<00:02:18.180> you're<00:02:18.330> not

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390

someone who has more expertise than you

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.410 
someone who has more expertise than you

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
see you know way more holes in my game

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.320

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
than I can because he has experience and

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.540 
than I can because he has experience and
so<00:02:30.450> having<00:02:30.740> somewhat<00:02:31.740> more<00:02:32.010> experience<00:02:32.520> to

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550
