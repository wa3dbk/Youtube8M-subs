 and the theme of the frozen movie 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:05:07.979
 the most successful movie in history 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:05:09.989
 of the bronx all the snow fell in dividing 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.819
 in the snow that happened in your house when 

00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:14.189

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:19.039
 your mom barceló tower your dad say tower 

00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:19.039
 your uncle 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:30.449
 Mr. Enrique pinti how he saw the 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:33.619
 small although the tower is small in 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.619
 age and small in stature 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:48.409
 I am a fan of frozen I have the 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:48.409
 absolutely subject 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:06:03.820
 I imagine she is an ideal little princess 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.330
 perfect because it is in the physical roll 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.750
 total 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:11.490
 wonderful ideal and with a tuning to 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.490
 bulletproof so I loved it 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.680
 also 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.539
 I look at the middle half that is the future 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.400
 that the future of this is incredible 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:26.669
 because they are very tiny they are very 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.569
 young girls and how suddenly 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:30.280
 scattered on stage a lot 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:32.469
 of things that you have inside and not you 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.870

 the black look of produce 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.639
 to me strikes me that at 15 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:49.960
 years this voice that one is changing with 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:53.130
 the time is so placed and so pure 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:56.290
 so perfect and that I get to those shades 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.970
