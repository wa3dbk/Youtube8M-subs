and then a simple quiz that if you make

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.630 
and then a simple quiz that if you make
an<00:01:13.619> error<00:01:13.970> provides<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:15.240> hints<00:01:15.630> and

some<00:01:22.380> body<00:01:22.560> structures<00:01:23.100> are<00:01:23.250> not<00:01:23.340> contained

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
some body structures are not contained

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.499 
some body structures are not contained
within<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.240> region<00:01:25.640> let's<00:01:26.640> say<00:01:26.850> that's<00:01:27.119> true

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
within a region let's say that's true

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.600 
within a region let's say that's true
and<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.320> says<00:01:28.530> one<00:01:28.710> purpose<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.280> define

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
and it says one purpose to define

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.700 
and it says one purpose to define
regions<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.360> localize<00:01:30.750> body<00:01:31.049> structures

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
regions is to localize body structures

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.719 
regions is to localize body structures
so<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.520> must<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:32.850> false<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.729> then

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
so it must be false and it is and then

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.950 
so it must be false and it is and then
here<00:01:35.939> if<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.299> click<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.750> right

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
here if you have to click on the right

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.190 
here if you have to click on the right
foot<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.290> proceed<00:01:38.299> many<00:01:39.299> beginners<00:01:39.600> click<00:01:40.020> on

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
this foot and it's on there right but we

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.670 
this foot and it's on there right but we
learn<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:44.810> left<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.049> right<00:01:46.229> are<00:01:46.350> always

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
learn that left and right are always

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.950 
learn that left and right are always
defined<00:01:46.860> with<00:01:47.250> respect<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> patient<00:01:48.299> and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
defined with respect to the patient and

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.950 
defined with respect to the patient and
this<00:01:49.470> goes<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.979> for<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> while<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.450> when<00:01:51.840> it

plane we have a section from an actual
PET<00:02:37.079> scan<00:02:37.579> that<00:02:38.579> makes<00:02:38.849> it<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.090> little<00:02:39.180> more

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
PET scan that makes it a little more

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.330 
PET scan that makes it a little more
real<00:02:40.640> when<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.819> see<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.920> plane

corresponding to an actual imagery we

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.569 
corresponding to an actual imagery we
talk<00:02:49.260> about<00:02:50.900> proximal<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.079> distal<00:02:52.109> in<00:02:52.739> the

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
talk about proximal and distal in the

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.640 
talk about proximal and distal in the
same<00:02:53.819> manner<00:02:54.120> with<00:02:54.599> an<00:02:54.750> animation<00:02:55.139> we're

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
same manner with an animation we're

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.530 
same manner with an animation we're
moving<00:02:56.010> proximally<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.940> then<00:02:57.239> we're<00:02:57.420> moving

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
moving proximally and then we're moving

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.979 
moving proximally and then we're moving
distally<00:02:59.120> this<00:03:00.120> kind<00:03:00.359> of<00:03:00.450> interactivity

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
distally this kind of interactivity

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.860 
distally this kind of interactivity
really<00:03:01.530> hammers<00:03:01.950> home<00:03:02.159> the<00:03:02.340> point<00:03:02.609> and<00:03:02.939> again

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
really hammers home the point and again

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.830 
really hammers home the point and again
for<00:03:04.139> this<00:03:04.230> section<00:03:04.530> we've<00:03:05.220> got<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.730> recap<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.629> a

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
for this section we've got a recap and a

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.259 
for this section we've got a recap and a
short<00:03:07.109> quiz<00:03:07.439> and<00:03:08.340> then<00:03:08.609> we<00:03:08.790> get<00:03:08.909> into<00:03:09.060> the

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
short quiz and then we get into the

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.199 
short quiz and then we get into the
special<00:03:09.540> motions<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.470> joint<00:03:11.180> such<00:03:12.180> as

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
special motions of the joint such as

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.899 
special motions of the joint such as
flexion<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.049> extension<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:14.310> motions<00:03:14.760> are

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
flexion and extension the motions are

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:20.140 
flexion and extension the motions are
off<00:03:15.349> always<00:03:16.940> for<00:03:17.940> trading<00:03:18.269> pairs<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.680> have

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
off always for trading pairs so you have

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.809 
off always for trading pairs so you have
flexion<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.359> one<00:03:22.019> direction<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.819> extension

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
flexion in one direction and extension

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.729 
flexion in one direction and extension
in<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.030> opposite<00:03:24.449> direction<00:03:24.629> and<00:03:25.169> here<00:03:25.620> you

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
in the opposite direction and here you

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.369 
in the opposite direction and here you
can<00:03:25.859> see<00:03:26.069> Jessica<00:03:26.579> going<00:03:26.790> through<00:03:27.379> flexion

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
can see Jessica going through flexion

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.819 
can see Jessica going through flexion
and<00:03:28.470> extension<00:03:28.590> for<00:03:29.280> several<00:03:29.639> joints<00:03:30.680> we<00:03:31.680> do

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
and extension for several joints we do

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.470 
and extension for several joints we do
the<00:03:31.980> same<00:03:32.190> thing<00:03:32.519> for<00:03:32.760> abduction<00:03:33.359> and

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
the same thing for abduction and

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.149 
the same thing for abduction and
adduction<00:03:36.049> which<00:03:37.049> makes<00:03:37.349> it<00:03:37.500> much<00:03:37.650> easier<00:03:37.709> to

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
adduction which makes it much easier to

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.220 
adduction which makes it much easier to
understand<00:03:38.639> through<00:03:38.970> simple<00:03:39.329> animations<00:03:39.989> and

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
understand through simple animations and

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.289 
understand through simple animations and
interactivity<00:03:40.859> than<00:03:41.489> simply<00:03:41.909> looking<00:03:42.209> at

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
interactivity than simply looking at

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.960 
interactivity than simply looking at
pictures<00:03:42.919> we<00:03:43.919> can<00:03:44.040> talk<00:03:44.310> about<00:03:44.459> things<00:03:44.879> like

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
pictures we can talk about things like

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.629 
pictures we can talk about things like
the<00:03:45.239> hip<00:03:45.419> range<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.930> motion<00:03:46.379> which<00:03:47.159> might<00:03:47.430> be<00:03:47.609> a

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
the hip range of motion which might be a

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.330 
the hip range of motion which might be a
little<00:03:47.879> difficult<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.629> understand<00:03:49.530> just

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
little difficult to understand just

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.280 
little difficult to understand just
looking<00:03:50.609> at<00:03:50.699> still<00:03:50.909> images<00:03:51.389> but<00:03:51.930> here<00:03:52.079> we<00:03:52.199> get

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
looking at still images but here we get

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.270 
looking at still images but here we get
to<00:03:52.440> actually<00:03:52.790> play<00:03:53.790> with<00:03:53.819> it<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.209> bit<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:55.250> again

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
to actually play with it a bit and again

but here we have our various motion here
we<00:04:03.900> have<00:04:04.049> our<00:04:04.199> valgus<00:04:04.709> motion<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.959> it's

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
we have our valgus motion and it's

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.369 
we have our valgus motion and it's
cemented<00:04:07.379> into<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.889> brain<00:04:08.129> quite<00:04:08.370> quickly
