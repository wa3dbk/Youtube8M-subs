00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.330
 or because of my indifferent channel in 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.700
 family today touches candy both for 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.910
 the child that is actually a leather 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.010
 How fruit is made is how you make a 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.230
 mash and then it does dry and then what 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.240
 short and are like caramelitos does not 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.030
 lack sugar purpose or nothing is and 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.990
 it's super rich the thing you have to have 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:28.619
 a dehydration mine is that 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.449
 round vale there are some much better 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.570
 that is to my market that are 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.670
 rectangular super large super more 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.120
 simple because there are angles but it costs 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.309
 a pasta 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.150
 I can not so I have that one that has 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.760
 cost with shipping 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.490
 45 euros from germany 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.910
 very well is very well I do not know if you know 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:56.610
 how it works that there is an engine here 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:59.790
 and here then there are trays like that with 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.190
 trays and you're there your fruits and 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.400
 dried vegetables 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.070
 what is the thing of that is that is that not 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.040
 use a lot cross and vegans because you 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.490
 dry the food without knowing it and save 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.250
 all its nutrients do not go more than 40 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.560
 degrees because if there were more than 40 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.200
 degrees would kill everything 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.200
 minerals vitamins and all that then 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 let's make a mash of banana and mango 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 OK 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.580
 I teach 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.360
 very easy bananas one thing that I 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.210
 forgot to say bananas when they have 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.400
 black spots like that when they're more than 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.410
 other days is when they are the best for 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.140
 health to me I do not like to eat bananas 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.580
 well for nothing then I hope that it 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.240
 put on the brown spots because 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.240
 I know it's better 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.090
 Y 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:09.429
 because then I have the bananas very 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:13.920
 matured at my level and I'm going to cut it was 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.920
 the figure which is now the handle 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.349
 I've also done it with peaches 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.349
 ah 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.250
 oranges 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.300
 the only thing I'm going to put is a bit of 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.300
 cinnamon 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.080
 enough now with that I'm going to 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.970
 crush and make 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.610
 a puree 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.290
 although I already have everything crushed what 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.290
 I'll throw myself now is to throw cinnamon 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.560
 a richer cream that looks like things 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.830
 we have stopped the babies 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:11.270
 then I take the tray 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:15.970
 of my dehydrator here I put the 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.970
 ordinary vegetable paper that is made 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:27.950
 rectangular then I'll show you 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:31.750
 super easy you have your tray with the 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:35.260
 paper placed and I'm going to throw 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.750
 tourÃ© do not put it too thick that or 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.590
 otherwise it will never dry out or have to 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.680
 wait days because you know that with that 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.290
 they are more or less 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.010
 10 hours but as each machine is 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.590
 different you go looking at how it is 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.390
 good not too fine and too much 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.960
 thick 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.960
 mother 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.410
 this is going to be used a lot once 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.520
 titled very well because I have a lot 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.130
 Hurry and if I have some pieces very bad 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.700
 very bad 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.220
 and it stays with you to see it take off from the paper and 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:19.020
 you have a piece of leather to cut in 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.020
 bits and you have left 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.350
 it's great 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.350
 and mine loves 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:39.110
 apart from making that fruit ass 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:44.080
 also what there is friend for less than 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:46.470
 banana is your banana bag still 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.500
 pretty mature 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.180
 like they are the best 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.180
 very anticancer 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.260
 true 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.860
 sliced 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:15.430
 and there's no need to put it on paper 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:15.430
 because it does not fall and you throw it like that 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.690
 equal about 10 hours and then you get 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:25.240
 well he used declared that he has nothing 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.030
 what to do with the dried bananas that 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.690
 they buy in the supermarket 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.220
 that gives a thousand laps without sugar without 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.729
 nothing serious 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:40.680
 created my laps giving 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.680
 then you have a recipe here 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.740
 also have candies but healthy without 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:52.950
 nothing has added no sugar like fruit 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:54.810
 you already have your sugar there is nothing worth 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.520
 2 silver candies you can make 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.160
 also peach and that but singing 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.260
 who loves children like that even though 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.800
 they like bananas and the neck of 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:08.990
 fruit that when dried and put so 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.990
 You can make scissors and that's it 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.920
 see you later
