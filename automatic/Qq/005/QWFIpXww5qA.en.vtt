or ago color changing LED light bulbs
found<00:00:06.720> here<00:00:07.049> in<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.799> bathroom<00:00:08.309> we<00:00:09.300> have<00:00:09.540> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
found here in the bathroom we have the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.950 
found here in the bathroom we have the
gu10<00:00:10.710> version<00:00:12.410> the<00:00:13.410> spot<00:00:13.710> light<00:00:13.889> version<00:00:14.960> what

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
gu10 version the spot light version what

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.400 
gu10 version the spot light version what
they<00:00:16.139> are<00:00:16.490> our<00:00:17.490> bulbs<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.300> can<00:00:18.990> be<00:00:19.140> color

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
they are our bulbs that can be color

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.550 
they are our bulbs that can be color
changed<00:00:20.660> remotely<00:00:21.660> by<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:23.070> remote<00:00:23.310> control

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
changed remotely by the remote control

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.500 
changed remotely by the remote control
one<00:00:25.560> remote<00:00:25.859> control<00:00:26.310> will<00:00:26.490> control<00:00:26.849> all<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
one remote control will control all the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.800 
one remote control will control all the
bulbs<00:00:27.769> within<00:00:28.769> range<00:00:28.980> any<00:00:29.369> or<00:00:29.820> iglo<00:00:30.090> bulb<00:00:30.390> will

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
bulbs within range any or iglo bulb will

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.209 
bulbs within range any or iglo bulb will
be<00:00:30.929> controlled<00:00:31.380> by<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.560> remote<00:00:31.710> control<00:00:34.219> so

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
be controlled by the remote control so

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.660 
be controlled by the remote control so
they've<00:00:35.430> gone<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.730> blow<00:00:36.980> or<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.370> put<00:00:38.520> them

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
they've gone to blow or you can put them

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.510 
they've gone to blow or you can put them
onto<00:00:38.850> normal<00:00:39.629> white<00:00:39.840> light<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.530> course<00:00:41.370> you

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
onto normal white light of course you

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.729 
onto normal white light of course you
can<00:00:41.670> turn<00:00:41.850> them<00:00:42.000> off<00:00:42.210> or<00:00:44.180> back<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.780> here

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
can turn them off or back on and here

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.180 
can turn them off or back on and here
we've<00:00:46.860> got<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.100> fast<00:00:47.370> color<00:00:47.670> change<00:00:47.969> setting

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
we've got the fast color change setting

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.799 
we've got the fast color change setting
this<00:00:50.190> will<00:00:50.430> change<00:00:51.270> all<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.660> bulbs<00:00:51.899> in

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
this will change all the bulbs in

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.590 
this will change all the bulbs in
synchronization<00:00:55.370> quite<00:00:56.370> fast<00:00:56.699> or<00:00:57.270> you've<00:00:57.510> got

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
synchronization quite fast or you've got

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.349 
synchronization quite fast or you've got
a<00:00:57.629> slow<00:00:57.899> color<00:00:58.199> change<00:00:58.500> setting<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.820> program

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
a slow color change setting this program

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.349 
a slow color change setting this program
will<00:01:00.739> gradually<00:01:01.739> change<00:01:02.399> from<00:01:02.609> each<00:01:02.789> color<00:01:03.090> in

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
will gradually change from each color in

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.250 
will gradually change from each color in
the<00:01:04.229> spectrum<00:01:04.710> very<00:01:05.159> very<00:01:05.430> slowly<00:01:05.930> as<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.110> can

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the spectrum very very slowly as you can

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.800 
the spectrum very very slowly as you can
see<00:01:07.439> they<00:01:07.590> look<00:01:07.619> very<00:01:07.770> very<00:01:08.580> innovative<00:01:08.850> or

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
see they look very very innovative or

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.300 
see they look very very innovative or
you<00:01:10.020> probably<00:01:10.170> can't<00:01:10.500> say<00:01:10.710> because<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.159> is

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
you probably can't say because this is

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.580 
you probably can't say because this is
quite<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.880> poor<00:01:12.510> video<00:01:12.869> because<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.439> just

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
quite a poor video because it's just

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.530 
quite a poor video because it's just
filmed<00:01:13.890> with<00:01:13.979> my<00:01:14.010> phone<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:15.000> not<00:01:15.210> doing

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
filmed with my phone and it's not doing

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.070 
filmed with my phone and it's not doing
the<00:01:16.229> bulbs<00:01:16.619> any<00:01:16.860> justice<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.850> they<00:01:18.689> say

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
the bulbs any justice but they say

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.390 
the bulbs any justice but they say
they're<00:01:19.439> slowly<00:01:19.740> slowly<00:01:20.430> changing<00:01:22.280> for<00:01:23.280> each

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
they're slowly slowly changing for each

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.520 
they're slowly slowly changing for each
color<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.909> spectrum<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.869> also<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.290> can

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
color in the spectrum and also you can

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.070 
color in the spectrum and also you can
dim<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.979> bulbs<00:01:26.400> with<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> remote<00:01:26.939> control<00:01:27.080> or

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
dim the bulbs with the remote control or

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.370 
dim the bulbs with the remote control or
you<00:01:28.170> can<00:01:28.290> brighten<00:01:28.530> them<00:01:28.710> up<00:01:30.079> so<00:01:31.079> they<00:01:31.229> can

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
you can brighten them up so they can

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.030 
you can brighten them up so they can
also<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.770> dimmed<00:01:31.979> by<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.280> remote<00:01:32.549> control

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
also be dimmed by the remote control

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.249 
also be dimmed by the remote control
