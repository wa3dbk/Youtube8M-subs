00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.450
 Forecast 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.430
 we are transmitting from the 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.050
 operational center in trees like Pablo 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.730
 paris guerrillo leon we have arrived at 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.910
 end of the season of the nfl the super 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.890
 bowl 49 on February 1 has been found 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.890
 from england and now it appears as 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.890
 favorite -1 the totals on the line 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.600
 they are at 48 points and a half Juan Pablo 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.400
 I like to say hello, a thousand friends 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.620
 of beatriz good remember that there are three 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.230
 ways to forecast mainly 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.030
 for this super goal 49 to the result 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.250
 where you simply choose the 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.100
 winner of the match by any margin 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.570
 to the total that is the worker yonder or as 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.510
 he is known in Mexico and in some 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.059
 other parts the highs and the lows where 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.520
 you must add the number of points in 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.489
 this case is at 48 and a half and the line 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.320
 handicap where it opens minus 1 they cycled this 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.480
 it means that the whole of that 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.280
 tree must win by two points or more my 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.590
 recommendation would be that they take 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.960
 48 and a half low between these two teams 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.509
 it could be a lot since seven 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.909
 weeks on defense 1 and 2 of the 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.619
 nfl in the case of Aaron we must say 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.340
 it's just the second team since 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.670
 season 69 to 71 when minnesota was 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.200
 the best defense in the league in points 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.759
 accepted three years in a row has no longer 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.799
 been the best defense in points in 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.869
 against and new england listen to you 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.959
 in the fourth rooms and specifically 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.060
 the second halves 40 offensives of the 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:36.459
 rivals only seven have come to the area 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.890
 red and they have scored 12 points in 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:40.840
 last seven weeks specifically 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.459
 with Pablo in the second half 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.950
 today we must also remind you that in 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.869
 this case 9 england they did they were 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.229
 of the few teams that had more 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.780
 over or highs that fall and walk in this 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.640
 Case 9 England reached eleven counting 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.759
 regular season and postseason 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.979
 while aaron reached 10 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.590
 combined way so regularly 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.229
 these teams are the ones that score the most 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.119
 points or surpass the total line that's 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.399
 very important and finally the line 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.549
 emilio handicap where the set 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.720
 desired open -1 this is going to be 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.300
 moving 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.700
 of the 15 days could even appear 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.770
 at some favorable time for new 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.140
 england tom brady will play his sixth 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.750
 superbowl a brand in the history of the 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.820
 nfl and also tell them that all the 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.280
 day lost the last two games of 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.680
 super bowl that have been played in 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.770
 where this match is going to take place in 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.480
 everything and also mention that the favorites 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.250
 in the last three editions have 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.620
 lost the game and in four in the 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.810
 last six being nine england in 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.840
 two occasions lose officiating as they 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.910
 we said with Pablo less one will win or 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.860
 you will lose this super step and you have to 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.660
 remind them also emilio that is very 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.030
 important that they go to the section of 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.090
 nfl and find the different 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.790
 propositions there will be forecasts for 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.640
 each player for different moves and 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.920
 of course around the game not 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.500
 miss the chance to do it live 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.160
 it just becomes one more emotion 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.720
 big 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.540
 abraham and champion or there will be a new 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.020
 champion in the nfl the last to win two 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.570
 consecutive titles 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.400
 just new england is already more 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.020
 ten years we say goodbye with towns 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.390
