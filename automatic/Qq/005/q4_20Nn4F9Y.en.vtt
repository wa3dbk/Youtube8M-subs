00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
like this is the big boss scope so I'm

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.710 
like this is the big boss scope so I'm
fighting<00:05:45.340> at<00:05:45.550> dawn<00:05:45.700> at<00:05:45.820> the<00:05:45.880> moment<00:05:46.120> I'm<00:05:46.570> going

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
fighting at dawn at the moment I'm going

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.480 
fighting at dawn at the moment I'm going
to<00:05:46.780> start<00:05:47.050> this<00:05:47.169> one<00:05:47.230> hopefully<00:05:47.650> if<00:05:48.190> I've<00:05:48.340> got

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
to start this one hopefully if I've got

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.830 
to start this one hopefully if I've got
enough<00:05:48.700> energy<00:05:48.880> so<00:05:49.090> on<00:05:49.419> the<00:05:49.510> right<00:05:49.630> hand<00:05:49.780> side

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
enough energy so on the right hand side

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.900 
enough energy so on the right hand side
take<00:05:50.830> that<00:05:51.040> I<00:05:51.070> think<00:05:51.370> that<00:05:51.490> gives<00:05:51.640> me<00:05:51.760> a<00:05:51.820> better

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
take that I think that gives me a better

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.120 
take that I think that gives me a better
chance<00:05:52.210> of<00:05:52.330> winning<00:05:52.660> and<00:05:53.260> so<00:05:53.470> like<00:05:53.650> say<00:05:53.830> it's<00:05:54.040> a

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
chance of winning and so like say it's a

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.170 
chance of winning and so like say it's a
bit<00:05:54.310> difficult<00:05:54.669> to<00:05:54.700> get<00:05:54.820> through<00:05:54.970> if<00:05:55.090> you

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
bit difficult to get through if you

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.600 
bit difficult to get through if you
don't<00:05:55.390> really<00:05:55.690> understand<00:05:56.110> Japanese<00:05:56.610> and
