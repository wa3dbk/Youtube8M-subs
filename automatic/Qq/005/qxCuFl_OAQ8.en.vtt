had wondering all the Walkman here what
are<00:00:06.720> things<00:00:06.839> whenever<00:00:07.170> you're<00:00:07.350> designing<00:00:07.710> a

this particular one is available in F 24
and<00:00:44.430> F<00:00:44.640> 34<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.570> I'm<00:00:46.410> actually<00:00:46.590> using<00:00:46.829> right

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
and F 34 and I'm actually using right

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.040 
and F 34 and I'm actually using right
now<00:00:47.190> an<00:00:47.340> F<00:00:47.460> 24<00:00:47.969> set<00:00:48.239> up<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.840> see<00:00:49.020> I

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
now an F 24 set up just so you can see I

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.220 
now an F 24 set up just so you can see I
just<00:00:49.170> quickly<00:00:49.500> set<00:00:49.829> these<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.789> new<00:00:50.940> pro

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
just quickly set these up on the new pro

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.260 
just quickly set these up on the new pro
3500<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.129> really<00:00:53.370> cool<00:00:53.550> because<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.969> mean

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
3500 this is really cool because I mean

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.750 
3500 this is really cool because I mean
I<00:00:54.300> could<00:00:55.170> possibly<00:00:55.980> put<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> bulb<00:00:56.460> machine

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
I could possibly put the bulb machine

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.639 
I could possibly put the bulb machine
there<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.629> bracket<00:00:58.020> may<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.320> go<00:00:58.500> in

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
there but the bracket may not go in

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.049 
there but the bracket may not go in
there<00:00:58.829> or<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.190> may<00:00:59.280> not<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.460> easy<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.820> hang<00:00:59.940> it

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
there or it may not be easy to hang it

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.340 
there or it may not be easy to hang it
up<00:01:00.120> straight<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.510> there<00:01:00.660> another<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
up straight in there another one the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.930 
up straight in there another one the
bubbles<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.800> close<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> lights<00:01:02.520> anyways

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
bubbles that close to the lights anyways

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.329 
bubbles that close to the lights anyways
because<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.600> bubbles<00:01:04.409> made<00:01:04.619> Bowl<00:01:04.890> back<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
because so bubbles made Bowl back and

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.070 
because so bubbles made Bowl back and
get<00:01:05.519> all<00:01:05.549> over<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.060> lights<00:01:06.270> or<00:01:06.689> wasn't

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
get all over the lights or wasn't

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.410 
get all over the lights or wasn't
somebody<00:01:07.260> else<00:01:07.770> dances<00:01:08.729> right<00:01:08.880> up<00:01:09.030> against

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
somebody else dances right up against

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.090 
somebody else dances right up against
the<00:01:09.540> system<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.049> shakes<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.560> enough<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
the system and shakes it just enough to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.620 
the system and shakes it just enough to
shake<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> little<00:01:11.549> bit<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.760> bubbles<00:01:12.030> loose<00:01:12.240> you

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
shake a little bit of bubbles loose you

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570 
shake a little bit of bubbles loose you
want<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.900> keep<00:01:12.990> things<00:01:13.170> separated<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.400> is

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
want to keep things separated this is

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.700 
want to keep things separated this is
the<00:01:14.700> right<00:01:14.880> tool<00:01:15.150> for<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.450> job<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:16.350> real<00:01:16.530> quick

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the right tool for the job so real quick

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.830 
the right tool for the job so real quick
let's<00:01:16.740> see<00:01:17.100> how<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.369> works<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.909> how<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.600> can

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
let's see how it works and how you can

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.760 
let's see how it works and how you can
take<00:01:18.960> advantage<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:20.119> now<00:01:21.119> I'm<00:01:21.299> short<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.320> I

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
take advantage of it now I'm short so I

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.010 
take advantage of it now I'm short so I
don't<00:01:23.610> really<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.880> mean<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.060> could<00:01:24.270> come<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:24.780> with

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
don't really I mean I could come up with

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.050 
don't really I mean I could come up with
a<00:01:25.080> very<00:01:25.229> top<00:01:25.470> part<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.430> intensive<00:01:26.880> all

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
a very top part but for intensive all

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.520 
a very top part but for intensive all
intents<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.479> purposes<00:01:27.570> we're<00:01:28.200> going<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.350> go

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
intents and purposes we're going to go

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.109 
intents and purposes we're going to go
ahead<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:29.850> clamp<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.990> bottom

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
ahead and just clamp it on the bottom

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.780 
ahead and just clamp it on the bottom
now<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.180> f24<00:01:34.140> has<00:01:34.439> two<00:01:34.680> clamps<00:01:35.130> evenly<00:01:35.520> spaced

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
now the f24 has two clamps evenly spaced

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.850 
now the f24 has two clamps evenly spaced
to<00:01:36.030> match<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.420> trussing<00:01:36.810> perfectly<00:01:37.380> they're

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
to match the trussing perfectly they're

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.069 
to match the trussing perfectly they're
not<00:01:38.040> bolted<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.579> they<00:01:38.820> are<00:01:39.030> welded<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:39.900> this

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
not bolted on they are welded on so this

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.590 
not bolted on they are welded on so this
puppy<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.619> going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:41.100> stay<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.670> there<00:01:41.880> nice<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
puppy is going to stay in there nice and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.920 
puppy is going to stay in there nice and
tight<00:01:43.130> we<00:01:44.130> had<00:01:44.280> an<00:01:44.369> event<00:01:44.490> with<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.210> f34

tight we had an event with the f34

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.740 
tight we had an event with the f34
trussing<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:47.070> hung<00:01:47.310> our<00:01:47.490> bone<00:01:47.670> machine<00:01:48.090> or

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
trussing and we hung our bone machine or

trussing and we hung our bone machine or
a<00:01:48.810> actually<00:01:49.259> used<00:01:49.439> two<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.649> these<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.430> one

the other side we had the UFO that way
the<00:01:54.659> UFO<00:01:55.140> stuck<00:01:55.500> out<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> little<00:01:55.829> bit<00:01:55.979> past<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
the UFO stuck out a little bit past the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.980 
the UFO stuck out a little bit past the
trussing<00:01:56.700> which<00:01:56.820> look<00:01:57.030> great<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.810> bulb

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
trussing which look great and the bulb

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.780 
trussing which look great and the bulb
machine<00:01:58.320> was<00:01:58.530> kept<00:01:58.770> away<00:01:59.040> from<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.579> light

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
machine was kept away from the light

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.310 
machine was kept away from the light
which<00:02:00.149> kept<00:02:00.450> things<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.719> little<00:02:00.810> bit<00:02:00.960> safer

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
which kept things a little bit safer

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.020 
which kept things a little bit safer
make<00:02:01.829> sure<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.070> consult<00:02:02.369> with<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.670> owner's

manual before you overload this with too
much<00:02:05.579> weight<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.780> give<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.079> an<00:02:07.170> idea<00:02:07.259> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
much weight but to give you an idea the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.440 
much weight but to give you an idea the
Accu<00:02:07.860> UFO<00:02:08.310> was<00:02:08.489> about<00:02:08.670> 30<00:02:08.879> some<00:02:09.119> odd<00:02:09.209> pounds

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
Accu UFO was about 30 some odd pounds

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.050 
Accu UFO was about 30 some odd pounds
and<00:02:09.780> held<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.319> with<00:02:10.410> no<00:02:10.800> issue<00:02:11.069> another

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
and held it with no issue another

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.850 
and held it with no issue another
example<00:02:12.690> we<00:02:12.840> actually<00:02:13.200> had<00:02:13.319> an<00:02:13.440> event

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
example we actually had an event

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.710 
example we actually had an event
where<00:02:14.040> we<00:02:14.280> needed<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.700> floods<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.330> stick<00:02:15.570> out

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
where we needed the floods to stick out

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.540 
where we needed the floods to stick out
a<00:02:15.750> little<00:02:15.870> bit<00:02:16.170> past<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.590> trussing<00:02:17.070> because

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
a little bit past the trussing because

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.400 
a little bit past the trussing because
we<00:02:17.640> wanted<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.000> hit<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.270> corners<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:18.960> we

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
we wanted to hit the corners and we

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.080 
we wanted to hit the corners and we
weren't<00:02:19.560> able<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.860> hit<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.190> corners<00:02:20.610> too<00:02:20.820> much

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
weren't able to hit the corners too much

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.670 
weren't able to hit the corners too much
if<00:02:21.360> we<00:02:21.420> add<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.810> directly<00:02:21.930> over<00:02:22.230> where<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
if we add it directly over where the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.260 
if we add it directly over where the
trust<00:02:22.920> was<00:02:23.130> because<00:02:23.550> other<00:02:23.700> lights<00:02:23.970> would<00:02:24.120> get

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
trust was because other lights would get

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.690 
trust was because other lights would get
in<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.480> way<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.170> we<00:02:25.350> had<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:26.250> boom<00:02:26.460> arm

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
in the way so we had the boom arm

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.430 
in the way so we had the boom arm
directly<00:02:27.330> off<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.630> side<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.050> we<00:02:28.140> hung<00:02:28.320> the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
directly off to the side and we hung the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.930 
directly off to the side and we hung the
floods<00:02:28.710> right<00:02:29.010> there<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.460> then<00:02:29.760> the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
floods right there and then the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.700 
floods right there and then the
backlight<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:31.110> allowed<00:02:31.320> us<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.470> get<00:02:31.680> a

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
backlight and that allowed us to get a

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.500 
backlight and that allowed us to get a
little<00:02:32.010> bit<00:02:32.220> better<00:02:32.340> coverage<00:02:32.820> then<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.330> was

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
little bit better coverage then that was

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.460 
little bit better coverage then that was
really<00:02:33.540> handy<00:02:33.930> too

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
really handy too

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.490 
really handy too
last<00:02:35.310> but<00:02:35.490> not<00:02:35.520> least<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.090> this<00:02:36.330> is<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.570> part<00:02:37.380> of

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
last but not least and this is a part of

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.020 
last but not least and this is a part of
my<00:02:37.560> favorite<00:02:37.740> use<00:02:38.010> for<00:02:38.220> these<00:02:38.280> whenever<00:02:38.880> we

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
my favorite use for these whenever we

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.390 
my favorite use for these whenever we
have<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.210> single<00:02:39.480> span<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.930> trust<00:02:40.170> over<00:02:40.590> our<00:02:40.980> DJ

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400
