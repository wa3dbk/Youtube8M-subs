he's just he's just the complete package
man<00:00:38.579> like<00:00:38.820> they<00:00:38.969> say<00:00:39.180> he's<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.420> gift<00:00:39.780> he's

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469

symmetrical<00:00:43.250> his<00:00:44.250> proportions<00:00:44.610> are<00:00:45.000> just

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180

going<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> tough<00:00:49.890> guy<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.160> defeat<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
going to be a tough guy to defeat in the

in<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.210> coming<00:00:51.600> year<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.050> think<00:00:52.140> he's<00:00:52.410> going

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
in the coming year so I think he's going

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.470 
in the coming year so I think he's going
to<00:00:52.590> be<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> streak<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.550> little<00:00:53.699> while<00:00:53.910> of

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
to be on a streak for a little while of

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.930 
to be on a streak for a little while of
winning<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> Olympia<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.800> think<00:00:56.460> second<00:00:56.789> place

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
winning the Olympia I think second place

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.310 
winning the Olympia I think second place
is<00:00:57.120> going<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.300> change<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.840> year<00:00:58.079> obviously

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320

past<00:01:02.730> couple<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.120> years<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.449> been<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.719> big

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
past couple of years it's been a big

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.859 
past couple of years it's been a big
debate<00:01:04.189> that<00:01:05.189> Kai's<00:01:05.430> should<00:01:05.700> have<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.030> where

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
debate that Kai's should have one where

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.109 
debate that Kai's should have one where
that<00:01:07.080> Cayenne<00:01:07.350> feel<00:01:07.680> are<00:01:07.830> really<00:01:08.070> close<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:09.060> I

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
that Cayenne feel are really close but I

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.450 
that Cayenne feel are really close but I
think<00:01:09.210> let<00:01:10.110> him<00:01:10.260> last<00:01:10.500> year's<00:01:10.740> Olympia<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.310> saw

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.760 
think let him last year's Olympia we saw
kai<00:01:11.700> slip<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> little<00:01:12.210> bit<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.780> Kyle<00:01:13.470> wasn't

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
kai slip a little bit and Kyle wasn't

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.340 
kai slip a little bit and Kyle wasn't
you<00:01:14.130> know<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:15.119> was<00:01:15.390> more<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.780> definitive

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
you know it was more of a definitive

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.140 
you know it was more of a definitive
decision<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.040> Phil<00:01:17.310> Heath<00:01:17.520> one<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.000> car

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
decision that Phil Heath one and car

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.660 
decision that Phil Heath one and car
really<00:01:18.420> wasn't<00:01:18.869> up<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.020> par<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.650> phil<00:01:20.520> heath

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
really wasn't up to par with phil heath

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.640 
really wasn't up to par with phil heath
at<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.909> last<00:01:21.119> Olympia<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.810> think<00:01:22.380> there<00:01:22.500> was<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
at the last Olympia I think there was a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.679 
at the last Olympia I think there was a
good<00:01:22.890> bit<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.159> space<00:01:23.460> between<00:01:23.520> first<00:01:24.509> and

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
good bit of space between first and

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.780 
good bit of space between first and
second<00:01:25.140> at<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.710> last<00:01:25.890> olympian<00:01:26.189> i<00:01:26.460> think<00:01:26.640> this

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
second at the last olympian i think this

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.670 
second at the last olympian i think this
year<00:01:26.850> guys<00:01:27.720> going<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.049> slip<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> little<00:01:28.409> bit

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
year guys going to slip a little bit

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.289 
year guys going to slip a little bit
more<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.280> know<00:01:29.310> he's<00:01:29.520> getting<00:01:29.820> older<00:01:30.119> I

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
more you know he's getting older I

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.780 
more you know he's getting older I
believe<00:01:30.900> he's<00:01:31.020> almost<00:01:31.170> 40<00:01:31.740> if<00:01:32.040> he's<00:01:32.250> not<00:01:32.400> 40

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
believe he's almost 40 if he's not 40

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.230 
believe he's almost 40 if he's not 40
already<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.540> phil<00:01:33.960> heath<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.820> 3334<00:01:35.820> early

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
second place to dennis wolf obviously

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.330 
second place to dennis wolf obviously
dennis<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.170> won<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> arm<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.770> classic<00:01:44.159> where

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
dennis just won the arm of classic where

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.370 
dennis just won the arm of classic where
he<00:01:44.430> looked<00:01:44.640> amazing<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:46.020> I'm<00:01:46.079> going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.229> have

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
he looked amazing so I'm going to have

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.350 
he looked amazing so I'm going to have
Dennis<00:01:46.770> move<00:01:46.950> up<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.220> place<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.700> believe<00:01:48.149> he<00:01:48.270> got

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
Dennis move up a place I believe he got

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.319 
Dennis move up a place I believe he got
third<00:01:48.750> at<00:01:49.020> last<00:01:49.320> year's<00:01:49.649> Olympia<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.310> think<00:01:51.270> he

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
third at last year's Olympia I think he

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.969 
third at last year's Olympia I think he
deserves<00:01:51.630> second<00:01:52.110> at<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.380> year's<00:01:52.590> Olympia

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
deserves second at this year's Olympia

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.770 
deserves second at this year's Olympia
so<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.159> have<00:01:53.280> Dennis<00:01:53.579> moving<00:01:53.909> up<00:01:54.060> kai<00:01:54.390> moving

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
so I have Dennis moving up kai moving

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.810 
so I have Dennis moving up kai moving
down<00:01:55.049> but<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.860> think<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> third<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.640> fourth

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
down but I think the third and fourth

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.999 
down but I think the third and fourth
place<00:01:57.149> spots<00:01:57.509> are<00:01:57.869> kind<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.320> interchangeable

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
place spots are kind of interchangeable

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.980 
place spots are kind of interchangeable
and<00:01:59.130> they<00:01:59.219> could<00:01:59.399> really<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> coin<00:02:00.030> toss<00:02:00.299> i'm

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
and they could really be a coin toss i'm

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.410 
and they could really be a coin toss i'm
going<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.290> shawn<00:02:01.530> rhoden<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.950> forth<00:02:02.420> and

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
going to have shawn rhoden and forth and

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.319 
going to have shawn rhoden and forth and
the<00:02:03.450> reason<00:02:04.380> being<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.890> shawn<00:02:05.100> rhoden<00:02:05.369> got<00:02:06.060> for

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
the reason being is shawn rhoden got for

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.160 
the reason being is shawn rhoden got for
that<00:02:06.509> last<00:02:06.689> year's<00:02:06.990> Olympia<00:02:08.629> and<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.959> just

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
that last year's Olympia and I just

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.740 
that last year's Olympia and I just
think<00:02:10.349> those<00:02:10.470> top<00:02:10.709> three<00:02:10.739> guys<00:02:11.750> despite

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
think those top three guys despite

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.610 
think those top three guys despite
Sean's

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
Sean's

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.280 
Sean's
we'll<00:02:13.799> physique<00:02:14.129> and<00:02:14.280> his<00:02:14.400> incredible

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
we'll physique and his incredible

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.949 
we'll physique and his incredible
v-taper<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.790> think<00:02:17.790> those<00:02:17.940> top<00:02:18.180> three<00:02:18.209> guys<00:02:18.599> are

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
v-taper I think those top three guys are

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.979 
v-taper I think those top three guys are
just<00:02:19.140> are<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.220> solid<00:02:20.640> top<00:02:20.790> three<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.390> think

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
just are just a solid top three I think

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.660 
just are just a solid top three I think
Sean's<00:02:22.230> just<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.560> little<00:02:22.769> bit<00:02:22.890> too<00:02:23.099> new<00:02:23.370> too

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
Sean's just a little bit too new too

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.940 
Sean's just a little bit too new too
young<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.299> his<00:02:24.810> muscle<00:02:25.110> maturity<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.769> his

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
young and his muscle maturity and his

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.500 
young and his muscle maturity and his
size<00:02:26.190> isn't<00:02:26.700> there<00:02:26.909> to<00:02:26.940> compete<00:02:27.299> with<00:02:27.420> these

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
size isn't there to compete with these

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.229 
size isn't there to compete with these
top<00:02:27.780> three<00:02:28.080> guys<00:02:28.610> although<00:02:29.610> he<00:02:29.760> has<00:02:29.909> gotten

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
top three guys although he has gotten

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.720 
top three guys although he has gotten
third<00:02:30.480> two<00:02:31.079> years<00:02:31.349> ago<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:31.590> believe<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.310> just

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
third two years ago I believe I just

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.910 
third two years ago I believe I just
think<00:02:33.090> these<00:02:33.239> top<00:02:33.480> three<00:02:33.750> right<00:02:33.959> now<00:02:34.170> are<00:02:34.500> in<00:02:34.829> a

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
think these top three right now are in a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.399 
think these top three right now are in a
solid<00:02:35.250> enough<00:02:35.400> position<00:02:35.909> that<00:02:36.780> Sean<00:02:36.989> might<00:02:37.290> be

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
solid enough position that Sean might be

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.080 
solid enough position that Sean might be
on<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.560> outside<00:02:37.680> looking<00:02:38.069> in<00:02:38.549> of<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.849> top

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
on the outside looking in of that top

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.750 
on the outside looking in of that top
three<00:02:39.329> spot<00:02:40.019> but<00:02:40.799> like<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.129> said<00:02:41.159> it<00:02:41.430> could<00:02:41.579> be<00:02:41.730> a

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
three spot but like I said it could be a

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.580 
three spot but like I said it could be a
coin<00:02:41.970> toss<00:02:42.209> if<00:02:42.450> Kai<00:02:42.599> looks<00:02:42.900> really<00:02:43.140> bad<00:02:43.319> in<00:02:43.500> his

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
coin toss if Kai looks really bad in his

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.720 
coin toss if Kai looks really bad in his
conditionings<00:02:44.099> really<00:02:44.310> off<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.610> he's

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
conditionings really off and he's

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.000 
conditionings really off and he's
holding<00:02:44.879> a<00:02:45.030> bunch<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.329> water<00:02:45.530> he<00:02:46.530> could<00:02:46.739> slip

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
holding a bunch of water he could slip

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.940 
holding a bunch of water he could slip
down<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.430> fourth<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.060> those<00:02:48.750> are<00:02:48.870> my<00:02:48.989> top<00:02:49.049> four

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
down to fourth so those are my top four

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.660 
down to fourth so those are my top four
so<00:02:50.730> my<00:02:50.879> top<00:02:51.090> six<00:02:51.450> would<00:02:51.629> be<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:52.400> don't<00:02:53.400> know<00:02:53.579> I

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
so my top six would be I don't know I

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.720 
so my top six would be I don't know I
don't<00:02:53.940> think<00:02:54.120> Jay<00:02:54.329> Cutler's<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.900> i<00:02:55.709> would<00:02:56.129> bet

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
don't think Jay Cutler's I i would bet

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.720 
don't think Jay Cutler's I i would bet
it's<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.359> safe<00:02:57.629> bet<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.959> say<00:02:58.379> that<00:02:59.190> Jay<00:02:59.400> Cutler

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
it's a safe bet to say that Jay Cutler

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.309 
it's a safe bet to say that Jay Cutler
is<00:02:59.760> not<00:03:00.030> competing<00:03:00.510> this<00:03:00.599> year<00:03:00.659> from<00:03:01.170> the

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
is not competing this year from the

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.839 
is not competing this year from the
looks<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.799> pictures<00:03:02.159> I've<00:03:02.280> seen<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.609> them

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
looks of the pictures I've seen of them

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.030 
looks of the pictures I've seen of them
so<00:03:03.840> I'm<00:03:03.930> not<00:03:04.049> even<00:03:04.109> going<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.409> have<00:03:04.560> him<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:04.920> the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
so I'm not even going to have him in the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.860 
so I'm not even going to have him in the
mix<00:03:06.140> so<00:03:07.140> 45<00:03:07.590> i<00:03:08.040> would<00:03:08.370> say<00:03:08.519> big<00:03:08.790> Rami<00:03:09.120> based<00:03:09.659> on

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
else is competing I don't think they've

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.020 
else is competing I don't think they've
I<00:03:28.980> don't<00:03:29.129> think<00:03:29.250> they've<00:03:29.370> even<00:03:29.549> released<00:03:29.879> an

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
I don't think they've even released an

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.520 
I don't think they've even released an
official<00:03:30.120> list<00:03:30.660> but<00:03:30.900> these<00:03:31.049> guys<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.410> i've

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
official list but these guys that i've

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.259

competing<00:03:33.599> I<00:03:33.950> think<00:03:34.950> rowley<00:03:35.250> is<00:03:35.400> competing<00:03:35.940> if

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
competing I think rowley is competing if

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.610
