00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
duty 3 with that game flop because they

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.280 
duty 3 with that game flop because they
designed<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:42.000> vehicle<00:00:42.390> based<00:00:42.809> game

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290

tactical insertion boosting in Reaper

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.240 
tactical insertion boosting in Reaper
all<00:00:51.690> pretty<00:00:51.989> much<00:00:52.020> all<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.500> game<00:00:52.710> modes<00:00:52.949> this

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
all pretty much all the game modes this

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.639 
all pretty much all the game modes this
has<00:00:53.399> gotten<00:00:53.969> out<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.149> hand<00:00:54.320> it<00:00:55.320> was<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.500> nice

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
has gotten out of hand it was a nice

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.680 
has gotten out of hand it was a nice
idea<00:00:55.829> doesn't<00:00:56.730> really<00:00:57.000> work<00:00:57.210> out<00:00:57.360> very<00:00:57.570> well

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
idea doesn't really work out very well

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.779 
idea doesn't really work out very well
it<00:00:58.320> needs<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.590> be<00:00:58.710> taken<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.160> don't<00:00:59.430> see<00:00:59.609> any

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
it needs to be taken out I don't see any

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.819 
it needs to be taken out I don't see any
reasonable<00:01:00.780> way<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.079> they<00:01:01.170> could<00:01:01.230> fix<00:01:01.620> that

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
reasonable way that they could fix that

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.380 
reasonable way that they could fix that
just<00:01:02.129> needs<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.340> be<00:01:02.430> taken<00:01:02.550> out<00:01:02.850> or<00:01:03.030> place<00:01:03.239> with

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
something else perhaps third is the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.910 
something else perhaps third is the
Infinity<00:01:06.450> care<00:01:06.780> package<00:01:07.140> glitch<00:01:07.170> which<00:01:07.799> I

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
Infinity care package glitch which I

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.370 
Infinity care package glitch which I
realize<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.340> they<00:01:08.430> fix<00:01:08.670> some<00:01:08.909> glitches<00:01:09.180> but

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
realize that they fix some glitches but

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.929 
realize that they fix some glitches but
this<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.740> very<00:01:11.010> much<00:01:11.280> still<00:01:11.549> up<00:01:11.820> and

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
this one is very much still up and

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.690 
this one is very much still up and
running<00:01:12.170> I<00:01:13.170> feel<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:13.950> Infinity<00:01:14.369> Ward<00:01:14.549> got<00:01:14.670> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
running I feel like Infinity Ward got a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.460 
running I feel like Infinity Ward got a
little<00:01:14.939> cocky<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.450> overconfident<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.290> their

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
little cocky and overconfident in their

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.649 
little cocky and overconfident in their
game<00:01:17.130> making<00:01:17.369> abilities<00:01:17.909> they<00:01:18.330> should<00:01:18.570> have

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
game making abilities they should have

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.070 
game making abilities they should have
had<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> beta<00:01:19.110> period<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:21.420> fourth<00:01:21.659> one<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
had a beta period the fourth one is the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.420 
had a beta period the fourth one is the
one<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.229> believe<00:01:22.560> should<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.830> taken<00:01:23.189> most

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
one I believe should be taken most

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.249 
one I believe should be taken most
seriously<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.509> game<00:01:24.750> needs<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.229> a

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
seriously this game needs to have a

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.920 
seriously this game needs to have a
classic<00:01:25.830> playlist<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:27.030> halo<00:01:27.630> has<00:01:27.750> an
