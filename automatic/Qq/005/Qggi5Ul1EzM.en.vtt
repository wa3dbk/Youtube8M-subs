 Please tell me to see and I have a question I would like to answer for a moment 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:29.950
 The in particular proficiency of legs and waist had been in that mind 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:33.170
 The interlocking of all quickly becomes Therefore, it I was writing there burns second leg and waist of party members that can 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:37.519
 By what you say I do not know quite satisfactory because 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:41.950
 Please tell me what kind of condition that you can do with your feet and hips . 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:46.570
 It was to say that actually go to the channel of the channel 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.390
 I looked at the window and wrote a comment, but it 's difficult to tell if it's a sentence, so you 're right Yosuke 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.530
 Taking permission from the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.449
 Please let me explain with a video of Yosuke's video 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.680
 Yes it looks like this, Yosuke 's Inoue's ugly waist is up and it's beautiful 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.680
 The left foot is increasing and it is ugly 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.900
 Yes Can you feel like this 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.670
 The left foot swings firmly 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.109
 It is beautiful 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.109
 so 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.890
 While 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:28.490
 I wonder if it was good or hard 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.490
 It 's time around how their window is I speed-oriented 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.040
 Such feeling 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:45.720
 Yes day 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.720
 What's wrong with this explanation So what do you want to look at your window 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:56.960
 Something that really they that 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:59.560
 I know that I am not in a position to invent for some reason, but I think a bit back and legs 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.710
 Only about the interlocking of the waist 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:07.150
 It is very difficult to explain in that document 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.030
 Were you able to know even a little look at this Nde but might have people suffering in the same way 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.250
 And I thought that 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:17.110
 And say Yes Well somewhere 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:20.460
 I'm also quite different from that, but I'm talking about stretching my legs, but I'm almost bent . 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.410
 Polish only An a Ntte felt not smoke really 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.410
 I want you to see the day 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.010
 This open leg 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.010
 This open leg is 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.030
 Even in this state 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.880
 even here 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:45.850
 Gaano where say are much keep 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:47.540
 It is a place where legs and hips are linked in a row, and keep it open by keeping both legs extended with pin and legs 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.810
 Then 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.810
 road 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:03:02.020
 It's the left foot here, but it's the left foot, but the left foot has increased. 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:06.820
 I think I'm the right foot is to come about automatically in the swing 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.910
 Something is n pole and s pole of magnet, but in order to keep the same distance from repulsion 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.660
 When you sack and Gachi' 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:16.080
 Shake the left foot firmly against it 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:20.510
 You will come in with Then but two of 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.510
 Of course hips and has solidified the Gachi' 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.800
 It will harden and the back lower body will become solid firmly here is open as well 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.690
 If you do so 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.690
 If you turn the upper body fast 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:42.600
 Nde women more than chopsticks now is to come with legs as if solving a twist of the upper body 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.500
 It means that the speed comes out First firmly solidify your feet, then return the upper body quickly 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.510
 To go 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.930
 So we will up the speed 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:01.230
 It is a video of Yosuke from here 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.230
 By 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.990
 It is so expensive and beautiful 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.990
 I really want to apprehend this height because I think it can be connected to various techniques 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.260
 First of all I'm here 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.830
 I'd have firmly shake the east left foot 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:24.389
 I have a great now the mother Nde Densuke like left foot firmly and shake 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:30.700
 But right foot a little in contrast 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:34.590
 I think there is a little bit of work that goes up and down instead of keeping it open 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:37.280
 The side is beautiful here It is wonderful here beautiful 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.820
 Here it is also amazing high Na I do it this 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.820
 smart 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.620
 Another Do a little or 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.620
 This is good too 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:55.969
 I have a tendency to stand like this without my right foot touching 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:59.800
 Keep open leg a little 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:02.580
 It feels like it's broken down here 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.580
 Like this 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.389
 So my left foot swings 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:15.759
 It is like feeling that it buys it and it is broken in Italy and Doba again 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:15.759
 Right foot 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:24.289
 It is and I wonder if not a little touched hard to look around here That's right 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:29.139
 I'm getting this way 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:31.409
 The right foot this about but it is okay to be in about a little this time as well this 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.409
 Hereabouts Hen 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.180
 So much healing here 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.220
 The right foot is not around so much 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.970
 That the Yes 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:54.990
 The link between the waist and the leg is judged by whether or not the open leg of the current leg can be kept. 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:58.150
 Please give me 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:02.249
 Oyasu Really す さ ん ん window 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:07.049
 I think it's high and great . 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:08.639
 It also easy to Thomas also went If this I think also easy to connect to the Toka Toka head Halo 

00:06:07.049 --> 00:06:11.080
 so 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:14.699
 I also want to apprentice 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.699
