close to the cuticle bringing them on

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.580 
close to the cuticle bringing them on
top<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.300> each<00:01:36.540> other<00:01:40.369> as<00:01:42.050> the<00:01:43.050> acrylic<00:01:43.440> is

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
top of each other as the acrylic is

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.680

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.460 
drawing I'm going to pick up a really
tiny<00:01:46.110> bead<00:01:46.440> of<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.650> clear<00:01:47.750> so<00:01:48.750> i<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:49.050> pick<00:01:49.260> up

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
tiny bead of the clear so i can pick up

00:01:49.470 --> 00:02:05.630 
tiny bead of the clear so i can pick up
my<00:01:49.970> stars<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.479> set<00:01:51.990> them<00:01:52.140> down

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.930

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
so it's a really really tiny bead just

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.000 
so it's a really really tiny bead just
enough<00:02:10.240> to<00:02:10.390> pick<00:02:10.539> up<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.840> star<00:02:11.940> set<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.090> down

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.120 

you<00:02:18.010> can<00:02:18.250> do<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.640> face<00:02:18.970> down<00:02:19.000> on<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.570> star<00:02:20.130> or

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
you can do it face down on the star or

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.090 
you can do it face down on the star or
you<00:02:21.280> can<00:02:21.490> do<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.760> face<00:02:22.030> up<00:02:22.860> whatever<00:02:23.860> way<00:02:24.040> is

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
you can do it face up whatever way is

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:37.440 
you can do it face up whatever way is
easier<00:02:24.310> for<00:02:24.670> you

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
the last speed is going to go in the

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.940 
the last speed is going to go in the
back<00:03:20.239> close<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.170> cuticle<00:03:23.709> that's<00:03:24.709> going

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
back close to the cuticle that's going

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:37.750 
back close to the cuticle that's going
to<00:03:25.010> be<00:03:25.099> a<00:03:25.129> smaller<00:03:25.549> bead
