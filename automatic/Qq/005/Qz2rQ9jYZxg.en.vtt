00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:15.370
 Hello Well today another 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.360
 a little secret must be a secret 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.060
 by observations 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.480
 what else can you say decided 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.480
 share 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.380
 moped 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.559
 you can clearly see smoke coming from the chimney 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:51.330
 A lot of requests go straight from the pipe 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.780
 and I can answer caps and me this is 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.780
 changes radically 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:09.380
 came today captain weather 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:09.380
 spoiled either 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:20.550
 this soup is already two days u will come yes today 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.180
 at night there was light only recently 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:27.830
 crushed 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:32.119
 so the paper show say it's not 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:49.850
 smoke tobacco and check it is very easy 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:53.220
 take a sheet of paper pure white bouquet 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.410
 some kind of two o'clock boiler cover even 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.360
 did not get to the bottom 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.450
 clean himself 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.940
 little white if you have on paper 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.280
 oil stains then it is natural 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.530
 there may even be drops that is in the ocean 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.400
 kicked out does not allow paper to become clean 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:15.840
 I start the scale if there are oil 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:19.200
 stains it is uniquely a few without 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.200
 caps here it is anyway already us 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.690
 until the whole engine is so cold 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.280
 weather you can even letters from weight to 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.820
 to all the surrounding cars which 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.630
 is coming 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.040
 you sit there is smoke from the pipe well 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.060
 warm up 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.599
 there is no such thing, do n't be afraid of him 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.620
 it does not smoke it for the more 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.359
 it turns out hot air comes out of 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.890
 pipes immediately naturally it cools 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:51.939
 here it turns out so we also remember to 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.480
 to this 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.480
 often a second 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.069
 in the garage the same moment of smoke from the pipe 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.680
 just grandfather 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:13.110
 that is, such 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:16.950
 getting so much colder so 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.950
 hot exhaust gases 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.650
 flying away from the pipe you are immediately cooled 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.049
 it turns out that moisture is condensed 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.079
 is obtained by 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:31.319
 that is, it does not smoke well I said already if 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.099
 you need to check there is some 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.670
 doubt 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.769
 put a sheet of white paper clean 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.730
 hold on 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:44.939
 even if the paper was wet I was no longer 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.629
 I know where and you somewhere I threw not 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:52.409
 so much out so well here if it became even 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.700
 could oh wait till dry if 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:56.579
 dried up no trace left 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.549
 so it was water if you stayed 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:06.650
 oils of course the stains are already worth 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:06.650
 think about it 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:17.150
 so on 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:18.940
 you again had such a question even for us 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:24.820
 appeared 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:27.110
 the group in contact there the smoke group goes from 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.830
 engine 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.949
 already there and you went all engine 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.560
 have looked 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:36.169
 then it means definitely from laying 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.520
 between the cylinder head came kapets 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.520
 only she got burned 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:54.550
 their land which can be shown like this 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:58.389
 It looks like there's something even got burned itself 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.120
 metal is the ring itself here 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:07.770
 perfectly visible 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:16.660
 correction gasket naturally was 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:18.190
 problem hello bad moped 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.160
 that is, leave the river at all 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:24.190
 went wrong took off with a kickstarter 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:33.820
 did not keep pace and after some time 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:37.000
 knocking the prostate out of the engine that is smoke 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.199
 tumbled down and that was the first reason then 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.910
 there is, as it were, the first sign that 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:46.090
 laying on the tables she disassembled here 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:49.030
 on a moped, well, of course not a fight, but here 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:53.440
 drove to repair and found such 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:58.180
 a piece that is just plainly obtained 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:03.340
 through this burned-out section of gases 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:05.159
 red-hot that is turns out passes 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.460
 here where we all speak goes 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:12.220
 naturally fall into the card warms up 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.460
 well there is butter from dough butter too 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.909
 gas is hot that is naturally here 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:22.229
 naturally the oil begins to smoke burn 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:24.460
 and naturally move well there 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:29.729
 special breather there is something there, as it were, and 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:32.949
 through it already comes smoke that is 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:34.300
 burning products oil that is if u 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:38.770
 you are puffed up by the engine itself 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.490
 below and it turns out it is about 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.590
 parties that is 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.830
 rear wheel there under the frame so you don't 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:48.340
 will see will be perfectly visible 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.780
 very very so strong it will 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.430
 the first sign of being burned out 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.840
 laying well, that's all I wanted 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.860
 to tell 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:00.060
 on the 2nd on oil on couple to all thanks for 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.060
 attention all bye
