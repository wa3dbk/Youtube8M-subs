00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.150
 and that for another evil is that you are today 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.370
 I'm here once again I minecraft 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.890
 I'm dim and flight this is going to be a 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.950
 video to show you how it does 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.470
 defenses or think defenses very good 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.870
 to destroy the nexus to defend ourselves 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.540
 so that you know not to touch us 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.150
 nothing at all the nexus and can take 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.340
 departure thanks to the defense simply 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.430
 to the defense even if we do not have a good 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.030
 attack with the defense you can win it like this 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.500
 how good are we going to start with the whole 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.840
 it has been from the beginning that this is going to 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.790
 be for Milan and as I do the 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.120
 defenses between the best way that 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.180
 bieber goes out 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.430
 so let's go for a walk with the gun 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.210
 1 the way types so we're going 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.829
 now with the first way so far 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.989
 Okay, guys, once here 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.489
 let's start with the tutorial the 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.920
 first thing we have to do to 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.649
 that is more likely to be explained to us 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.909
 the reader is going to be making a wall one 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.759
 wall in their football they have will have 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.399
 all done but a wall has to 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.369
 to be of earth a coin of earth usually 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:13.100
 be very difficult for you to pass the 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.440
 opposites explained the reasons the 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.840
 reasons are very simple you when they give you 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.259
 the fermentation liquid destroys the 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.020
 nexus 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.479
 You usually get the kit with a 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.000
 sword a pick and an ax 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.590
 so a part is not given to you and it's very 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.170
 unlikely that you when you are going to apply 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.649
 the fact of any other equipment you get 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.659
 a shovel then as normal 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.460
 take a shovel to africa nexus 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.390
 because it would be bullshit at least 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.030
 for me 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.750
 because their cousin is not going to get 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.430
 flick a shovel to move to the 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.170
 wall I think we would lose 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.450
 a lot of time and you could have the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.020
 otherwise, I recommend a lot 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.330
 make the earth walls and if you can 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.460
 be that you have double layer because the 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.290
 first of earth and then of wood for 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.240
 take away more in the opposite 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.860
 enrique has the shovel and between you have 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.320
 than break it and then you find the 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.550
 wood is very unlikely to not get caught 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.630
 Our team in particular is also worth 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.150
 the wall is very important that you have 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.910
 because at least five cubes or 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.810
 square or what do you want to call it from 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.060
 height because if we put fingers we put 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.920
 a creation that comes from us 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.960
 default and wing and until and we have not been 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.120
 casting 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.150
 you know that the higher it is the more 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.340
 difficult is it going to be that they can strain 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.850
 Okay, now we're going to go with 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.090
 the second way to check our 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.490
 defense now we see you okay kid is 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.500
 very well then now the second way to 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.200
 how is our defense in destroying 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.970
 the exodus is going to be in the wall that 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.150
 we have put ground we are going to put in 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.850
 a little corner that does not hide a lot 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.190
 kind of stairs to be able to go out to 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.710
 for you were some kind of stairs for 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.380
 inside to be able to go out 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.280
 outside and let's put a type 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:13.260
 how is it called 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:16.830
 Live a type of waterfall to 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.870
 more if they kill one of them within 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.450
 our base and the grace escaleritas 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.160
 we throw into the water and we do not hurt 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.830
 also because they live on water because 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.470
 for example by water when at least 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.959
 someone will enter to apply them in the nexus if 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.450
 will go up if by water it is very difficult 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.130
 that no one see you because when you go up the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.290
 Water takes quite a while as it does 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.540
 you will know if you are going and you are going up 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.080
 a waterfall by a waterfall in the water 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.480
 america is enough to be able to climb 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.280
 because it's usually slow and it's very 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.370
 unlikely that the team sees him 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.500
 going up for that same purpose apart from 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.220
 and departure for those of us inside 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.740
 to leave that is usually very useful 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.560
 Well now let's move on with the 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.670
 third reason to do way reason for 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.330
 what it is to take them from to sit the 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.430
 base in meira 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.710
 I'm going to guys we're here in the 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.930
 third way to take away the defense 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.100
 and minecraft and one of the ways that we 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.870
 can leave quite profitable is to put 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.660
 doors since if we do not put doors 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.870
 it's much easier to sneak 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.480
 only with the doors you can lose some 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.580
 few hundredths of time but the 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.360
 you lose and the truth is that it can be 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.600
 quite useful and put some plates of 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.580
 pressure is a place 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.800
 inside the base since we put it on 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.020
 outside can quickly enter and exit 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.420
 but instead we put them inside has 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.310
 to give the right click and open it now 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.680
 We are fine, we can be 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.010
 much more useful can go out 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.570
 since only with plunging into the psu 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.060
 place and death came out so much more 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.330
 simple we also say that also 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:04.330
 Well, you have to recommend where 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.730
 are the watermelons you can put you can 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.380
 cover it so no one sneaks 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.660
 also for watermelons and to pass us by 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.360
 inside without the underside you can 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.130
 discover it and also put the pre 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.890
 surface inside the base not by 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.960
 outside so they can not enter 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.750
 Well, now we are going to pass, it was already 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.100
 fourth way to check the bases of 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.280
 Minecraft 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:31.000
 Okay, we're already here for the last 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.550
 way to defend the walls of 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.800
 100 beds and good one of the ones you have 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.500
 what to do is in the bridges that are 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.450
 that connect from the nexus that is where 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.180
 normally people sneak in to go to 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.130
 attacking the nexus the concrete so 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.350
 we have to do especially try 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.140
 break the bridge as much as you can if 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.720
 I went to the whole bridge a lot better or 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:56.470
 with which to break half or insufficient and 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:59.710
 put several walls where in the 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.540
 bridge so that it costs them to pass this 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.370
 may be better land because 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.950
 it's going to cost more as I said 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.940
 before normally normally we 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.670
 they carry a shovel to make 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.790
 to apply the text so it's very useful and 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.830
 also what you might be able to 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:20.370
 give enough to sack the opposites 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:23.910
 you can put a tree what we propose 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:27.030
 others take dust from bones you put a 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.990
 ground strip you put two you break 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:33.370
 trees 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:36.160
 of the branches 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.650
 the seed as you call it you put it there 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.180
 with the bone dust you make it grow and 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.090
 the truth that the prisoners on the bridge and 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.530
 it's quite annoying since you have to 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.600
 break the wood or you have to break the 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.000
 leaves and it's quite annoying and you can 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.520
 make him waste a lot of time and 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.530
 truth is that it did not take long to do it and 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.690
 also some of the ones that are optional 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.030
 but that the truth is that for me I do not 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:02.160
 like but a lot of people do it 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:04.690
 put our base around putting water 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.940
 direction down for people to 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.460
 that I'm going to enter our nexus 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.650
 like to enter but I see something 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.780
 negative to that because it's worth to the 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.820
 people will have a harder time entering the rights 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.070
 but if we want to go to 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.680
 defend it for example is also going to 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.900
 like us so good what 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.630
 We have seen enough already to 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.400
 say first that the link in the 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.380
 game of we win it we won that 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.910
 departure to destroy the fact and good 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.160
 guys, I hope you liked to give 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:36.010
 like suscribe 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.710
 see you later and I like it if you want 

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:40.150
 that brings you more bullets to defend the 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:43.120
 nexus anything by thanking the 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:45.360
 comments and good see you in another 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.360
 video
