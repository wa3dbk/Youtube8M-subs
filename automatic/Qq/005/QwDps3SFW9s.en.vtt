00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.000 
think I need to trim this more because
it<00:02:46.280> kind<00:02:46.459> of<00:02:46.550> goes<00:02:46.790> over<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.270> side<00:02:48.010> but

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
it kind of goes over to the side but

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:56.880 
it kind of goes over to the side but
yeah<00:02:49.160> it's<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.700> pretty<00:02:50.000> high<00:02:51.489> so<00:02:54.160> there<00:02:55.160> we<00:02:55.250> go

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
yeah it's a pretty high so there we go

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.370 
yeah it's a pretty high so there we go

because i know this was just the fast

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.120 
because i know this was just the fast
like<00:03:14.260> so<00:03:15.260> it<00:03:15.440> would<00:03:15.530> take<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:15.830> much<00:03:15.920> for

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130
