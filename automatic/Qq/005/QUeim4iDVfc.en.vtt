went to market unfortunately I was kind
of<00:00:47.399> cool<00:00:47.520> idea<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:49.020> idea<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.590> that

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
of cool idea but the idea here is that

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.850 
of cool idea but the idea here is that
it's<00:00:49.890> mostly<00:00:50.930> brainless<00:00:51.930> laptop<00:00:52.500> doesn't<00:00:52.770> do

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
it's mostly brainless laptop doesn't do

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.920 
it's mostly brainless laptop doesn't do
anything<00:00:53.129> until<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.430> plug<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.239> phone<00:00:54.449> into

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
anything until you plug the phone into

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.529 
anything until you plug the phone into
the<00:00:55.230> back<00:00:55.440> here<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.520> then<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.000> phone<00:00:57.149> acts<00:00:57.390> as

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
the back here and then the phone acts as

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.040 
the back here and then the phone acts as
a<00:00:57.570> brain<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.530> really<00:00:58.890> nice<00:00:59.300> simple<00:01:00.300> box<00:01:00.629> just

from<00:03:07.800> my<00:03:08.400> atrix<00:03:08.519> 4g<00:03:08.730> running<00:03:09.569> in<00:03:10.110> this<00:03:10.410> web<00:03:10.590> top

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
from my atrix 4g running in this web top

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.979 
from my atrix 4g running in this web top
environment<00:03:12.120> here<00:03:12.209> so<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:12.510> is<00:03:12.630> actually<00:03:12.720> an

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
environment here so this is actually an

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.120 
environment here so this is actually an
operating<00:03:13.380> system<00:03:13.410> that<00:03:13.800> they've<00:03:13.950> got

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
operating system that they've got

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.059 
operating system that they've got
running<00:03:14.910> on<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.090> device<00:03:15.769> acting<00:03:16.769> is<00:03:16.890> the

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
running on the device acting is the

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.520 
running on the device acting is the
brain<00:03:17.489> of<00:03:17.519> this<00:03:17.700> laptop<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:18.900> they<00:03:19.049> kind<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.320> put

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
brain of this laptop so they kind of put

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.100 
brain of this laptop so they kind of put
a<00:03:19.670> operating<00:03:20.670> system<00:03:20.970> in<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.750> operating
