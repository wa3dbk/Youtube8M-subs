00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.880
 what manufacturers are hiding today or 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.430
 do not finish crop or full frame 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.580
 mirror egli mirrorless why 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.660
 SLRs lately somehow not 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.260
 and fall short 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.510
 mirrorless development is very active on 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.469
 these and other questions I will try 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.610
 answer in this video and article below 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.040
 size matters 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.410
 on any forum you very quickly 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.420
 explain that 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.690
 full frame matrix is much better crop 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.579
 of however you need to remember that 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.969
 professional or just good 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.250
 the photographer and the phone frame will shoot gorgeous 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.649
 while the person who 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.079
 can not shoot and full personnel 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.359
 fancy camera does not help much 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.030
 so that the beginner does not choose 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.729
 photographer the result will be very far from 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.340
 perfection the secret is pretty simple with 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.159
 full frame even with a budget 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.860
 lenses are always very easy to blur 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.130
 background and give pictures that look 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.369
 which is so called mirror that is 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.220
 when you have a basic plan, that is, an object 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.470
 sharp and the background is blurred and 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.720
 blur pretty much that is in 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.210
 the picture feels volume in any 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.189
 case at the same time if you take 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.650
 crooked near the camera and the camera with 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.530
 pretty strong specks it will be 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.570
 mean that volume in a picture is so easy 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.259
 create you fail because 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.930
 when shooting a budget lens 1250 this 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.990
 budget zoom you have a background so much 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.720
 blur is not the main subject 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.420
 yes it will be sharp but separate it from 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.340
 the background will get harder and you 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.790
 you will dance for a very long time with such 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.340
 a camera but a three-dimensional picture and 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.640
 don't really get real 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.660
 photographers do very differently when 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.870
 you take a big camera and blurs the background 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.710
 called snot then the viewers these same 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.710
 snot and let the sake of pop and 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.860
 for the sake of such nice photos with 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.640
 blurred snot in the background and makes sense 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.980
 take 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.890
 cameras with full frame matrices 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.470
 because even a man who is nothing 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.420
 does not understand in a good composition always 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.230
 will say ME ME ME ME ME ME ME 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.800
 What a nice photo, but to get 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.450
 such photos are much easier to take 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.060
 full-frame camera 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.150
 well and in the end with a big camera and 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.820
 for professionals easier website having said that 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.710
 I'm a professional photographer I'll take pictures of you 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.320
 since no one else can 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.140
 but back to the little camera there is no 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.960
 small moderately small covers 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.820
 today they are already functional any 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.370
 mirror and even most 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.430
 mirrorless systems including those with more 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.490
 a large matrix of benefits can 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.280
 call an excellent stabilizer 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.209
 good quality viewfinder 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.910
 great touch screen 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.910
 smart control various electronic 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.910
 or by mechanical shooting modes like 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.220
 life composite life bulk when you follow 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.400
 practically on the screen for a couple turnout 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.810
 photos and not at all forced to guess 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.120
 what do you get 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.430
 exposure and so do a few 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.630
 duplicates that is these cameras 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.010
 most of the work they do for you 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.620
 functional and they are comfortable and not to mention 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.600
 already that they have a great size 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.950
 which fits well practically in 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.620
 any bag and as a result the weight of 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.290
 disadvantages except the size of the matrix 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.380
 which is about 3 times less than 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.220
 any full frame and here if we 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.800
 remember keeping pictures and 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.780
 composition matrix size goes to 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.050
 second plan because we know how 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.630
 divide the picture into plans how to transfer 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.090
 volume using composition perspective 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.609
 contrast and dividing pictures on the plans 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.340
 front middle rear and so on 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.099
 not to mention that we know the rules 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.830
 how to wake the background at least in 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:27.319
 some degree so he looked 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.000
 really blurry really 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:32.419
 a bunch of themes 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.610
 that is why we do not rest on the size of 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.639
 general conclusion is simple if you do not know how 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.800
 shoot and always want sharp shots 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.030
 take a camera with a smaller matrix because 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.389
 that she will help you 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.370
 much more fit depth of field 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.830
 on the other hand this camera is very good 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.800
 suitable professional travel 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.199
 who appreciate every gram and if you 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.719
 want artistic blur back 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:59.029
 plan and have no idea how it is 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:01.580
 done then take the camera with the matrix 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:03.919
 More with full-frame matrix I have 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.990
 in view if you want 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.830
 mirror impressions of your shots 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.159
 such a camera will help you 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.110
 the future despite the fact that 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:17.990
 optical theory you don't know and teach 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.750
 don't want then there is a choice then actually 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.699
 very simple if you liked it 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.930
 video think about subscribing 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:26.240
 put like 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.659
 dislike and generally discuss all this in 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.080
 comments I do not mind until see you in 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.080
 the internet
