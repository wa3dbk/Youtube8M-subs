it in the galaxy note 2 so anyway let's

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.929 
it in the galaxy note 2 so anyway let's
see<00:01:21.960> how<00:01:22.110> many<00:01:22.259> how<00:01:23.009> many<00:01:23.070> gigabytes<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.790> space

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
see how many how many gigabytes of space

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.969 
see how many how many gigabytes of space
they<00:01:24.329> give<00:01:24.570> us<00:01:24.689> when<00:01:24.899> you<00:01:24.990> put<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.409> 64

they give us when you put in a 64

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.580 
they give us when you put in a 64
gigabyte<00:01:26.659> external<00:01:27.659> card<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.320> see

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
gigabyte external card so you can see

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.499 
gigabyte external card so you can see
that<00:01:28.619> they<00:01:28.950> give<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.670> give<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.000> fifty<00:01:30.329> nine

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
point forty six gigabytes of external

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.959 
point forty six gigabytes of external
space<00:01:33.539> it's<00:01:34.500> not<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:34.860> good<00:01:35.070> as<00:01:35.219> internal<00:01:35.729> space

space it's not as good as internal space

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.789 
space it's not as good as internal space
but<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.360> we<00:01:36.570> could<00:01:36.719> definitely<00:01:36.930> use<00:01:37.289> that<00:01:37.649> to

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
but it we could definitely use that to

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.940 
but it we could definitely use that to
our<00:01:37.829> advantage<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.820> help<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.450> situation

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
popular game out right now but it only

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.910 
popular game out right now but it only
seems<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.420> want<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.930> use<00:02:27.140> your<00:02:27.380> internal

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
seems to want to use your internal

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.890 
seems to want to use your internal
storage<00:02:28.250> for<00:02:28.460> everything<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.180> as<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.600> can<00:02:29.720> see

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
storage for everything so as you can see

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.920 
storage for everything so as you can see
it's<00:02:30.050> using<00:02:30.530> 1.49<00:02:31.220> gigabytes<00:02:31.940> of<00:02:32.090> my<00:02:32.300> internal

it's using 1.49 gigabytes of my internal

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
internal storage and that's a huge chunk

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.020 
internal storage and that's a huge chunk
so<00:02:36.020> imagine<00:02:36.260> just<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.740> couple<00:02:36.920> of<00:02:37.100> those<00:02:37.730> games

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
so imagine just a couple of those games

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.990 
so imagine just a couple of those games
and<00:02:38.390> it'll<00:02:38.660> fill<00:02:38.960> up<00:02:39.290> 16<00:02:40.160> gigabyte<00:02:40.610> galaxy

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
and it'll fill up 16 gigabyte galaxy

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.300 
and it'll fill up 16 gigabyte galaxy
note<00:02:41.150> 2<00:02:41.330> rather<00:02:41.600> quickly<00:02:41.960> so<00:02:42.800> I'll<00:02:42.950> just<00:02:43.010> be

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
note 2 rather quickly so I'll just be

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.000 
note 2 rather quickly so I'll just be
wary<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.850> that<00:02:44.030> situation<00:02:44.390> hopefully<00:02:45.010> the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
wary of that situation hopefully the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.800 
wary of that situation hopefully the
these<00:02:46.520> games<00:02:46.820> will<00:02:47.560> these<00:02:48.560> games<00:02:48.890> will<00:02:49.130> be

these games will these games will be

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.570 
these games will these games will be

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
the 64 gigabyte model because I do have

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
a 64 gigabyte model but uh that rumor

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.790 
a 64 gigabyte model but uh that rumor
actually<00:03:13.310> does<00:03:13.730> is<00:03:14.630> panning<00:03:15.140> out<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.410> be<00:03:15.530> true

actually does is panning out to be true
I<00:03:16.130> stopped<00:03:16.520> by<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.760> couple<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.180> carriers<00:03:17.420> the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
I stopped by a couple of carriers the

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.250 
I stopped by a couple of carriers the
least<00:03:18.290> popular<00:03:18.709> carrier<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:20.540> provides<00:03:21.050> a

least popular carrier that provides a

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
cdma LTE model unfortunately not as good

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.620 
cdma LTE model unfortunately not as good

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
anyway the CDMA LTE model they have a

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.350 
anyway the CDMA LTE model they have a
very<00:03:33.260> limited<00:03:33.530> stock<00:03:34.070> of<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.370> 64<00:03:34.730> gigabyte

very limited stock of the 64 gigabyte

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.510 
very limited stock of the 64 gigabyte
model<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:36.380> if<00:03:36.470> I<00:03:36.620> really<00:03:36.980> wanted<00:03:37.280> that<00:03:37.340> I

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
model so if I really wanted that I

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.300 
model so if I really wanted that I
should<00:03:37.880> get<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.440> get<00:03:39.440> that<00:03:39.470> right<00:03:39.830> away<00:03:39.980> because

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
should get a get that right away because

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.370 
should get a get that right away because
theory<00:03:40.580> they<00:03:40.880> aren't<00:03:41.239> making<00:03:41.360> any<00:03:41.600> more<00:03:41.870> 64

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380

into the most popular carrier and you

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.360 
into the most popular carrier and you
know<00:03:50.600> it<00:03:50.900> turns<00:03:51.080> out<00:03:51.320> that<00:03:51.380> they<00:03:51.709> haven't<00:03:52.040> had

of weeks now so they've been sold out

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.350 
of weeks now so they've been sold out
for<00:03:57.560> quite<00:03:57.860> a<00:03:57.920> bit<00:03:58.100> a<00:03:58.130> while<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.760> they<00:03:59.060> don't

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
for quite a bit a while and they don't

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.660 
for quite a bit a while and they don't
seem<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.840> be<00:04:00.050> expecting<00:04:00.980> any<00:04:01.130> more<00:04:01.340> in<00:04:01.459> stock

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
seem to be expecting any more in stock

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.400 
seem to be expecting any more in stock
because<00:04:01.880> they<00:04:02.150> are<00:04:02.270> not<00:04:02.300> being<00:04:02.900> manufactured

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
because they are not being manufactured

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.350 
because they are not being manufactured

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
or that's what the sales people are

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.290 
or that's what the sales people are
saying<00:04:05.630> so<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:06.200> always<00:04:06.500> take<00:04:06.860> what<00:04:07.190> CEO<00:04:07.880> people
