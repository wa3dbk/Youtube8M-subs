00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Now I want to dress increasing income the CPM by means of the four 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.660
 Girl with the one the knives 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.569
 Schaub can hold at home 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:10.719
 I have a Japanese first now 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.049
 Wasserstein 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.679
 Percent that is a synthetic stone in two lay once 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.600
 Percent with 52 Aquaman have thousands of confirmation 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.869
 there are protests of tens of thousands of crowns 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:22.730
 percent 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.640
 that's a lot then and ways to get home the knives are not fixed yet 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.179
 Sheep can hold 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.730
 Then again I put a tour of stones this are rare 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.450
 that's the Belgian forecast 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.970
 where does not come from the name comes from Belgium the trend of 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.420
 Consumer natural stone 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.180
 then I have a so-called Arcandor radiate 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.890
 Mark was mined to the mountains of the USA and then I have the 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.930
 so-called Green Saxons 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.670
 He comes from Germany 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.180
 Pauli the stone is recognized that stone 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.500
 although they are equally good from the quality avenue 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.550
 that Belgian percent of Brocken and the Greens did not tell him 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.739
 exclusively only 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.800
 and what about holding patterns 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.390
 and writing the songs I like to follow him 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.140
 to explain 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.810
 now i start with more multi dragging performance 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.149
 Salinas guest to prescribe 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.389
 This Japanese Waterstone has about five to ten minutes before that 

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:25.940
 Percentage just below cold water is then not like with water 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.360
 if no Gladbeck ascend a balloon 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.100
 and it shows that the Europeans are lagging behind 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.780
 So the European knives are in the 1 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.070
 Highlight is far way and was back 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.540
 22 23 degrees deducted it is complicated but is ticked off 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.340
 that's 90 degrees half of which is 5 40 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.660
 and half of it in about 22 23 degrees 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.510
 with the way goes 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.240
 when grinding 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.600
 over the entire rising the whole stone exploit 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.190
 and SLI the sounds with moderate pressure 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.190
 against the Styrians 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.469
 Percent slightly different is this embarrassing after stiff Philo Sophie 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.889
 For that, one assumes one now rises and they plead natural stones 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:19.729
 wishes a cheerful the water-cooled Sundern with Bill 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.809
 never dry 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:27.479
 there is not so much a curse word that means well dry grinder that 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.989
 is a man in Portland so someone who wants to and not 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.109
 can 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.109
 The stone is considered you take the Japanese knife 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:39.909
 and who got to an angle of about 12 to 15 degrees 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:43.469
 12 to 15 degrees this is about half a thumb 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:48.279
 and grinds is 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:51.279
 Ing then move over the steep 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:56.489
 now quite good to see Calvin monkeys razor sharp 11 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.749
 the oil flows on the blade 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.749
 and so you sneak the bell piece by piece 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:06.179
 and from every page 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:11.289
 At the very end, the top comes off 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:15.679
 Gray what you see here 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.009
 Isfort cut off state 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:21.309
 and yet the knife is created piece by piece 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:23.669
 SZ 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.259
 you need even more was not to stop 11 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:28.399
 It only takes a few minutes for it 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:31.419
 Borner demanded advises the power consumers, of course, longer 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.359
 Today's spring always stuck to the tomatoes when the knife without pressure a tomato 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.249
 If you do not cut anymore you should think about sharpening 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.249
 otherwise the people will stay out too long 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:45.509
 to 12 Japanese method 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:49.419
 Two of these Elger embarrassing angles sulfur is to be kept 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:53.089
 You can buy 11 such so-called lures 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.609
 how do you just get on the plate 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:00.589
 and thus can keep the angle wonderful 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:12.839
 that of course very very easy and very easy for the layman
