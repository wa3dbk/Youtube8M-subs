I'll<00:00:18.599> show<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.869> why<00:00:19.140> okay

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.470 

so<00:00:28.090> we<00:00:28.210> just<00:00:28.450> done<00:00:28.690> this<00:00:28.870> one<00:00:30.000> we<00:00:31.000> now<00:00:31.119> do<00:00:31.180> the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
so we just done this one we now do the

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.970 
so we just done this one we now do the
energy<00:00:31.810> disruption<00:00:31.990> like<00:00:32.470> like<00:00:32.710> I<00:00:32.739> did

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
energy disruption like like I did

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.320 
energy disruption like like I did
yesterday<00:00:33.310> he<00:00:33.460> goes<00:00:33.640> her<00:00:33.730> hands<00:00:33.940> across<00:00:34.120> the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330 
yesterday he goes her hands across the

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.410 
yesterday he goes her hands across the
base<00:00:34.510> one<00:00:34.780> two<00:00:35.080> three

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
but this round cuts upwards we should do

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.760 
but this round cuts upwards we should do
it<00:01:28.450> what<00:01:29.450> you<00:01:29.930> can't<00:01:30.140> do<00:01:30.290> it<00:01:30.380> on<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.590> first

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
it what you can't do it on the first

his neck was in there soon was in there

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.370 
his neck was in there soon was in there
just<00:01:40.120> in<00:01:41.120> case<00:01:41.360> he's<00:01:41.570> still<00:01:41.810> he's<00:01:41.990> been<00:01:42.230> able

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
just in case he's still he's been able

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.080 
just in case he's still he's been able
to<00:01:42.560> grab<00:01:42.770> your<00:01:42.950> Brenda<00:01:43.310> here<00:01:45.610> to<00:01:46.610> finish<00:01:46.790> off

to grab your Brenda here to finish off
with<00:01:50.140> I'll<00:01:51.140> just<00:01:51.200> do<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.530> whole<00:01:51.560> thing

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.370 

it's<00:02:17.350> doing<00:02:17.680> magnetism<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:18.840> he<00:02:19.840> picked<00:02:20.110> up<00:02:20.230> on

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
it's doing magnetism so he picked up on

yesterday<00:02:28.630> how<00:02:28.840> our<00:02:29.800> hands<00:02:30.070> were<00:02:30.250> essentially

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
yesterday how our hands were essentially

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.310 
yesterday how our hands were essentially
magnet<00:02:31.000> feel<00:02:31.150> think<00:02:31.330> we're<00:02:31.570> all<00:02:31.720> magnet

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
magnet feel think we're all magnet

any electricity that flows through our

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.090 
any electricity that flows through our
body<00:02:34.510> does<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.530> make<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.680> occurred

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
body does it make that occurred

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.820 
body does it make that occurred
associated<00:02:36.820> with<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:38.140> when<00:02:38.440> L<00:02:38.620> was

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
associated with that so when L was

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.920 
associated with that so when L was
moving<00:02:39.160> his<00:02:39.250> hands<00:02:39.760> placements<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:40.750> stick

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
moving his hands placements and stick

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.620 
moving his hands placements and stick
like<00:02:41.020> this<00:02:41.140> thought<00:02:41.410> right<00:02:42.300> when<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:43.390> fast

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
like this thought right when you fast

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.770 
like this thought right when you fast
conductor<00:02:44.520> through<00:02:45.520> magnetic<00:02:45.790> field<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.630> can

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
conductor through magnetic field you can

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.820 
conductor through magnetic field you can
generate<00:02:47.340> current<00:02:48.340> from<00:02:48.490> that<00:02:48.520> conductor<00:02:49.300> and

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
generate current from that conductor and

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.100 
generate current from that conductor and
it's<00:02:50.830> proportional<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.640> firstly<00:02:52.510> how<00:02:52.750> quickly

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
it's proportional to firstly how quickly

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.600 
it's proportional to firstly how quickly
you<00:02:53.350> pass<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.800> conductor<00:02:54.340> through<00:02:54.520> the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
you pass that conductor through the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.570 
you pass that conductor through the
magnetic<00:02:55.030> field<00:02:55.890> it's<00:02:56.890> proportional<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.460> the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
magnetic field it's proportional to the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.090 
magnetic field it's proportional to the
length<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.030> conductor<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:59.530> also<00:02:59.920> it's

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
length of the conductor and also it's

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.740 
length of the conductor and also it's
proportionate<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.880> size<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.690> the

proportionate to the size of the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.810 
proportionate to the size of the
magnetic<00:03:02.230> field<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:03.130> you<00:03:03.220> have<00:03:03.370> this<00:03:03.490> formula

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
magnetic field so you have this formula

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.450 
magnetic field so you have this formula
I<00:03:04.180> what's<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.990> current<00:03:05.290> flowing<00:03:06.220> in<00:03:06.400> the

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
essentially off I'm not quite sure what

essentially off I'm not quite sure what
the<00:03:30.310> length<00:03:30.550> of<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:30.790> conductor<00:03:30.910> you<00:03:31.330> know

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
the length of the conductor you know

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.880 
the length of the conductor you know
that's<00:03:31.630> interesting<00:03:32.200> I<00:03:32.320> was<00:03:32.530> just<00:03:32.680> going<00:03:32.830> to

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
that's interesting I was just going to

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.650 
that's interesting I was just going to
say<00:03:33.010> that<00:03:33.220> because<00:03:33.370> L<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:34.030> length<00:03:34.060> of<00:03:34.390> it<00:03:34.540> and

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
say that because L the length of it and

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.940 
say that because L the length of it and
don't<00:03:34.810> know<00:03:34.930> maybe<00:03:35.170> that's<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.590> difference

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
don't know maybe that's the difference

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.750 
don't know maybe that's the difference
between<00:03:36.270> those<00:03:37.270> that<00:03:37.600> last<00:03:37.900> for<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.230> long<00:03:38.410> time

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
between those that last for a long time

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.220 
between those that last for a long time
and<00:03:39.760> those<00:03:40.000> that<00:03:40.300> last<00:03:40.510> for<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:40.720> short<00:03:40.780> time

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
and those that last for a short time

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.750 
and those that last for a short time
like<00:03:41.620> this<00:03:41.800> one<00:03:42.010> here<00:03:42.160> it's<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.310> pretty<00:03:42.459> big

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
like this one here it's a pretty big

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.370 
like this one here it's a pretty big
conductor<00:03:43.000> we're<00:03:43.450> putting<00:03:43.750> our<00:03:43.870> hands<00:03:44.140> over

with<00:03:44.530> this<00:03:44.650> one<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.160> so<00:03:45.790> L<00:03:46.209> would<00:03:46.480> be<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:46.709> bigger

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
with this one and so L would be a bigger

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.130 
with this one and so L would be a bigger
amount<00:03:48.519> than<00:03:49.330> some<00:03:49.660> of<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.840> others<00:03:50.110> that

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
amount than some of the others that

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.570 
amount than some of the others that
maybe<00:03:50.530> a<00:03:50.650> shorter<00:03:51.070> time<00:03:51.250> something<00:03:51.550> that

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
maybe a shorter time something that

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.100 
maybe a shorter time something that
that's<00:03:52.150> good<00:03:52.330> we're<00:03:52.540> getting<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.780> son<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:53.080> a

that's good we're getting a son to a

that's good we're getting a son to a

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
reason for that as well well ultimately

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.350

this<00:03:55.989> is<00:03:56.050> using<00:03:56.590> different<00:03:57.160> language

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.110 
half life and in the scientific language
it's<00:04:06.750> called<00:04:06.960> Karen<00:04:07.380> hmm<00:04:08.220> that's<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.910> same

it's called Karen hmm that's the same

that's why you do it slowly you're only

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.770 
that's why you do it slowly you're only
