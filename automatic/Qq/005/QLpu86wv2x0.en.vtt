00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
you know by all means

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.580 
you know by all means
do<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:13.910> but<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:15.150> just<00:02:15.210> rarely<00:02:15.780> made<00:02:16.110> any<00:02:16.470> of

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
do that but I just rarely made any of

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.800

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
the other ones and playtesting so I

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.650 
the other ones and playtesting so I
figured<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.380> after<00:02:20.250> playing<00:02:20.910> for<00:02:21.330> four

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
figured that after playing for four

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.680 
figured that after playing for four
hours<00:02:21.960> tonight<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:23.730> was<00:02:24.090> by<00:02:24.480> far<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:25.140> best

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
hours tonight this was by far the best

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.110 
hours tonight this was by far the best
situation<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.710> can<00:02:28.890> run<00:02:29.040> with<00:02:29.220> all

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
situation that you can run with all
