element<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:44.810> because<00:01:45.950> water<00:01:46.950> also<00:01:47.640> comes<00:01:48.420> from

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
element to because water also comes from

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.630 
element to because water also comes from
the<00:01:48.780> cosmic<00:01:49.140> energy<00:01:49.350> only<00:01:49.560> Naruto

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
the cosmic energy only Naruto

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.580 
the cosmic energy only Naruto
so<00:01:50.909> that's<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.619> here<00:01:52.619> higher<00:01:53.250> connection<00:01:53.640> and

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
so that's a here higher connection and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.870 
so that's a here higher connection and
normal<00:01:55.590> people<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:56.070> are<00:01:56.159> low<00:01:56.520> health

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
normal people we are low health

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.569 
normal people we are low health
connection<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.689> we<00:01:57.990> could<00:01:58.259> not<00:01:58.590> get<00:01:58.950> directly

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
connection so we could not get directly

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.109 
connection so we could not get directly
from<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.060> cosmos<00:02:00.469> so<00:02:01.469> we<00:02:01.649> need<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.579> lots<00:02:02.939> of

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
from the cosmos so we need to lots of

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.870 
from the cosmos so we need to lots of
