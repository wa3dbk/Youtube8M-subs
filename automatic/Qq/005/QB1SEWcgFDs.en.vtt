well let's remember she's got a
two-handed<00:05:52.420> backhand<00:05:53.020> so<00:05:53.170> it's<00:05:53.320> going<00:05:53.470> to

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
two-handed backhand so it's going to

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.220 
two-handed backhand so it's going to
take<00:05:53.740> a<00:05:53.770> little<00:05:54.010> time<00:05:54.310> to<00:05:54.490> develop

take a little time to develop

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.040 
take a little time to develop
the<00:05:55.920> fact<00:05:56.190> that<00:05:56.280> you<00:05:56.490> mix<00:05:56.700> it<00:05:56.880> array<00:05:57.450> is<00:05:57.720> a<00:05:57.840> good

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
the fact that you mix it array is a good

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.490 
the fact that you mix it array is a good
sign<00:05:58.290> on<00:05:58.530> your<00:05:58.680> right<00:05:58.890> you'll<00:05:59.160> get<00:05:59.370> better
