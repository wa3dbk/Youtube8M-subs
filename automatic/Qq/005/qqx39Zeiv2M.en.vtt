 Sim card was received with which you 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.740

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:36.600
 some scammers extort money and so 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.320
 further so for these purposes we have 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.719
 Federal Communications Agency Rossvyaz 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.300
 dot ru site here we can google 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.500
 very easy to write Russian Goku worlds 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.680
 link ru 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.969
 and the first will be the site just federal 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.149
 Communications Agency Rossvyaz 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.149
 and so here and the top site 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.340
 push activity and push resource 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.340
 you walkie talkies 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.700
 further a little squander and here we are 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.220
 we see an extract from the pc relay from the registry 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.220
 Russian system and numbering plan 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.030
 here 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.030
 form opens 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.420
 here in the form you can enter as 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.880
 city codes 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.600
 here it is written in FIG prefix 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.740
 for example 495 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:43.700
 either same same prefix it is spelled 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:48.700
 for mobile operators let's say i 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.700
 I will write this 1 909 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.570
 let's say 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.610
 996 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.350
 farther 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.030
 but let's say 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.630
 five 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.630
 00 I'm just picking a number at random 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.240
 click find 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.390
 so 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:22.460
 what do we see 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:27.950
 here we got that first prefix 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.950
 909 number range from 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.460
 9 and 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:38.070
 so many zeros to 999 it refers to 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.300
 Moscow and Moscow region refers to 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:46.050
 pennant that is beeline 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:48.300
 here that is, the data is valid sim card 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.960
 she was registered 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.900
 Well, at least sold by the operator 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:58.110
 whose office is located 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.750
 regionally located in Moscow for 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:08.240
 you can have any number here 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:08.240
 you can write let's say 937 let's say 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.770
 276 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.260
 he is 013 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.500
 let's see I just wrote from the bald 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.960
 see records not found imagine 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.980
 such a number let's say it does not exist and 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:35.310
 from the noodle and led to see such numbers not 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.240
 registered in the registry system then 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.090
 there is a database 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.070
 works gone as they say minus this 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.850
 database that it does not give out the names and 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.740
 middle name and the exact address of the addition 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.300
 the person who registered this 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.710
 number but it violates the law 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.210
 rf therefore 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:57.870
 this cannot be posted online 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:59.400
 without violating the criminal code therefore 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.860
 you have to be content with just not 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.020
 complete data if you thought it was 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.520
 the video is interesting then put your finger up 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.680
 this video subscribe to my channel 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.680
