00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.730
 new line of monitors lg 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.619
 already appeared in Ukraine and today we 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.920
 look at the flagship model with 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:25.340
 interesting design and functional 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.340
 innovations this model is 24 m p 76 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.119
 the very beginning attracts the original 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.730
 cinema screen design 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.680
 with a transparent leg it was made for 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.190
 so that the monitor would hang in 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.050
 the air 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.320
 the whole construction is going by 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.840
 there are no special screws and screwdrivers 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.450
 only the angle of the panel changes 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.969
 but the whole structure looks interesting 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.430
 and the original aluminum base 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.469
 steel case made of plastic 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.930
 moreover it is black glossy behind 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.090
 nourishes all this beauty thin 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.340
 silver frame on the back of the usual 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.350
 a place a set of interfaces is not here 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.860
 familiar to computer users 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.850
 but 2 hdmi and apparently for everyone 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.250
 case bg 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.770
 if you have hdmi missing then 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.049
 donâ€™t find the adapter system 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.729
 the problem is, among other things, audio 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.860
 output and headphone output 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.540
 and this because on the bottom is 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.640
 small stereo speakers 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.159
 if speaker system or headphone 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.380
 no such thing will save the situation in 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.070
 right moment and the other from her and not 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.619
 required 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.990
 front model looks spectacular but we 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.170
 already seen frameless design from ji 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.369
 and earlier therefore were not surprised yet 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.960
 turned on the monitor 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.490
 because the frame has really become 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.259
 much already 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.259
 the display still cannot be called 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.540
 completely frameless but progress is evident 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.060
 it feels like an image 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.549
 occupies all the space and just hangs 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.170
 in the air returns to the ground unless 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.720
 the lower part of the body where it is located 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.880
 touch screen control and menu not 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.159
 changed beginners have to get used to 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.810
 navigation but for those who are already familiar with 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.439
 lg monitor interfaces 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.939
 everything will be familiar and understandable here 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.850
 standard settings supplemented more 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.040
 serious adjustments of color definition 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.090
 and contrast there is even a fine tuning 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.489
 in six colors with brightness 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:23.709
 the saturation and hue of each real 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:25.810
 a flagship appeared and a new leader mode 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.830
 which is useful when reading large 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.350
 volumes of text 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.390
 It is designed to save energy and save 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.459
 eyes user who's my model 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.310
 has a diagonal of 24 inches 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.739
 where is the matrix set hey hey hey dog 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.019
 which is now the most 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.569
 quality monitor is calibrated to 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.150
 the plant as evidenced by this 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.590
 certificate so that everything is valid 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.940
 It became so as drawn in this 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.220
 do not forget to switch the document 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.100
 monitor into essay mode it defaults 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.030
 and included in the profile to change and 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.680
 custom 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.510
 as a result you will get great 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.640
 image quality in the form of a large 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.489
 coverage of accurate color temperature and 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.600
 great gram and thanks to that 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.940
 This model has no contraindications 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.730
 the monitor is suitable for movie lovers 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.950
 and gamers so for serious work with 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.109
 color and those who used to be 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.150
 suffered from flicker backlight will 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.579
 happy when designing a monitor 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.160
 used magic technology in 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.680
 liquor safe therefore even with a decrease 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.930
 the brightness of the years the backlight will not strain 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.780
 eyes too vigilant users 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.269
 further decide for yourself this model 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.820
 seem overly glamorous to someone 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.819
 the design will be pleasant but in any case 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.519
 the monitor is interesting and not cheap yes and 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.680
