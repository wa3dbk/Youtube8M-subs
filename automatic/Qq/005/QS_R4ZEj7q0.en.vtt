week's episode I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:02.879> make<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.090> cucumber<00:00:03.449> roll<00:00:08.630> is<00:00:10.639> a<00:00:11.639> piece<00:00:11.820> of

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
to make a cucumber roll is a piece of

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.350 
to make a cucumber roll is a piece of
cucumber<00:00:12.440> some<00:00:13.440> water<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.759> knife<00:00:15.000> now<00:00:15.299> the

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
cucumber some water and a knife now the

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.480 
cucumber some water and a knife now the
water<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.289> lubricate<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.800> knife<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.279> as

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
water is to lubricate the knife so as

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.609 
water is to lubricate the knife so as
you're<00:00:17.699> cutting<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.150> cucumber<00:00:18.690> then<00:00:19.260> it

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
you're cutting the cucumber then it

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.859 
you're cutting the cucumber then it
allows<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.369> slide<00:00:20.789> through<00:00:21.240> instead<00:00:21.750> of

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
allows you to slide through instead of

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.009 
allows you to slide through instead of
not<00:00:22.500> getting<00:00:22.830> bogged<00:00:23.070> down<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.760> now<00:00:24.750> what

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
not getting bogged down on it now what

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.320 
not getting bogged down on it now what
I've<00:00:25.109> done<00:00:25.140> here<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.740> I've<00:00:25.890> already<00:00:26.250> taken<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
I've done here is I've already taken the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.089 
I've done here is I've already taken the
skin<00:00:27.689> off<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.050> cucumber<00:00:28.560> with<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.769> cheese

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
skin off the cucumber with a cheese

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.400 
skin off the cucumber with a cheese
knife<00:00:31.850> keep<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.000> blade<00:00:33.149> wet<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.780> then<00:00:34.230> just

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
knife keep the blade wet and then just

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
knife keep the blade wet and then just
simply<00:00:35.600> move<00:00:36.600> into<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.200> with<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> knife<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:41.370> you

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
simply move into it with a knife and you

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.180 
simply move into it with a knife and you
want<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.670> keep<00:00:41.790> an<00:00:41.969> eye<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.649> the<00:00:43.649> blade<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.040> can

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
want to keep an eye on the blade you can

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.360 
want to keep an eye on the blade you can
just<00:00:44.520> see<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.879> through<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.539> cucumber<00:00:46.280> so<00:00:47.280> you

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
just see it through the cucumber so you

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.209 
just see it through the cucumber so you
want<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.700> keep<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.829> it's<00:00:49.829> not<00:00:50.010> too

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
want to keep it so that it's not too

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.590 
want to keep it so that it's not too
thick<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.700> not<00:00:50.789> too<00:00:51.030> thin

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
thick and not too thin

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.020 
thick and not too thin
if<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.379> lift<00:00:52.680> up<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.890> blade<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.489> then

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
if you lift up the blade like so then

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.090 
if you lift up the blade like so then
you<00:00:54.120> dig<00:00:54.360> deeper<00:00:54.780> into<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.020> cucumber<00:00:55.350> making

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
you dig deeper into a cucumber making

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.240 
you dig deeper into a cucumber making
the<00:00:56.190> slices<00:00:56.550> thicker<00:00:56.820> now<00:00:57.180> when<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:58.070> move<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the slices thicker now when you move the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.200 
the slices thicker now when you move the
blade<00:00:59.480> down<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:02.640> actually<00:01:02.850> come

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
blade down like so you actually come

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.929 
blade down like so you actually come
more<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> surface<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.760> you'll<00:01:05.760> cut

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
more to the surface and you'll cut

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.090 
more to the surface and you'll cut
thinner<00:01:06.210> slices<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.350> right<00:01:07.590> thickness<00:01:07.830> would

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
thinner slices the right thickness would

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.539 
thinner slices the right thickness would
be<00:01:08.280> about<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.909> quarter<00:01:09.450> centimeter<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.770> tenth

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
be about a quarter centimeter is tenth

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.870 
be about a quarter centimeter is tenth
of<00:01:11.729> an<00:01:11.820> inch<00:01:12.799> once<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.040> while<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.520> take<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
of an inch once in a while just take the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.300 
of an inch once in a while just take the
blade<00:01:15.090> out<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.810> cucumber<00:01:16.560> wet<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.070> again

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
blade out of the cucumber wet it again

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.060 
blade out of the cucumber wet it again
so<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.880> more<00:01:18.060> lubrication<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.070> then

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
so is you have more lubrication and then

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:30.300 
so is you have more lubrication and then
just<00:01:20.250> continue<00:01:20.430> cutting

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.760 

I'm<00:01:30.820> not<00:01:31.090> using<00:01:31.330> pressure<00:01:31.840> here<00:01:32.140> just<00:01:32.380> let<00:01:32.650> the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
I'm not using pressure here just let the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.490 
I'm not using pressure here just let the
nether<00:01:33.250> knife<00:01:33.490> do<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.729> work<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:35.200> you<00:01:35.260> just

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
nether knife do the work and you just

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.880 
nether knife do the work and you just
guide<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:36.100> cucumber<00:01:36.640> into<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:36.940> way<00:01:37.060> now

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
guide the cucumber into the way now

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.410 
guide the cucumber into the way now
between<00:01:38.890> cuts<00:01:39.190> you<00:01:39.400> push<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:39.880> up<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.180> then

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
between cuts you push it up and then

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.320 
between cuts you push it up and then
when<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.259> cut<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:41.710> bring<00:01:41.950> it<00:01:42.100> down<00:01:42.400> so<00:01:43.210> you're

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
when you cut you bring it down so you're

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.140 
when you cut you bring it down so you're
always<00:01:43.420> cutting<00:01:43.810> in<00:01:43.990> one<00:01:44.140> direction<00:01:45.150> this

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
always cutting in one direction this

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.370 
always cutting in one direction this
gives<00:01:46.360> you<00:01:46.420> a<00:01:46.450> lot<00:01:46.600> of<00:01:46.630> control<00:01:46.960> if<00:01:47.050> you<00:01:47.140> start

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
gives you a lot of control if you start

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.920 
gives you a lot of control if you start
soaring<00:01:47.710> both<00:01:47.890> ways<00:01:48.190> and<00:01:48.430> cutting<00:01:48.700> then

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
soaring both ways and cutting then

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.870 
soaring both ways and cutting then
you're<00:01:49.930> going<00:01:50.259> to<00:01:50.470> miss<00:01:50.920> calculate<00:01:51.430> and<00:01:51.640> slip

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
you're going to miss calculate and slip

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.389 
you're going to miss calculate and slip
up<00:01:52.290> now<00:01:53.290> this<00:01:53.500> does<00:01:53.680> take<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:53.950> little<00:01:54.159> bit<00:01:54.250> of

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
up now this does take a little bit of

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.300 
up now this does take a little bit of
practice<00:01:54.820> and<00:01:55.560> don't<00:01:56.560> worry<00:01:56.770> too<00:01:57.009> much<00:01:57.040> just

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
practice and don't worry too much just

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.719 
practice and don't worry too much just
buy<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.270> bunch<00:01:58.479> of<00:01:58.659> cucumbers<00:01:59.250> try<00:02:00.250> it<00:02:00.310> out<00:02:00.520> I

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
buy a bunch of cucumbers try it out I

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.340 
buy a bunch of cucumbers try it out I
mean<00:02:00.970> these<00:02:01.180> things<00:02:01.240> are<00:02:01.690> pretty<00:02:02.080> cheap

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
mean these things are pretty cheap

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.930 
mean these things are pretty cheap
anyway<00:02:02.770> okay<00:02:03.250> so<00:02:03.310> now<00:02:03.490> you<00:02:03.550> start<00:02:03.700> getting

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
anyway okay so now you start getting

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.690 
anyway okay so now you start getting
towards<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.509> seeds<00:02:04.840> is<00:02:05.289> when<00:02:05.800> you<00:02:05.920> stop<00:02:06.160> so

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
towards the seeds is when you stop so

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.000 
towards the seeds is when you stop so
there<00:02:07.390> we<00:02:07.479> go<00:02:10.140> alright<00:02:11.140> now<00:02:11.410> we<00:02:11.470> just<00:02:11.739> roll

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
there we go alright now we just roll

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.570 
there we go alright now we just roll
this<00:02:12.130> up<00:02:12.340> put<00:02:12.700> one<00:02:12.970> side<00:02:15.840> for<00:02:16.840> later<00:02:17.550> take<00:02:18.550> a

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
this up put one side for later take a

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:27.290 
this up put one side for later take a
