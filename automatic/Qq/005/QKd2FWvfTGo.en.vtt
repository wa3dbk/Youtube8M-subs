00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.650 
little Nixon leaf
it<00:00:40.559> uses<00:00:41.010> an<00:00:41.100> 80<00:00:41.370> kilowatt<00:00:41.969> electric<00:00:42.120> motor

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
it uses an 80 kilowatt electric motor

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.750 
it uses an 80 kilowatt electric motor
which<00:00:42.960> means<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.379> consumes<00:00:43.770> as<00:00:43.890> much<00:00:44.250> power<00:00:44.550> as

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
which means it consumes as much power as

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.810 
which means it consumes as much power as
800<00:00:45.660> light<00:00:45.840> bulbs<00:00:46.230> or<00:00:46.379> 80<00:00:46.920> washing<00:00:47.489> machines

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.209 
800 light bulbs or 80 washing machines
that<00:00:48.300> gives<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> equivalent<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.260> 109

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
that gives you the equivalent of 109

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.040 
that gives you the equivalent of 109
horsepower<00:00:50.460> or<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> electric<00:00:51.570> motor<00:00:51.719> also

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
horsepower or the electric motor also

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.450 
horsepower or the electric motor also
produces<00:00:52.739> 280<00:00:53.489> Newton<00:00:54.300> meters<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.629> torque<00:00:54.719> so

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
produces 280 Newton meters of torque so

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.880 
produces 280 Newton meters of torque so
what<00:00:56.460> will<00:00:56.610> happen<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.570> drag<00:00:57.809> race<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.710> find

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
just I'm coasting along really I got

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.450 
just I'm coasting along really I got
thrashed<00:01:38.830> that<00:01:39.830> was<00:01:39.950> a<00:01:39.980> little<00:01:40.100> bit<00:01:40.310> of<00:01:40.400> a

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
thrashed that was a little bit of a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.190 
thrashed that was a little bit of a
whitewash<00:01:40.820> wasn't<00:01:41.180> it<00:01:41.270> I<00:01:41.600> actually<00:01:41.870> thought

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
whitewash wasn't it I actually thought

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.480 
whitewash wasn't it I actually thought
the<00:01:42.350> leaf<00:01:42.530> would<00:01:42.680> do<00:01:42.830> much<00:01:42.980> better<00:01:43.040> than<00:01:43.280> it

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
the leaf would do much better than it

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.520 
the leaf would do much better than it
did<00:01:43.700> but<00:01:44.240> I<00:01:44.390> think<00:01:44.570> it<00:01:44.630> was<00:01:44.720> hamstrung<00:01:45.260> by<00:01:45.290> its

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
did but I think it was hamstrung by its

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.560 
did but I think it was hamstrung by its
weight<00:01:45.740> off<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.430> line<00:01:46.610> as<00:01:46.850> a<00:01:46.910> result<00:01:47.390> did

weight off the line as a result did

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.560 
weight off the line as a result did
naught<00:01:47.750> to<00:01:47.930> 60<00:01:48.110> in<00:01:48.640> 10.5<00:01:49.640> seconds<00:01:50.210> whereas

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
naught to 60 in 10.5 seconds whereas

naught to 60 in 10.5 seconds whereas
this<00:01:50.750> did<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.110> in<00:01:51.320> nine<00:01:51.800> point<00:01:52.190> four<00:01:52.550> seconds

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
this did it in nine point four seconds

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.750 
this did it in nine point four seconds
and<00:01:53.330> then<00:01:54.320> it<00:01:54.410> was<00:01:54.500> all<00:01:54.620> over<00:01:54.860> really<00:01:55.040> this<00:01:55.580> did

seconds the leaf it was seventeen point
nine<00:02:00.140> seconds<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.040> no<00:02:01.390> this<00:02:02.390> hero<00:02:02.630> wasn't
