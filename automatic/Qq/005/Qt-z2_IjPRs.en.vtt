00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.150
 hello that such friends my name is halo and 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.059
 I'm going to show you how to visualize your 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.919
 Android computer available on your pc what 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.160
 first thing we're going to do is connect by 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:16.039
 medium of usb our android device 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.930
 and automatically it will search for 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.760
 necessary drivers to recognize it 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.830
 as an android device my team 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.509
 arrives has you installed and how can 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.509
 see already known as a device 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:29.029
 Android well once you have 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.590
 the necessary drivers installed and their 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.739
 equipment unaware as a device 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.420
 android we will continue with the tutorial 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.980
 we will go to the internet and we will 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.900
 download the files that we need 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.530
 to be able to visualize our team 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:46.129
 android on our pc the first one is a 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.680
 file delete with the name sdk I'm going 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.750
 to leave the links of the three files 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.809
 that we need in the description of 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.520
 video once they enter the first 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.940
 link that is going to be this we are going to give a 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.680
 click on this blue button 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.030
 as you can see below 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.000
 shows a screen with an agreement 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.880
 that we must accept 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.560
 and we have to check the box 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.500
 our operating system that 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.990
 currently available in my case is 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.460
 2 bits we mark it and we start the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.040
 discharge 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.729
 a file will automatically be downloaded 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.159
 in rar format and now once created 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.110
 because I already have to download 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.950
 this file with time because it weighs 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.250
 around 480 mb and it will take 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.610
 a little good 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.170
 then we will download java if 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.720
 is that you do not have installed 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.470
 let's download it let's give it a 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.090
 click on the red button 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.470
 next shows us the new 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.050
 screen tells us that we need 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.600
 start the free download show you 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.560
 one click and it automatically starts 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.760
 to download our program calls 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.990
 I do not discard either because I have it 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.750
 installed well below we are going to 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.420
 download the file that helps us 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.110
 visualize our android team in 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.210
 our pc android tsjm this is a 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.900
 program that is executed by means of 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.670
 java why we need java let's go to 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.370
 escape any version I would 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.290
 I recommend that you download the most current 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.540
 which in my case is the 1.0 point 2 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.300
 let's give it a click and it's also going to 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.800
 download automatically and no longer the 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.980
 I write because then I have it 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.810
 well once we finish downloading 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.480
 the necessary files we are going to close 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.640
 our explorer 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.400
 we are going to direct ourselves to locate our 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:47.010
 files I hold in downloads like 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.010
 you can see they are two files 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.130
 this is the android screen program in the 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.550
 version 1.0 point 2 and this is the file 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.790
 rar ray forgiveness of the sdk we are going to 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.830
 unzip it and we have a folder left 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.680
 with superimposed inside we're going to 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.520
 run this application called sdk 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.520
 manager 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.549
 this application helps us to 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.950
 update the drivers and some 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.510
 drivers that we need to 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.530
 our android team 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.400
 let's wait for them to change 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.080
 these packages will vary a lot 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.750
 depending on your team that have the 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.330
 operating system they have but 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.800
 it automatically detects them and we're going to 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.810
 click once you have finished 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.520
 to load and detect them we are going to give a 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.770
 click here to install the five packages 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.830
 and we are going to give you here to accept already 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.540
 then install, I'm not going to 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.830
 install because then I have them 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.410
 installed this is only the 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.300
 update of the previous ones in your 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.580
 case they can install and they are also going to 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.310
 do it with time since I 'm in this 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.320
 discharge takes around 20 to 30 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.050
 minutes because the weight of the files 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.870
 that will download is around 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:06.800
 500 to 600 megabytes okay what you 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.480
 download and wait for them to update 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.940
 and I'll give it to cancel and I'll 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.820
 close this window the next thing that 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.130
 let's do is go to drive inn 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:20.160
 let's double click to open it 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.870
 and well how can it not be a program that 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.930
 it is useful for the version of our 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.660
 Android device what are we going to do 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.840
 is to open the adhb tabs 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.020
 and go to the adhb option 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.020
 executable pad 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.310
 this automatically detects it but of 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:43.040
 not be so what you have to 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:47.390
 to do is to click on this button 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:51.080
 let's go to the folder of 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.820
 and the rare wing that we have extracted we are going 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.360
 to direct us to the location in my case 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:59.020
 is in downloads 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.360
 let's prepare the folder and here 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.370
 inside let's put the folder sdk 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.770
 what is this we are going to click on 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.860
 her to open it 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.289
 and they offer us new folders we are going to 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.960
 locate the file in the ceiling folder 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:19.110

 now let's give in accept 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.290
 and is automatically having 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.990
 connected to our android device 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.700
 It opens a screen with the 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.900
 display of our device 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.900
