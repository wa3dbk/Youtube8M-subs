00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:02.149 
hey my friends this is part one of

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.780 
hey my friends this is part one of
installing<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.710> 1<00:00:04.710> terabyte<00:00:05.040> Seagate

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
installing a 1 terabyte Seagate

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.680 
installing a 1 terabyte Seagate
Barracuda<00:00:06.589> 7200<00:00:07.589> rpm<00:00:07.980> hard<00:00:08.010> drive<00:00:08.280> in<00:00:09.030> an<00:00:09.360> MPC

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
Barracuda 7200 rpm hard drive in an MPC

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.180 
Barracuda 7200 rpm hard drive in an MPC
5000<00:00:10.590> so<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:11.099> first<00:00:11.280> step<00:00:11.570> in<00:00:12.570> any<00:00:13.040> hard<00:00:14.040> drive

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
5000 so the first step in any hard drive

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.189 
5000 so the first step in any hard drive
replacement<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.969> for<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.690> backup<00:00:15.929> your

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
replacement is for you to backup your

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.650 
replacement is for you to backup your
hard<00:00:16.560> drive<00:00:16.770> that's<00:00:17.550> existing<00:00:18.119> in<00:00:18.240> there<00:00:18.420> so

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
hard drive that's existing in there so

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.720 
hard drive that's existing in there so
what<00:00:19.380> you're<00:00:19.470> going<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.619> do<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.100> you're<00:00:20.400> going

backed up and then at the conclusion

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.280 
backed up and then at the conclusion
we'll<00:01:01.410> go<00:01:01.559> ahead<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.629> reinstall<00:01:03.629> those<00:01:03.989> files

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
we'll go ahead and reinstall those files

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.070 
we'll go ahead and reinstall those files
back<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.010> new<00:01:05.129> hard<00:01:05.339> drive<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:06.420> first

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
back on to the new hard drive but first

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.170 
back on to the new hard drive but first
step<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.369> basically<00:01:08.549> take<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
step in this is to basically take the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.130 
step in this is to basically take the
MPC<00:01:09.630> 5000<00:01:10.520> unplug<00:01:11.520> everything<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.600> then<00:01:12.930> you

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
MPC 5000 unplug everything and then you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.550 
MPC 5000 unplug everything and then you
gotta<00:01:13.350> take<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:14.150> like<00:01:15.150> I'm<00:01:15.330> doing<00:01:15.630> here<00:01:15.930> and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
gotta take it like I'm doing here and

gotta take it like I'm doing here and
you're<00:01:17.250> gonna<00:01:17.460> put<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.180> soft<00:01:18.479> surface

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
you're gonna put it on a soft surface

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.090 
you're gonna put it on a soft surface
I'm<00:01:19.920> putting<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.340> my<00:01:20.549> couch<00:01:21.140> ok<00:01:22.140> now

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
there's a series of screws and I'm not

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.600 
there's a series of screws and I'm not
gonna<00:01:25.110> go<00:01:25.290> into<00:01:25.409> detail<00:01:25.799> what<00:01:25.979> screws<00:01:26.369> they

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
gonna go into detail what screws they

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.310 
gonna go into detail what screws they
are<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:26.939> they're<00:01:27.090> basically<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.720> perimeter

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
are but they're basically the perimeter

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.859 
are but they're basically the perimeter
screws<00:01:28.740> all<00:01:29.009> along<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.460> edge<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:29.869> that

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
screws all along the edge here that

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.569 
screws all along the edge here that
you're<00:01:31.049> gonna<00:01:31.170> remove<00:01:32.479> first<00:01:33.479> okay<00:01:34.070> then<00:01:35.070> once

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
you're gonna remove first okay then once

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.719 
you're gonna remove first okay then once
you've<00:01:35.790> removed<00:01:36.030> those<00:01:36.570> screws<00:01:37.460> you're<00:01:38.460> going

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
you've removed those screws you're going

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.210 
you've removed those screws you're going
to<00:01:38.850> take<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.479> front<00:01:39.930> portion<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.590> MPC<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
to take the front portion of the MPC the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.760 
to take the front portion of the MPC the
portion<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.670> says<00:01:41.850> MPC<00:01:42.329> 5000<00:01:43.079> you're<00:01:43.649> going

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
portion that says MPC 5000 you're going

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.740 
portion that says MPC 5000 you're going
to<00:01:43.829> take<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.130> panel<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.820> you're<00:01:45.299> gonna<00:01:45.390> lift

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
to take this panel and you're gonna lift

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.810 
to take this panel and you're gonna lift
it<00:01:46.020> back<00:01:46.290> okay<00:01:46.740> because<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.159> hard<00:01:47.369> drive<00:01:47.640> is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
it back okay because the hard drive is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.999 
it back okay because the hard drive is
back<00:01:48.030> here<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:49.290> connected<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.770> some

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
back here and it's connected to some

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.590 
back here and it's connected to some
very<00:01:50.369> short<00:01:50.909> cables<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.670> if<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.880> yank<00:01:54.210> this

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
very short cables and if you yank this

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.719 
very short cables and if you yank this
this<00:01:54.990> thing<00:01:55.229> off<00:01:55.500> you're<00:01:55.979> gonna<00:01:56.100> pull<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
this thing off you're gonna pull the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.230 
this thing off you're gonna pull the
cables<00:01:57.119> out<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.750> might<00:01:57.930> destroy<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
cables out and you might destroy the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.289 
cables out and you might destroy the
adapter<00:02:00.799> that<00:02:01.799> they<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.579> installed<00:02:03.030> on

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
adapter that they have installed on

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.959 
adapter that they have installed on
these<00:02:03.420> new<00:02:03.659> versions<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.710> MPC<00:02:05.250> which

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
these new versions of the MPC which

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.229 
these new versions of the MPC which
converts<00:02:07.039> SATA<00:02:08.039> drives<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.640> IDE

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
