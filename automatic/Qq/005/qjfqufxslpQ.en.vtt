 in the garden that will have its own 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.340
 function when we advance to the adventure 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.259
 shortly after leaving we will meet a 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.750
 group of characters that give us a choice 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.729

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.350
 They will give us the new pocket ex where 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.799
 Pokemons will be registered 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.799
 let's find 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.509
 after leaving pull pull the gym 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.369
 innovate that will be our first destination 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.200
 that the city is not empty and 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.640
 easily recognizable by its great 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.640
 fountain located in the center 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.560
 in the center of the heat region it 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.659
 find luminary city a metropolis 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.509
 full of life and customers who visit 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.400
 its infinity of stores from its iconic 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.020
 tower located in the center of the city 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.020
 there are numerous streets 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.780
 in its playability we noticed several changes 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.610
 such as being able to run without 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.740
 need to get the famous 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.990
 slippers instead have been added 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.110
 some skates that will make us go to more 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.400
 speed using the analog stick 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.350
 we can also travel on the back of 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.360
 some pokemon to reach areas 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.360
 that are otherwise inaccessible 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.739
 now you can fight air combats 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.360
 between flying-type pokemon in addition to 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.519
 face big hordes of 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.519
 enemies being before very limited 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.510
 One of the biggest novelties is the 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.490
 mere evolutions that allow a 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.890
 Pokémon evolve during a combat 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.900
 increasing its strength considerably 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.810
 seeing your abilities altered or 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.000
 even your guy does not all pokemon 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.760
 can mega evolve just some and 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.740
 under certain circumstances besides 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.970
 depending on the version we have 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.970
 these will be different 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.500
 to be able to do it we need an object 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.660
 known as the mega stone existing 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.730
 one for each species of pokemon capable of 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.430
 evolve and see giving your name 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.380
 pokemon specifically our coach 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.420
 takes his left arm the mega aaron 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.670
 that reacts with dumbo that brings us to 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.370
 his mega stone unleashing his mega 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.200
 evolution but everything that will not work 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.580
 if the link between a pokemon is 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.580
 coach is not very strong 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.820
 in the super training we do not increase 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.610
 the level of our pokemon but its 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.470
 dexterity points for combat here 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.810
 we can increase your experience 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.820
 attack defense attack special defense 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.700
 special and speed at a higher rate 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.500
 than those of other pokemon in previous 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.270
 titles of the saga could already be increased 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.400
 by gestures but in this way 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.400
 it is much simpler and more effective 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.770
 next to the old pokemon types it 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.300
 has added a new category in the 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.010
 of type a is where you have 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.110
 rated some pokemon's 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.530
 previous titles than new ones like 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.530
 Silvio 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.890
 the customization also plays a 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.900
 important role in this adventure 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.940
 being able to change the aspect of our 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.100
 character visiting clothing stores and 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.290
 Beauty salons choosing different 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.960
 equipment such as footwear caps 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.120
 accessories you can also change the 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.490
 changing our hairstyle icon 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.490
 pss and the pokémon global link 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.430
 and if we go through the study of 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.950
 recording we can create a small 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.630
 10 seconds video where to introduce ourselves 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.820
 and make our pokemon known 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.010
 choosing the background music the angles 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.150
 from camera to poses and effects to create 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.150
 a video of our style 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.560
 the play touch forget us play with 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.990
 our pokémon to get little 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.810
 at any time give them treats or 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.430
 caress those with the touch screen 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.380
 this will be necessary to make them 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.150
 better is fought by making them more 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.920
 friendly and feel loved 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.920
 having each a few references 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:58.349
 thanks to the new players there are 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:06:00.539
 we can connect with some players 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.429
 that are close to us or through 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:04.830
 the online either to fight against 

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:06.479
 them or exchange pokemon even with 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.270
 those who have not had contact 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.159
 previously in addition through the node 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.869
 mixed we can receive messages from 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:16.550
 people who are far away from 

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:16.550
 other players I am the teacher 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.550
 taking advantage of the new graphic style 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.170
 totally three-dimensional allowing 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.000
 much more freedom than in previous 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.500
 titles a camera has been introduced 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.780
 to be able to take pictures of the 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.210
 stunning views in places with a 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.620
 So organic sight signal for 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.630
 get photos of our style 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.850
 we can adjust the focus the diaphragm 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.450
 exposure or brightness among other 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.450
 many functions 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.840
 told in a great soundtrack with 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.850
 multitude of melodies that adapt to 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.950
 all kinds of situations besides 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.110
 sounds for each creature and different 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.350
 effects although some of these are very 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.350
 improvable 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.539
 in conclusion pokemon x and pokemon and you'll see 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.970
 are two essential titles for the 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:12.380
 3d laptop from nintendo with lots of 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.130
 content and hours of fun 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.130
 insured 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.630
 although it retains its classic gameplay 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.970
 adds new elements that make it 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.770
 much more palatable as the fighting 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.380
 or against a large number of 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:32.150
 pokemon the mega evolutions added 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.150
 also a great strategic touch 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.199
 the new ways of training our 

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.150
 Pokémon are much more entertaining than 

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:42.130
 in previous versions making the 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.940
 adventure is more enjoyable thanks to the 

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.940
 different mini-games 

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.569
 the renewed graphic aspect that gives the 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.879
 possibility of new playable aspects 

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:57.740
 and his extensive soundtrack make the 

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:57.740
 Overall result is very good 

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:04.420
 pokemon x and pokemon and strips are converted 

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.250
 well in two highly recommended games for 

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:09.390
 the followers of the saga for those 

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.390
 who want to start the
