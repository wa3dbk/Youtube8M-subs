00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.579
 we are now with eva and have us 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.120
 straight or just getting ready and 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.039
 is already much before we have to go a 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.440
 hour to go around we are indeed 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.440
 something else we are waiting for you to eat 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:15.760
 that is open we are standing in here 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.660
 a giant snake and it does not work 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.020
 nothing back 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.480
 since the coni strange came and now 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.110
 she goes back 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.450
 is in practice and he is being paid to her 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.640
 they come directly purely she died 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.640
 probably is great 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.660
 Hamburg 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.470
 the party is over so i wanted you 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.540
 again a little feedback on how 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.700
 liked the evening and so and 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.720
 All in all , I found it very much 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.660
 very interesting should be 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.630
 First of all , I have a lot of people 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.360
 I usually only see it through various 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.560
 social media platform track and also 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.049
 if I'm not necessarily with them 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.760
 people just entertained so in 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.080
 Real times to see and their facial expressions and 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.890
 I always like gestures 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.019
 revealing and that we 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.390
 So, during the show above, they were like 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.190
 on such an empore I could all 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.600
 people watching super and watching 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.100
 Of course I did that too if you did 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.190
 my video looks longer then 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.650
 Do you know that I am a very attentive 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.020
 and practiced observer pins and 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.490
 otherwise I can not do that much 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.660
 to say it because it is just my first 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.190
 fashion show was and I have none 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.750
 I believe in the comparison 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.220
 organization is a little bit wrong 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.410
 went so we were just out there 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:46.370
 quite a long time and others were if I am 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.810
 even longer than we and the 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.680
 aftershowparty i think there are then 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.820
 not any more, anyhow 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.940
 got in somehow was such a 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.530
 weird and the after show party 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.300
 We were not so long now 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.580
 So we're around I think I'm trying 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.180
 12 already at home so the music found 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.010
 I am very cool 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.260
 but what bothered me was that 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.760
 yes that was it in the Stadtbad wedding 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.950
 was really in an old swimming pool 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.200
 and the dance floor was in, so to speak 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.690
 so it's where he pots it and you put it 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.270
 then got a bit deeper and 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.300
 how standard all the time down and 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.979
 everyone else who stood up could 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.270
 all the time so look at us 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.400
 who then practically done what 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.260
 I did during the show and 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.050
 I can not do that myself so well though 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.180
 Well, unfortunately, I'm not right 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.990
 to protect 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.430
 otherwise I'm very much 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.530
 very glad that I had the opportunity 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:39.620
 to go there and thanks for the 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.150
 evening stylight a studio 71 case without 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.260
 I would not have come there 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.610
 I hope the video has you too 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.140
 please and i hope i have a few 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.720
 interesting and insightful 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.030
 to be able to capture impressions 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.659
 that was interesting and 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:56.229
 capture insightful impressions 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.229
 until the next, hopefully
