00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.160
 today we will address the matter 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.350
 carburation a carburetion 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.240
 of course minimal basic because the 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.629
 real carburetion will then have to be addressed 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.150
 on the road trying our engine 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:38.730
 on the road to see the gears 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.370
 how it behaves by checking maybe the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.879
 but we are already the color of the candle 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.519
 half the work to address the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.220
 carburetion speech I give you one more 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.960
 go over the vines I already had 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.000
 shown in the previous video on 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.820
 carburetor overhaul them first 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.579
 we find the screw of the minimum that goes to act 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.120
 on the guillotine and the screw of the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.739
 carburetion the idle screw is easy 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.660
 recognize because precisely following the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.280
 guillotine we will see this life that 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.860
 exists ds type carburetors like these 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.009
 or like these, just follow 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.369
 precisely the guillotine and we will see the 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.630
 lives that must act on them as far as 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.619
 concerns the life of the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.970
 carburation if we find it downstream ie 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.429
 towards the engine by screwing the lean mo 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.009
 mine because we close by unscrewing 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.929
 we will get fat because we open certain 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.459
 carburetors instead this life there 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.099
 we find upstream towards the rent 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.780
 of the area as we all know the area goes 

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:45.090
 zmagria of the mine and therefore tents 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.459
 speed up the engine so we'll do the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.340
 reverse procedure if we close then 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:53.160
 we remove air the engine will go will go 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.660
 get fat if we unscrew the engine instead 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:00.539
 will tend to get lost due to carburetion 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.090
 I proceed in this way after having 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.560
 previously heated the engine to 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.800
 a few minutes 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.450
 turn on and make the 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.250
 engine with this minimum life 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.310
 let's keep it was a bit of a turn 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.410
 do not overdo it and then we go to close 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.510
 the carburetor screw until the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.510
 engine will shut down now I'll show you 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.510
 It's funny 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.540
 the mind to do what we are 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.300
 making the motor must be assembled 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.430
 perfect there must not be 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.310
 give aspirations anywhere 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.290
 good or bad jets should be 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.550
 the right ones 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.380
 once done what he had done 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.580
 see now let's unscrew this 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:27.250
 about 10 lives a lap and a half round 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:32.500
 a fourth going to open in this 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:35.620
 way a complete tour 1 and let's do a 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.780
 a quarter at this point 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.810
 turn the engine back on and go to 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.829
 adjust up to our liking with 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.829
 the screw of the minimum 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.900
 the others repented 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.900
 Yes No 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:17.630
 I would say this 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.630
 the grandchildren grant four wounded 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.690
 these reactions 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.539
 I wanted to show you how it behaves 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.160
 engine if absurdly we had jets 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.919
 completely wrong on ours 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.680
 carburetor this is just an engine 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:40.979
 just a little pushed and rode a car 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.139
 ziegler with a jet of the maximum of 80 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.090
 now I'll show you that absurdly but 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.569
 really really hard mount assimo a 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.349
 much bigger cast type a 110 you 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:54.449
 I'll show you how it behaves like 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.310
 I told you before I mounted a jet 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.220
 really exaggerated just for 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.470
 show you how the engine behaves 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.409
 should do a lot of smoking e 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.830
 bubbling mumbling when accelerates 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.830
 now let's see 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.790
 as you have noticed it was enough of 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.400
 change a much bigger jet than 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.600
 the engine couldn't even accelerate it 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.900
 so much smoke 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.120
 now as against pros I will show you 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.669
 decrease a lot of the jet then from 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.259
 a clear 80 its original we exaggerate 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.740
 let's put a 60 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:49.740
 we see 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.160
 tablets are withdrawals by subject 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.800
 like engine vacuums boasts 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.749
 to notice also decreasing by a lot 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:23.650
 the jet the engine didn't work like 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:25.869
 where you go 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.059
 the smoke disappeared however the engine 

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:30.699
 it was hard to get out of laps was missing 

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:32.710
 so here is the importance of trying the 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:36.809
 our half on the road by pulling a little 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.919
 marches doing all the checks precisely 

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:41.139
 decrease or increase our items 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.330
 very important thing also to check 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:44.919
 the color of the candle if that were 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.020
 very smeared with oil 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:50.439
 you can well understand that the jet is large 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.839
 if it was a very clear electrode 

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:54.509
 this would be the exact color 

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:59.610
 should on a nutty color 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:59.610
 I thank you and see you next time
