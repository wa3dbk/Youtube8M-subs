 go on a walk and found 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.660

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.660

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:51.020
 the confrontation lasted ten minutes 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.899
 a situation that was already expected in this 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.810
 moment the shock crew has just 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.180
 position a little further down

 they are in need of an ambulance because 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.480
 There are wounded people at night falls and the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.519
 teachers in the public 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.340
 decided to keep the strike 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.620
