00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
we're to be talking about its connection

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.190

directly<00:00:53.400> to<00:00:54.180> king<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.390> Mars<00:00:54.540> 3<00:00:54.809> now<00:00:54.930> as<00:00:55.050> we

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
directly to king of Mars 3 now as we

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.080 
directly to king of Mars 3 now as we
know<00:00:55.320> Kingdom<00:00:55.650> Hearts<00:00:55.770> key<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.580> obviously

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
know Kingdom Hearts key is obviously

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.520

launch events no one knows what it is
and<00:04:41.220> then<00:04:41.639> there's<00:04:41.759> daybreak<00:04:42.120> town<00:04:42.300> which

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
and then there's daybreak town which

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:43.860 
and then there's daybreak town which
apparently<00:04:42.599> looks<00:04:42.900> very<00:04:43.080> familiar<00:04:43.199> to<00:04:43.440> it

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
apparently looks very familiar to it

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.750 
apparently looks very familiar to it
and<00:04:43.990> let<00:04:44.560> have<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.710> partial<00:04:45.040> X<00:04:45.160> also<00:04:45.610> looks

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
and let have the partial X also looks

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.430 
and let have the partial X also looks
familiar<00:04:45.880> to<00:04:46.090> that<00:04:46.240> so<00:04:46.480> I<00:04:46.690> kind<00:04:47.140> of<00:04:47.170> wonder<00:04:47.410> if

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
familiar to that so I kind of wonder if

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.230 
familiar to that so I kind of wonder if
since<00:04:47.980> daybreak<00:04:48.190> town<00:04:48.490> is<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.700> big<00:04:48.850> hub<00:04:49.030> world

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.000 
since daybreak town is the big hub world
in<00:04:49.390> que<00:04:49.480> de<00:04:49.540> Mars<00:04:49.720> regular<00:04:50.320> key<00:04:50.530> and<00:04:50.770> you<00:04:50.890> know

in que de Mars regular key and you know

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.230 
in que de Mars regular key and you know
it's<00:04:51.130> kinda<00:04:51.280> marquee<00:04:51.580> if<00:04:51.730> kena<00:04:52.060> marks
