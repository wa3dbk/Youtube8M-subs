we're<00:00:05.879> going<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:06.029> show<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.359> how<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.660> change

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
we're going to show you how to change

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.560 
we're going to show you how to change
the<00:00:07.170> coolant<00:00:07.589> in<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.980> motorcycle<00:00:08.420> if<00:00:09.420> you

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
the coolant in the motorcycle if you

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.070 
the coolant in the motorcycle if you
look<00:00:09.719> over<00:00:09.960> here<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.610> demonstration<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:12.360> how<00:00:13.019> we

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
look over here a demonstration of how we

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.650 
look over here a demonstration of how we
flush<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.889> radiator<00:00:14.340> or<00:00:14.639> change<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.269> coolant

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
flush the radiator or change the coolant

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.380 
flush the radiator or change the coolant
it's<00:00:16.560> always<00:00:16.800> very<00:00:17.100> important<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:18.060> keep<00:00:18.330> good

we've added to it from here it's very

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.020 
we've added to it from here it's very
important<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.030> all<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.780> fluids<00:01:13.170> out

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
important to have all the fluids out

this fluid on this vehicle gets changed

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.530 
this fluid on this vehicle gets changed
very<00:01:16.950> frequently<00:01:17.520> which<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.939> why<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.180> seems

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
very frequently which is why it seems

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.590 
very frequently which is why it seems
quite<00:01:18.869> clear<00:01:20.270> generally<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.360> type<00:01:21.570> of

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
quite clear generally this type of

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.749 
quite clear generally this type of
service<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.320> overlooked<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.490> many

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
service is overlooked on many

service is overlooked on many
motorcycles<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.140> find<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.590> be

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
motorcycles and we find it to be

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.700 
motorcycles and we find it to be
extremely<00:01:26.040> imperative<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.630> climates<00:01:28.560> where

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
extremely imperative to climates where

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.620 
extremely imperative to climates where
it<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.250> be<00:01:29.340> very<00:01:29.549> harsh<00:01:29.880> either<00:01:30.210> cool<00:01:30.600> or

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
it can be very harsh either cool or

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
especially when it's hot once we have

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.050 
especially when it's hot once we have
all<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> fluid<00:01:34.470> that's<00:01:34.590> been<00:01:34.860> removed<00:01:35.280> we

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
all the fluid that's been removed we

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.450 
all the fluid that's been removed we
want<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.479> able<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.840> put<00:01:37.380> new<00:01:37.619> fresh<00:01:37.979> fluids

put the funnel towards the radiator we
have<00:01:58.590> our<00:01:58.770> chemicals<00:01:59.310> or<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.599> case<00:02:00.810> we're

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
have our chemicals or in this case we're

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.120 
have our chemicals or in this case we're
using<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:02.000> coolant<00:02:03.200> it's<00:02:04.200> very<00:02:04.530> warm<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.039> these

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
using a coolant it's very warm in these

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.770 
using a coolant it's very warm in these
climate<00:02:05.640> right<00:02:05.849> now<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.299> we're<00:02:06.450> going<00:02:06.539> to<00:02:06.630> use

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
climate right now so we're going to use

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.910 
climate right now so we're going to use
the<00:02:06.959> coolant<00:02:09.080> from<00:02:10.080> here<00:02:11.120> using<00:02:12.120> your<00:02:12.329> spouts

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
the coolant from here using your spouts

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.650 
the coolant from here using your spouts
pour<00:02:13.920> directly<00:02:14.069> into<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.790> spout<00:02:15.060> which<00:02:15.480> will

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
pour directly into the spout which will

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.250 
pour directly into the spout which will
go<00:02:15.810> into<00:02:16.049> the<00:02:16.319> radiator<00:02:17.720> now<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.840> course<00:02:19.079> we've

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
go into the radiator now of course we've

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.720 
go into the radiator now of course we've
put<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.560> bolt<00:02:19.769> back<00:02:19.829> on<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.400> it's<00:02:20.549> going<00:02:20.610> to

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
put the bolt back on so it's going to

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.550 
put the bolt back on so it's going to
help<00:02:20.879> fill<00:02:21.180> up<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.420> reservoir<00:02:21.629> as<00:02:22.170> well<00:02:22.410> as

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
help fill up the reservoir as well as

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.790 
help fill up the reservoir as well as
the<00:02:22.680> radiator<00:02:23.099> directly

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.740 

keep<00:02:30.400> an<00:02:30.550> eye<00:02:30.670> frequently<00:02:31.570> on<00:02:31.720> the

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
keep an eye frequently on the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.110 
keep an eye frequently on the
measurement<00:02:32.320> inside<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.830> radiator<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:33.850> can

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
measurement inside the radiator this can

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.420 
measurement inside the radiator this can
be<00:02:34.240> done<00:02:34.450> by<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.660> simple<00:02:35.080> visual<00:02:35.500> inspection

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
be done by a simple visual inspection

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.120 
be done by a simple visual inspection
and<00:02:36.990> that's<00:02:37.990> how<00:02:38.110> we<00:02:38.170> change<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.680> coolant<00:02:39.040> in

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
and that's how we change the coolant in

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.100 
and that's how we change the coolant in
