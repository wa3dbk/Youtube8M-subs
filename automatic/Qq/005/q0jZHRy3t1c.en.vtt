must<00:00:59.670> be<00:00:59.850> depressed<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:01.969> because<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.180> airbag

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
must be depressed and because the airbag

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.810 
must be depressed and because the airbag
has<00:01:03.809> Springs<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.830> airbag<00:01:05.430> will<00:01:05.580> literally

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
has Springs the airbag will literally

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.000 
has Springs the airbag will literally
pop<00:01:06.210> off<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:07.010> soon<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:10.080> released<00:01:10.380> you

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
pop off as soon as it is released you

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.330 
pop off as soon as it is released you
will<00:01:11.280> know<00:01:11.460> when<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.600> released<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.170> so

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
will know when you have released it so

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.770 
will know when you have released it so
you<00:01:14.340> insert<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> screwdriver<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.420> access

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
you insert the screwdriver in the access

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.840 
you insert the screwdriver in the access
hole<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:19.200> need<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.439> go<00:01:19.560> above<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.280> spring

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
hole and you need to go above the spring

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.219 
hole and you need to go above the spring
clip<00:01:22.159> you<00:01:23.159> can<00:01:23.369> go<00:01:24.330> straight<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.780> you'll<00:01:25.020> hit

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
clip you can go straight in you'll hit

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.160 
clip you can go straight in you'll hit
the<00:01:25.290> spring<00:01:25.650> clip<00:01:25.860> which<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.900> good<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.110> a

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
the spring clip which is good for a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.899 
the spring clip which is good for a
reference<00:01:28.500> point<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.100> know<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.670> you

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
reference point so you know that you

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.370 
reference point so you know that you
need<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.180> go<00:01:30.329> higher<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.750> really<00:01:31.110> can't<00:01:31.229> go<00:01:31.320> to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
need to go higher you really can't go to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.410 
need to go higher you really can't go to
the<00:01:31.470> very<00:01:31.650> top<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.100> hole<00:01:32.250> because<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
the very top of the hole because the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.660 
the very top of the hole because the
only<00:01:33.689> way<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.869> release<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.470> spear<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.159> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
only way to release the spear is to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.770 
only way to release the spear is to
depress<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:37.140> met<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.380> spring<00:01:37.860> clip<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:39.360> as

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
depress the met the spring clip so as

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.749 
depress the met the spring clip so as
I'm<00:01:40.079> depressing<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.100> right<00:01:41.220> here<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.549> can

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
I'm depressing it right here you can

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.130 
I'm depressing it right here you can
skip<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.150> general<00:01:42.479> idea<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.899> need<00:01:43.020> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
skip the general idea that you need to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.230 
skip the general idea that you need to
lever<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.770> need<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.920> use<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.399> screwdriver<00:01:44.850> as

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
lever you need to use the screwdriver as

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.340 
lever you need to use the screwdriver as
a<00:01:45.270> lever<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.780> lever<00:01:46.680> downwards<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:48.350> with

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
a lever and lever downwards and with

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.710 
a lever and lever downwards and with
enough<00:01:49.619> movement<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.790> will<00:01:51.030> release<00:01:51.509> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
enough movement you will release the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.550 
enough movement you will release the
barb<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.320> airbag<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.110> theory<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.500> is

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
barb and the airbag so in theory this is

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.469 
barb and the airbag so in theory this is
should<00:01:58.920> be<00:01:59.040> quite<00:01:59.430> easy<00:01:59.460> as<00:01:59.850> long<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.299> get

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
should be quite easy as long as you get

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.289 
should be quite easy as long as you get
the<00:02:00.930> end<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> screwdriver<00:02:02.299> positioned

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
the end of the screwdriver positioned

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.150 
the end of the screwdriver positioned
correctly<00:02:05.479> again<00:02:06.479> position<00:02:07.469> correctly<00:02:07.829> means

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
correctly again position correctly means

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.619 
correctly again position correctly means
you're<00:02:08.429> at<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.610> very<00:02:08.789> top<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.239> hole<00:02:09.420> you

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
you're at the very top of the hole you

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.230 
you're at the very top of the hole you
must<00:02:09.840> be<00:02:09.989> above<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:11.550> spring<00:02:12.360> clip

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
must be above the spring clip

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.780 
must be above the spring clip
so<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.480> can<00:02:13.660> lever<00:02:13.960> downwards<00:02:14.640> that's<00:02:15.640> the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
so you can lever downwards that's the

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.780 
so you can lever downwards that's the
only<00:02:16.030> really<00:02:16.240> way<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.600> releases<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:18.430> here<00:02:18.640> you

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
only really way it releases so here you

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.550 
only really way it releases so here you
can<00:02:18.880> see<00:02:19.090> I'm<00:02:19.240> levering<00:02:19.990> downwards<00:02:20.410> and

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
can see I'm levering downwards and

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.830 
can see I'm levering downwards and
getting<00:02:20.800> quite<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.040> bit<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.370> movement<00:02:21.520> as<00:02:21.970> the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
getting quite a bit of movement as the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.170 
getting quite a bit of movement as the
spring<00:02:23.140> clip<00:02:23.520> but<00:02:24.520> just<00:02:25.300> not<00:02:25.480> quite<00:02:25.750> enough<00:02:25.810> as

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
spring clip but just not quite enough as

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.380 
spring clip but just not quite enough as
the<00:02:28.180> air<00:02:28.300> bag<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.660> not<00:02:28.840> released<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:31.210> had

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
the air bag is not released and I had

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.320 
the air bag is not released and I had
this<00:02:31.510> problem<00:02:32.550> with<00:02:33.550> this<00:02:33.790> side<00:02:34.090> on<00:02:34.240> the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
this problem with this side on the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.670 
this problem with this side on the
steering<00:02:34.630> wheel<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:36.280> side<00:02:36.520> only<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.680> this

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
steering wheel this side only and this

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.550 
steering wheel this side only and this
is<00:02:38.860> what<00:02:39.040> led<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.730> me<00:02:40.030> cutting<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.450> out<00:02:40.570> and

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.750 

having<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.650> kind<00:02:44.770> of<00:02:44.890> cheat<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.310> really<00:02:45.610> get

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
having to kind of cheat to really get

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.510 
having to kind of cheat to really get
this<00:02:45.940> spring<00:02:46.780> clip<00:02:46.960> to<00:02:47.110> release<00:02:47.140> which<00:02:47.650> I'm

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
this spring clip to release which I'm

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.360 
this spring clip to release which I'm
going<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.760> have<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:48.940> do<00:02:49.060> here<00:02:49.330> as<00:02:49.420> well<00:02:49.660> I'm<00:02:50.440> not

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
going to have to do here as well I'm not

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.820 
going to have to do here as well I'm not
really<00:02:51.520> sure<00:02:51.910> why<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.570> couldn't<00:02:53.530> get<00:02:53.680> the

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
really sure why I couldn't get the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.470 
really sure why I couldn't get the
necessary<00:02:54.010> downward<00:02:54.850> movement<00:02:55.270> of<00:02:55.420> the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
necessary downward movement of the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.180 
necessary downward movement of the
spring<00:02:55.750> clip<00:02:55.960> but<00:02:56.680> now<00:02:56.830> I'm<00:02:56.950> pressing

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
spring clip but now I'm pressing

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.220 
spring clip but now I'm pressing
directly<00:02:57.820> down<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.590> I've<00:02:59.590> just<00:02:59.830> released<00:03:00.040> it

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
directly down and I've just released it

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.570 
directly down and I've just released it
so<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.350> airbag<00:03:02.650> is<00:03:02.680> off<00:03:04.620> quick<00:03:05.620> picture<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.460> it

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
so the airbag is off quick picture of it

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.140 
so the airbag is off quick picture of it
here<00:03:06.850> you<00:03:07.570> can<00:03:07.660> see<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.020> spear<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:09.790> can<00:03:09.940> see

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
here you can see the spear you can see

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.900 
here you can see the spear you can see
where<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:11.320> metal<00:03:11.590> scratched<00:03:11.890> up<00:03:12.160> where<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.460> was

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
where the metal scratched up where I was

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.630 
where the metal scratched up where I was
contacting<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.140> airbag<00:03:14.680> with<00:03:15.460> my

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
contacting the airbag with my

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.600 
contacting the airbag with my
screwdriver<00:03:16.350> so<00:03:17.350> if<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.680> go<00:03:17.830> past<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.340> spring

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
screwdriver so if you go past the spring

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.210 
screwdriver so if you go past the spring
clip<00:03:18.850> you're<00:03:19.450> going<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.660> hit<00:03:19.840> metal<00:03:20.350> but<00:03:20.740> a<00:03:20.890> few

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
clip you're going to hit metal but a few

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.920 
clip you're going to hit metal but a few
millimeters<00:03:21.760> farther<00:03:22.150> in<00:03:22.300> and<00:03:22.630> that's<00:03:22.780> the

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
millimeters farther in and that's the

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.890 
millimeters farther in and that's the
back<00:03:23.140> of<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.410> airbag<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:25.180> use<00:03:25.630> it<00:03:25.750> as<00:03:25.810> a

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
back of the airbag so use it as a

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.290 
back of the airbag so use it as a
reference<00:03:26.260> as<00:03:26.380> well<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:28.080> good<00:03:29.080> luck
