00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:56.199
 hello all right I'm the arena CondÃ¡ 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.449
 sorry to interrupt but it's weird 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.339
 I can find you here without 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:06.100
 nobody in the stands without the press 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:08.290
 only you have I observed for some time 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.890
 I want to say a few things and I think 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.250
 This is a good time. 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.110
 we have two games ahead and we have 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.470
 Some have heard that you have been 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.400
 far more satisfied others 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.840
 I do not want to talk to you about the 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.850
 Only thing left when we die 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.560
 something that is worth much more than money 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.470
 that can not be stolen 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.780
 I want to talk about glory that does not 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.140
 it is easy to achieve because 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.940
 finds to sell more by exposing something 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.720
 You conquered in life was easy. 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.910
 recalls the childhood of the floodplain 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.369
 I remember when I was called a mercenary. 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.619
 when they were accused and had to 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.229
 to be able to prove it 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.470
 contrary in field 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:00.530
 glory comes with blood sweat and tears 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.170
 and it is not anyone who is winning 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.910
 there is one thing I learned in all these 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.459
 years is that the future can be built 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.560
 work south on persist lose the 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.700
 I breathe like the legs do not 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.790
 hold on 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.430
 Leave your life on the field Thursday evening 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.370
 my bleachers will be full and 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.709
 believe they would give life in the field 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.730
 but they can not because they are not 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.570
 you 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.760
 fight to the end defend these colors and 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.040
 they will never be forgotten 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.390
 our motivated adversary we are 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.239
 ten times more 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.900
 they are confident in the 100 times more 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:44.870
 they will have the support of us 10,000 times more 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.630
 I ask once more to hand over your 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.620
 heart in this field and when they can not 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.780
 Go forward 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.269
 Look at me, here you go 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.980
 find strength you can be 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.350
 invincible if we want 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.920
 We're unbeaten here but I know that 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.760
 We can use a lot more force. Let's go. 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.760
 go shopping 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:17.200
 with vashee then it takes 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:19.710
 already traces my ass with victory already 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.710
 it is 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:37.180
 I'll leave the woman to you. 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:37.180
 now that ends there with a crowded show
