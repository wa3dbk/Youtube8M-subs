00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:07.779
 hello today instead of showing a 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:11.250
 tutorial with the film I will show you how 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:14.470
 create an earring with paper e 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.480
 of the card says god for the card 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:21.730
 old of books I did not dare anymore 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:32.499
 then holding a sheet of paper is the 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:35.499
 so it breaks into so many pieces then it 

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:42.159
 we have to do one bigger than these 

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:45.159
 so here so much looking for straw but 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:49.690
 this is impossible straight instead jazz 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:52.089
 we also speak healthy, no need 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:01:00.929
 this drop we put aside and 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:01:00.929
 we begin to roll them up like this 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.500
 so from those we find the scotch 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:23.360
 and try to do as much as possible 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:25.670
 small feel and aestheticism at the counter 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.830
 we take the score we pass on to 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.550
 bank so now we mean the shears e 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:44.000
 we make small bits of it 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:46.759
 so it is we always play bank if not 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.330
 you want to do it yourself to do this 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.580
 work pieces can be done in two 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.610
 an agent to the coach and his bike there 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:03.820
 then we take back our piece of 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.820
 paper we do not remove them 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.880
 after which if you like it that you 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.980
 this little piece here and small 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.100
 we know why this bigger 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.520
 it will then be long cut 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.890
 perceptively we close it we hold the 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:41.210
 our previous piece of scotch e 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:46.880
 heaven let's go away and so on for others is 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:49.150
 already a belly then we take what 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.709
 previously we cut big 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.709
 but let's do the same thing 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.040
 sorry 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.930
 the footballer will remain so I do everything 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:18.269
 but the same and the other there is a bit of everything 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.510
 more up down ok now we take 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.849
 always our Scotch 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.060
 I left this book for a while 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.370
 bigger than the others because 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.019
 this country androlib big rolls 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.290
 drought well 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.849
 then we take these ones 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.349
 little doctors we have cock 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:43.140
 first where is the scotch we use a 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:49.230
 This moment we marry this we take 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:53.420
 the glue with a brush 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:56.730
 brush good thing that moves because 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:00.359
 previously used then when 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.180
 he defined it to use it not wet not 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:06.750
 I cleaned don't leave it so then yes 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.390
 it hardens and you can easier use it 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.579
 we believe and forget it up here in the 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.579
 things much easier if you don't clean up 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:21.810
 then we reflect paintings 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:24.800
 take the side with the little one though 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.990
 because we keep it we take some 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.000
 always on the side where the glue is 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.310
 I recommend where the scotch is 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.180
 so at least you do n't see the Scotch yes 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.380
 see the writing ok and do so too 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:43.680
 for all the others 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:49.560
 I already have it ready and that's it 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:52.440
 base will become a flower after you have 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.820
 attached you have to finish it by cutting it 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.530
 with the con however so when 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.490
 you have finished treading the rest 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:05.400
 you have to let it dry 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.889
 I did a whole day like this again 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.349
 much better non-existent 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:13.820
 I was cut and after having cut it 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:17.430
 take frigiolini like that 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:21.560
 these magazines that I also used 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:24.510
 previous footage of with the first 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.990
 I don't know if you see them well though 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:43.500
 are the little pendants which of that 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:45.620
 pair of earrings so-so these here 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.560
 we put them aside 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:53.640
 take our our little flower 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:59.550
 dried and cut, we put the glue 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:06:02.640
 above in a point where you want 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:10.290
 I always seek depends on the point with the 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:13.460
 uglier and for the purchase and put it 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.460
 above so 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.890
 take this pretty thing and the 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.500
 put on you have to wait too 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.940
 I is almost dry for a day 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:29.300
 full 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.300
 after that, something like that is true 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:44.220
 so 15 andolina not only see with the 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:47.280
 dried cedolino here you can then 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.400
 attack this later 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.530
 meanwhile these here already have 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.450
 at the opening then it resumes with mine 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:07:01.020
 They already have a hook you open it 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:05.750
 dishonest yarns ok we ended up 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:08.900

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:11.700
