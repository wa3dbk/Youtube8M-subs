00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.649 
customers don't seem to mind some of the
things<00:02:02.250> are<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> bit<00:02:02.460> expensive<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:03.329> then

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
things are a bit expensive but then

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.749 
things are a bit expensive but then
obviously<00:02:04.079> they<00:02:04.680> were<00:02:04.740> probably<00:02:05.040> way<00:02:05.729> more

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
obviously they were probably way more

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.570 
obviously they were probably way more
expensive<00:02:06.329> than<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.869> originally<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.920> you

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
expensive than that originally so you

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.040 
expensive than that originally so you
expect<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.179> pay<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.750> bit<00:02:10.259> more

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
expect to pay a bit more

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.350 
expect to pay a bit more
