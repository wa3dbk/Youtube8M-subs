 Good morning is Osamu Isa your child today will continue to create a putter 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.230
 The material is here 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:26.250
 The grated half of the body to the three pieces of mackerel 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.250
 I will put 1 tablespoon of salt on both sides 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:40.510
 The place thick only comes by to fewer in such a place to do little more Nioko like 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.790
 In this state put about house time 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.050
 Since water comes out in the meantime, I put Saran rap on this and slightly inclined it like this 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.040
 In the state 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.310
 I raise time in the refrigerator 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:04.190
 After 1 hour 4 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:05.320
 I'll flush down with the water and then count on it 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.070
 ban 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:16.760
 It is fine if the Lord is in a single-sided state 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:19.630
 It was 7 minutes in about about 10 years of one-sided 7-minute single-sided 8 minutes with the other side 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.930
 I will have another 7 minutes 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:29.049
 It is in the state that this is attached on both sides in 8 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:31.649
 Everyone is a little bit white, but from here there is a solid bone so I pulled it out 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.649
 You go 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.759

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.759
 River O s or wort will come 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.080

 Pour the place of part of this collected in the same kind of heat will continue to put the rice on it 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:20.720
 When putting rice, if there is a thick part, it will not lose money and cut out the hot part 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.720
 Put it in the rice and make it easy to roll 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.810
 Java will continue to full minute put rice in on this 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.810
