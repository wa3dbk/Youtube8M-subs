00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
because we're going to do what we call

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.490 
because we're going to do what we call
seeding<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.309> chocolate<00:00:53.879> which<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> method

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
seeding the chocolate which is a method

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.619 
seeding the chocolate which is a method
of<00:00:55.649> if<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.070> like<00:00:56.250> simple<00:00:56.550> tempering<00:00:57.360> for<00:00:57.570> the

of if you like simple tempering for the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.360 
of if you like simple tempering for the
chocolate<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.440> helps<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.949> set<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
chocolate so that it helps it to set a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.910 
chocolate so that it helps it to set a
room<00:00:59.879> temperature<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> good<00:01:01.770> little

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
room temperature this is a good little

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.310 
room temperature this is a good little
technique<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:03.210> actually<00:01:03.600> follow<00:01:03.840> isn't<00:01:04.229> it

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
technique to actually follow isn't it

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
seeding is that you me up melt 2/3

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.010 
seeding is that you me up melt 2/3
straight<00:01:32.369> up<00:01:32.579> which<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.600> what<00:01:33.720> we've<00:01:33.810> got<00:01:33.840> in

straight up which is what we've got in

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.330 
straight up which is what we've got in
the<00:01:34.049> bowl<00:01:34.229> here<00:01:34.439> it's<00:01:34.590> only<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.799> small<00:01:35.070> amount

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
the bowl here it's only a small amount
