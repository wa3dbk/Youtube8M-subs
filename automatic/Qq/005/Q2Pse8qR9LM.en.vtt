minor chord voicings first thing get the

scale 1 2 flat 3 4 5 6 and natural 7 do

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.209 
scale 1 2 flat 3 4 5 6 and natural 7 do
an<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.809> can<00:00:12.840> run<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.469> bass<00:00:13.740> note<00:00:13.769> again

some<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:15.000> these<00:00:15.059> chords<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.509> we'll<00:00:15.630> be

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
some of these chords that we'll be

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.710 
some of these chords that we'll be
exploring<00:00:16.460> but<00:00:17.460> yeah<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.789> idea<00:00:17.910> here<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.539> that

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
exploring but yeah the idea here is that

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.779 
exploring but yeah the idea here is that
we're<00:00:19.020> going<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.230> get<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.470> basics<00:00:19.890> susta

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
we're going to get the basics susta

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.990 
we're going to get the basics susta
verse<00:00:22.160> and<00:00:23.160> then<00:00:23.340> we're<00:00:23.519> going<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.670> look<00:00:23.820> at

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
verse and then we're going to look at

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.439 
verse and then we're going to look at
some<00:00:24.420> ways<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.810> embellishing<00:00:25.769> those<00:00:25.920> basics

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
some ways of embellishing those basics

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.820 
some ways of embellishing those basics
and<00:00:27.449> hopefully<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.230> body<00:00:28.439> will<00:00:28.619> be<00:00:28.650> too

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
and hopefully this body will be too

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.140 
and hopefully this body will be too
tricky<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.160> apply<00:00:29.310> pretty<00:00:29.699> much<00:00:29.880> straightaway

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
tricky to apply pretty much straightaway

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.179 
tricky to apply pretty much straightaway
to<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> chordal<00:00:31.439> vamp<00:00:31.650> or<00:00:31.859> something

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
to like a chordal vamp or something

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.310 
to like a chordal vamp or something

sounds anything like that so hopefully

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.330 
sounds anything like that so hopefully
that's<00:00:51.510> where<00:00:51.719> we<00:00:51.840> can<00:00:51.960> values<00:00:52.320> first<00:00:53.190> thing

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
that's where we can values first thing

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.279 
that's where we can values first thing
is<00:00:53.430> get<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.640> know<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.879> scale<00:00:54.090> know<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.020> scale

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
is get to know the scale know the scale

can't we can moon looks like suppose if
you<00:01:24.100> get<00:01:24.220> fast<00:01:24.460> enough<00:01:24.670> but<00:01:24.850> it's<00:01:25.420> not<00:01:25.659> that's

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
you get fast enough but it's not that's

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.940 
you get fast enough but it's not that's
not<00:01:25.869> already<00:01:26.049> the<00:01:26.259> point<00:01:26.470> you<00:01:26.560> just<00:01:26.590> go<00:01:26.799> nice

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
not already the point you just go nice

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.440 
not already the point you just go nice
and<00:01:27.009> slowly<00:01:27.369> you<00:01:27.490> look<00:01:27.610> at<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.759> intervals<00:01:28.149> of

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
and slowly you look at the intervals of

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.580 
and slowly you look at the intervals of
scale<00:01:28.720> that<00:01:28.750> we've<00:01:28.990> seen<00:01:29.110> look<00:01:29.290> at<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.439> note

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.700 
names you might give that on on every
string<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.600> you<00:01:31.869> might<00:01:32.020> learn<00:01:32.140> an<00:01:32.409> ending

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
string and you might learn an ending

suppose<00:03:24.690> get<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.380> trade<00:03:25.620> chords<00:03:25.980> happening

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
suppose get the trade chords happening

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.870 
suppose get the trade chords happening
all<00:03:27.330> over<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.989> net<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.680> in<00:03:29.070> many<00:03:29.310> as<00:03:29.610> many
