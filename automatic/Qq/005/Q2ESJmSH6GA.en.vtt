00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.090 
don't know if i'm enjoying them as much
as<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:32.570> thought<00:02:32.600> I<00:02:32.840> would<00:02:32.960> and<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.530> few<00:02:33.890> guys

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
as I thought I would and that a few guys

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.340 
as I thought I would and that a few guys
are<00:02:34.730> enjoying<00:02:35.090> them<00:02:35.630> as<00:02:35.780> much<00:02:35.960> as<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:36.200> thought

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
are enjoying them as much as I thought

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.840 
are enjoying them as much as I thought
you<00:02:36.410> would<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:36.800> we've<00:02:37.250> got<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.490> start<00:02:37.670> to

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
you would so we've got to start to

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.460 
you would so we've got to start to
finish<00:02:38.120> those<00:02:38.270> which<00:02:38.510> is<00:02:38.690> pretty<00:02:38.870> much<00:02:39.080> just<00:02:39.260> a

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
finish those which is pretty much just a

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.020 
finish those which is pretty much just a
progression<00:02:39.800> series<00:02:40.490> throughout<00:02:40.730> little

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
progression series throughout little

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.420 
progression series throughout little
team<00:02:41.240> but<00:02:41.990> I<00:02:42.050> don't<00:02:42.320> think<00:02:42.590> my<00:02:42.650> gameplay<00:02:43.250> can

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
team but I don't think my gameplay can

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.220 
team but I don't think my gameplay can
actually<00:02:43.670> bring<00:02:43.820> anything<00:02:44.030> as<00:02:44.360> entertaining

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
actually bring anything as entertaining

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.170 
actually bring anything as entertaining
as<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.560> thought<00:02:45.830> like<00:02:46.010> obviously<00:02:46.760> is<00:02:46.940> just

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
as I thought like obviously is just

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.910 
as I thought like obviously is just
literally<00:02:47.570> playing<00:02:47.900> through<00:02:48.350> all<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.680> team

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
literally playing through all the team

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.190 
literally playing through all the team
but<00:02:49.220> my<00:02:49.850> skills<00:02:50.209> are<00:02:50.360> fairly<00:02:50.570> average<00:02:50.780> I'm<00:02:51.080> not

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
but my skills are fairly average I'm not

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.750 
but my skills are fairly average I'm not
bad<00:02:51.440> at<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.680> game<00:02:51.709> I'd<00:02:52.010> probably<00:02:52.190> win<00:02:52.520> a

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
bad at the game I'd probably win a

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.300 
bad at the game I'd probably win a
majority<00:02:53.570> of<00:02:53.840> my<00:02:54.200> games<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.680> I<00:02:54.860> don't<00:02:55.190> know

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
majority of my games and I don't know

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.410 
majority of my games and I don't know
