consistent<00:02:00.899> updates<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.040> game

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
consistent updates to the game

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.090 
consistent updates to the game
consistent<00:02:02.909> work<00:02:03.299> on<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.750> game<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.649> letting

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
consistent work on the game and letting

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.399 
consistent work on the game and letting
us<00:02:05.219> know<00:02:05.250> every<00:02:05.759> week<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.360> d<00:02:06.780> they<00:02:06.930> are<00:02:06.990> doing

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.619 
us know every week that d they are doing
something<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.310> that's<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.879> think<00:02:09.119> one<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
something and that's I think one of the

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.029 
something and that's I think one of the
things<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.929> helped<00:02:10.259> revive<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.590> don't<00:02:10.920> want

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
things that helped revive I don't want

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.380 
things that helped revive I don't want
to<00:02:11.099> say<00:02:11.160> revive<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.700> game<00:02:11.940> but<00:02:12.120> kind<00:02:12.330> of

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
to say revive the game but kind of

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
to say revive the game but kind of
brought<00:02:12.599> back<00:02:12.870> positive

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
brought back positive

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.130 
brought back positive
tivity<00:02:13.740> to<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.910> company<00:02:15.300> in<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.600> game<00:02:15.780> itself

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
tivity to the company in the game itself

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.730 
tivity to the company in the game itself
and<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.530> was<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.520> idea<00:02:18.230> that<00:02:19.230> there's

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
and that was the idea that there's

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.080 
and that was the idea that there's
communication<00:02:19.950> between<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.690> my<00:02:23.090> I'm

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
communication between the and my I'm

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.450 
communication between the and my I'm
going<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.540> get<00:02:24.720> back<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.260> say<00:02:25.410> okay<00:02:25.650> um<00:02:26.190> but

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
going to get back in to say okay um but

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.430 
going to get back in to say okay um but
the<00:02:26.550> idea<00:02:26.820> behind<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.570> hard<00:02:27.750> my<00:02:27.930> Twitter<00:02:28.200> went

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
the idea behind is hard my Twitter went

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.200 
the idea behind is hard my Twitter went
off<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.710> my<00:02:28.800> phone<00:02:29.010> went<00:02:29.340> off<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:29.730> sometimes

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
off and my phone went off and sometimes

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.250 
off and my phone went off and sometimes
it<00:02:30.300> can<00:02:30.390> be<00:02:30.420> important<00:02:30.780> but<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.960> idea<00:02:31.200> that

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
it can be important but the idea that

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.950 
it can be important but the idea that
there's<00:02:32.190> ever<00:02:32.820> a<00:02:32.910> weekly<00:02:33.330> update<00:02:33.690> kind<00:02:33.900> of

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
there's ever a weekly update kind of

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.170 
there's ever a weekly update kind of
reconnected<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.710> devs<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.550> viewers<00:02:35.910> and

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
reconnected the devs to the viewers and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.210 
reconnected the devs to the viewers and
to<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.300> players<00:02:36.690> themselves<00:02:37.010> after<00:02:38.010> such<00:02:38.190> a

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
to the players themselves after such a

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.650 
to the players themselves after such a
long<00:02:38.460> time<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.850> silence<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.390> not<00:02:39.540> really

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
long time of silence and not really

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.330 
long time of silence and not really
knowing<00:02:39.990> what's<00:02:40.530> happening<00:02:40.620> with<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.160> game

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
knowing what's happening with the game

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.940 
knowing what's happening with the game
so<00:02:41.610> even<00:02:42.240> if<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:42.690> particular<00:02:43.230> monday<00:02:43.650> is

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
so even if this particular monday is

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.670 
so even if this particular monday is
pretty<00:02:44.550> bereft<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.660> information<00:02:46.260> is<00:02:46.410> really

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
pretty bereft of information is really

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.610 
pretty bereft of information is really
nothing<00:02:46.890> there<00:02:47.330> it<00:02:48.330> just<00:02:48.690> serves<00:02:48.960> to<00:02:49.110> say<00:02:49.380> that

particularly i really think with the
reintegration<00:03:12.090> reintegration<00:03:12.990> of<00:03:13.710> the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
reintegration reintegration of the
