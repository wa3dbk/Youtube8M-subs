little explaining on how the Dynojet
dyno<00:00:05.940> works<00:00:06.420> with<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.750> CVT<00:00:08.030> what<00:00:09.030> I'm<00:00:09.120> going

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450

dyno works with the CVT what I'm going
to<00:00:09.480> do<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.340> compare<00:00:11.960> some<00:00:12.960> runs<00:00:13.200> here<00:00:13.759> this<00:00:14.759> is

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
to do is compare some runs here this is

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
closed air box set up this was the setup

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.910 
closed air box set up this was the setup
that<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:24.900> ran<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.350> weekend<00:00:25.740> at<00:00:25.830> new

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920

that I just ran this weekend at new
media<00:00:26.869> this<00:00:27.869> was<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.859> dyno<00:00:29.130> was<00:00:29.369> done<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.670> 622

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
media this was this dyno was done on 622

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.729 
media this was this dyno was done on 622
and<00:00:32.369> we're<00:00:32.579> going<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.850> compare<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:34.350> different

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739

clutch<00:00:34.980> setup<00:00:35.280> which<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.730> ran<00:00:36.000> about<00:00:36.300> three

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
clutch setup which I ran about three

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.990 
weeks ago in the media we're gonna
explain<00:00:40.050> how<00:00:40.290> these<00:00:40.469> work<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:42.899> red<00:00:43.110> line<00:00:43.379> is

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
explain how these work the red line is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.420 
explain how these work the red line is
the<00:00:45.000> old<00:00:45.270> setup<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.620> way<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.800> had<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.219> set<00:00:47.399> up

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the old setup the way I had it set up

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.590 
the old setup the way I had it set up
before<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.559> can<00:00:49.559> see<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.489> dyno<00:00:50.760> starts<00:00:51.360> at

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
before you can see the dyno starts at

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.959 
before you can see the dyno starts at
about<00:00:54.649> and<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.770> now<00:00:55.890> start<00:00:56.129> sampling<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.789> come

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
about and I now start sampling and come

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.170 
about and I now start sampling and come
to<00:00:57.149> save<00:00:57.390> 14<00:00:58.140> miles<00:00:58.379> an<00:00:58.530> hour<00:00:58.910> you<00:00:59.910> make<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
to save 14 miles an hour you make the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.770 
to save 14 miles an hour you make the
same<00:01:00.390> horsepower<00:01:01.430> out<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.699> whole<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.329> old

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
same horsepower out of the whole the old

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.260 
same horsepower out of the whole the old
clutch<00:01:04.170> setup<00:01:04.470> was<00:01:04.739> better<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.339> was<00:01:05.549> stage<00:01:06.000> 3

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
clutch setup was better this was stage 3

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.240 
clutch setup was better this was stage 3
clutch<00:01:06.619> to<00:01:07.619> 54<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.729> 56<00:01:09.270> ha's<00:01:09.950> came<00:01:10.950> out<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
hole harder held the power just about

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.370 
hole harder held the power just about
the<00:01:13.770> same<00:01:14.010> as<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> mid-range<00:01:15.080> during<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> end

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the same as a mid-range during the end

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.160 
the same as a mid-range during the end
the<00:01:16.950> old<00:01:17.189> clutch<00:01:17.549> had<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> much<00:01:18.570> better<00:01:18.780> top-end

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the old clutch had a much better top-end

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.700 
the old clutch had a much better top-end
here<00:01:19.970> this<00:01:20.970> was<00:01:21.270> from<00:01:21.479> 60<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.020> 70<00:01:22.350> miles<00:01:22.530> an

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
here this was from 60 to 70 miles an

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.740 
here this was from 60 to 70 miles an
hour<00:01:22.830> which<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.189> basically<00:01:23.759> run<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> run<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
hour which is basically run a run in the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.530 
hour which is basically run a run in the
eighth<00:01:24.900> mile<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.590> ended<00:01:26.130> up<00:01:26.189> about<00:01:26.520> 62<00:01:27.150> miles<00:01:27.360> an

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
eighth mile I ended up about 62 miles an

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.960 
eighth mile I ended up about 62 miles an
hour<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:28.619> past<00:01:28.920> weekend<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.490> tried<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> new

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
hour this past weekend I tried a new

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.580 
hour this past weekend I tried a new
clutch<00:01:30.210> setup<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:31.170> clutch<00:01:31.500> setup<00:01:31.770> was<00:01:33.590> for

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
clutch setup this clutch setup was for

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.819 
clutch setup this clutch setup was for
360<00:01:35.490> gram<00:01:35.700> weights<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.810> gave<00:01:37.380> me<00:01:37.590> less

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
360 gram weights this gave me less

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.530 
360 gram weights this gave me less
horsepower<00:01:38.360> but<00:01:39.360> more<00:01:39.570> rpm<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.439> can<00:01:41.400> select<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
horsepower but more rpm I can select the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.260 
horsepower but more rpm I can select the
left<00:01:42.840> value<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.500> engine<00:01:44.040> speed<00:01:44.070> rpm<00:01:44.790> which<00:01:45.119> is

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
left value as engine speed rpm which is

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.170 
left value as engine speed rpm which is
already<00:01:45.509> there<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.130> let's<00:01:47.130> go<00:01:47.310> about<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.880> see

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
already there and let's go about and see

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.830
