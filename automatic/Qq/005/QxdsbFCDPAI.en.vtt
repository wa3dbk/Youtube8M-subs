collaborate with him on this and of

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.440 
collaborate with him on this and of
course<00:00:37.980> like<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.430> might<00:00:38.910> be<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> only<00:00:39.180> art

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
course like this might be the only art

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.420 
course like this might be the only art
course<00:00:39.690> they<00:00:39.809> ever<00:00:39.930> take<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:41.010> question<00:00:41.340> is

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
course they ever take the question is

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.830 
course they ever take the question is
what's<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> takeaway<00:00:41.940> from<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.420> course<00:00:42.660> like

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
what's the takeaway from a course like

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.770 
what's the takeaway from a course like
this<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.640> my<00:00:44.640> hope<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.149> even<00:00:45.539> though

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
this and my hope is that even though

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.580 
this and my hope is that even though
they<00:00:45.930> may<00:00:46.050> not<00:00:46.260> go<00:00:46.440> out<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.710> become<00:00:47.039> art<00:00:47.579> majors

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
they may not go out to become art majors

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.619 
they may not go out to become art majors
that<00:00:49.590> they<00:00:49.739> will<00:00:49.920> at<00:00:50.160> least<00:00:50.340> figure<00:00:50.789> out<00:00:51.000> how

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
that they will at least figure out how

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.200 
that they will at least figure out how
to<00:00:51.690> access<00:00:52.350> creativity<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.370> was<00:00:53.520> young<00:00:53.910> I

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
to access creativity and I was young I

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.549 
to access creativity and I was young I
used<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:55.140> really<00:00:55.620> like<00:00:56.579> our<00:00:57.230> dance<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.320> grew

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
used to really like our dance I grew

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.029 
used to really like our dance I grew
older<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:59.280> lost<00:01:00.000> my<00:01:00.149> interests<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.289> now<00:01:01.859> them

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
older I lost my interests and now them

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.650 
older I lost my interests and now them
in<00:01:02.160> clubs<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:02.789> wanted<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.120> regain<00:01:03.629> that

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
in clubs I just wanted to regain that

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.980 
in clubs I just wanted to regain that
interest

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.390 

collaboration<00:01:07.990> is<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.560> huge<00:01:08.979> part<00:01:09.159> of<00:01:09.310> this

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
collaboration is a huge part of this

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.420 
collaboration is a huge part of this
course<00:01:09.729> to<00:01:10.240> take<00:01:10.570> 11<00:01:11.229> really<00:01:11.619> bright<00:01:11.830> students

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
course to take 11 really bright students

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.780 
course to take 11 really bright students
and<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.869> sit<00:01:14.320> them<00:01:14.439> down<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:14.619> say<00:01:14.950> hey<00:01:15.190> you're

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
and to sit them down and say hey you're

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.630 
and to sit them down and say hey you're
all<00:01:16.060> going<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.450> design<00:01:16.900> one<00:01:17.409> design<00:01:18.070> that's

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
all going to design one design that's

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.840 
all going to design one design that's
really<00:01:19.060> tough<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.540> do<00:01:19.690> being<00:01:20.140> a<00:01:20.200> group<00:01:20.440> was<00:01:21.210> um

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
really tough to do being a group was um

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.249 
really tough to do being a group was um
it<00:01:24.850> was<00:01:24.940> a<00:01:24.970> bit<00:01:25.119> difficult<00:01:25.149> at<00:01:25.659> times<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.229> know

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
it was a bit difficult at times you know

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.710 
it was a bit difficult at times you know
tactical<00:01:26.740> I've<00:01:26.860> about<00:01:27.070> that<00:01:27.310> um<00:01:27.580> just<00:01:28.450> because

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
tactical I've about that um just because

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.560 
tactical I've about that um just because
there's<00:01:28.930> so<00:01:29.110> many<00:01:29.200> clashing<00:01:29.890> like<00:01:30.490> ideas<00:01:31.030> and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
there's so many clashing like ideas and

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.469 
there's so many clashing like ideas and
the<00:01:32.200> design<00:01:32.530> normally<00:01:32.979> takes<00:01:33.190> place<00:01:34.000> towards

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
the design normally takes place towards

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:35.850 
the design normally takes place towards
the<00:01:34.659> beginning<00:01:34.750> of<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.200> course<00:01:35.440> where<00:01:35.770> you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
the beginning of the course where you

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.590 
the beginning of the course where you
don't<00:01:36.009> necessarily<00:01:36.220> know<00:01:36.909> know<00:01:37.240> each<00:01:37.390> other

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
don't necessarily know know each other

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.130 
don't necessarily know know each other
that<00:01:37.750> well<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.560> that's<00:01:39.310> tricky<00:01:39.759> territory

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
that well so that's tricky territory

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.070 
that well so that's tricky territory
learning<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:43.210> know<00:01:43.330> paint<00:01:43.659> together<00:01:43.780> and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
learning to you know paint together and

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.399 
learning to you know paint together and
have<00:01:44.229> them<00:01:44.470> like<00:01:45.429> still<00:01:46.090> mash<00:01:46.330> and<00:01:46.569> look<00:01:46.780> like

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
have them like still mash and look like

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.169 
have them like still mash and look like
they<00:01:47.560> belong<00:01:47.860> together<00:01:48.130> that's<00:01:48.640> been<00:01:48.880> a

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
they belong together that's been a

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.350 
they belong together that's been a
growing<00:01:49.690> experience<00:01:49.960> for<00:01:50.500> me<00:01:51.100> that<00:01:51.909> I<00:01:52.210> was

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
growing experience for me that I was

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.930 
growing experience for me that I was
kind<00:01:52.569> of<00:01:52.659> opposed<00:01:53.259> to<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.530> idea<00:01:53.590> I<00:01:54.130> was<00:01:54.280> oh<00:01:54.550> I'd

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
kind of opposed to the idea I was oh I'd

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.999 
kind of opposed to the idea I was oh I'd
rather<00:01:55.149> have<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:56.020> like<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.289> old<00:01:56.409> mural<00:01:56.770> and

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
rather have it like the old mural and

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.180 
rather have it like the old mural and
have<00:01:57.789> my<00:01:58.000> own<00:01:58.030> little<00:01:58.630> piece<00:01:58.929> to<00:01:59.170> work<00:01:59.350> on<00:01:59.530> all

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
have my own little piece to work on all

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.609 
have my own little piece to work on all
together<00:02:00.700> as<00:02:00.970> we<00:02:01.270> progressed<00:02:01.509> through<00:02:02.020> this<00:02:02.170> I

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
together as we progressed through this I

really<00:02:09.340> incredible<00:02:09.670> about<00:02:10.299> these<00:02:10.479> students

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
really incredible about these students

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.390 
really incredible about these students

is the fact that they know at the very
beginning<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.970> they're<00:02:13.180> going<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.420> be

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510
