00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 the greatest welcome back to me 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.870
 channel in this short and of the beautiful the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.460
 function towards main applications 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.240
 a small navigation through the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.799
 phone 'microsoft lumia 640 lt of the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.680
 first s with phone with the system 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.980
 operative so I'm not very expert in 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.980
 this 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.150
 so when we learn the phone 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.100
 for the first time we have like this 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.650
 grid where we have the different 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.110
 applications that we can use are 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.290
 pure squares with functions that 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.880
 we can navigate in this way with the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.580
 finger 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.130
 here we have the main ones if we want 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.470
 add more thrust I imagine that 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.390
 You can also remove others above 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.330
 We have the function to see our 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.800
 contacts in this box to see the 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.010
 contacts here there is a function 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.450
 interesting to group 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.210
 recognized for chats and 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.010
 share things with them 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.579
 now we have the best picture 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.369
 small to make the calls 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.550
 then we also have another little box for 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.800
 check the messages that have arrived 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.780
 we have another one to check the emails 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.520
 electronic in this case we can 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.560
 set up our email accounts 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.340
 electronic very easily in this 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.219
 option 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.630
 then we have one navigation in this 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.850
 case I should have a connection to 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.609
 internet to be able to navigate here is me 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.200
 asking to look for something but the same is the 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:31.670
 internet connection in this case not the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.260
 I have done we have preinstalled facebook 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.630
 in this case he asks me for mail and password 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.300
 we have something called games but 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.030
 basically to have connectivity with 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.250
 our xbox and stuff like that download 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.250
 game games 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.020
 they basically have to see more than everything 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.000
 with the xbox 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.479
 a very important thing to know in this 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.570
 phone is that below we have the 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.190
 navigation buttons the most important 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.860
 is the little arrow to the left that is 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.990
 to return the one from the center to 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.509
 enter this main menu or start 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.300
 and then there 's the search search 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.340
 It allows you to find everything I want and 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.310
 either on the internet and phone 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.239
 soon destiny find an application 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.239
 mobile if we give facebook 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.980
 make 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.390
 you are looking 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.500
 the application 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.500
 or the contact 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.010
 in this case I think he is doing is 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.840
 an internet search 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.280
 so it only serves as for 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.690
 look for contacts I think 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.690
 search contacts 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.860
 basically in the bing option the 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.450
 microsoft search search on the web or 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.540
 on the phone 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.980
 let's go back then already having clear of 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.140
 that these three little buttons below are 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.660
 of navigation these sometimes we are 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.610
 sometimes they hide themselves in the case that 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.940
 get off slide your finger up 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.760
 there as you can see they were hidden if it is 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.360
 smooth the finger from bottom to top and 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.360
 they reappear 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.810
 here also up we also have some 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.360
 notification options we slide from 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.370
 top down we will have the area 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.680
 of notifications we have a few options 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.209
 here that can be configured we have the 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.730
 option to activate bluetooth wipe 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.269
 airplane mode and to enter the camera 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.799
 where I will dedicate a special video for 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.980
 everything that has to do with the camera 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.440
 which will be the next one that I will return 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.750
 we keep browsing these applications 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.519
 stores news ideas the button 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.370
 configuration that is very important here 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.260
 we can configure many things we are going to 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.329
 see how to set up the wifi 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.940
 still a bluetooth has nothing to do 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:03.530
 with the without data sensors connection 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.940

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.739
 interesting driving applications for 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.190
 electronic mail accessories instead of 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.190

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.400

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.260
 what is that has to do with space 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.180
 storage and then prove it in 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.560
 another video what is the real space of 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.290
 storage that phone being 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.600

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.930
 interesting for what people want 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.510
 that is all that is for the option of 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.080
 configuration we have options for the 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.800
 Alarm configuration 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.539
 calculator in your hand is very important 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.939
 see the storage space here we see 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:27.870
 that we have on the phone completely 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:30.900
 again we have 4 gigas of the 84 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:34.319
 used and 3.2 gigabytes available 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.240
 I have an 8gb microsd that is this 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:39.000
 is showing the information of the 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.300

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.080

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.810
 these are the photos taken by the 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.850
 now let the following video to 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.470
 what is the camera and I will show you the 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.630
 quality of the photos you take that 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.920
 performed inside my house we are going to 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.840
 need it here on the screen 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.090
 start if we try good to the 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.610
 left nothing happens if we move 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:15.160
 to the right we enter to see the 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.750
 main configuration options in 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.210
 this case we see I think everything that 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.570
 is here instead of seeing it in small squares 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.250
 we see it in a list and there's even 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.380
 some additional things for example 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.660
 this battery saving was not here 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.580
 within all those options 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.319
 we want to know what is battery saving 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.000
 it shows what it is consuming 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:37.000
 more battery at the time 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.460
 in this case it tells me that it is the camera 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.230
 to use it now that more 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.240
