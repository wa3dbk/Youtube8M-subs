00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.990
 good morning on the first channel inclusion with 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.580
 Petersburg four thousand people 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.849
 managed to regain rumor thanks 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.860
 cochlear implantation in petersburg from 97 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.110
 years in lori nii such operations are done 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.750
 constantly but still there were patients 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.609
 which method was not shown only now 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.679
 experts can firmly say that not 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.860
 there are more people who can not 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.540
 it would return the rumor at the end of the past 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.210
 at the St. Petersburg Research Institute of ENT 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.670
 for the first time in Russia was made 3 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:48.480
 unique hearing operation 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:51.210
 stem implantation mohawk added more 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.890
 from katyusha again russian i'm soon 2 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.440
 years but the first life sound she heard 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.300
 just 3 months ago when Petersburg 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.250
 neurosurgery installed in the girl's brain 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.320
 implant stimulating hearing 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.180
 nerves this was the only chance 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.710
 gain ear and speech video ears 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.420
 no snail nerf mean 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.520
 cochlear implantation is impossible 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.440
 The operation took place on the basis of Polenov Skog 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.119
 orinho and Petersburg neurosurgeons 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.369
 advised German professor robert 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.410
 b employee lori nii sergey levin 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.300
 participated as a neurophysiologist and audiologist 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.880
 tested implanting electrode 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.530
 the operation was quite long 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.190
 because difficult access was for 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.569
 surgeons and when surgeons have already come to 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.050
 brain stem exactly in that place 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:36.020
 where should tentatively be installed 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.729
 the electrode was tested 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.530
 tested the fire in time took 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.899
 about the same as all together 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.229
 operations need to be very accurate 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.440
 define this place because if we 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.989
 let's even install this electrode side by side 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.250
 after the implantation of care 

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:54.750
 the child will not be able to hear 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.789
 correct setting implants and 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.920
 rehabilitation without which it will not happen 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.539
 main miracle not heard before 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.520
 man cannot understand speech and 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.200
 even talk to the implant to 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.270
 to develop these skills the operation needs to be done 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.920
 as early as possible better with this year 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.509
 promotes early detection of deaf 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.039
 children who are held in their homes 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.959
 Russia for 7 years 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.640
 Ksyusha operated on a year and seven 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.260
 develops very quickly everyone is not 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.819
 we are engaged there for 10-15 minutes times 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.819
 23 exactly a day course in the garden, she became 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:28.939
 to respond to sounds you can call her 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.489
 now it's much easier if not even 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:33.430
 call then pat or knock she 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:39.260
 it will turn easier now 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:41.060
 she began to make more sounds in 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.159
 Petersburg alumni designed kit 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.930
 for the rehabilitation of children after all kinds 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.209
 implantations living far from 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.650
 educational institutions books recipe 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.299
 self audio CDs 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.609
 implant settings patients get 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.510
 free as all implants themselves 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:59.599
 operations 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:02.840
 operations and implants pay for them 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.819
 state approximately cost 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.659
 implant of the order of one million rubles 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.659
 I can say that the institute together with 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.849
 our industrial firms 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:18.409
 made our domestic duffel 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:20.569
 a process that is not inferior is not inferior 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.359
 foreign analogues 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.370
 and of course much cheaper but the most 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.530
 favorite domestic development of children and 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.030
 the ball is not hearing a child with an implant 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.010
 a multiplier not invented by a tower 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.780
 with him the child learn to hear and 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.780
 talk and such a toy can be obtained 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.090
 only as a gift for hard work 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.010
 mimicry emotions of movement of this lion cub 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.900
 k drawn by multipliers precisely with 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.459
 particular child boy making 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.129
 cochlear implantation in two years 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.430
 done somewhere in 4 years 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:51.769
 rice from 4 to 6 years old when the boy was 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.900
 drew the ball now the boy already 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.370
 for more than 12 years he has been studying in 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.349
 comprehensive school well 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.269
 only two percent of children speak 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.889
 born with born hearing anomalies 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.750
 the rest fade away as a result 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:05.000
 a viral infection reception 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.980
 antibiotics for adults who have lost 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.349
 hearing after serious illness became 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.000
 implantation new chance to return contact with 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.199
 World 2 of our adult patients 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.609
 young people 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:20.000
 full of life expectancy up to one patient 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:23.720
 25 years of neurofibromatosis type 2 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.510
 Of course the fact that we brought it to them aloud 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.960
 huge for them is huge 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.120
 here is faith and hope that life 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.250
 may be the best for them on every 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.710
 thousands of children one is born deaf 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.450
 this statistic is almost unchanged but now 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.490
 thanks to the work of domestic doctors and 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.040
 scientists there are no people left 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.630
 it would help to hear the world of anastasia
