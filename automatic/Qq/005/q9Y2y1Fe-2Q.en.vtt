00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.979
 in her husband osvaldo de andrade tarsila

 Brazil 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.880
 this movement led by oswald 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.850
 proposed the swallowing of the culture 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.840
 European into something good 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.000
 Brazilian and the figure of the abaporu 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.300
 idealized the process of swallowing 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.250
 this phase of tarsila's painting 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.320
 titled antropofágica is the most 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.760
 important part of his career 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.190
 we have as example of this phase the tables 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.130

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:25.419
 the precursor of silva began the 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.419
 painting with social themes in brazil 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.250
 [Music] 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.659
 São Paulo recognized the value 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.479
 very late 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:42.319
 for years southern tarsila almost 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:46.400
 forgetfulness is ignored the importance of 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:49.250
 his work was denied or diminished tarsila 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.210
 spent difficult days but always 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:55.879
 smiling always kind to everyone 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.150
 always pleased with herself and with the

 [Music] 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:10.250
 Tarsila was certainly a rare creature 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:13.039
 outstanding superior 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.909
 everything about her was of high quality. 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:21.770
 talent to culture and sensitivity to 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:24.710
 goodness and beauty is not necessary 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.860
 remind you of your exhibitions in Paris in 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:31.699

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:34.250
 antropofagia the phase for brazil and that 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:39.440
 the role it represented in the renewal of 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:40.020
 Brazilian art died on 17

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:52.440
 of two hundred frames and some 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.319
 drawings sculptures fundamental for a 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:07:00.620
 search that continues to this day 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:07:00.620
