00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.590
 hi everyone knows that at 6 for 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.120
 a little video after game because 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.560
 I could not keep the comment that 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.760
 I had done live with his daughters 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.869
 if any, which was a lot of 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.699
 noise at home as usual 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.140
 so here we did a little body in 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.490
 fight against the world to do the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.930
 success 1 because I realized 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.730
 count I did not have the hammer spell 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.680
 of the world are stimulating and yes I am 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.019
 completely nil so here we went 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.279
 to make a small mill to 2 quietly 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.110
 some of which had benefited 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.660
 to make success so we do not know 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.300
 really realized that the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.120
 success I 'm not going so we fell 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.700
 under the 2% versatile kind and status 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.780
 so we could make the successes but he 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.250
 already had all the success and I 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.059
 had no time and I 'm doing 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.579
 never have any stuff 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.379
 then he still has the fact that one who 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.820
 date long enough so me to 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.250
 the time to jump with the loc 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.750
 we now learn if it was a trick 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.239
 enough or because moon to sav to 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.640
 critics at the doors of the ring so that's it 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.320
 we left quietly donate 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.580
 play 2 because it was his fans 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.909
 to play several since I had 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.359
 lost that pleasure 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.369
 just with the duration how to say but the 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:14.009
 do is solo forget good times 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.210
 like that so we play more too 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.159
 we are impressed earth we think that 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.829
 do comrades dofus career so 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.929
 here I am pleased to play as 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.619
 that a small number that date from the tax 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.409
 exist which I will make you 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.759
 share this video with you 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.009
 show a little the pleasure it had 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.299
 with friends that's if you ever 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.099
 want fire in the solitary is good 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.599
 to move forward but obviously that's fine 

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.399
 save you simply stopped 

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:38.409
 so here I am it allows anyway 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.549
 offer me on the steelers game when 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.670
 even more and enjoyed playing at 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.149
 pdp with steam hours and the fact that his 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.349
 son takes over 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.239
 frankly it really motivates me to 

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:47.219
 to play because we are two of Poitiers 

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:50.379
 reindeer who know each other well enough 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:52.810
 so that's not bad it allowed us to 

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:53.979
 least do what we have here, therefore, 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.270
 it's not over a next file will be 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.140
 surely a big file since there 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.909
 is a little on the cortex 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.159
 we did some time you have a little 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.450
 hard to handle the vortex this video the 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.250
 here I do them anyway for fun 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.469
 to decompress because late May to 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.000
 bump it's never good because doing 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:10.450
 once you're drunk you no longer 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.810
 want to continue so better to do 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.819
 a quiet break to rest a little 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.099
 then resume the boss for not 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.870
 take the lead and the jury then had 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.400
 more small because the lighthouse but 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.750
 it's not his skates frankly me 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.400
 find that people who shut up is a 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.079
 big mistake because at the farm we close 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.750
 finally because we are motivated certainly but 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.069
 we can never play concentrated since 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.840
 we will focus a boss like the 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.120
 vortex fake total conservation because 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.730
 that the guy were nervous with the srab 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.169
 especially we say nervous because fashion 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.609
 now course be the traps 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:40.959
 finally when they have no choice 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.919
 because before he got stuck in 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.079
 traps he ran no donations whose 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:45.650
 it was a bug diablo 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.329
 so that's it 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.890
 my little thing always here look 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.159
 little fights the comment a little on the 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.650
 fight 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:54.590
 so we went to moun we did 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.299
 the versatile excesses and status one is 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.579
 stayed a little quiet did not last 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.189
 long fighting six minutes 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.810
 Afa galÃ© it was not too hard 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.640
 hump with optimization had one 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.689
 could not lose frankly if we 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.069
 was losing 7 and hard 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.540
 I was able to put tactics 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.709
 you go behind the wall so the word 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.959
 he had almost continued to watch 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.180
 on all of us that the dark and midnight he 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.819
 we are more than ned his summoner 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.120
 it's like the Doppler steamer and stinks of 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.859
 shit 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.090
 so here it is a grove it is 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.650
 easy to manage because one is from 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.790
 1200 but you it is because you 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.139
 will win so much especially that makes 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.299
 go down so it's blocked bling from view 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.370
 with is huge and pretty here it's a 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:36.080
 turret and 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.400
 it's great so soon finished 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.260
 2010the assembly point of view the commune 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.950
 type half any case that the effect 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.510
 of esther and panoz weakness and here 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.569
 so here I am you make videos 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.489
 do kama technical videos for 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.049
 your stuff i have nikam mate to me that 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.360
 you will post there I already made the video 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.879
 so I have not if I put the poster before 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.989
 this is where after this one but that's it 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.819
 it's my goal to you 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.290
 show my technique cama but I have 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.299
 mate nikam to me she is not 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.290
 necessarily made for you so if she 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.390
 maybe for you I tried to 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.010
 diversify when a good activity is 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.930
 to find techniques to me not too much 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.920
 trees because his sons him more 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.790
 or less water against something else they 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.410
 are born croquettes 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.000
 we have our main passes they are 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.769
 Facts that and I have my team hours 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.010
 So I had the steamer knows everything 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.400
 make 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.630
 really do everything and our places except 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.550
 case everything so we often played 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.320
 set to mono against so we will find 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.690
 often techniques to Mamoun Rod and 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.479
 to the balls and will share his problem 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.040
 this is the moomba surely die on 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:36.050
 this video 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.050
 leave you in music 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.540
 and
