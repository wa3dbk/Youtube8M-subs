00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
natural sign don't flat it it would have

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.740 
natural sign don't flat it it would have
been<00:03:49.140> flat<00:03:49.410> because<00:03:49.799> of<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:49.950> key<00:03:50.099> signature

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
been flat because of the key signature

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.339 
been flat because of the key signature
so<00:03:51.750> natural<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.349> natural<00:03:53.360> to<00:03:54.360> begin<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:55.260> then

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
so natural a natural to begin and then

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:56.809 
so natural a natural to begin and then
the<00:03:55.470> last<00:03:55.650> this<00:03:56.040> actually<00:03:56.370> starts<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.760> the

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.170 
together now then where's your line is
an<00:04:01.410> E<00:04:01.620> flat<00:04:01.799> so<00:04:02.430> nothing<00:04:02.670> that<00:04:02.700> thinks<00:04:02.970> about

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
an E flat so nothing that thinks about

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.050 
an E flat so nothing that thinks about
him<00:04:03.390> so<00:04:03.570> you'll<00:04:03.720> have<00:04:03.840> your<00:04:04.260> lines<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:05.060> people

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
him so you'll have your lines and people

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.690 
him so you'll have your lines and people
are<00:04:06.180> weak<00:04:06.390> reading<00:04:06.720> those<00:04:06.870> sometimes

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
are weak reading those sometimes

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.650 
are weak reading those sometimes
remember<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.730> middle<00:04:09.030> C<00:04:09.209> would<00:04:09.390> be<00:04:09.420> on<00:04:09.630> that

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
remember a middle C would be on that

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.300 
remember a middle C would be on that
first<00:04:10.019> ledger<00:04:10.290> line<00:04:10.440> so<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.829> second<00:04:11.190> one<00:04:11.250> is

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
first ledger line so the second one is

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.650 
first ledger line so the second one is
an<00:04:11.519> E<00:04:11.640> flat<00:04:11.870> -<00:04:12.920> okay<00:04:13.920> now<00:04:14.850> let's<00:04:15.359> look<00:04:15.450> at<00:04:15.600> the

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
an E flat - okay now let's look at the

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.759 
an E flat - okay now let's look at the
right<00:04:15.780> hand<00:04:16.079> then<00:04:16.200> we'll<00:04:16.350> try<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.530> put<00:04:16.680> it

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
right hand then we'll try to put it

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.270 
right hand then we'll try to put it
together<00:04:16.859> you<00:04:17.609> flat<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:19.019> then<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.950> has<00:04:20.100> two

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
together you flat and then it has two

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.949 
together you flat and then it has two
stems<00:04:20.579> right<00:04:20.910> you<00:04:21.090> want<00:04:21.239> to<00:04:21.269> wonder<00:04:21.690> why<00:04:21.810> like

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
stems right you want to wonder why like

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.020 
stems right you want to wonder why like
this<00:04:22.049> because<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.500> alto<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.190> The<00:04:23.340> Sopranos

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
this because the alto and The Sopranos

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.600 
this because the alto and The Sopranos
found<00:04:24.570> out<00:04:24.720> are<00:04:24.900> both<00:04:25.140> singing<00:04:25.500> in<00:04:25.680> E<00:04:25.800> flat<00:04:25.830> so

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
found out are both singing in E flat so

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.279 
found out are both singing in E flat so
because<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:26.940> stems<00:04:27.180> up<00:04:27.389> for<00:04:27.539> soprano<00:04:27.930> stems

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
because the stems up for soprano stems

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.400 
because the stems up for soprano stems
down<00:04:28.470> are<00:04:28.680> Alto<00:04:29.120> alright<00:04:30.150> that's<00:04:31.080> why<00:04:31.260> it's
