excited to weather and it is like a

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.410 
excited to weather and it is like a
leotard<00:02:30.050> so<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.680> should<00:02:30.860> fit<00:02:31.069> all<00:02:31.549> right<00:02:32.090> but

I never had anything like this and a

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.350 
I never had anything like this and a
little<00:04:33.680> kind<00:04:33.950> of<00:04:34.040> in<00:04:34.160> fashion<00:04:34.520> so<00:04:35.030> I<00:04:35.090> got<00:04:35.240> this

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
little kind of in fashion so I got this

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.960 
little kind of in fashion so I got this
plain<00:04:35.660> black<00:04:36.200> one<00:04:36.500> and<00:04:36.530> just<00:04:36.979> kind<00:04:37.310> of<00:04:37.460> drop

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
plain black one and just kind of drop

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.180

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.909 
of think it just gives it a little
something<00:04:41.990> different<00:04:42.020> than<00:04:42.500> why<00:04:42.620> they<00:04:42.770> just

something different than why they just

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.339 
something different than why they just
having<00:04:43.160> a<00:04:43.340> normal<00:04:43.789> crop<00:04:44.300> top<00:04:44.599> and<00:04:44.750> I<00:04:44.990> really
