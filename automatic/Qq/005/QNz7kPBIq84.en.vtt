around blower sighs and this is
basically<00:02:21.930> just<00:02:22.170> too<00:02:22.410> much<00:02:22.560> engine<00:02:22.920> for<00:02:23.190> this

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
basically just too much engine for this

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.309 
basically just too much engine for this

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.330 

the<00:04:11.849> 2<00:04:12.060> 500<00:04:12.750> is<00:04:13.010> 1678<00:04:14.630> 17<00:04:15.630> pounds<00:04:15.989> of<00:04:16.049> boost<00:04:16.340> and

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
the 2 500 is 1678 17 pounds of boost and

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:25.100 
the 2 500 is 1678 17 pounds of boost and
we<00:04:17.459> got<00:04:17.609> 17<00:04:18.150> 20<00:04:18.600> 30<00:04:19.109> to<00:04:19.519> 1714<00:04:20.630> 1709<00:04:23.030> 1697<00:04:24.110> 9280

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
we got 17 20 30 to 1714 1709 1697 9280

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.690 
we got 17 20 30 to 1714 1709 1697 9280
57<00:04:25.860> 974<00:04:26.610> so<00:04:27.510> you<00:04:28.110> can<00:04:28.260> see<00:04:28.410> this<00:04:28.590> is<00:04:28.770> really<00:04:29.040> it

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
57 974 so you can see this is really it

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.700 
57 974 so you can see this is really it
you<00:04:29.970> know<00:04:30.120> right<00:04:30.360> up<00:04:30.480> in<00:04:30.600> here<00:04:30.780> where<00:04:31.020> it<00:04:31.110> at

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
you know right up in here where it at

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.909 
you know right up in here where it at
6,000<00:04:32.370> RPM<00:04:32.669> with<00:04:32.880> 15<00:04:33.330> and<00:04:33.750> some<00:04:34.440> thousand<00:04:34.830> our

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
6,000 RPM with 15 and some thousand our

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.970 
6,000 RPM with 15 and some thousand our
family<00:04:35.340> still<00:04:35.880> only<00:04:36.030> at<00:04:36.210> 18<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:37.620> really

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
family still only at 18 and really

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.200 
family still only at 18 and really
flattens<00:04:38.370> out<00:04:38.490> right<00:04:38.730> through<00:04:38.880> here<00:04:39.030> you<00:04:39.090> can

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
flattens out right through here you can

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.430 
flattens out right through here you can
see<00:04:39.330> that<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.600> actually<00:04:39.630> does<00:04:40.080> not<00:04:40.260> make

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
see that it actually does not make

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.969 
see that it actually does not make
really<00:04:40.980> does<00:04:41.100> not<00:04:41.250> make<00:04:41.400> any<00:04:41.430> more<00:04:41.760> boost<00:04:42.030> from

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
really does not make any more boost from

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.800 
really does not make any more boost from
6802<00:04:43.979> 7400<00:04:44.850> so<00:04:45.240> that's<00:04:45.360> just<00:04:45.419> where<00:04:45.660> it's

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
6802 7400 so that's just where it's

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.860 
6802 7400 so that's just where it's
rolling<00:04:46.139> over<00:04:46.520> using<00:04:47.520> up<00:04:47.669> using<00:04:48.600> up<00:04:48.780> the

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
rolling over using up using up the

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.210 
rolling over using up using up the
blower<00:04:49.400> mainly<00:04:50.400> because<00:04:51.650> we<00:04:52.650> look<00:04:52.800> too<00:04:53.070> much

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
blower mainly because we look too much

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.159 
blower mainly because we look too much
motor<00:04:53.490> with<00:04:53.940> this<00:04:54.210> particular<00:04:54.570> motor<00:04:54.990> has<00:04:55.139> a

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
motor with this particular motor has a

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.340 
motor with this particular motor has a
little<00:04:55.380> too<00:04:55.440> much<00:04:55.560> camshaft<00:04:56.040> in<00:04:56.220> it<00:04:57.350> but

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
little too much camshaft in it but

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.050 
little too much camshaft in it but
anyways<00:04:58.650> that's<00:04:59.010> what<00:04:59.160> we're<00:04:59.340> working<00:04:59.880> with

anyways that's what we're working with

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.150 
anyways that's what we're working with
and<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.720> blower<00:05:00.900> they<00:05:01.080> sent<00:05:01.350> us<00:05:01.380> to<00:05:01.620> to<00:05:01.979> work

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160
