hey Steve Stein from guitar zoom here
that<00:00:29.230> solo<00:00:29.529> that<00:00:29.680> I<00:00:29.740> was<00:00:29.890> just<00:00:30.099> playing<00:00:30.160> was

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
that solo that I was just playing was

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.190 
that solo that I was just playing was
actually<00:00:31.150> just<00:00:31.330> a<00:00:31.419> few<00:00:31.449> different<00:00:31.930> links

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
actually just a few different links

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.229 
actually just a few different links
combined<00:00:32.739> to<00:00:33.250> make<00:00:33.280> a<00:00:33.460> guitar<00:00:33.670> solo

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
combined to make a guitar solo

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.790 
combined to make a guitar solo
most<00:00:34.780> people<00:00:35.050> believe<00:00:35.140> you<00:00:35.410> need<00:00:35.559> to<00:00:35.650> know<00:00:35.770> a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
most people believe you need to know a

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.410 
most people believe you need to know a
ton<00:00:36.100> of<00:00:36.129> different<00:00:36.309> scales<00:00:36.760> and<00:00:37.030> a<00:00:37.120> bunch<00:00:37.300> of

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
ton of different scales and a bunch of

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.540 
ton of different scales and a bunch of
theory<00:00:37.690> to<00:00:37.840> make<00:00:37.989> a<00:00:38.020> solo<00:00:38.470> and<00:00:38.649> the<00:00:39.129> truth<00:00:39.340> is

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
theory to make a solo and the truth is

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.250 
theory to make a solo and the truth is
that's<00:00:39.699> just<00:00:39.970> not<00:00:40.090> true<00:00:40.270> a<00:00:40.510> simple<00:00:41.110> way<00:00:41.230> to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
that's just not true a simple way to

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.590 
that's just not true a simple way to
solo<00:00:41.710> is<00:00:42.010> to<00:00:42.370> learn<00:00:42.519> some<00:00:42.790> really<00:00:43.150> cool<00:00:43.540> and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
solo is to learn some really cool and

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.750 
solo is to learn some really cool and
effective<00:00:44.260> guitar<00:00:44.559> licks<00:00:44.800> and<00:00:45.010> then<00:00:45.400> learn

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
effective guitar licks and then learn

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.880 
effective guitar licks and then learn
how<00:00:45.790> to<00:00:46.000> string<00:00:46.449> them<00:00:46.600> together<00:00:46.809> to<00:00:47.710> make<00:00:47.860> a

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
how to string them together to make a

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.280 
how to string them together to make a
cool<00:00:48.160> solo<00:00:48.519> so<00:00:49.059> even<00:00:49.360> if<00:00:49.449> you<00:00:49.540> know<00:00:49.750> scales<00:00:50.079> in

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
cool solo so even if you know scales in

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.350 
cool solo so even if you know scales in
theory<00:00:50.650> the<00:00:51.040> idea<00:00:51.070> of<00:00:51.430> using<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:51.940> connecting

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
theory the idea of using and connecting

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.819 
theory the idea of using and connecting
cool<00:00:52.600> guitar<00:00:52.930> licks<00:00:53.170> together<00:00:53.500> is<00:00:53.739> still

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
cool guitar licks together is still

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.740 
cool guitar licks together is still
essential<00:00:54.489> in<00:00:54.579> being<00:00:54.699> able<00:00:54.879> to<00:00:55.030> make<00:00:55.120> your

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
essential in being able to make your

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.630 
essential in being able to make your
solo<00:00:56.019> really<00:00:56.379> stand<00:00:56.739> out<00:00:56.949> so<00:00:57.370> I'm<00:00:57.460> going<00:00:57.610> to

show you three simple guitar licks that

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.740 
show you three simple guitar licks that
you<00:00:59.890> can<00:01:00.070> use<00:01:00.340> to<00:01:00.789> play<00:01:01.000> a<00:01:01.030> rock<00:01:01.329> guitar<00:01:01.690> solo

string I'm gonna go up to the 17th fret

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.590 
string I'm gonna go up to the 17th fret
I'm<00:01:07.450> going<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.690> use<00:01:07.780> 17<00:01:08.350> 15<00:01:09.160> 14<00:01:09.670> and<00:01:09.850> 12<00:01:10.060> I'm

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
I'm going to use 17 15 14 and 12 I'm

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.090 
I'm going to use 17 15 14 and 12 I'm
going<00:01:10.690> to<00:01:10.840> use<00:01:10.929> pull<00:01:11.170> offs<00:01:11.350> for<00:01:11.619> all<00:01:11.770> of<00:01:11.979> these

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
going to use pull offs for all of these

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.370 
going to use pull offs for all of these
so<00:01:12.610> I'm<00:01:12.700> going<00:01:12.910> 17<00:01:13.420> to<00:01:13.539> 12<00:01:14.399> 15<00:01:15.399> to<00:01:15.490> 12<00:01:16.050> 14<00:01:17.050> to<00:01:17.140> 12

so I'm going 17 to 12 15 to 12 14 to 12

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.370 
so I'm going 17 to 12 15 to 12 14 to 12
and<00:01:18.060> then<00:01:19.060> I'm<00:01:19.149> going<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.300> tag<00:01:19.570> it<00:01:19.840> by<00:01:20.050> going<00:01:20.229> to

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
and then I'm going to tag it by going to

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.700 
and then I'm going to tag it by going to
the<00:01:20.500> 15th<00:01:21.190> fret<00:01:21.520> of<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.789> second<00:01:22.330> string<00:01:22.710> then

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
the 15th fret of the second string then

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.590 
the 15th fret of the second string then
back<00:01:24.070> to<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.520> first<00:01:24.820> string<00:01:25.149> on<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.330> 12th

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
back to the first string on the 12th

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.080 
back to the first string on the 12th
fret<00:01:25.770> that's<00:01:26.770> my<00:01:26.950> first<00:01:27.160> lick<00:01:27.490> so<00:01:27.700> it<00:01:27.789> sounds

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
fret that's my first lick so it sounds

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:36.289 
fret that's my first lick so it sounds
like<00:01:28.149> this<00:01:28.420> nice<00:01:28.690> and<00:01:28.720> slow

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.029 

and<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:37.049> course<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.380> becomes<00:01:37.619> really<00:01:37.799> powerful

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
and of course it becomes really powerful

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:45.319 
and of course it becomes really powerful
as<00:01:38.429> you<00:01:38.520> speed<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.000> up<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.210> little<00:01:39.329> bit<00:01:44.329> but

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
as you speed it up a little bit but

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.340 
as you speed it up a little bit but
really<00:01:45.539> it's<00:01:45.659> just<00:01:45.719> a<00:01:45.869> bunch<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.110> different

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
really it's just a bunch of different

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.800 
really it's just a bunch of different
pull<00:01:46.530> offs<00:01:46.740> all<00:01:47.070> used<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:48.270> connected<00:01:48.659> together

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
pull offs all used it connected together

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.929 
pull offs all used it connected together
so<00:01:49.740> that's<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.039> first<00:01:50.280> look<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.640> want<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
so that's the first look that I want you

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.240 
so that's the first look that I want you
to<00:01:51.030> work<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.359> the<00:01:52.259> second<00:01:52.679> lick<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.009> went

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
to work on the second lick that I went

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.699 
to work on the second lick that I went
into<00:01:53.549> was<00:01:54.179> a<00:01:54.210> lick<00:01:54.509> also<00:01:54.899> with<00:01:55.049> pull<00:01:55.259> offs<00:01:55.439> I'm

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
into was a lick also with pull offs I'm

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.370 
into was a lick also with pull offs I'm
going<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.920> be<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.130> 15<00:01:56.729> 12<00:01:57.060> 15<00:01:57.840> 12<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.289> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
going to be going 15 12 15 12 on the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.949 
going to be going 15 12 15 12 on the
first<00:01:58.619> string<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.069> then<00:01:59.909> 15<00:02:00.420> 12<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
first string and then 15 12 in the

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:02.929 
first string and then 15 12 in the
second<00:02:01.289> string<00:02:01.469> but<00:02:01.619> only<00:02:01.740> once<00:02:02.069> so<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:02.759> this

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
second string but only once so like this

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.169 
second string but only once so like this
and<00:02:04.069> then<00:02:05.069> one<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.399> these<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.630> you're<00:02:06.750> going

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
and then one of these so you're going

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.569 
and then one of these so you're going
and<00:02:09.799> because<00:02:10.799> there's<00:02:10.950> only<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.160> group<00:02:11.400> of

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:11.579 
and because there's only a group of

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:13.400 
and because there's only a group of
three<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.120> those<00:02:12.269> it<00:02:12.599> actually<00:02:13.170> kind<00:02:13.380> of

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
three of those it actually kind of

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.839 
three of those it actually kind of
changes<00:02:13.769> up<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:13.950> rhythm<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.340> little<00:02:14.370> bit<00:02:14.640> makes

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
changes up the rhythm a little bit makes

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.809 
changes up the rhythm a little bit makes
it<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.120> bit<00:02:15.360> more<00:02:15.390> interesting<00:02:19.190> okay<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.700> you've

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
it a bit more interesting okay so you've

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:28.000 
it a bit more interesting okay so you've
got<00:02:20.849> your<00:02:21.120> first<00:02:21.329> lick<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:24.060> connects

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.280 

you<00:02:28.760> see<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.330> I<00:02:29.360> could<00:02:29.629> connect<00:02:29.930> back<00:02:30.110> and

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
you see so I could connect back and

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.660 
you see so I could connect back and
forth<00:02:30.470> between<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:30.830> first<00:02:30.980> lick<00:02:31.430> in<00:02:31.550> that

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
forth between that first lick in that

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.550 
forth between that first lick in that
second<00:02:32.060> lick<00:02:32.209> again<00:02:32.750> at<00:02:32.870> any<00:02:32.989> tempo<00:02:33.379> that<00:02:33.409> I

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
second lick again at any tempo that I

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:46.869 
second lick again at any tempo that I
choose<00:02:33.890> -<00:02:45.310> pretty<00:02:46.310> cool<00:02:46.489> huh

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
choose - pretty cool huh

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.420 
choose - pretty cool huh
so<00:02:47.239> then<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.510> third<00:02:47.870> lick<00:02:48.260> is<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.799> little<00:02:49.340> bit

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
so then the third lick is a little bit

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.770 
so then the third lick is a little bit
longer<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:50.030> one<00:02:50.209> what<00:02:50.330> I'm<00:02:50.420> going<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.599> do<00:02:50.660> is

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
longer this one what I'm going to do is

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.910 
longer this one what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:50.870> going<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.019> start<00:02:51.230> off<00:02:51.319> doing<00:02:51.349> a<00:02:51.620> pull<00:02:51.799> off

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
I'm going to start off doing a pull off

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.080 
I'm going to start off doing a pull off
from<00:02:52.160> 15<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.730> 12<00:02:54.099> so<00:02:55.099> the<00:02:55.220> second<00:02:55.579> lick<00:02:55.700> left

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
from 15 to 12 so the second lick left

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.449 
from 15 to 12 so the second lick left
off<00:02:56.360> with<00:02:56.629> that<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:57.349> third<00:02:57.620> lake<00:02:57.799> starts<00:02:58.250> with

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
off with that the third lake starts with

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.759 
off with that the third lake starts with
that<00:02:59.260> then<00:03:00.260> I'm<00:03:00.349> going<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.500> go<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.650> the

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
that then I'm going to go to the

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.009 
that then I'm going to go to the
fourteenth<00:03:01.280> fret<00:03:01.370> of<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.670> third<00:03:01.879> string<00:03:02.019> then

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
fourteenth fret of the third string then

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.500 
fourteenth fret of the third string then
back<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.190> twelfth<00:03:04.610> fret<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.000> second

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
back to the twelfth fret of the second

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.479 
back to the twelfth fret of the second
string<00:03:08.709> then<00:03:09.709> I'm<00:03:09.799> going<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:09.950> do<00:03:10.040> that<00:03:10.190> same

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
string then I'm going to do that same

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.339 
string then I'm going to do that same
idea<00:03:10.819> starting<00:03:11.480> on<00:03:11.569> the<00:03:11.690> third<00:03:11.720> string<00:03:12.319> and

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
idea starting on the third string and

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.699 
idea starting on the third string and
going<00:03:12.859> to<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.069> fourth<00:03:13.310> string<00:03:14.500> so<00:03:15.500> now<00:03:15.620> I'm

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
going to the fourth string so now I'm

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.449 
going to the fourth string so now I'm
doing<00:03:16.010> 14<00:03:16.519> 12<00:03:17.170> 14<00:03:18.170> on<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.319> fourth<00:03:18.620> string<00:03:18.739> back

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
doing 14 12 14 on the fourth string back

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.449 
doing 14 12 14 on the fourth string back
to<00:03:19.489> 12<00:03:19.970> on<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.239> third<00:03:20.450> string<00:03:20.890> so<00:03:21.890> you<00:03:21.980> can<00:03:22.220> see

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
to 12 on the third string so you can see

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.930 
to 12 on the third string so you can see
the<00:03:22.640> similarity<00:03:23.299> between<00:03:23.329> these<00:03:23.780> two<00:03:23.959> shapes

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
the similarity between these two shapes

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:33.649 
the similarity between these two shapes
and<00:03:27.400> so<00:03:28.400> I'm<00:03:28.459> connecting<00:03:28.879> those<00:03:29.000> together

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.640 

so<00:03:34.659> now<00:03:34.810> what<00:03:34.900> I'm<00:03:34.959> going<00:03:35.049> to<00:03:35.110> do<00:03:35.200> is<00:03:35.319> slide

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
so now what I'm going to do is slide

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.319 
so now what I'm going to do is slide
from<00:03:36.069> the<00:03:36.189> twelfth<00:03:36.549> fret<00:03:36.730> of<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.060> third

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
from the twelfth fret of the third

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.190 
from the twelfth fret of the third
string<00:03:37.360> where<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:37.750> left<00:03:37.930> off<00:03:38.140> to<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.769> eleven

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.580 

okay<00:03:42.200> so<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.620> looks<00:03:42.769> like<00:03:42.920> this

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.350 

then<00:03:48.190> I'm<00:03:48.250> going<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.400> go<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.550> the<00:03:48.640> 12th<00:03:48.970> fret<00:03:49.090> of

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
then I'm going to go to the 12th fret of

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.070 
then I'm going to go to the 12th fret of
the<00:03:49.420> fourth<00:03:50.290> string<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.790> then<00:03:52.690> back<00:03:52.870> to<00:03:52.989> the

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
the fourth string and then back to the

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.630 
the fourth string and then back to the
11<00:03:53.550> and<00:03:54.550> then<00:03:54.700> slide<00:03:54.940> down<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.209> 9

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
11 and then slide down to 9

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.930 
11 and then slide down to 9
so<00:03:57.600> I<00:03:57.660> have

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:13.860 

a<00:04:02.970> little<00:04:03.600> bit<00:04:03.690> faster

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.650 

you<00:04:14.560> see<00:04:14.739> so<00:04:15.340> lick<00:04:15.760> number<00:04:16.030> one<00:04:16.209> number<00:04:16.449> two

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
you see so lick number one number two

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.939 
you see so lick number one number two
and<00:04:16.690> number<00:04:16.840> three<00:04:17.019> all<00:04:17.350> connected<00:04:17.799> together

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
and number three all connected together

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:23.820 
and number three all connected together
a<00:04:18.190> little<00:04:18.370> bit<00:04:18.519> slower<00:04:18.880> for<00:04:19.209> you<00:04:19.239> here<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.770> I'm
