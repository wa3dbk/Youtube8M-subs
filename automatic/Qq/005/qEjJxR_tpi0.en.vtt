craftsmanship can't goes more but

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.120 
craftsmanship can't goes more but
there's<00:03:57.670> a<00:03:57.730> certain<00:03:58.060> point<00:03:58.330> where<00:03:58.780> you<00:03:59.530> start

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
there's a certain point where you start

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.360 
there's a certain point where you start
getting<00:04:00.190> diminishing<00:04:00.970> returns<00:04:01.950> I'd<00:04:02.950> say<00:04:03.190> this

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
getting diminishing returns I'd say this

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.280 
getting diminishing returns I'd say this
is<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:03.549> really<00:04:04.030> good<00:04:04.269> example<00:04:04.330> would<00:04:04.870> be<00:04:04.930> like

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
is a really good example would be like

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.360 
is a really good example would be like
El<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:06.190> Gibson<00:04:06.820> made<00:04:06.970> Les<00:04:07.209> Paul's

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
El the Gibson made Les Paul's

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.520 
El the Gibson made Les Paul's
because<00:04:09.370> I<00:04:09.519> think<00:04:09.760> oh<00:04:09.940> they<00:04:10.810> just<00:04:10.840> don't<00:04:11.230> do

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
because I think oh they just don't do

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.009 
because I think oh they just don't do
much<00:04:11.980> for<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.640> 2000s<00:04:13.360> where<00:04:13.510> you<00:04:13.690> probably

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
much for the 2000s where you probably

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.300 
much for the 2000s where you probably
just<00:04:14.380> drop<00:04:15.150> five<00:04:16.150> or<00:04:16.359> six<00:04:16.570> hundred<00:04:17.310> for

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
just drop five or six hundred for

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.810 
just drop five or six hundred for
something<00:04:18.580> like<00:04:18.700> this<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:19.799> has<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:20.830> lot<00:04:21.790> of

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
something like this and has a lot of

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.770 
something like this and has a lot of
great<00:04:22.060> value<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.390> it<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:24.340> really<00:04:24.820> that's<00:04:25.000> about
