00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.190 

my<00:00:08.950> favorite<00:00:09.340> part<00:00:09.610> about<00:00:09.760> graffiti<00:00:10.540> I<00:00:10.660> think

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 
my favorite part about graffiti I think

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.980 
my favorite part about graffiti I think
that<00:00:11.469> it<00:00:11.680> keeps<00:00:12.130> the<00:00:12.520> spirit<00:00:13.480> of<00:00:13.629> rebellion

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
that it keeps the spirit of rebellion

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.530 
that it keeps the spirit of rebellion
alive<00:00:14.500> our<00:00:14.950> country<00:00:15.670> was<00:00:15.820> founded<00:00:16.059> on

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:16.540 
alive our country was founded on

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.749 
alive our country was founded on
rebellion<00:00:17.320> and<00:00:17.560> I<00:00:17.830> think<00:00:18.099> that<00:00:18.340> if<00:00:18.550> there

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:18.759 
rebellion and I think that if there

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.060 
rebellion and I think that if there
isn't<00:00:19.090> someone<00:00:19.349> questioning<00:00:20.349> the<00:00:20.470> status<00:00:20.529> quo

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
isn't someone questioning the status quo

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.010 
isn't someone questioning the status quo
if<00:00:21.189> there<00:00:21.490> isn't<00:00:21.610> some<00:00:21.910> kind<00:00:22.119> of<00:00:22.270> dissent<00:00:22.810> and

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
if there isn't some kind of dissent and

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.620 
if there isn't some kind of dissent and
free<00:00:23.680> thinkers<00:00:24.189> out<00:00:24.399> there<00:00:24.759> you<00:00:25.480> know

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
pops like a puzzle to me like I I like

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.840 
pops like a puzzle to me like I I like
to<00:02:25.080> just<00:02:25.230> lay<00:02:25.410> down<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.830> couple<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.280> lines<00:02:26.489> and

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
to just lay down a couple of lines and

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.400 
to just lay down a couple of lines and
then<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.000> kind<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.239> see<00:02:27.420> where<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.780> goes<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.019> I

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
then I kind of see where that goes and I

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.920 
then I kind of see where that goes and I
just<00:02:28.620> try<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.010> figure<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.459> out<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:29.970> don't<00:02:30.660> have

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
just try to figure it out I don't have

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.960 
just try to figure it out I don't have
like<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.080> set<00:02:31.440> style<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.220> lettering<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.850> do

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
like a set style of lettering that I do

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.600 
like a set style of lettering that I do
so<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.360> just<00:02:33.570> kind<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.870> start<00:02:34.769> trying<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.340> figure

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
so I just kind of start trying to figure

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.190 
so I just kind of start trying to figure
out<00:02:35.730> how<00:02:35.820> do<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.000> pieces<00:02:36.360> work<00:02:36.570> together<00:02:36.720> and

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
out how do the pieces work together and

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.870 
out how do the pieces work together and
I<00:02:37.680> think<00:02:37.799> that's<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.040> fun<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:38.700> keeps

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
I think that's the fun of it that keeps

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.400 
I think that's the fun of it that keeps
me<00:02:39.000> drawing<00:02:39.239> like<00:02:39.450> every<00:02:39.660> time<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:39.840> go<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.110> draw

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
me drawing like every time I go to draw

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.860 
me drawing like every time I go to draw
I<00:02:40.440> do<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.680> new<00:02:40.920> style<00:02:41.220> or<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.519> new<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:42.420> know<00:02:42.450> type

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
I do a new style or a new you know type

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.310 
I do a new style or a new you know type
of<00:02:43.019> lettering<00:02:43.470> style<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:45.510> don't<00:02:46.170> know

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
of lettering style and and I don't know

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.960 
of lettering style and and I don't know
I<00:02:46.350> think<00:02:46.440> that's<00:02:46.620> what<00:02:46.860> keeps<00:02:47.580> me<00:02:47.820> motivated

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
I think that's what keeps me motivated

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.759 
I think that's what keeps me motivated
to<00:02:48.360> keep<00:02:48.570> drawing<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.290> think<00:02:49.440> that's<00:02:49.620> the

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
to keep drawing and I think that's the

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.250 
to keep drawing and I think that's the
goal<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.190> keep<00:02:50.400> drawing<00:02:50.750> I'm<00:02:51.750> pretty<00:02:52.019> much

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
goal is to keep drawing I'm pretty much

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.740 
goal is to keep drawing I'm pretty much
influenced<00:02:52.920> by<00:02:52.950> everything<00:02:53.340> around<00:02:53.610> me<00:02:53.940> from

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
influenced by everything around me from

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.610 
influenced by everything around me from
every<00:02:55.080> writer<00:02:55.350> to

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
every writer to

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.150 
every writer to
comics<00:02:57.520> too<00:02:57.849> you<00:02:58.330> know<00:02:58.470> movies<00:02:59.470> I<00:02:59.709> see<00:02:59.980> you

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
comics too you know movies I see you

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.330 
comics too you know movies I see you
know<00:03:00.989> what<00:03:01.989> it<00:03:02.110> is<00:03:02.140> is<00:03:02.380> an<00:03:02.530> attempt<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:02.980> piece

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
know what it is is an attempt to piece

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.650 
know what it is is an attempt to piece
together<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:05.050> language<00:03:05.560> of<00:03:05.800> color<00:03:06.550> so<00:03:07.480> this

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
together the language of color so this

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.750 
together the language of color so this
in<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.930> sense<00:03:07.959> is<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.470> way<00:03:08.830> our<00:03:08.980> language<00:03:09.489> is<00:03:09.640> if

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
in a sense is the way our language is if

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.030 
in a sense is the way our language is if
you<00:03:09.880> look<00:03:10.090> at<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.660> way<00:03:10.840> we<00:03:10.870> speak<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.650> way<00:03:11.800> we

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
you look at the way we speak the way we

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.430 
you look at the way we speak the way we
advertise<00:03:12.640> it's<00:03:12.940> little<00:03:13.209> bits<00:03:13.660> here<00:03:14.380> and

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
advertise it's little bits here and

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.009 
advertise it's little bits here and
there<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.130> so<00:03:15.580> this<00:03:15.790> reflects<00:03:16.330> somehow<00:03:16.810> those

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
there and so this reflects somehow those

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.589 
there and so this reflects somehow those
little<00:03:17.349> bits<00:03:17.620> an<00:03:17.890> attempt<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.790> kind<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.239> put<00:03:19.480> it

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
little bits an attempt to kind of put it

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.060 
little bits an attempt to kind of put it
together<00:03:20.489> this<00:03:21.489> is<00:03:21.700> art
