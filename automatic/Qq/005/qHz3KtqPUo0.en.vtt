I<00:03:40.180> like<00:03:40.540> having<00:03:40.870> that<00:03:40.989> quiet<00:03:41.430> relatively<00:03:42.430> more

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
I like having that quiet relatively more

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.940 
I like having that quiet relatively more
quiet<00:03:42.879> space<00:03:43.209> which<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.599> afterload<00:03:44.049> normally

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
quiet space which the afterload normally

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.129 
quiet space which the afterload normally
is<00:03:45.129> and<00:03:45.489> clearly<00:03:46.269> that's<00:03:46.389> what<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.689> top<00:03:46.870> deck

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
is and clearly that's what the top deck

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.289 
is and clearly that's what the top deck
is<00:03:47.319> meant<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.680> be<00:03:47.799> and<00:03:48.069> again<00:03:48.489> in<00:03:48.790> warmer

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
is meant to be and again in warmer

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.199 
is meant to be and again in warmer
weather<00:03:49.420> yeah<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:50.500> what<00:03:50.739> is<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.639> say<00:03:51.819> I'm<00:03:51.879> thank

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
weather yeah so what is to say I'm thank

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.720 
weather yeah so what is to say I'm thank
you<00:03:52.389> and<00:03:53.349> I<00:03:53.469> think<00:03:53.709> also<00:03:53.859> one<00:03:54.310> of<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.549> things

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
you and I think also one of the things

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.539 
you and I think also one of the things
that<00:03:55.060> is<00:03:56.019> important<00:03:56.680> about<00:03:56.739> this<00:03:57.040> experience

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
that is important about this experience

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.490 
that is important about this experience
is<00:03:57.669> that<00:03:57.760> it<00:03:57.909> is<00:03:58.030> all-inclusive<00:03:58.540> yes<00:03:59.169> I<00:03:59.290> think

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
is that it is all-inclusive yes I think

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.470 
is that it is all-inclusive yes I think
that's<00:03:59.680> a<00:03:59.799> very<00:04:00.040> pivotal<00:04:00.400> point<00:04:00.879> because<00:04:01.269> most

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
that's a very pivotal point because most

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.720 
that's a very pivotal point because most
river<00:04:01.810> cruises<00:04:02.199> are<00:04:02.379> inclusive<00:04:03.129> to<00:04:03.519> a<00:04:03.549> degree

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
river cruises are inclusive to a degree

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.970 
river cruises are inclusive to a degree
mm-hmm<00:04:04.569> your<00:04:04.900> duties<00:04:05.439> would<00:04:05.590> often<00:04:05.859> be

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
mm-hmm your duties would often be

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.770 
mm-hmm your duties would often be
included<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:06.639> your<00:04:06.849> wine<00:04:07.120> with<00:04:07.359> lunch<00:04:07.389> and

included and your wine with lunch and

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.959 
included and your wine with lunch and
dinner<00:04:07.959> would<00:04:08.319> invariably<00:04:08.949> be<00:04:09.159> included<00:04:09.819> and

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:09.969 
dinner would invariably be included and

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:11.520 
dinner would invariably be included and
various<00:04:10.359> river<00:04:10.599> cruises<00:04:11.049> do<00:04:11.169> different

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
various river cruises do different

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.619 
various river cruises do different
things<00:04:11.560> they<00:04:12.069> this<00:04:12.609> is<00:04:12.669> the<00:04:13.090> ultimate

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
things they this is the ultimate

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.620 
things they this is the ultimate
all-inclusive<00:04:14.590> moment<00:04:15.120> everything<00:04:16.120> every

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
all-inclusive moment everything every

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.469 
all-inclusive moment everything every

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
drink you ever want is included in the

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.900 
drink you ever want is included in the
fare<00:04:19.720> and<00:04:19.750> all<00:04:20.229> your<00:04:20.380> gratuity<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:21.310> air<00:04:21.549> and

fare and all your gratuity and air and

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.050 
fare and all your gratuity and air and
your<00:04:22.509> air<00:04:23.099> from<00:04:24.099> a<00:04:24.160> couple<00:04:24.430> of<00:04:24.580> Canadian

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
your air from a couple of Canadian

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.300 
your air from a couple of Canadian
gateways<00:04:25.449> and<00:04:25.930> your<00:04:26.919> transfers<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:28.380> also<00:04:29.380> all

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
gateways and your transfers and also all

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.890 
gateways and your transfers and also all
your<00:04:30.550> short<00:04:30.880> excursions<00:04:31.389> so<00:04:31.570> I<00:04:31.630> think<00:04:31.690> the

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
your short excursions so I think the

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.290 
your short excursions so I think the
value<00:04:32.320> is<00:04:32.349> is<00:04:32.770> enormously<00:04:33.430> and<00:04:34.060> the

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
value is is enormously and the

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.240 
value is is enormously and the
effortlessness<00:04:34.960> I<00:04:35.320> think<00:04:35.620> that's<00:04:35.770> one<00:04:35.979> of<00:04:36.009> the

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
effortlessness I think that's one of the

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.129 
effortlessness I think that's one of the
the<00:04:36.580> things<00:04:36.610> that<00:04:36.970> I<00:04:37.120> love<00:04:37.389> most<00:04:37.419> whether<00:04:37.990> or

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
the things that I love most whether or

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.620 
the things that I love most whether or
not<00:04:38.229> you<00:04:38.380> end<00:04:38.560> up<00:04:38.710> spending<00:04:38.919> more<00:04:39.520> or<00:04:39.789> less<00:04:40.000> the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
not you end up spending more or less the

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.810 
not you end up spending more or less the
fact<00:04:40.870> that<00:04:40.960> once<00:04:41.380> you<00:04:41.680> pay<00:04:41.919> your<00:04:42.099> fare<00:04:42.340> yes

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
fact that once you pay your fare yes

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.580 
fact that once you pay your fare yes
don't<00:04:43.090> have<00:04:43.389> to<00:04:43.599> do<00:04:43.690> any<00:04:43.840> more<00:04:43.960> thinking<00:04:44.409> or

once you've paid your fare you have

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.249 
once you've paid your fare you have
something<00:04:52.240> you<00:04:52.300> can<00:04:52.449> completely<00:04:52.810> stop<00:04:52.930> doing

something you can completely stop doing

you know and just enjoy your holiday yes
I<00:04:55.479> mean<00:04:55.570> obviously<00:04:55.690> spa<00:04:56.320> would<00:04:56.560> be<00:04:56.680> extra<00:04:57.130> fact

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
I mean obviously spa would be extra fact

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.159 
I mean obviously spa would be extra fact
you<00:04:57.699> purchase<00:04:58.180> something<00:04:58.330> on<00:04:58.599> board<00:04:58.840> the<00:04:58.960> ship

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
you purchase something on board the ship

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.839 
you purchase something on board the ship
if<00:04:59.349> you<00:04:59.380> wanted<00:04:59.710> extra<00:04:59.860> wine<00:05:00.250> right

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
if you wanted extra wine right

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:02.370 
if you wanted extra wine right
there's<00:05:00.970> also<00:05:01.150> that<00:05:01.389> private<00:05:01.870> dining<00:05:02.050> room

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
there's also that private dining room

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.080 
there's also that private dining room
that<00:05:02.590> is<00:05:02.770> very<00:05:03.250> much<00:05:03.370> like<00:05:03.430> a<00:05:03.580> food<00:05:03.849> and

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
that is very much like a food and

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.240 
that is very much like a food and
tasting<00:05:04.659> dining<00:05:05.289> space<00:05:05.560> that<00:05:05.889> would<00:05:06.009> be<00:05:06.070> an

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
tasting dining space that would be an

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.820 
tasting dining space that would be an
extra<00:05:06.520> charge<00:05:06.550> but<00:05:07.180> essentially<00:05:07.690> it's<00:05:08.409> all<00:05:08.650> in

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
extra charge but essentially it's all in

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.589 
extra charge but essentially it's all in
room<00:05:09.190> and<00:05:09.430> I<00:05:09.639> think<00:05:09.880> that's<00:05:10.030> that's<00:05:10.300> a<00:05:10.419> very

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
room and I think that's that's a very

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.529 
room and I think that's that's a very
good<00:05:10.870> price<00:05:11.500> point<00:05:11.860> and<00:05:12.430> it's<00:05:13.240> for<00:05:13.479> a<00:05:13.509> very

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
good price point and it's for a very

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.629 
good price point and it's for a very
good<00:05:13.810> experience<00:05:14.169> so<00:05:14.620> this<00:05:15.009> is<00:05:15.190> a<00:05:15.219> winner

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
good experience so this is a winner

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.709 
good experience so this is a winner

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:18.719 
I remember Isaac yes and I think that

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:20.089 
I remember Isaac yes and I think that
