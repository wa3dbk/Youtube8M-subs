00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.210
 favorite retseptik again that 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.650
 very simple and fast 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.230
 and most importantly it will be 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.060
 used my favorite curd by 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.880
 time you will need about 10-15 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.000
 minutes and from the ingredients you will need 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.099
 one cup 200 or 300 grams of cottage cheese 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.949
 be sure to skim a bit 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.899
 jam or jam, I took more candied fruits and 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.880
 chocolate network we will have chocolate 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.579
 will definitely need silicone 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.469
 molds so that the dessert we had with the form 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.160
 first melt chocolate on steam 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.840
 bathhouse 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.230
 for this you will need to boil 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.000
 water and put when a bowl of chocolate 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.219
 by the way you can take the bitter chocolate i 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.710
 took on the lower dairy close 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.489
 lid and let it melt 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.320
 Now let 's do a pear, we will cut it on 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.120
 dice instead of pears you can 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.449
 use any other your favorite 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.449
 fruit 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.700
 chocolate has melted now we are generous 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.050
 we coat the molds from the inside 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.600
 why we use silicone 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.610
 molds because then when dither 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.610
 will harden because it will be easier for the owl 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.899
 we have well smeared the molds inside with 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.119
 chocolate now send them to five 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.610
 five minutes in the freezer 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.159
 now we put curd in each of 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.000
 molds impose until the middle 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:43.440
