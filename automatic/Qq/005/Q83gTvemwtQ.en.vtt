00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.680
 whether chor or casual gamer for everyone 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.569
 gaming is missing no matter if big or small 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.519
 is the upcoming gamescom one 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.620
 Absolute highlight quickly you lose 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.910
 but in the surplus of harlem stalls 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.679
 and new releases and the overview 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.630
 that's exactly why there are here 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:26.210
 our top ten probably the best games 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:26.210
 the gamescom 2015 ranked ten 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.489
 in the ego shooter genre, there are many 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.680
 gamer only the choice between battlefield 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.329
 or call of duty, which is often missed out 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.829
 the innovation and the demanded 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.320
 fresh wind often come too short 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.940
 ubisoft has rainbow six now 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.470
 Of course you can try something new 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.730
 do not reinvent the wheel because one 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.110
 weapon remains a weapon and a weapon 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.610
 Battlefield is a battlefield 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.350
 Nevertheless, the new litter surprised 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.089
 through an interesting game concept 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.589
 for the terrorists and five police officers 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:54.280
 meet on quite small terra 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:55.989
 on each other 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.280
 and thereby a geiÃŸler is defended 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.530
 whether in a disused 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.420
 house or in a plane everything is 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.309
 possible and lets hope that one as 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.140
 player is offered many variations 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.000
 but if the new games are up and 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.890
 ubisoft we can convince first 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.610
 to watch gamescom or to release 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.119
 at 16 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.119
 October 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.390
 place nine 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.590
 just cause 3 has explosions explosions 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.420
 and yes sometimes one 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.130
 explosion of course has the game too 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.780
 Much more to offer an incredible 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.820
 big open world in which we move 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.409
 and the ruler general the rebels 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.940
 want to try to overthrow 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.500
 the first gameplay scenes from the e3 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.090
 look very promising 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.310
 because you are not just traveling the world 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.899
 hike but with speed boats 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.399
 helicopters jets helicopters and and 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.440
 and drive through the area and fly 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.240
 So action is definitely here 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.830
 pre-programmed from the first of december 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.250
 and I have already mentioned there 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.250
 explosions 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.390
 stade 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.360
 Eight 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.840
 who knows the metal gear solid 3 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.430
 also enjoy the latest release 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.440
 May be the fifth part under the title 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.060
 fanpage important not only by 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.650
 great store and cool graphics 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.180
 but as usual with a 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.580
 gripping story crazy characters 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.230
 the cineastic elements and 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.310
 an interesting topic may be included 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.019
 Of course not missing 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.489
 next to the many and longtime fans 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.200
 we are looking forward to the 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.819
 gamescom and on the first of september 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.290
 because then you can with the new part 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.290
 expect from the house konami 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.160
 seventh place 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.859
 Rich big green islands surrounded by 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.329
 blue water waiting loosely on it 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.030
 It's time again to become president 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.859
 for after 20 70 it goes to the second 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.599
 but in the future, without 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.639
 ubisoft strategy game department again 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.499
 on abgespeist.de future vision but 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.180

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:26.980
 so in vain on aliens and green 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.810
 People in the city center can, however, the 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.010

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.970
 place six 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.219
 Imagine you live in New York 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.840
 or a devastating pandemic spreads 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.370
 within days you run out of it 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.410
 the sparsely lit streets and 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.639
 alleys in which there is chaos and that 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.019
 system threatens to collapse 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.459
 through the diseases and the many 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.350
 days without food exactly in this 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.539
 Threatening world throws us ubisoft in
