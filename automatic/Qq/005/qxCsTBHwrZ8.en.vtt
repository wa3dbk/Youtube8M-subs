00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
21 and i found this which I just thought

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.940 
21 and i found this which I just thought
this<00:01:32.299> was<00:01:32.479> a<00:01:32.509> little<00:01:32.780> more<00:01:32.900> formal<00:01:33.350> but<00:01:33.830> you

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
this was a little more formal but you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.800 
this was a little more formal but you
can<00:01:34.070> still<00:01:34.250> wear<00:01:34.400> every<00:01:34.700> day<00:01:34.729> obviously<00:01:34.970> but

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
can still wear every day obviously but

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.850 
can still wear every day obviously but
this<00:01:35.960> one<00:01:36.110> is<00:01:36.229> definitely<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.619> little<00:01:36.650> more

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
this one is definitely a little more

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.469 
this one is definitely a little more
dressy<00:01:37.250> kind<00:01:37.610> of<00:01:37.640> like<00:01:37.820> a<00:01:37.880> cupcake<00:01:38.150> when

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479
