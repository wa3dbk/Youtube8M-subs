plugin called skybox male so with this

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.910 
plugin called skybox male so with this
plugin<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.690> can<00:00:15.809> basically<00:00:16.199> create<00:00:16.619> up<00:00:16.830> a

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
plugin you can basically create up a

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.710 
plugin you can basically create up a
mailbox<00:00:17.310> system<00:00:17.880> where<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.270> can<00:00:18.420> send

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
mailbox system where you can send

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.109 
mailbox system where you can send
messages<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.380> send<00:00:19.680> packages<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.490> minecraft

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
messages and send packages on minecraft

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.750 
messages and send packages on minecraft
and<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.660> be<00:00:21.810> with<00:00:21.990> signs<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.980> GUI<00:00:23.369> so

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
and this can be with signs and in GUI so

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.370 
and this can be with signs and in GUI so
it<00:00:23.880> makes<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.210> really<00:00:24.539> easy<00:00:24.660> for<00:00:24.930> your<00:00:25.140> players

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
it makes it really easy for your players

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.040 
it makes it really easy for your players
because<00:00:25.920> gys<00:00:26.670> are<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.240> easy<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.539> use<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.900> don't

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
because gys are so easy to use you don't

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.779 
because gys are so easy to use you don't
know<00:00:28.109> what<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> GUI<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.650> basically<00:00:29.310> just<00:00:29.340> your

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
know what a GUI is basically just your

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.730 
know what a GUI is basically just your
inventory<00:00:30.300> everything<00:00:31.019> can<00:00:31.289> be<00:00:31.320> done<00:00:31.410> by

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
inventory everything can be done by

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.100 
inventory everything can be done by
clicking<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.130> blog<00:00:32.399> send<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:33.930> we

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
clicking a blog send this and that so we

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.260 
clicking a blog send this and that so we
can<00:00:34.230> use<00:00:34.440> science<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.100> send<00:00:35.370> stuff<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.969> then

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
can use science to send stuff and then

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.049 
can use science to send stuff and then
our<00:00:36.600> mailbox<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.920> GUI<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.610> if<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.790> send

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
our mailbox is the GUI so if we send

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.700 
our mailbox is the GUI so if we send
something<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.480> player<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:40.200> open<00:00:40.590> our

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
mailbox which is the GUI we can grab

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.450

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
and it kind of leaves a mystery but I'm
