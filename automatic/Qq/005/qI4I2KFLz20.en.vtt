00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
as often as I remember typically 2 to 3

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.649 
as often as I remember typically 2 to 3
times<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.350> day<00:01:31.729> depending<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:33.030> how<00:01:33.150> high<00:01:33.360> was

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.210 
more effectively when taken in
conjunction<00:04:44.919> with<00:04:46.500> what<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.650> fenugreek<00:04:47.919> or

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
conjunction with what the fenugreek or

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.460 
conjunction with what the fenugreek or
they<00:04:48.340> go<00:04:48.490> through<00:04:48.789> even<00:04:49.360> though<00:04:49.659> they<00:04:49.840> contain

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
they go through even though they contain

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.159 
they go through even though they contain
both<00:04:50.820> fenugreek<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.060> go<00:04:52.240> through<00:04:52.479> typically

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
both fenugreek and go through typically

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.250 
both fenugreek and go through typically
well<00:04:53.880> the<00:04:54.880> plus<00:04:55.090> contains<00:04:55.570> go<00:04:55.750> through<00:04:56.020> and

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
well the plus contains go through and

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.649 
well the plus contains go through and
the<00:04:56.320> regular<00:04:56.680> doesn't<00:04:57.099> but<00:04:57.729> yeah<00:04:58.150> they<00:04:58.510> work

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
the regular doesn't but yeah they work

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:00.340 
the regular doesn't but yeah they work
better<00:04:58.870> in<00:04:59.139> conjunction<00:04:59.440> with<00:04:59.620> additional

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
better in conjunction with additional

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.690 
better in conjunction with additional
that's<00:05:00.890> the<00:05:01.070> speech<00:05:02.350> um<00:05:03.350> I<00:05:04.690> think<00:05:05.690> that's<00:05:05.990> it

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
that's the speech um I think that's it

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.700 
that's the speech um I think that's it
yeah<00:05:07.700> those<00:05:08.540> are<00:05:08.720> pretty<00:05:08.840> much<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.080> mean<00:05:09.440> the

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
yeah those are pretty much the mean the

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.650 
yeah those are pretty much the mean the
most<00:05:09.860> useful<00:05:10.070> I<00:05:10.490> mean<00:05:10.670> there's<00:05:10.850> also<00:05:11.030> for<00:05:11.540> the

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
most useful I mean there's also for the

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.800 
most useful I mean there's also for the
severe<00:05:11.960> cases<00:05:13.270> Reckling<00:05:14.270> which<00:05:14.630> is

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
severe cases Reckling which is

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.470 
severe cases Reckling which is
prescription<00:05:15.230> only<00:05:15.470> but<00:05:16.250> there's<00:05:16.730> a<00:05:17.150> really

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
prescription only but there's a really

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.050 
prescription only but there's a really
high<00:05:17.870> incidence<00:05:18.770> of<00:05:18.980> depression<00:05:19.370> with<00:05:19.880> it

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
high incidence of depression with it

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.920 
high incidence of depression with it
because<00:05:20.180> of<00:05:20.300> the<00:05:20.510> way<00:05:20.630> it<00:05:20.810> works<00:05:21.080> on<00:05:22.930> the

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
because of the way it works on the

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.600 
because of the way it works on the
receptors<00:05:24.470> in<00:05:24.590> your<00:05:24.620> brain<00:05:24.710> because<00:05:25.280> it<00:05:25.400> can't

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
receptors in your brain because it can't

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.450 
receptors in your brain because it can't
cross<00:05:26.060> the<00:05:26.330> blood-brain<00:05:27.080> barrier<00:05:27.460> and

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
cross the blood-brain barrier and

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.930 
cross the blood-brain barrier and
there's<00:05:28.640> also<00:05:28.820> domperidone<00:05:30.160> which<00:05:31.160> does<00:05:31.700> not

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
there's also domperidone which does not

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.760 
there's also domperidone which does not
cross<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.450> blood-brain<00:05:32.810> barrier<00:05:32.840> so<00:05:33.530> it<00:05:33.560> does

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
cross the blood-brain barrier so it does

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.750 
cross the blood-brain barrier so it does
not<00:05:33.920> have<00:05:34.160> that<00:05:34.310> effect<00:05:34.760> however<00:05:35.570> it<00:05:36.140> is<00:05:36.290> also

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
not have that effect however it is also

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.690 
not have that effect however it is also
not<00:05:38.320> approved<00:05:39.320> for<00:05:39.770> prescription<00:05:40.340> for
