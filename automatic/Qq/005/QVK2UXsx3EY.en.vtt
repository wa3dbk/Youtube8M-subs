00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.360
 cookies 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.470
 the ingredients are a package of 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:23.680
 biscuits integrated bitti alfano 100 g of 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:29.680
 soft butter and a man a nicoletta vi 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:31.800
 will make veiled towards prepared in the 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:39.480
 pie dish 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:43.239
 well now towards the soft butter and started 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.909
 to assemble it with flour by crushing 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.830
 by the nervous you imagine yourself doing one 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:48.809
 then the butter should be shortened 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.440
 mix well 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:58.030
 so obviously began who has one 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:01.690
 planetary knows that must use of 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.970
 leaf hook when I see that butter 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.049
 and it was well assembled to the flour 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.060
 that will be the time to add 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:14.680
 the man, however, is really a 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:26.140
 minute 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:30.940
 the dough ok now I add place e 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.540
 I continue to set the butter does not have ha 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.150
 melted 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.630
 no it should not be merged engineer in biscuits 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.240
 in the pastry it is preferable to use it 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.420
 in the case of classical pastry yes 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.860
 use very cold butter in this 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:53.230
 case of cookies we use it 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.570
 soft not melted and these biscuits a 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.320
 unlike the classic pastry not 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.500
 they need to rest in 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.090
 refrigerator before being formed e 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.050
 this is the peculiarity of these 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.479
 biscuits are made directly with 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.270
 hands without the use of a rolling pin or 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:19.300
 Other molds are therefore tools 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:26.400
 very fast realized is forming the 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.400
 ball a girl on average about kind 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.680
 at this point the dough is ready 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.150
 to be formed how long it has 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.950
 employed well and we are ready to train 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.129
 your cookies 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.549
 we take a large amount of dough 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:55.180
 more or less like a walnut we do it 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:57.609
 roll on the palm of your hand e 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.000
 we place a baking pan covered with 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:05.260
 greaseproof paper 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.879
 thanks for the help nadia please do you 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.690
 see how to make them with the drops of 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.780
 chocolate 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.739
 then I add in a bit of dough 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.260
 of the drops the continuous mixture of 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.889
 knead in order to make them but we believed 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.900
 to call well inside and then 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:27.639
 I proceed with in addition to the others he realized the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.760
 my little ball that good for lovers of 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:35.069
 these are really excellent chocolate 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:43.090
 then take the dough balls 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:46.150
 the beauty of these was a little ball 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.250
 cookies is that you don't need to have any 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.930
 special equipment in the house such as 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.610
 you can see we used one 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:59.060
 terrine a fork and nothing else 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:02.110
 we proceed with forming the biscuits there 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.210
 we press a little with a fork 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.060
 just to avoid that lievitino is that 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.730
 become too high and among other things 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:17.329
 they are also very nice because we give 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:21.490
 a nice back but you will have to show how 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:30.320
 we can customize them with almond 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:33.250

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.250
