actually like feeling up to the point

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.280 
actually like feeling up to the point
where<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.280> answer<00:02:21.690> toppling<00:02:22.690> on<00:02:22.810> top<00:02:23.020> of<00:02:23.170> each

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
where the answer toppling on top of each

00:02:23.290 --> 00:03:07.290 
where the answer toppling on top of each
other

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.990

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.860 
actually like starting to drowned just
from<00:03:49.010> each<00:03:49.100> other's<00:03:49.340> weight<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:50.510> pictures

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
from each other's weight the pictures

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.770 
from each other's weight the pictures
must<00:03:51.020> be<00:03:51.200> full<00:03:52.270> hundreds<00:03:53.270> and<00:03:53.420> hundreds<00:03:53.690> of

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
must be full hundreds and hundreds of

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.620 
must be full hundreds and hundreds of
ants<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:55.280> entire<00:03:55.520> plant<00:03:55.820> is<00:03:56.030> still<00:03:56.240> covered

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
ants the entire plant is still covered

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:03.850 
ants the entire plant is still covered
in<00:03:56.720> them<00:04:01.840> just<00:04:02.840> shows<00:04:03.080> how<00:04:03.260> efficient<00:04:03.740> of

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
in them just shows how efficient of

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:26.409 
in them just shows how efficient of
predator<00:04:04.370> these<00:04:04.580> plants<00:04:04.940> actually<00:04:05.240> are

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.090 

it's<00:04:27.419> just<00:04:27.630> simply<00:04:27.960> so<00:04:28.289> full<00:04:28.560> it's<00:04:28.770> not<00:04:28.889> even

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
it's just simply so full it's not even

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.460 
it's just simply so full it's not even
an<00:04:29.190> efficient<00:04:29.520> trap<00:04:29.699> anymore<00:04:30.440> they're<00:04:31.440> just

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
an efficient trap anymore they're just

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:42.409 
an efficient trap anymore they're just
Danny<00:04:32.009> on<00:04:32.220> top<00:04:32.400> of<00:04:32.550> each<00:04:32.669> other<00:04:41.180> they<00:04:42.180> keep

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
Danny on top of each other they keep

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:57.500 
Danny on top of each other they keep
falling<00:04:42.810> in<00:04:42.960> though<00:04:56.000> anyways<00:04:57.000> guys<00:04:57.210> I<00:04:57.449> think

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
falling in though anyways guys I think

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.990 
falling in though anyways guys I think
um<00:04:59.180> we<00:05:00.180> have<00:05:00.330> a<00:05:00.360> clear<00:05:00.690> winner<00:05:00.720> here<00:05:01.289> I<00:05:02.000> think

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
um we have a clear winner here I think

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.990 
um we have a clear winner here I think
is<00:05:03.120> really<00:05:03.330> a<00:05:03.449> tie<00:05:03.720> actually<00:05:04.350> I<00:05:04.669> would<00:05:05.669> say<00:05:05.699> the

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
is really a tie actually I would say the

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.240 
is really a tie actually I would say the
pitcher<00:05:06.330> plant<00:05:06.449> is<00:05:06.720> um<00:05:06.990> is<00:05:07.229> completely<00:05:08.070> eaten

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
pitcher plant is um is completely eaten

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.629 
pitcher plant is um is completely eaten
its<00:05:08.460> fill<00:05:08.810> in<00:05:09.810> about<00:05:10.020> ten<00:05:10.260> minutes<00:05:10.289> or<00:05:10.680> so<00:05:10.710> but

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
its fill in about ten minutes or so but

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.520 
its fill in about ten minutes or so but
the<00:05:11.760> ants<00:05:12.060> just<00:05:12.240> keep<00:05:12.389> coming<00:05:12.750> and<00:05:12.780> coming<00:05:13.199> and

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
the ants just keep coming and coming and

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.150 
the ants just keep coming and coming and
coming<00:05:14.300> so<00:05:15.300> I<00:05:15.630> hope<00:05:16.560> you<00:05:16.680> enjoyed<00:05:17.009> this

curious<00:05:17.669> a<00:05:17.789> little<00:05:18.000> experiment<00:05:18.509> as<00:05:18.660> much<00:05:18.810> as<00:05:18.960> I

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
curious a little experiment as much as I

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.460 
curious a little experiment as much as I
did<00:05:19.259> kind<00:05:20.099> of<00:05:20.220> fun<00:05:20.870> kind<00:05:21.870> of<00:05:21.930> interesting<00:05:22.349> to

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
did kind of fun kind of interesting to

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.650 
did kind of fun kind of interesting to

you<00:05:31.410> know<00:05:31.470> just<00:05:31.860> hang<00:05:31.979> the<00:05:32.099> plant<00:05:32.310> in<00:05:32.490> a

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
you know just hang the plant in a

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.399 
you know just hang the plant in a
neighboring<00:05:33.479> tree<00:05:33.780> I<00:05:33.810> got<00:05:34.020> to<00:05:34.110> figure<00:05:34.260> out<00:05:34.320> how

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
neighboring tree I got to figure out how

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:36.140 
neighboring tree I got to figure out how
to<00:05:34.440> get<00:05:34.620> all<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:34.770> ants<00:05:34.979> off<00:05:35.099> of<00:05:35.280> it<00:05:35.400> I<00:05:35.550> think

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
to get all the ants off of it I think

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.700 
to get all the ants off of it I think
the<00:05:36.270> best<00:05:36.300> way<00:05:36.599> is<00:05:36.750> just<00:05:36.780> give<00:05:37.289> it<00:05:37.409> a<00:05:37.470> spray

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
the best way is just give it a spray

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.890 
the best way is just give it a spray
with<00:05:37.740> water<00:05:37.919> and<00:05:38.849> to<00:05:39.300> let<00:05:39.419> the<00:05:39.570> pitchers

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
with water and to let the pitchers

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.450 
with water and to let the pitchers
continue<00:05:40.409> to<00:05:40.530> do<00:05:40.620> their<00:05:40.800> thing<00:05:40.979> and<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.190> ants

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
continue to do their thing and the ants

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.040 
continue to do their thing and the ants
will<00:05:41.610> fall<00:05:41.940> in<00:05:42.150> hopefully<00:05:44.659> and<00:05:45.659> there<00:05:45.900> is<00:05:46.020> a

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
will fall in hopefully and there is a

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.149 
will fall in hopefully and there is a
final<00:05:46.620> shot<00:05:46.889> of<00:05:47.099> how<00:05:47.280> full<00:05:47.669> it<00:05:47.820> actually<00:05:48.180> got

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
final shot of how full it actually got

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:51.680 
final shot of how full it actually got
Wow<00:05:50.159> there's<00:05:50.580> they're<00:05:50.940> crawling<00:05:51.180> back<00:05:51.479> out

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
Wow there's they're crawling back out

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.560 
Wow there's they're crawling back out
it's<00:05:51.870> so<00:05:51.990> full<00:05:52.699> it's<00:05:53.699> full<00:05:54.030> to<00:05:54.240> the<00:05:54.270> brim<00:05:54.360> with

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
it's so full it's full to the brim with

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.920 
it's so full it's full to the brim with
ants

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.470 

it's<00:06:00.930> just<00:06:01.200> amazing
