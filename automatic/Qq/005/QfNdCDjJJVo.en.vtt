00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.380
 why so necessary although he did not hit with his hand 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:29.450
 could smell like that rebel more 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.219
 just kapets yes this ciroc will 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.229
 writing so this is not an advertisement because 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:37.969
 that the rhythm of such a server is at least 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:41.119
 stupid here you can meet 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:43.450
 evgehu and all hev all all all all all all 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.119
 all in general can be found 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.969
 and where, after all, do not merge because he 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.880
 plays on others angry at it spleen 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.280
 such nila is thicker and 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.340
 I chose because they are the most chalky 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.380
 both in the second 100 that they are stupidly stupid in 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.539

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.890

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:08.429
