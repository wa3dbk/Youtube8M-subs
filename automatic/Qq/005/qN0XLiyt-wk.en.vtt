00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
you were going to use your peak flow

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.470 
you were going to use your peak flow
meter<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.399> would<00:00:41.550> clear<00:00:41.760> your<00:00:41.790> mouth<00:00:42.090> make

meter you would clear your mouth make

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.880 
meter you would clear your mouth make
sure<00:00:42.510> there's<00:00:42.870> nothing<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.379> your<00:00:43.410> mouth<00:00:43.649> and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
sure there's nothing in your mouth and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.220 
sure there's nothing in your mouth and
you<00:00:44.489> would<00:00:44.610> exhale<00:00:45.059> all<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.420> air<00:00:45.660> out<00:00:45.809> as

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
you would exhale all the air out as

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.869 
you would exhale all the air out as
possibly<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.890> much<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.370> could<00:00:47.579> without

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
possibly as much as you could without

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.060 
possibly as much as you could without
using<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.480> peak<00:00:48.660> flow<00:00:48.870> meter<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.350> then<00:00:49.950> you

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
using the peak flow meter and then you

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.520 
using the peak flow meter and then you
would<00:00:50.219> inhale<00:00:50.640> deeply<00:00:51.149> as<00:00:51.449> much<00:00:52.050> air<00:00:52.289> as<00:00:52.320> you

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
would inhale deeply as much air as you

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.350 
would inhale deeply as much air as you
can<00:00:52.829> bring<00:00:53.070> into<00:00:53.430> your<00:00:53.460> eight<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:54.000> your<00:00:54.180> lungs

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
can bring into your eight to your lungs

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.510 
can bring into your eight to your lungs
and<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:55.079> blow<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.500> all<00:00:55.770> out<00:00:55.800> through<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
and you blow it all out through the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.000 
and you blow it all out through the
mouth<00:00:57.260> piece<00:00:58.260> which<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> little<00:00:58.800> white

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
mouth piece which is a little white

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.340 
mouth piece which is a little white
thing<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.489> end<00:00:59.520> here<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:01.199> would

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
thing on the end here and you would

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.340 
thing on the end here and you would
forcefully<00:01:02.070> exhale<00:01:02.670> all<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.960> air<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.320> your

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
forcefully exhale all of the air in your

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.260 
forcefully exhale all of the air in your
lungs<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.979> would<00:01:05.129> chart<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.670> reading<00:01:06.119> this

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
lungs you would chart this reading this

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.510 
lungs you would chart this reading this
would<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.600> your<00:01:06.630> initial<00:01:07.229> baseline<00:01:07.619> this

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
would be your initial baseline this

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.030 
would be your initial baseline this
would<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.600> baseline<00:01:10.380> where<00:01:10.710> you're<00:01:10.890> not

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
would be the baseline where you're not

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.270 
would be the baseline where you're not
having<00:01:11.400> any<00:01:11.549> asthma<00:01:12.450> symptoms<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.100> would

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
having any asthma symptoms but it would

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.170 
having any asthma symptoms but it would
be<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.670> day<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.270> normality<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.939> then<00:01:17.939> you

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
be a day of normality to you then you

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.880 
be a day of normality to you then you
would<00:01:18.330> do<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.659> two<00:01:18.900> more<00:01:19.080> times<00:01:19.140> you're<00:01:19.740> not

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
would do this two more times you're not

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.609 
would do this two more times you're not
taking<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.490> reading<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.119> an<00:01:21.240> average<00:01:21.450> but<00:01:22.259> you

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
taking a reading of an average but you

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.240 
taking a reading of an average but you
are<00:01:23.330> recording<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.960> highest<00:01:25.530> number<00:01:26.009> that

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
are recording the highest number that

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.010 
are recording the highest number that
you<00:01:26.369> can<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.090> you're<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:27.630> trying<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
you can get and you're just trying to

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.380 
you can get and you're just trying to
get<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> very<00:01:28.409> best<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:29.009> your<00:01:29.670> personal<00:01:30.150> best

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
get the very best of your personal best

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.020 
get the very best of your personal best
you<00:01:30.960> record<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.100> then<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.880> would

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
you record this and then you would

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.149 
you record this and then you would
assess<00:01:33.420> yourself<00:01:33.799> according<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.040> the
