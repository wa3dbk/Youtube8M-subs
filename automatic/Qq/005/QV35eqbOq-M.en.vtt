00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 so hoarding you are found guilty of 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.410
 that you don't give skype to your subscribers 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:12.500
 you have one last chance to think it over 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.500
 give skype no guilty 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.829
 greet gentlemen with you to shakira 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.649
 today we are going to execute people well, as 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.649
 will you be when you download this card 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.160
 I'll just say a couple of features of this. 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.500
 kart 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.300
 so as not to spoil your impression of food 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.040
 before you download this card 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.519
 make sure you are not nervous 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.589
 Well, let's get started in general what of yourself 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.079
 represents this card contains map 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.409
 a bunch of different devices and arrange for that 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.750
 just to kill the device 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.990
 for this quite diverse starting 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.869
 from ordinary ending so that we can 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.600
 just throw off the tall right in 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.850
 mixer oh well you that mom is bad 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.890
 before bad let's give a friend for example 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.020
 what can there do besides 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.899
 kill on actually something more then 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.770
 nothing except that we can come down as 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:29.170
 would down that is for textures and here we are 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.909
 we can run to build and so on in 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.550
 Generally if you understand everything we can 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.470
 insert here walk and kill well everything 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.750
 you understand everything 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.520
 Accordingly, much more regret not where 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.130
 it will not be displayed that is what 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.899
 we built it down below and here nowhere is it 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.720
 will not say and yet certainly worth 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.910
 note that the height of this map is just 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.550
 is huge you just peer so that 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.319
 build what you want and yes yes yes I almost 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.420
 don't forget to download one 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.810
 which allows you to tear off 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.330
 limbs to add more 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.729
 realism and that's all gentlemen all 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.110
 the links will be in the description under the video as well 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.759

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.060
 standing on the roof and wall 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.260
 look at the cat's life 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.260

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:31.200

 rain
