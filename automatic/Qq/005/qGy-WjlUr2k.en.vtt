00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
Carson and we did a laser also which was

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.170 
Carson and we did a laser also which was
phenomenal<00:00:33.449> to<00:00:33.540> get<00:00:33.660> rid<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.790> sun<00:00:35.790> damage

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
phenomenal to get rid of the sun damage

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.689 
phenomenal to get rid of the sun damage
and<00:00:36.769> rejuvenation<00:00:37.769> which<00:00:38.070> has<00:00:38.250> helped<00:00:38.489> pick

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
and rejuvenation which has helped pick

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.490 
and rejuvenation which has helped pick
up<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.090> lot<00:00:39.269> of<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.540> elasticity<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.379> skin

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
up a lot of the elasticity in the skin

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.140 
up a lot of the elasticity in the skin
and<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.879> had<00:00:42.059> really<00:00:42.330> deep<00:00:42.510> circles<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:44.150> depth

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
and I had really deep circles and depth

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.810 
and I had really deep circles and depth
underneath<00:00:45.600> my<00:00:45.780> eyes<00:00:46.019> so<00:00:46.920> dr.<00:00:47.430> Carson

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
underneath my eyes so dr. Carson

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.090 
underneath my eyes so dr. Carson
suggested<00:00:48.390> doing<00:00:48.510> fillers<00:00:49.019> which<00:00:49.350> have

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
suggested doing fillers which have

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.009 
suggested doing fillers which have
helped<00:00:50.430> tremendously<00:00:50.610> with<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.510> darkness<00:00:51.780> of

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
helped tremendously with the darkness of

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.439 
helped tremendously with the darkness of
the<00:00:52.140> circles<00:00:52.530> under<00:00:52.739> my<00:00:52.769> eyes<00:00:53.330> freshened<00:00:54.330> up

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the circles under my eyes freshened up

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.140 
the circles under my eyes freshened up
my<00:00:55.170> face<00:00:55.350> quite<00:00:55.619> a<00:00:55.650> bit<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.190> didn't<00:00:56.970> want<00:00:57.119> to

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
my face quite a bit I didn't want to

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.609 
my face quite a bit I didn't want to
look<00:00:57.239> like<00:00:57.299> I'd<00:00:57.570> gone<00:00:57.720> through<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:58.019> wind<00:00:58.440> tunnel

00:00:58.609 --> 00:00:58.619 
look like I'd gone through a wind tunnel

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:02.329 
look like I'd gone through a wind tunnel
I<00:00:58.979> want<00:00:59.610> it<00:00:59.729> to<00:00:59.820> be<00:00:59.940> very<00:01:00.030> natural<00:01:00.979> the<00:01:01.979> healing

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
I want it to be very natural the healing

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.359 
I want it to be very natural the healing
time<00:01:02.549> was<00:01:03.119> very<00:01:03.510> minimal<00:01:04.229> especially<00:01:05.070> with

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
time was very minimal especially with

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.330 
time was very minimal especially with
the<00:01:05.519> dot<00:01:05.700> laser<00:01:05.940> and<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:10.340> continual

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the dot laser and the continual

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.150 
the dot laser and the continual
continuation<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:13.229> freshness<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.980> just

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
continuation of the freshness it just

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
continuation of the freshness it just
really<00:01:14.430> refreshed<00:01:15.350> my<00:01:16.350> face<00:01:17.180> everybody

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
really refreshed my face everybody

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.750 
really refreshed my face everybody
thought<00:01:18.480> I<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.900> took<00:01:19.140> looked<00:01:19.890> wonderful<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
thought I just took looked wonderful and

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.960 
thought I just took looked wonderful and
couldn't<00:01:21.090> identify<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.740> drastic<00:01:23.430> change<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:23.940> a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
couldn't identify a drastic change but a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.240 
couldn't identify a drastic change but a
very<00:01:24.210> refreshing<00:01:24.600> change<00:01:24.980> probably<00:01:25.980> took<00:01:26.190> a

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
very refreshing change probably took a

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.310 
very refreshing change probably took a
good<00:01:26.550> 10<00:01:26.790> years<00:01:26.820> off<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.570> don't<00:01:28.050> look<00:01:28.170> it's

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
so last time we did a little bit of

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.770 
so last time we did a little bit of
filler<00:01:43.980> underneath<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.909> eye<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.510> cheek

filler underneath the eye and the cheek
complex<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.880> like<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.060> had<00:01:48.150> mentioned<00:01:48.600> earlier

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
complex and like I had mentioned earlier

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.350 
complex and like I had mentioned earlier
we<00:01:49.260> all<00:01:49.409> have<00:01:49.620> some<00:01:49.890> side<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.280> side<00:01:50.430> asymmetry

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
we all have some side to side asymmetry

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.050 
we all have some side to side asymmetry
and<00:01:51.680> again<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:52.860> try<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.250> correct<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.700> as<00:01:53.850> much

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
and again we try and correct it as much

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.820 
and again we try and correct it as much
as<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:54.810> sometimes<00:01:55.350> they're<00:01:55.590> still

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
as we can but sometimes they're still

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.800 
as we can but sometimes they're still
residual<00:01:56.370> asymmetry<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.300> you've<00:01:57.450> noticed

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
residual asymmetry and you've noticed

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.600 
residual asymmetry and you've noticed
still<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> little<00:01:58.380> bit<00:01:58.620> of<00:01:58.710> flatness<00:01:59.220> on<00:01:59.400> this

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
still a little bit of flatness on this

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.760 
still a little bit of flatness on this
side<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.970> that<00:02:00.120> correct<00:02:00.540> by<00:02:00.930> Rhonda

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
side is that correct by Rhonda

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.090 
side is that correct by Rhonda

00:04:48.859 --> 00:04:48.869 
hydroxyapatite which is part of bone but

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:52.689 
hydroxyapatite which is part of bone but
the<00:04:49.349> area<00:04:49.559> under<00:04:50.039> the<00:04:50.189> eye<00:04:50.219> is<00:04:50.879> so<00:04:51.719> delicate
