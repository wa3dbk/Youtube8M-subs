in the store is part of this pack and

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.779 
in the store is part of this pack and

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.770 
piece and just in terms of articulation
I<00:04:46.290> think<00:04:46.620> it's<00:04:46.770> great<00:04:47.370> hopefully<00:04:48.210> plausible

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
I think it's great hopefully plausible

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.730 
I think it's great hopefully plausible
there's<00:04:49.530> no<00:04:50.340> real<00:04:50.640> downsides<00:04:51.540> I<00:04:51.810> find<00:04:52.140> first

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740
