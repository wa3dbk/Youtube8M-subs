hammer<00:01:49.330> nails<00:01:49.800> knife<00:01:50.800> to<00:01:51.070> cut<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.310> low<00:01:51.940> slope

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
hammer nails knife to cut the low slope

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.870 
hammer nails knife to cut the low slope
well<00:01:53.290> it's<00:01:53.410> clean<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.040> it's<00:01:54.250> quick<00:01:54.550> and<00:01:54.760> it's

well it's clean and it's quick and it's

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.520 
well it's clean and it's quick and it's
easy<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.510> that<00:01:55.600> makes<00:01:55.840> a<00:01:55.960> lot<00:01:56.080> of<00:01:56.140> sense<00:01:56.440> when

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
working I can see that we've already

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.950 
working I can see that we've already
rolled<00:02:00.670> out<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.030> low<00:02:01.210> slope<00:02:01.510> and<00:02:01.690> cut<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:01.930> to

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
rolled out the low slope and cut it to

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.660 
rolled out the low slope and cut it to
measure<00:02:02.260> so<00:02:02.800> where<00:02:02.950> do<00:02:03.010> we<00:02:03.070> go<00:02:03.220> from<00:02:03.340> here

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
measure so where do we go from here

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.460 
measure so where do we go from here
well<00:02:04.000> what<00:02:04.180> we<00:02:04.300> do<00:02:04.480> now<00:02:04.720> is<00:02:04.990> fold<00:02:05.410> it<00:02:05.560> back

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.180 

we<00:02:09.130> apply<00:02:09.760> a<00:02:09.790> rubberized<00:02:10.690> sealant<00:02:11.260> along<00:02:12.040> the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
we apply a rubberized sealant along the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.240 
we apply a rubberized sealant along the
metal<00:02:12.370> drip<00:02:12.700> edge<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:14.470> what<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.620> do<00:02:14.740> is<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.070> take

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
metal drip edge so what I do is I take

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.040 
metal drip edge so what I do is I take
the<00:02:15.430> release<00:02:15.640> paper<00:02:18.210> kind<00:02:19.210> of<00:02:19.300> run<00:02:19.480> with<00:02:19.660> it

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
the release paper kind of run with it

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.400 
the release paper kind of run with it
now<00:02:20.560> what<00:02:20.770> we<00:02:20.890> do<00:02:21.070> is<00:02:21.100> we<00:02:21.370> ease<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:21.760> into<00:02:21.910> place

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
now what we do is we ease it into place

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.570 
now what we do is we ease it into place
you<00:02:23.410> don't<00:02:23.470> want<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.740> pick<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.070> up<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.370> let<00:02:24.460> it

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
you don't want to pick it up and let it

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.970 
you don't want to pick it up and let it
stick<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:25.000> itself<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:25.750> we<00:02:26.350> kind<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.590> just<00:02:26.740> roll

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
stick to itself so we kind of just roll

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.620 
stick to itself so we kind of just roll
it<00:02:27.190> into<00:02:27.340> place<00:02:28.080> now<00:02:29.080> we<00:02:29.200> apply<00:02:29.320> some<00:02:29.740> pressure

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
it into place now we apply some pressure

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.050 
it into place now we apply some pressure
just<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.750> make<00:02:31.930> sure<00:02:31.960> it's<00:02:32.290> down<00:02:32.820> or<00:02:33.820> we<00:02:33.910> could

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
just to make sure it's down or we could

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.330 
just to make sure it's down or we could
take<00:02:34.210> a<00:02:34.240> roller<00:02:34.600> like<00:02:34.990> a<00:02:35.200> countertop<00:02:35.890> kind<00:02:36.220> of

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
take a roller like a countertop kind of

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.610 
take a roller like a countertop kind of
roller<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:37.690> always<00:02:37.900> want<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.110> be<00:02:38.200> careful

Pete that looks pretty quick and easy
and<00:04:06.330> I<00:04:06.390> noticed<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:06.900> when<00:04:06.990> you<00:04:07.020> peel<00:04:07.320> back

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
and I noticed that when you peel back

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.960 
and I noticed that when you peel back
that<00:04:07.770> zip<00:04:08.040> strip<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.490> put<00:04:08.640> these<00:04:08.730> two

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
that zip strip and put these two

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.160 
that zip strip and put these two
together<00:04:09.120> that's<00:04:09.510> sticky<00:04:09.870> too<00:04:09.960> sticky

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
together that's sticky too sticky

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.530 
together that's sticky too sticky
contact<00:04:10.770> is<00:04:10.920> one<00:04:11.070> strong<00:04:11.340> hold<00:04:11.640> that's<00:04:12.360> right

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
contact is one strong hold that's right

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.600 
contact is one strong hold that's right
it's<00:04:12.720> watertight<00:04:13.020> right<00:04:13.440> away<00:04:13.680> tell<00:04:14.340> me<00:04:14.370> why<00:04:14.580> I

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
it's watertight right away tell me why I

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.640 
it's watertight right away tell me why I
cut<00:04:14.880> this<00:04:15.030> at<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.240> 45<00:04:15.750> degree<00:04:15.780> angle

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
cut this at a 45 degree angle

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.800 
cut this at a 45 degree angle
well<00:04:17.070> when<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.519> next<00:04:17.700> course<00:04:18.000> goes<00:04:18.239> over<00:04:18.570> top

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
well when the next course goes over top

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.750 
well when the next course goes over top
it<00:04:19.049> just<00:04:19.080> allows<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.769> lay<00:04:20.040> flatter<00:04:20.400> and

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
it just allows it to lay flatter and

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.940 
it just allows it to lay flatter and
prevent<00:04:21.570> snow<00:04:21.840> or<00:04:21.989> ice<00:04:22.019> from<00:04:22.410> backing<00:04:22.620> up

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
prevent snow or ice from backing up

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.220 
prevent snow or ice from backing up
that's<00:04:23.520> great<00:04:23.700> you<00:04:24.120> know<00:04:24.210> low<00:04:24.750> slope<00:04:25.020> can<00:04:25.170> be

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
that's great you know low slope can be

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.410 
that's great you know low slope can be
used<00:04:25.470> over<00:04:25.620> plywood<00:04:26.220> oriented<00:04:27.030> strand<00:04:27.330> board

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
used over plywood oriented strand board

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.260 
used over plywood oriented strand board
really<00:04:28.050> any<00:04:28.200> Nayla<00:04:28.560> Ballou<00:04:29.160> asphalt<00:04:29.760> surface
