00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
the Sun to his back so I could kind of

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.280 
the Sun to his back so I could kind of
get<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:09.550> Sun<00:04:09.910> acting<00:04:10.510> as<00:04:10.630> a<00:04:10.660> rim<00:04:10.870> light<00:04:10.900> and

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
get the Sun acting as a rim light and

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
several tests with different lighting

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.660 
several tests with different lighting
setups<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:29.200> it<00:04:29.350> ultimately<00:04:29.830> was<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.460> light

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670

that<00:04:30.850> I<00:04:30.910> liked<00:04:31.240> that<00:04:32.020> I<00:04:32.080> wanted<00:04:32.410> most<00:04:32.620> but<00:04:32.950> in

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
that I liked that I wanted most but in

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.790 
that I liked that I wanted most but in
addition<00:04:33.790> it<00:04:34.270> travels<00:04:34.930> very<00:04:35.110> easily<00:04:35.440> it's

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
addition it travels very easily it's

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.410 
addition it travels very easily it's
very<00:04:35.860> light<00:04:36.250> it's<00:04:36.490> very<00:04:36.640> compact<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:37.330> the

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
very light it's very compact and the

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.110 
very light it's very compact and the
battery<00:04:37.720> pulls<00:04:38.050> out<00:04:38.230> really<00:04:38.620> simply<00:04:39.130> so<00:04:40.090> that

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
battery pulls out really simply so that

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.910 
battery pulls out really simply so that
you<00:04:40.300> can<00:04:40.450> pop<00:04:40.810> it<00:04:40.960> in<00:04:41.050> your<00:04:41.080> camera<00:04:41.470> bag<00:04:41.500> and

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
you can pop it in your camera bag and

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.580 
you can pop it in your camera bag and
put<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.190> unit<00:04:42.550> under<00:04:42.790> in<00:04:43.420> a<00:04:43.540> checked<00:04:43.780> bag<00:04:43.990> but

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
put the unit under in a checked bag but

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.140 
put the unit under in a checked bag but
then<00:04:44.680> you'd<00:04:44.800> also<00:04:44.920> always<00:04:45.280> have<00:04:45.790> the<00:04:45.970> battery

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
then you'd also always have the battery

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.270 
then you'd also always have the battery
with<00:04:46.450> you<00:04:46.630> in<00:04:46.930> your<00:04:47.020> camera<00:04:47.350> bag<00:04:47.380> according<00:04:48.250> to
