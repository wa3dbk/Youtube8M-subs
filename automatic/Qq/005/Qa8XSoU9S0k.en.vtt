00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:13.040
 life time of a reflex camera 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.620
 reflex cameras 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.930
 analogous or digital depend on the good 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.310
 shutter operation to be 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.500
 in working condition 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.610
 properly 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.740
 what is the shutter is a device 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.480
 mechanical camera by the 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.059
 that the exposure time is controlled 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.110
 in the light of the movie or sensor in the 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.570
 case of digital cameras 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.350
 the shutter and together the camera 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.350
 It has a lifetime 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.750
 the answer is yes to be a device 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.940
 mechanical your life time depends 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.339
 directly from many factors such as 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.159
 are quality materials 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.710
 precision manufacturing of the settings of the 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.140
 mechanism a climate maintenance and 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.449
 external agents to which the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.810
 device as well as time and 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.400
 frequency of use 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.790
 then my camera has the number 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.120
 shooting limit 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.460
 the answer is not the manufacturers of 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.590
 cameras do not offer accurate data about 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.050
 the number of shots corresponding to 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.210
 life time of a shutter in 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.760
 some high- end models offer a 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.950
 average number obtained by means of 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.020
 laboratory tests performed in 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.000
 controlled environments under conditions 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.340
 ideals 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.420
 what is the average number of shots 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.880
 from a camera 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.710
 there is such a wide range of brands 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.259
 and camera models would be almost 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.630
 impossible to know however there is data 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.670
 generated by the same users as 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.280
 serve as a reference to know the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.110
 quality of a specific model the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.270
 average numbers in the most models 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.090
 common medium and high- end low 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.580
 they range between 100,000 and 400 thousand 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.789
 shots or pages like skiing 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.470
 king.com have generated this type of foundation 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.630
 of life time data from a 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.670
 shutter based on the experience of 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.190
 the users 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.830
 what is the use of knowing then how many 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.960
 shooting has my camera 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.930
 the number is important for several 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.000
 reasons if you bought your new camera 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.680
 this data helps you estimate the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.560
 lifetime in relation to 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.990
 statistics on the other hand if you're going to 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.880
 acquire a second-hand equipment this 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.850
 number can give you an idea of â€‹â€‹how much 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.190
 or the little that has been used fits 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.620
 mention that this data does not justify the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.470
 I do not deal with the physical and operative state 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.900
 of the rest of the team components 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.000
 and finally you can also use this 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.260
 data as a means of diagnosis for 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.870
 relate some type of failures 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.730
 how can I know how many shots it takes 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.099
 my camera 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.069
 unfortunately there is no universal method 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.530
 but fortunately there are several 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.720
 methods and programs that help us 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.450
 find out this data according to the brand of 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.860
 team 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.230
 then I can shoot without 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.409
 worries 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.180
 the answer is yes for that I show you 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.760
 the following table where you can 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.180
 observe how many shots you would have to 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.920
 do every day during the 365 days of 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.950
 year to get to the average number 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.530
 estimated in one year this number is in 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.870
 really crazy you would need 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.239
 dedicate to make timelapse all the 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.180
 days to approach you in a way 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.400
 worrying 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.650
 in the following table I show you a 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.510
 approximate life time in relation 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.180
 to the average numbers of those that we have 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.939
 been speaking in the first column 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.010
 We show the number of weeks per year in 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.200
 the second column we have placed a 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.870
 estimated number of shots per week 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.359
 in the third column the resultant 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.549
 number of shots per year in the fourth 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.739
 column we put an average number of 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.049
 shot taking as reference a 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:02.319
 Mid-range or low-range camera that oscillate 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.720
 the 150,000 shots and lastly in the 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.639
 fifth column we can see an estimated 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.760
 in years of our life time 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:11.640
 shutter 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.890
 so being objective we can give 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.930
 mind that the average life time is 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.049
 very acceptable in conditions of use 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.010
 let's say traditional or common 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.560
 remember that it is only a time 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.389
 estimated since if we keep our 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.370
 equipment in perfect condition its 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.160
 Life time can be much greater 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.530
 as additional information it is good to know that 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.630
 the number of people who have had to 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.880
 change a shutter or camera by 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.880
 Shutter failure is statistically 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.650
 very low generally the equipments are 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.470
 replaced earlier by failures 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.870
 electronic physical damage or simply 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.420
 because the user decided to buy another 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.760
 newer and better performance 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.190
 if you want to know how many shots 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.010
 has your camera I recommend you see 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.290
 my video with that theme in the description 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.850
 of the video are the links of the 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.850
