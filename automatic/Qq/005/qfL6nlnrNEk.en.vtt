to hold onto it with everything you've

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.340

got<00:02:06.189> because<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:07.060> fish<00:02:07.270> may<00:02:07.630> start<00:02:07.960> to<00:02:07.990> thrash

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
got because the fish may start to thrash

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.180 
got because the fish may start to thrash
violently<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:10.140> also<00:02:11.140> like<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.500> grab<00:02:11.890> and

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
violently I also like to grab and

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.800 
violently I also like to grab and
control<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.760> lower<00:02:13.000> jaw<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.569> fish

control the lower jaw of the fish

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.710 
control the lower jaw of the fish

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
because even though it is shorter it's

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.199 
because even though it is shorter it's
still<00:02:17.020> very<00:02:17.470> sharp<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.280> dangerous<00:02:18.610> weapon
