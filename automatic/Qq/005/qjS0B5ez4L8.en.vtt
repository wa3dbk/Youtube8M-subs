00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
and this test we're going to cover how

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.879 
and this test we're going to cover how
to<00:00:10.950> clean<00:00:11.879> your<00:00:12.059> PC<00:00:12.480> have<00:00:13.020> some<00:00:13.379> of<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.559> trash

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
that inevitably gets collected over a

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.950 
that inevitably gets collected over a
period<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.640> weeks<00:00:17.940> months<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.480> years<00:00:18.570> of

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
period of weeks months and years of

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.429 
period of weeks months and years of
usage<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:20.609> do<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.000> we're<00:00:21.839> going<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.080> use<00:00:22.259> a

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
usage and to do so we're going to use a

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.640 
usage and to do so we're going to use a
tool<00:00:22.619> called<00:00:22.650> C<00:00:23.609> cleaner<00:00:23.970> if<00:00:24.539> you've<00:00:25.529> already
