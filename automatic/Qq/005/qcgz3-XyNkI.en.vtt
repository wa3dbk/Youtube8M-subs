hey beerus i've had some viewers that

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.700 
hey beerus i've had some viewers that
have<00:00:02.370> asked<00:00:02.639> questions<00:00:03.179> about<00:00:03.710> freewheels

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
have asked questions about freewheels

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.650 
have asked questions about freewheels
cassettes<00:00:05.250> and<00:00:05.609> they<00:00:05.730> convert<00:00:06.150> from<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.480> free

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
cassettes and they convert from a free

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.509 
cassettes and they convert from a free
will<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:06.990> has<00:00:07.140> said<00:00:07.440> that<00:00:07.859> do<00:00:08.010> other<00:00:08.189> things

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
will to has said that do other things

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.480 
will to has said that do other things
and<00:00:09.200> I've<00:00:10.200> had<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.590> you'll<00:00:10.830> try<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.040> explain

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
and I've had to you'll try to explain

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.360 
and I've had to you'll try to explain
through<00:00:11.790> them<00:00:11.940> through<00:00:12.799> messages<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:14.309> know

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
through them through messages you know

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.790 
through them through messages you know
like<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.240> so<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.750> decided<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.109> shoot<00:00:16.740> a

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
like that and so I decided to shoot a

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.710 
like that and so I decided to shoot a
video<00:00:16.920> showing<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.880> differences<00:00:18.300> between<00:00:18.539> a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
video showing the differences between a

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.689 
video showing the differences between a
freewheel<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.439> cassette<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:20.070> mean<00:00:20.520> at<00:00:20.640> a

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
freewheel and a cassette I mean at a

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.090 
freewheel and a cassette I mean at a
glance<00:00:20.939> they<00:00:21.449> look<00:00:21.689> alike<00:00:21.869> they<00:00:22.439> basically<00:00:22.830> do

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
glance they look alike they basically do

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.380 
glance they look alike they basically do
the<00:00:23.220> same<00:00:23.250> thing<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.820> for<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.240> One

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
the same thing that for you in the One

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.029 
the same thing that for you in the One
Direction<00:00:24.420> they<00:00:24.990> catching<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.439> other<00:00:25.619> and

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
Direction they catching the other and

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.700 
Direction they catching the other and
you'll<00:00:26.970> see<00:00:27.090> they<00:00:27.210> drive<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.840> how<00:00:28.529> they

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
you'll see they drive like that how they

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.620 
you'll see they drive like that how they
actually<00:00:28.859> attach<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.580> hubs<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.359> everything

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
actually attach the hubs and everything

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.830 
actually attach the hubs and everything
like<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:31.520> completely<00:00:32.520> different<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.660> so

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
like that is completely different and so

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.240 
like that is completely different and so
I'm<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.050> show<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.200> close-up<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
I'm going to show you close-up the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.970 
I'm going to show you close-up the
differences<00:00:35.730> between<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.360> two<00:00:36.620> between<00:00:37.620> pre

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
differences between the two between pre

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.100 
differences between the two between pre
Welles<00:00:38.190> cassettes<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.820> then<00:00:39.690> maybe<00:00:39.899> they'll

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
Welles cassettes and then maybe they'll

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.590 
Welles cassettes and then maybe they'll
understand<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:41.100> what<00:00:41.790> they<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.390> can't

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
understand like what they can and can't

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.250 
understand like what they can and can't
do<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:43.340> pre<00:00:44.340> wheels<00:00:44.489> cassettes<00:00:45.200> ok<00:00:46.200> so

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
do with pre wheels cassettes ok so

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.970 
do with pre wheels cassettes ok so
here's<00:00:46.680> an<00:00:46.860> example<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.879> freewheel<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.980> it

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
here's an example of a freewheel and it

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.979 
here's an example of a freewheel and it
actually<00:00:50.160> screws<00:00:50.670> onto<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.210> hub<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.690> to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
actually screws onto the hub and to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.619 
actually screws onto the hub and to
remove<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.500> I'm<00:00:52.949> going<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.340> need<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.910> tool<00:00:54.239> and

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
remove it I'm going to need a tool and

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.139 
remove it I'm going to need a tool and
the<00:00:54.809> tools<00:00:55.050> come<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.129> variety<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.940> different

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the tools come in a variety of different

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.380 
the tools come in a variety of different
flavours<00:00:57.780> depending<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.390> manufacturer

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
flavours depending on the manufacturer

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.510 
flavours depending on the manufacturer
of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.809> freewheel<00:01:01.340> this<00:01:02.340> particular

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
of the freewheel this particular

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.299 
of the freewheel this particular
freewheel<00:01:03.030> uses<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.600> tool<00:01:03.840> here<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.070> there's

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
freewheel uses this tool here so there's

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.240 
freewheel uses this tool here so there's
little<00:01:05.489> splines<00:01:05.939> inside<00:01:06.720> here<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.040> tool

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
little splines inside here so the tool

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.160 
little splines inside here so the tool
just<00:01:08.369> fits<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.240> unscrew<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.840> from

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
just fits in and I can unscrew this from

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.560 
just fits in and I can unscrew this from
the<00:01:10.350> hub<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.860> like<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.880> already<00:01:12.420> had

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
the hub just like this I already had

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.850 
the hub just like this I already had
this<00:01:12.720> loosened<00:01:13.080> they<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.290> be<00:01:13.380> very<00:01:13.680> very

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
this loosened they can be very very

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.350 
this loosened they can be very very
tight<00:01:14.280> because<00:01:14.460> when<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.880> actually<00:01:14.970> ride<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
tight because when you actually ride the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.609 
tight because when you actually ride the
bike<00:01:15.479> they<00:01:15.630> actually<00:01:15.840> screw<00:01:16.110> tighter<00:01:16.350> tighter

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
bike they actually screw tighter tighter

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.469 
bike they actually screw tighter tighter
on<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.950> hub<00:01:17.100> already<00:01:17.490> pre<00:01:17.729> loosing<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.210> like

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
on the hub already pre loosing this like

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.539 
on the hub already pre loosing this like
pull<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.810> off<00:01:18.900> easily<00:01:19.170> now<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.250> look<00:01:20.430> at

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
pull it off easily now if you look at

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.760 
pull it off easily now if you look at
the<00:01:20.640> hub<00:01:20.820> here<00:01:21.180> there's<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.810> threaded<00:01:22.140> section

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the hub here there's a threaded section

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.640 
the hub here there's a threaded section
on<00:01:23.100> here<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:24.020> that's<00:01:25.020> where<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> pre<00:01:25.500> well

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
on here and that's where the pre well

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.070 
on here and that's where the pre well
threads<00:01:25.950> onto<00:01:26.130> now<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:27.080> relatively

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
threads onto now this is relatively

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.830 
threads onto now this is relatively
standard<00:01:29.040> there's<00:01:29.880> some<00:01:30.030> slight<00:01:30.240> variations

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
standard there's some slight variations

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.899 
standard there's some slight variations
maybe<00:01:31.170> between<00:01:31.500> English<00:01:31.979> French<00:01:32.729> Italian

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
maybe between English French Italian

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.730 
maybe between English French Italian
type<00:01:33.860> hubs<00:01:34.860> where<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:36.290> diameter<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.619> like

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
type hubs where the diameter of a like

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.399 
type hubs where the diameter of a like
that<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.460> they're<00:01:39.030> close<00:01:39.509> enough<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
that but they're close enough that the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.380 
that but they're close enough that the
free<00:01:40.979> wheels<00:01:41.220> are<00:01:41.640> generally

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
free wheels are generally

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.539 
free wheels are generally
interchangeable<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.189> now<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
interchangeable and so now this the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.280 
interchangeable and so now this the
freewheel<00:01:44.850> itself<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.750> most<00:01:45.899> common

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
freewheel itself and the most common

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.170 
freewheel itself and the most common
sizes<00:01:46.860> are<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.579> 5<00:01:47.850> 6<00:01:48.210> &amp;<00:01:48.390> 7<00:01:48.450> cogs<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.409> here<00:01:50.180> ole

tends<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.630> bikes<00:01:51.840> had<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.229> 5<00:01:52.920> cogs<00:01:53.399> on

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
tends to be bikes had the 5 cogs on

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.870 
tends to be bikes had the 5 cogs on
their<00:01:53.970> newer<00:01:54.570> bikes<00:01:54.750> have<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.229> 7-speed

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
their newer bikes have like the 7-speed

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.429 
their newer bikes have like the 7-speed
free<00:01:56.880> wheels<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.270> here<00:01:57.479> now<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.049> ratcheting

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
free wheels on here now the ratcheting

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.679 
free wheels on here now the ratcheting
mechanism<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:59.040> actually<00:01:59.340> built<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.729> to<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
mechanism is actually built in to the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.170 
mechanism is actually built in to the
freewheel<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.969> spins

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
freewheel so this is like this it spins

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.399 
freewheel so this is like this it spins
in<00:02:03.360> one<00:02:03.390> direction<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:04.020> then<00:02:04.170> kind<00:02:04.320> of

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
in one direction but then kind of

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.569 
in one direction but then kind of
catches<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:04.890> there<00:02:05.040> with<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.219> little<00:02:05.310> Paul's

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
catches in there with the little Paul's

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.670 
catches in there with the little Paul's
in<00:02:05.850> there<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.360> that's<00:02:06.450> all<00:02:06.630> built<00:02:06.810> into<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
in there so that's all built into the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.059 
in there so that's all built into the
freewheel<00:02:08.599> now<00:02:09.599> just<00:02:10.080> because<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.590> stuff<00:02:10.950> in

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
freewheel now just because this stuff in

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.930 
freewheel now just because this stuff in
here<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.550> relatively<00:02:12.000> standard<00:02:12.569> doesn't

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
here is relatively standard doesn't

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.090 
here is relatively standard doesn't
you<00:02:13.060> can<00:02:13.210> just<00:02:13.360> take<00:02:13.510> a<00:02:13.540> five<00:02:13.930> speed<00:02:14.770> freewheel

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
you can just take a five speed freewheel

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.950 
you can just take a five speed freewheel
off<00:02:15.460> and<00:02:15.700> it's<00:02:15.940> all<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.150> seven<00:02:16.480> speed<00:02:16.600> freewheel

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
off and it's all a seven speed freewheel

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.520 
off and it's all a seven speed freewheel
because<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.070> hub<00:02:18.330> diameter<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:20.170> hub<00:02:20.350> width

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
because the hub diameter the hub width

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.680 
because the hub diameter the hub width
is<00:02:20.710> actually<00:02:21.100> different<00:02:21.850> between<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.330> two

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
is actually different between the two

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.340 
is actually different between the two
unlike<00:02:23.500> road<00:02:23.650> bikes<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:24.130> five<00:02:24.430> speed<00:02:25.050> hub<00:02:26.050> is

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
unlike road bikes a five speed hub is

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.960 
unlike road bikes a five speed hub is
going<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.590> be<00:02:26.650> about<00:02:26.770> 120<00:02:27.310> millimeters<00:02:27.760> wide

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
going to be about 120 millimeters wide

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.010 
going to be about 120 millimeters wide
on<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.390> six<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:29.200> seven<00:02:29.560> speed<00:02:30.270> hub<00:02:31.270> it's<00:02:31.840> going

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
on a six and seven speed hub it's going

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.910 
on a six and seven speed hub it's going
to<00:02:32.080> be<00:02:32.170> about<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.320> hundred<00:02:32.410> twenty<00:02:32.800> six

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
to be about a hundred twenty six

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.290 
to be about a hundred twenty six
millimeters<00:02:33.400> wide<00:02:33.640> so<00:02:33.850> if<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.060> try<00:02:34.240> to

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
millimeters wide so if you try to

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.840 
millimeters wide so if you try to
install<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.690> seven<00:02:35.080> speed<00:02:35.170> freewheel<00:02:35.560> in<00:02:36.190> place

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
install a seven speed freewheel in place

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.320 
install a seven speed freewheel in place
of<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.120> five<00:02:37.330> speed<00:02:37.710> freewheel<00:02:39.180> freewheel<00:02:40.180> is

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
of a five speed freewheel freewheel is

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.790 
of a five speed freewheel freewheel is
going<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.600> rub<00:02:40.780> against<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.290> inside<00:02:41.620> of<00:02:41.740> the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
going to rub against the inside of the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.410 
going to rub against the inside of the
frame<00:02:42.010> because<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.430> hub<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:42.850> just<00:02:43.060> not<00:02:43.210> wide

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
frame because the hub is just not wide

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.300 
frame because the hub is just not wide
enough<00:02:44.070> okay

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
enough okay

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.040 
enough okay
here's<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.640> small<00:02:46.090> collection<00:02:46.300> of<00:02:46.750> different

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
here's a small collection of different

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.440 
here's a small collection of different
styles<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.590> free<00:02:47.770> wheels<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.700> identify

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
styles of free wheels so to identify

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.510 
styles of free wheels so to identify
whether<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:49.780> have<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.930> free<00:02:50.140> will<00:02:50.290> or<00:02:50.440> not<00:02:50.590> you

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
whether you have a free will or not you

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.620 
whether you have a free will or not you
kind<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.790> like<00:02:51.880> look<00:02:52.060> down<00:02:52.210> there's<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:52.600> a

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
kind of like look down there's like a

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.020 
kind of like look down there's like a
little<00:02:52.810> recessed<00:02:53.200> area<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.800> so<00:02:54.100> like<00:02:54.310> you

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
little recessed area and so like you

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.090 
little recessed area and so like you
want<00:02:55.210> to<00:02:55.270> see<00:02:55.360> whether<00:02:55.990> there's<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.230> area<00:02:56.860> for

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
want to see whether there's a area for

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.400 
want to see whether there's a area for
the<00:02:57.190> tool<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.460> attach<00:02:57.820> to<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.330> so<00:02:58.960> this<00:02:59.080> is<00:02:59.260> the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
the tool to attach to and so this is the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.960 
the tool to attach to and so this is the
freewheel<00:02:59.800> I<00:02:59.830> took<00:03:00.070> off<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.460> wheel<00:03:00.610> and<00:03:00.640> it's

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
freewheel I took off the wheel and it's

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.720 
freewheel I took off the wheel and it's
got<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.210> splines<00:03:01.540> down<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:02.020> here<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.580> this

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
got the splines down in here and so this

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.070 
got the splines down in here and so this
one<00:03:03.910> it's<00:03:04.030> also<00:03:04.180> got<00:03:04.390> splines<00:03:04.690> are<00:03:04.900> like<00:03:05.050> a

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
one it's also got splines are like a

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.360 
one it's also got splines are like a
smaller<00:03:06.390> smaller<00:03:07.390> splines<00:03:07.720> in<00:03:07.930> there<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:09.250> is

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
smaller smaller splines in there this is

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.790 
smaller smaller splines in there this is
an<00:03:09.430> old<00:03:09.580> French<00:03:10.240> freewheel<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:11.140> so<00:03:11.470> it's<00:03:11.650> got

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
an old French freewheel and so it's got

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.320 
an old French freewheel and so it's got
like<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.010> larger<00:03:12.460> opening<00:03:12.550> there<00:03:12.910> but<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.150> still

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
like a larger opening there but it still

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.570 
like a larger opening there but it still
has<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.570> splines<00:03:13.900> there<00:03:14.250> now<00:03:15.250> this<00:03:15.430> is<00:03:15.520> a

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
has the splines there now this is a

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.190 
has the splines there now this is a
different<00:03:15.880> style<00:03:16.090> see<00:03:16.360> it's<00:03:16.510> got<00:03:16.630> notches

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
different style see it's got notches

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.580 
different style see it's got notches
here<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:17.739> so<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.580> tool<00:03:19.020> like<00:03:20.020> this<00:03:20.260> actually

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
here and so the tool like this actually

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.800 
here and so the tool like this actually
attaches<00:03:21.400> into<00:03:21.670> this<00:03:21.790> notch<00:03:22.030> these<00:03:22.450> notches

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
attaches into this notch these notches

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.340 
attaches into this notch these notches
here<00:03:22.959> to<00:03:23.140> unscrew<00:03:24.100> this<00:03:24.310> from<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:25.020> wheel<00:03:26.020> and

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
here to unscrew this from the wheel and

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.320 
here to unscrew this from the wheel and
then<00:03:26.950> there's<00:03:27.130> also<00:03:27.340> some<00:03:27.820> other<00:03:27.880> ones<00:03:28.180> that

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
then there's also some other ones that

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.910 
then there's also some other ones that
have<00:03:28.480> like<00:03:28.510> four<00:03:29.080> notches<00:03:29.290> in<00:03:29.620> there<00:03:29.739> so<00:03:29.890> a

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
have like four notches in there so a

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.590 
have like four notches in there so a
tool<00:03:30.160> like<00:03:30.280> this<00:03:30.340> would<00:03:30.730> fit<00:03:31.030> down<00:03:31.239> in<00:03:31.450> there

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
tool like this would fit down in there

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.500 
tool like this would fit down in there
to<00:03:31.810> unscrew<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.830> then<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:34.030> item<00:03:34.330> really

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
to unscrew that and then the item really

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.870 
to unscrew that and then the item really
covered<00:03:34.810> here<00:03:35.020> here's<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.320> single<00:03:35.590> speed<00:03:36.040> free

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
covered here here's a single speed free

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.880 
covered here here's a single speed free
well<00:03:37.060> it's<00:03:37.270> got<00:03:37.420> like<00:03:37.570> four<00:03:37.900> notches<00:03:38.110> here<00:03:38.590> so

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
well it's got like four notches here so

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.880 
well it's got like four notches here so
wider<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.580> but<00:03:40.360> it<00:03:40.540> threads<00:03:40.930> on<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.709> wheel

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
wider and but it threads on to the wheel

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.340 
wider and but it threads on to the wheel
the<00:03:42.190> same<00:03:42.430> way<00:03:42.610> as<00:03:42.760> these<00:03:42.970> others<00:03:43.239> do<00:03:43.570> so

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
the same way as these others do so

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.770 
the same way as these others do so
anyway<00:03:45.220> this<00:03:45.459> is<00:03:45.640> kind<00:03:45.700> of<00:03:45.910> like<00:03:46.060> maybe

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
anyway this is kind of like maybe

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.420 
anyway this is kind of like maybe
getting<00:03:47.019> an<00:03:47.080> idea<00:03:47.380> of<00:03:47.680> what<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:48.010> look<00:03:48.040> forward

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
getting an idea of what to look forward

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.259 
getting an idea of what to look forward
to<00:03:48.519> see<00:03:48.700> if<00:03:48.910> you<00:03:49.090> have<00:03:49.390> a<00:03:49.690> freewheel<00:03:50.410> or<00:03:50.590> not

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
to see if you have a freewheel or not

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.580 
to see if you have a freewheel or not
okay<00:03:52.269> so<00:03:52.300> now<00:03:52.570> this<00:03:52.720> is<00:03:52.780> an<00:03:52.959> example<00:03:53.050> of<00:03:53.530> a

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
okay so now this is an example of a

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.009 
okay so now this is an example of a
cassette<00:03:54.040> it's<00:03:54.580> a<00:03:54.700> Shimano<00:03:55.060> hyper<00:03:55.330> glycoside

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
cassette it's a Shimano hyper glycoside

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.500 
cassette it's a Shimano hyper glycoside
which<00:03:56.170> is<00:03:56.380> one<00:03:57.160> of<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.310> most<00:03:58.120> common

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
which is one of the most common

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.560 
which is one of the most common
cassettes<00:03:58.930> you<00:03:59.019> find<00:03:59.350> around<00:03:59.500> today<00:04:00.269> and<00:04:01.269> it's

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
cassettes you find around today and it's

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.759 
cassettes you find around today and it's
kind<00:04:01.750> of<00:04:01.780> like<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:01.930> little<00:04:02.019> spice<00:04:02.290> in<00:04:02.440> here<00:04:02.470> but

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
kind of like a little spice in here but

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.860 
kind of like a little spice in here but
how<00:04:03.160> this<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.910> cassette<00:04:04.209> does<00:04:04.390> not<00:04:04.570> actually

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
how this the cassette does not actually

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.410 
how this the cassette does not actually
screw<00:04:05.260> on<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.130> wheel<00:04:06.280> like<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:06.820> freewheel

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
screw on to the wheel like the freewheel

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.729 
screw on to the wheel like the freewheel
does<00:04:07.690> is<00:04:07.950> held<00:04:08.950> on<00:04:09.070> by<00:04:09.130> a<00:04:09.400> lock<00:04:09.940> ring<00:04:10.269> so<00:04:11.050> I<00:04:11.350> can

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
does is held on by a lock ring so I can

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:12.810 
does is held on by a lock ring so I can
remove<00:04:11.950> this<00:04:12.100> lock<00:04:12.250> ring<00:04:12.459> which<00:04:12.610> I<00:04:12.730> already

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
remove this lock ring which I already

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.690 
remove this lock ring which I already
had<00:04:13.030> loosened<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:14.560> so<00:04:14.800> I<00:04:14.860> pulled<00:04:15.070> this<00:04:15.190> off<00:04:15.400> it

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
had loosened and so I pulled this off it

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.120 
had loosened and so I pulled this off it
threads<00:04:15.970> on<00:04:16.150> there<00:04:16.359> and<00:04:16.630> I<00:04:17.470> could<00:04:17.620> pull<00:04:17.799> the

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
threads on there and I could pull the

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.920 
threads on there and I could pull the
cassette<00:04:18.880> off<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.419> cassette<00:04:19.720> is

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
cassette off and the cassette is

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.310 
cassette off and the cassette is
actually<00:04:20.320> just<00:04:20.769> a<00:04:21.010> collection<00:04:21.549> of<00:04:21.729> cogs<00:04:22.360> that

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
actually just a collection of cogs that

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.320 
actually just a collection of cogs that
fits<00:04:23.560> on<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:24.130> this<00:04:24.550> part<00:04:24.850> here<00:04:24.910> which<00:04:25.300> is

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
fits on to this part here which is

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.580 
fits on to this part here which is
called<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:25.570> free<00:04:25.810> hub<00:04:26.050> there

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
called the free hub there

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.620 
called the free hub there
no<00:04:26.919> ratcheting<00:04:27.430> mechanism<00:04:27.570> inside<00:04:28.570> the

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
no ratcheting mechanism inside the

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.540 
no ratcheting mechanism inside the
cassette<00:04:29.139> the<00:04:29.169> ratcheting<00:04:29.710> mechanism<00:04:29.830> is<00:04:30.370> in

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
cassette the ratcheting mechanism is in

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.520 
cassette the ratcheting mechanism is in
this<00:04:30.669> part<00:04:30.910> called<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.210> freehub<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:31.840> then

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
this part called the freehub and then

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.159 
this part called the freehub and then
this<00:04:32.710> is<00:04:32.889> attached<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:34.090> wheel<00:04:34.300> now

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
this is attached to the wheel now

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.550 
this is attached to the wheel now
cassettes<00:04:35.680> commonly<00:04:36.639> come<00:04:36.820> in<00:04:37.240> sizes<00:04:38.169> from

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
cassettes commonly come in sizes from

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.950 
cassettes commonly come in sizes from
like<00:04:38.830> 7<00:04:39.490> cogs<00:04:39.729> up<00:04:40.150> to<00:04:40.330> I<00:04:40.360> think<00:04:40.479> currently

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
like 7 cogs up to I think currently

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.420 
like 7 cogs up to I think currently
about<00:04:41.110> 11<00:04:41.530> cogs<00:04:41.850> if<00:04:42.850> you<00:04:43.030> have<00:04:43.210> like<00:04:43.360> a<00:04:43.389> 7-speed

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
about 11 cogs if you have like a 7-speed

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.370 
about 11 cogs if you have like a 7-speed
wheel<00:04:45.430> on<00:04:45.669> the<00:04:45.760> back<00:04:45.940> it's<00:04:46.270> possible<00:04:46.900> you<00:04:47.080> have

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
wheel on the back it's possible you have

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.409 
wheel on the back it's possible you have
a<00:04:47.940> freewheel<00:04:48.940> as<00:04:49.180> possible<00:04:49.750> you<00:04:49.930> have<00:04:50.229> a

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
a freewheel as possible you have a

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.600 
a freewheel as possible you have a
cassette<00:04:52.419> so<00:04:53.139> if<00:04:53.470> you<00:04:53.590> look<00:04:53.830> to<00:04:53.860> see<00:04:54.220> does<00:04:54.490> it

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
cassette so if you look to see does it

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.540 
cassette so if you look to see does it
have<00:04:54.760> a<00:04:54.790> lock<00:04:55.210> ring<00:04:55.570> on<00:04:55.780> there<00:04:56.280> if<00:04:57.280> it<00:04:57.430> has<00:04:57.520> a

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
have a lock ring on there if it has a

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.719 
have a lock ring on there if it has a
lock<00:04:57.820> ring<00:04:58.120> then<00:04:58.870> it's<00:04:59.350> probably<00:04:59.680> a<00:05:00.100> modern

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
lock ring then it's probably a modern

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.900 
lock ring then it's probably a modern
cassette<00:05:01.380> if<00:05:02.380> it<00:05:02.590> has<00:05:02.740> like<00:05:03.010> what<00:05:03.639> I<00:05:03.669> showed

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
cassette if it has like what I showed

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.250 
cassette if it has like what I showed
you<00:05:04.000> before<00:05:04.120> like<00:05:04.600> kind<00:05:04.750> of<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:04.870> recessed

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
you before like kind of the recessed

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.690 
you before like kind of the recessed
little<00:05:05.590> splines<00:05:05.919> like<00:05:06.160> that<00:05:06.370> then<00:05:06.580> it's

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
little splines like that then it's

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.280 
little splines like that then it's
probably<00:05:06.850> a<00:05:07.060> freewheel<00:05:07.419> there's<00:05:07.990> like

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
probably a freewheel there's like

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.490 
probably a freewheel there's like
another<00:05:08.680> variation<00:05:09.870> called<00:05:10.870> you<00:05:11.110> know<00:05:11.229> glide

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
another variation called you know glide

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.610 
another variation called you know glide
which<00:05:11.979> was<00:05:12.520> a<00:05:12.550> cassette<00:05:13.090> but<00:05:13.900> actually<00:05:14.410> had

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
which was a cassette but actually had

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.140 
which was a cassette but actually had
was<00:05:14.919> held<00:05:15.130> on<00:05:15.280> instead<00:05:15.610> of<00:05:15.669> having<00:05:15.880> a<00:05:15.910> lock

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
was held on instead of having a lock

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.469 
was held on instead of having a lock
ring<00:05:16.419> it<00:05:16.780> actually<00:05:17.380> was<00:05:17.710> held<00:05:17.919> on<00:05:18.130> by<00:05:18.850> the

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
ring it actually was held on by the

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.529 
ring it actually was held on by the
smallest<00:05:20.050> cog<00:05:20.380> which<00:05:20.700> screwed<00:05:21.700> on<00:05:21.940> there<00:05:22.330> and

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
smallest cog which screwed on there and

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.710 
smallest cog which screwed on there and
those<00:05:23.289> are<00:05:23.440> not<00:05:23.590> really<00:05:24.490> common<00:05:24.880> anymore<00:05:25.090> the

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
those are not really common anymore the

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.469 
those are not really common anymore the
parts<00:05:26.139> are<00:05:26.260> hard<00:05:26.320> to<00:05:26.500> find<00:05:27.150> so<00:05:28.150> and<00:05:28.360> they're

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
parts are hard to find so and they're

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.250 
parts are hard to find so and they're
not<00:05:28.660> really<00:05:28.930> compatible<00:05:29.229> with<00:05:29.740> modern

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
not really compatible with modern

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.340 
not really compatible with modern
cassettes<00:05:32.260> and<00:05:33.150> so<00:05:34.150> before<00:05:34.600> people<00:05:34.780> asked

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
cassettes and so before people asked

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.510 
cassettes and so before people asked
there<00:05:35.560> is<00:05:35.590> just<00:05:36.160> no<00:05:36.490> way<00:05:36.539> to<00:05:37.539> install<00:05:38.410> a<00:05:38.800> free

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
there is just no way to install a free

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.570 
there is just no way to install a free
hub<00:05:39.789> to<00:05:39.970> come<00:05:40.150> hold<00:05:40.330> a<00:05:40.419> cassette<00:05:40.810> onto<00:05:41.770> a<00:05:42.039> hub

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
hub to come hold a cassette onto a hub

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.330 
hub to come hold a cassette onto a hub
design<00:05:42.970> for<00:05:43.660> a<00:05:43.840> freewheel<00:05:44.380> it's<00:05:44.919> just<00:05:45.190> not

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
design for a freewheel it's just not

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.629 
design for a freewheel it's just not
going<00:05:45.520> to<00:05:45.580> happen<00:05:46.260> so<00:05:47.260> that<00:05:47.740> is<00:05:48.010> pretty<00:05:48.520> much

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
going to happen so that is pretty much

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.520 
going to happen so that is pretty much
what<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:48.910> difference<00:05:49.300> between<00:05:49.360> a<00:05:49.900> freewheel

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
what the difference between a freewheel

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.390 
what the difference between a freewheel
and<00:05:50.830> a<00:05:51.760> cassette<00:05:52.180> is<00:05:52.450> so<00:05:53.289> there's<00:05:53.500> there's

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
and a cassette is so there's there's

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.839 
and a cassette is so there's there's
really<00:05:54.669> no<00:05:55.060> way<00:05:55.360> to<00:05:56.260> take<00:05:57.039> like<00:05:57.340> a<00:05:57.370> modern

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
really no way to take like a modern

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:01.350 
really no way to take like a modern
cassette<00:05:58.389> with<00:05:58.780> like<00:05:59.139> 10<00:05:59.560> speeds<00:06:00.039> and<00:06:00.360> install

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
cassette with like 10 speeds and install

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.339 
cassette with like 10 speeds and install
it<00:06:01.599> on<00:06:01.810> a<00:06:02.139> hub<00:06:02.680> designed<00:06:03.639> for<00:06:03.970> a<00:06:04.030> freewheel<00:06:04.810> so

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
it on a hub designed for a freewheel so

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:07.710 
it on a hub designed for a freewheel so
if<00:06:05.560> you<00:06:05.650> want<00:06:05.830> to<00:06:05.919> convert<00:06:06.370> you<00:06:07.240> pretty<00:06:07.630> much

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
if you want to convert you pretty much

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.129 
if you want to convert you pretty much
have<00:06:07.990> to<00:06:08.229> replace<00:06:08.740> the<00:06:08.979> wheel<00:06:09.190> or<00:06:09.639> rebuild<00:06:10.479> the

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
have to replace the wheel or rebuild the

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.969 
have to replace the wheel or rebuild the
wheel<00:06:11.320> with<00:06:11.590> a<00:06:11.620> new<00:06:12.160> hub<00:06:13.139> it's<00:06:14.139> just<00:06:14.410> probably

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 
wheel with a new hub it's just probably

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.469 
wheel with a new hub it's just probably
going<00:06:15.220> to<00:06:15.280> be<00:06:15.340> more<00:06:15.490> cost<00:06:15.760> effective<00:06:16.210> just<00:06:16.360> to

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
going to be more cost effective just to

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:21.000 
going to be more cost effective just to
replace<00:06:16.780> the<00:06:16.990> wheel<00:06:17.340> with<00:06:18.340> a<00:06:19.139> hub<00:06:20.139> design<00:06:20.380> for

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
replace the wheel with a hub design for

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.760 
replace the wheel with a hub design for
a<00:06:21.039> cassette<00:06:21.729> so<00:06:22.510> anyway<00:06:23.080> I<00:06:23.289> hope<00:06:23.470> you<00:06:23.590> found

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
a cassette so anyway I hope you found

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.620 
a cassette so anyway I hope you found
