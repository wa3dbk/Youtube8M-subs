00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:11.010
 I 'll show you how to install and texture 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:14.340
 packs on mine 081 version so to get started 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.740
 find link guys of course link i 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.070
 you will not fold because I find 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.500
 I have almost no problems 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.849
 honestly for me basically harder 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.640
 find texture pack any than him 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.120
 create create is much easier for me and 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.969
 we'll talk about this in the model lesson 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.629
 which will be out soon and in the same way 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.149
 we need a program block launcher 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.420
 launcher pro I have a reference to and new you 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.800
 see under the video in the description therefore 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.809
 Download and open our link 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.989
 we see opens minkravt yes he does not 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.460
 simple here click nastroechki 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.359
 launcher settings 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.559
 and select texture pack my downloaded 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.080
 texture pack is not very different therefore 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:10.409
 we don't notice much do everything 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.950
 that's all i did and here we will see already 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:18.979
 world let's click any load 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.979
 for example server we will not include 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.090
 so here it is he see texture in 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.180
 yes principle 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.130
 textures are much different than apparently not 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.530
 exchanged 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.110
 in the next lesson fashion thing if someone 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.990
 don't know this rubric on my channel then 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.710
 I explain in this column I tell you how 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.829
 make mods how to change them like 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.369
 complement and generally create create 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.590
 A clean slate in that lesson I will tell you 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.130
 how to create your textures if someone 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.079
 just can't or doesn't want to wait for it 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.590
 lesson then write in the comments 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.630
 i'm for example your server for your 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.439
 channel channel specially made 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.409
 textures 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.010
 Any special deal will make to order 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.060
 their tours for your 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:14.150
 minecraft in general about payback we of course 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.480
 agree, I think it will not 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.260
 expensive and see that the textures are absolutely 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.160
 I change all this I can do therefore 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.890
 we will see it moda lessons it in 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.000
 In principle, the first way I say that immediately 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.100
 I say that in a standard program 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.260
 miners while you're a mode that is in the most 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.370
 this texture game pack some 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.460
 is loading and why because these 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.640
 texture we trimmed 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:50.930
 installation pk and our launcher pro 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.930
 just crashes the textures 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.740
 to root files honestly where 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.810
 throw know daddy like games here 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:05.540
 let's help cc see that there are no 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.520
 There are no files, that is, files with textures 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.220
 let's system files maybe 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.800
 let's see it maybe even with us 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.709
 it turns out no see that he is nothing 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.870
 there is no suspicious way 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.739
 You can throw the texture that is open 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.140
 they can only be through monik block launcher 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.019
 and if someone wants to open them always 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.300
 through minecraft pe contact me know 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.209
 how do i just drag 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.510
 installation is dangerous and you will already have 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.780
 capital not standard textures 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.720
 in principle, on this leads all over 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.370
 who wants to download the texture look of course 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.440
 the same Yandex and google and bing and others 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.810
 search engines and all who looked 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.989
 and liked the video, put your finger 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.400
 up of course subscribe to the channel in 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.400
 principle on this all all bye
