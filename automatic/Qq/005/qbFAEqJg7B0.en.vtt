00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.470
 hello I'm angela from the visual mission and in 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.090
 this video we are going to explain to you how 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.260
 assemble the points with the method 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.440
 alternative to the thumb 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.960
 usually in Spain , the 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.910
 points in this way 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.010
 we passed a candle through here we cross this 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:39.070
 we passed the other 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.100
 yes so 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.890
 as in Spain 7 is usually knitted with 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.650
 long needles this needle is subject 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.559
 under the armpit in such a way that the needle 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.440
 is still and it is the hands that go 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.629
 assembling the points if you use a 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.640
 smaller needle or you have the style 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.250
 continental you will see that it is a bit 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.670
 uncomfortable having to be passing the 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.590
 needle of a hand alternately to the 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.590
 other 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.560
 to solve this there is the method 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.950
 alternative to the thumb in English it 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.260
 they call alternative blondel gastÃ³n or cast 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.540
 on with world level 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.420
 and because it is similar to the thumb method 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.320
 because we place the strand in a very 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.080
 similar to this other method in this case 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.080
 we leave the shortest thread on top of the 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.230
 index finger and the one that connects with the 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.610
 Roll over the thumb as well 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.130
 that the thumb method 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.100
 we have to leave this long thread 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.370
 as possible to assemble the points 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.980
 approximately 2.5 excuse 2 centimeters 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.590
 and a half for each point although it is always 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.500
 convenient to leave a little more then 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.430
 ok let's start we put the needle 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.130
 in this position and we passed the strand the 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.759
 needle for this site 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.039
 we take a turn and pass again the 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.670
 needle here and now with your finger 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:12.130
 index we throw we already have mounted two 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.130
 first points now let's ride 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.470
 one by one we return the needle 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.930
 here 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.010
 one strand above 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.640
 we went through this other side and threw 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.310
 you see 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.920
 the result is exactly the same as the one 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.959
 is usually used in Spain ' 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.470
 the only thing to use needles 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:38.620
 circular or shorter straight needles 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.370
 It is much more comfortable 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.459
 you see like this 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.220
 just like the thumb method this 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.610
 assembly of points is more or less 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.090
 loose and a little elastic is nothing left 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.090
 tight 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.310
 and also in the same way as the method 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.459
 of the thumb remember when you pull 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.610
 this thread has to be adjusted but 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.860
 not tight because if we do not have much 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.250
 difficulty when weaving the first 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.250
 return 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.040
 we hope this video has served you 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.590
 of help if you want to continue learning to 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.230
 weave with the mission visor visit our 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.860
