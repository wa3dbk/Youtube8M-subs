00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.039 
and cloud dot blog spot.com okay so this
is<00:00:14.070> how<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.370> glove<00:00:14.940> should<00:00:15.389> look<00:00:15.630> like<00:00:15.660> after

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
is how the glove should look like after

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.740 
is how the glove should look like after
finishing<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:17.039> interior<00:00:17.430> part<00:00:17.910> which<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.570> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
finishing the interior part which is the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.450 
finishing the interior part which is the
red<00:00:19.050> striped<00:00:19.740> part<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.820> glove<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:22.460> have

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
red striped part of the glove I have

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.269 
red striped part of the glove I have
tidied<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.480> ends<00:00:26.150> on<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.269> striped<00:00:27.539> part<00:00:27.960> and

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
tidied the ends on the striped part and

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.389 
tidied the ends on the striped part and
also<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:30.060> between<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.660> thumbs

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.610 

the<00:00:35.399> good<00:00:35.579> thing<00:00:35.790> about<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:37.140> reversible

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
the good thing about the reversible

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.619 
the good thing about the reversible
gloves<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.940> don't<00:00:39.120> really<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.390> to

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
gloves is that you don't really have to

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.869 
gloves is that you don't really have to
worry<00:00:39.899> too<00:00:40.469> much<00:00:40.500> about<00:00:40.680> hiding<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.430> ends

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
worry too much about hiding the ends

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.479 
worry too much about hiding the ends
because<00:00:42.480> they<00:00:43.320> will<00:00:43.649> be<00:00:43.829> hidden<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.370> between

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
because they will be hidden in between

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.729 
because they will be hidden in between
the<00:00:44.730> two<00:00:44.910> layers<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:48.200> what<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.350> now<00:00:49.500> need<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the two layers so what you now need to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.680 
the two layers so what you now need to
do<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.760> tidy<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.840> free<00:00:52.050> end<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.350> yarn<00:00:53.690> at

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
do is to tidy the free end of yarn at

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.470 
do is to tidy the free end of yarn at
the<00:00:54.750> top<00:00:55.020> edge<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.980> thumb<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the top edge and the thumb of the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.279 
the top edge and the thumb of the
interior<00:00:57.960> piece<00:00:58.789> because<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.780> not<00:01:00.960> used

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
interior piece because this is not used

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.080 
interior piece because this is not used
for<00:01:01.469> grafting<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.399> need<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.760> somewhat

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
for grafting and you need to somewhat

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.080 
for grafting and you need to somewhat
secure<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:04.409> prevent<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.979> from<00:01:05.010> being<00:01:05.850> too

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
secure to prevent it from being too

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.910 
secure to prevent it from being too
loose<00:01:06.330> or<00:01:07.280> unravel<00:01:08.280> after<00:01:08.520> grafting<00:01:09.799> it's<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
loose or unravel after grafting it's a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.560 
loose or unravel after grafting it's a
lot<00:01:11.040> easier<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.549> understand<00:01:12.060> from<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
lot easier to understand from the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.480 
lot easier to understand from the
diagrams<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.320> my<00:01:13.470> pattern<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.100> I'll<00:01:14.220> show<00:01:14.460> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
diagrams in my pattern but I'll show you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.300 
diagrams in my pattern but I'll show you
how<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:14.970> done<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> thumb<00:01:16.250> okay<00:01:17.250> so

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
how this is done on the thumb okay so

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.550 
how this is done on the thumb okay so
this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> wrong<00:01:17.970> side<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:19.140> knitted

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
this is the wrong side of the knitted

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.539 
this is the wrong side of the knitted
fabric<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.580> insert<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.450> needle<00:01:22.549> into

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
fabric and you insert the needle into

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.730 
fabric and you insert the needle into
the<00:01:23.729> loop<00:01:23.850> between<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.840> last<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the loop between the last and the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.469 
the loop between the last and the
penultimate<00:01:25.950> stitches<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:28.189> then<00:01:29.479> thread

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
penultimate stitches and then thread

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.499 
penultimate stitches and then thread
through<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.770> into<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> loop<00:01:32.670> between<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
through the into the loop between the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.450 
through the into the loop between the
first<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.140> second<00:01:35.009> stitches<00:01:36.079> and<00:01:37.460> then

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
first and the second stitches and then

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.700 
first and the second stitches and then
thread<00:01:39.420> through<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.740> loop<00:01:42.290> makes<00:01:43.290> your<00:01:43.470> sin

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
thread through the loop makes your sin

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.789 
thread through the loop makes your sin
and<00:01:44.270> again<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:47.030> very<00:01:48.030> carefully<00:01:48.750> tighten<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and again and very carefully tighten the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.429 
and again and very carefully tighten the
knot<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:53.149> trim<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.390> yarn<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.780> you're<00:01:55.229> now

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
knot and trim the yarn and you're now

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.920 
knot and trim the yarn and you're now
ready<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.860> graft

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.760 

okay<00:02:01.930> so<00:02:01.990> everything<00:02:02.860> is<00:02:02.979> now<00:02:03.130> ready<00:02:03.400> for<00:02:03.520> the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
okay so everything is now ready for the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.820 
okay so everything is now ready for the
gloom<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:05.890> just<00:02:06.100> wanted<00:02:06.370> to<00:02:06.490> say<00:02:06.640> hello<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:08.770> the

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
gloom I just wanted to say hello for the

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.390 
gloom I just wanted to say hello for the
finals<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.369> step<00:02:10.090> which<00:02:10.360> is<00:02:10.600> grafting<00:02:11.590> so

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
finals that step which is grafting so

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.730 
finals that step which is grafting so
what<00:02:12.490> you<00:02:12.610> need<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.880> do<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.720> turn<00:02:14.530> the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
what you need to do is to turn the

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.290 
what you need to do is to turn the
exterior<00:02:15.190> piece<00:02:15.430> right<00:02:16.090> side<00:02:16.360> out<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:19.150> that

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
exterior piece right side out so that

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.750 
exterior piece right side out so that
this<00:02:19.420> brings<00:02:20.130> exterior<00:02:21.130> interior<00:02:21.280> pieces

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
this brings exterior interior pieces

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:30.840 
this brings exterior interior pieces
with<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.570> wrong<00:02:22.720> side<00:02:22.990> facing<00:02:23.260> together<00:02:29.850> okay

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
with the wrong side facing together okay

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.320 
with the wrong side facing together okay
so<00:02:30.910> now<00:02:31.180> this<00:02:31.420> looks<00:02:31.900> more<00:02:32.620> like<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:33.330> reversible

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
so now this looks more like a reversible

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.949 
so now this looks more like a reversible
glove<00:02:35.160> what<00:02:36.160> we<00:02:36.400> now<00:02:36.790> going<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.239> do<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.660> to

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
glove what we now going to do is to

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.040 
glove what we now going to do is to
graft<00:02:38.770> all<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.340> way<00:02:39.430> around<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:40.600> top<00:02:40.780> edges

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
graft all the way around the top edges

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:48.840 
graft all the way around the top edges
so<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.160> basically<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.970> is<00:02:43.209> seamless<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:48.670> now

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
so that basically it is seamless so now

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.100 
so that basically it is seamless so now
I<00:02:48.880> match<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:50.700> first<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:51.970> last<00:02:52.120> stitches

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
I match the first and the last stitches

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.229 
I match the first and the last stitches
so<00:02:53.320> that<00:02:53.530> I<00:02:54.180> can<00:02:55.180> graft<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:56.230> correct

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
so that I can graft the correct

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.009 
so that I can graft the correct
complementary<00:02:58.239> stitches<00:03:00.660> but<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.780> video

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
complementary stitches but the video

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.810 
complementary stitches but the video
doesn't<00:03:02.410> really<00:03:02.620> show<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:02.890> clearly<00:03:03.280> how<00:03:03.790> the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
doesn't really show you clearly how the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.850 
doesn't really show you clearly how the
grafting<00:03:04.390> is<00:03:04.510> done<00:03:04.660> but<00:03:04.870> there<00:03:05.080> is<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.320> diagram

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
grafting is done but there is a diagram

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.250 
grafting is done but there is a diagram
in<00:03:06.190> my<00:03:06.400> pattern<00:03:06.820> which<00:03:07.570> you<00:03:07.720> can<00:03:07.900> have<00:03:08.019> a<00:03:08.080> look

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
in my pattern which you can have a look

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.420 
in my pattern which you can have a look
so<00:03:08.470> do<00:03:08.620> refer<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:11.739> only<00:03:11.769> thing<00:03:12.130> I<00:03:12.220> want

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
so do refer to it the only thing I want

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.759 
so do refer to it the only thing I want
to<00:03:12.580> mention<00:03:12.700> is<00:03:13.150> that<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.690> always<00:03:14.230> start<00:03:14.650> from

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
to mention is that I always start from

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.250 
to mention is that I always start from
the<00:03:15.310> last<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:15.940> then<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.239> first<00:03:16.540> stitches

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
the last and then the first stitches

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.789 
the last and then the first stitches
when<00:03:18.040> I<00:03:19.170> graft<00:03:20.170> any<00:03:20.769> fabrics<00:03:21.280> needed<00:03:21.610> in<00:03:21.700> round

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
when I graft any fabrics needed in round

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.759 
when I graft any fabrics needed in round
and<00:03:23.799> then<00:03:24.280> when<00:03:24.459> I<00:03:25.019> finish<00:03:26.019> all<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.320> stitches

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
and then when I finish all the stitches

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.280 
and then when I finish all the stitches
then<00:03:27.489> graph<00:03:27.820> the<00:03:28.060> first<00:03:28.239> stitches<00:03:28.540> once<00:03:28.930> again

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
then graph the first stitches once again

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
then graph the first stitches once again
to<00:03:30.160> complete<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.640> circle<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:32.470> this

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
to complete the circle and and this

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.759 
to complete the circle and and this
makes<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:34.150> nice<00:03:34.329> neat<00:03:34.810> finish<00:03:37.440> okay<00:03:38.440> so<00:03:38.500> I'm

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
makes a nice neat finish okay so I'm

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.740 
makes a nice neat finish okay so I'm
nearly<00:03:39.100> finished<00:03:39.190> grafting<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.209> top<00:03:40.480> part

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
nearly finished grafting the top part

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.650 
nearly finished grafting the top part
all<00:03:41.650> this<00:03:41.829> time<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.459> waste<00:03:42.670> yarn<00:03:42.880> is<00:03:43.269> still

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
all this time the waste yarn is still

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.500 
all this time the waste yarn is still
intact<00:03:43.989> but<00:03:44.680> when<00:03:44.860> I<00:03:45.000> when<00:03:46.000> everything<00:03:46.420> is

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.340 
intact but when I when everything is
done<00:03:47.010> you<00:03:48.010> can<00:03:48.190> pull<00:03:48.400> them<00:03:48.549> out<00:03:48.780> so<00:03:49.780> I'll<00:03:50.079> show

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.089 

okay<00:04:10.310> so<00:04:10.370> now<00:04:10.700> I'm<00:04:10.909> going<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.390> make<00:04:11.569> a<00:04:11.599> knot<00:04:12.099> to

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
okay so now I'm going to make a knot to

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:26.270 
okay so now I'm going to make a knot to
secure<00:04:13.129> the<00:04:13.459> end

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.860 

and<00:04:27.090> you<00:04:28.020> can<00:04:28.290> hide<00:04:28.620> this<00:04:29.010> not<00:04:32.090> in<00:04:33.090> between<00:04:33.630> two

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
and you can hide this not in between two

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:49.370 
and you can hide this not in between two
layers<00:04:34.050> like<00:04:34.610> this

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.520 

and<00:04:49.640> cut<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:50.790> yarn<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:51.300> repeat<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.380> same

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
and cut the yarn and repeat the same

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:59.120 
and cut the yarn and repeat the same
process<00:04:52.800> for<00:04:53.040> the<00:04:53.370> thumb<00:04:55.640> and<00:04:57.650> this<00:04:58.650> completes

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
process for the thumb and this completes

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.010 
process for the thumb and this completes
