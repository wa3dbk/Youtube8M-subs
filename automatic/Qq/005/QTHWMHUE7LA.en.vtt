00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.639
 Hi, I'm Julia FarrÃ© 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.260
 dietician-nutritionist of feeds and in 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.510
 this video I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.510
 feeding in the epoc which is the 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.029
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.730
 is a disorder that is characterized by 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.890
 the obstruction of the air when breathing is 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.769
 a progressive disease and little 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.429
 reversible the main cause of the epoc 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.860
 is the tobacco in fact 90% of the 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.650
 people who have this disease are 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.260
 smokers the cigars contain some 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.690
 harmful substances that when breathed 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.360
 they are hurting the lungs as is the 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.350
 nicotine the tar the monoxide 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.570
 carbon and cyanide the prevalence of 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.850
 epoc is variable depending on the 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.830
 countries and it has been seen that it is higher in 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.160
 the developed countries that is where you 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:01.010
 smokes more also increases from the 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.620
 60 years of age and in smokers over 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.189
 30 packages a year that this is going to be 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.619
 two and a half packs a month in Spain is 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.080
 the fourth leading cause of death and 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.960
 world health organization 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.750
 see that in 2020 the epoc will be the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.180
 third cause of death in the world 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.730
 if this happens it would occupy the fifth 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.030
 position of diseases with greater 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.520
 economic impact basically by the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.180
 high cost of drugs and by the 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.030
 hospitalizations within COPD 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.400
 they include two main disorders the 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.740
 first is chronic bronchitis and it is 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.900
 that the bronchi become inflamed 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.210
 bronchi is the main path that 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.180
 follow the air from the nose to the 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.820
 lungs then there are usually two 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.729
 with expectoration that is to say with mucus of 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.700
 chronically the other symptom or 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.610
 problem is pulmonary emphysema that is 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.040
 that the air spaces of 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.470
 the bronchi causing damage in the 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.380
 alveoli that are the air sacks 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.690
 what's inside the lungs this 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.610
 is that which produces air build is 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.430
 there is air trapped inside the lung 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.190
 that can not go abroad and this 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.580
 decreases oxygenation 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.550
 The main symptoms of epoc are 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.680
 the chronic cough that are usually the 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.350
 cases of bronchitis expectoration 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.780
 especially in the mornings and the mucus 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.870
 It can change color in moments 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.640
 in which the disease is more serious the 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.850
 dyspnea, which is the difficulty 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.460
 breathe easily and the feeling of 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.190
 missing the air that this is very common 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.520
 in cases of emphysema and 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.370
 wheezing and that is the air when breathing 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.970
 a whistle produces a sound when passing 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.000
 through the respiratory tract 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.580
 malnutrition is very frequent in 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.710
 cases of epoc since it affects up to 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.380
 half of the people who suffer this 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.300
 malnutrition disease what has been 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.420
 seen is that lung function worsens 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.040
 and the quality of life of people and 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.010
 increases the chances of suffering 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.250
 more health problems derived from this 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.290
 illness and even die what is 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.300
 recommended in these people is that 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.540
 have a body mass index 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.850
 superior to the rest is to say what has been 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.950
 seen is that when the imc is by 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.590
 below 25 which is what I normally 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.910
 it is recommended there are more chances of 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:37.060
 die people with epoc usually have 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.209
 an increase up to 10 times higher than 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.070
 normal energy expenditure what happens that 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.650
 you have to watch because if you make a 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:48.530
 excessively caloric diet 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.980
 you should breathe more because you eat more 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.959
 and this makes the symptoms worse 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.329
 then what has been done is calculate 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.849
 a little the kilocalories that you have to 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:01.939
 eat per kilo more or less a person 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.849
 of 50 kilos should eat about 1500 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:07.459
 kilocalories a day a person of 70 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.980
 kilos about 2,000 100 kilocalories a day 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.439
 it is important to split the 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.659
 minimum meals in five or six takes 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:18.680
 daily in this way is given less 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:20.600
 work to lung function there is that 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.760
 make a diet rich in fiber for 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.130
 avoid constipation and you have to do 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.550
 overexert when going to 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.110
 Bathroom also worsens lung function 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.090
 and you have to watch over the consumption of 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.710
 carbohydrates we are always 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.690
 saying dietitians that it's very 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.580
 important to consume carbohydrates 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.830
 because they are the main source of 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.169
 people's energy but in these 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.130
 cases should be monitored since the hydrate 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:48.949
 of carbon can be an overload 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.340
 functional in the lungs that can 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.800
 hinder this ability 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.169
 breathe correctly then in these 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.720
 cases in carbohydrates should 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.630
 contribute between 40 and 50 percent 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.520
 of daily energy in terms of 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.740
 proteins are a little bit more 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.919
 increased especially in people who 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.550
 they have a low weight they must contribute 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:15.610
 must provide between 15 grams of protein 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.410
 because per kilo of body weight 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.310
 the proteins also have an effect 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.870
 positive since consuming protein 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.650
 increases the amount of 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:29.040
 air that is ejected per minute 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.930
 the consumption of fats is an effort 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.180
 smaller at the time of breathing than the one of 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:37.259
 carbohydrate since it occurs 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.419
 less co2 when fats are consumed by 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:42.479
 therefore, more quantity of 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.970
 fats but without exceeding 50 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.520
 percent of daily energy there 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.979
 some nutrients that are especially 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.139
 important or some nutrients that 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:55.229
 we will recommend in the cases of epoc 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.910
 the first is the blue fish what is 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.860
 has seen is that the omega 3 that is in 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.740
 the blue fish prevents the damage 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.930
 lung that causes the tobacco issue and 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:07.350
 improves the symptoms of people with 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:10.500
 epoc also vitamin c vitamin e 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.720
 beta carotene and selenium have a 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.520
 antioxidant effect that improves the 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.580
 pulmonary function 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.960
 Broccoli is another food 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.570
 interesting in these cases because 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.539
 contains a substance that is capable of 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.400
 restore the imbalance that there is in 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:29.790
 the tissues of the lungs by 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.880
 lungs for its antioxidant effect 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:35.760
 zinc consumption is important 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.280
 calcium and magnesium since normally 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.860
 in these cases there is a deficit of these 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.170
 minerals has been observed that 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.020
 people who habitually consume soy 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:48.870
 they have better lung function and 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.390
 lower risk of developing epoc in 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:54.090
 general you have to make a soft diet and 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:56.330
 of easy chewing to decrease the 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:59.430
 difficulty breathing while eating 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:02.040
 in feeds we can make patterns 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.950
 personalized dietetics for any 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.440
 type of respiratory disease if 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.810
 you want to be updated on health issues and 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.300
 nutrition you can subscribe to our 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.760
 youtube channel and follow us in the

 social networks remember that eating 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:20.560
 well you improve your health 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.560
