in<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:00.900> quick<00:00:01.140> video<00:00:01.350> I'm<00:00:01.800> going<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.010> explain

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
in this quick video I'm going to explain

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.980 
in this quick video I'm going to explain
because<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.610> lot<00:00:02.820> of<00:00:02.850> customers<00:00:03.360> are<00:00:03.389> asking<00:00:03.840> us

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
because a lot of customers are asking us

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.090 
because a lot of customers are asking us
and<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.230> lot<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.470> guys<00:00:04.650> are<00:00:04.830> having<00:00:05.040> this

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
and a lot of guys are having this

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.010 
and a lot of guys are having this
problem<00:00:05.339> since<00:00:05.640> Clarion<00:00:06.180> has<00:00:06.299> discontinued<00:00:06.960> a

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
problem since Clarion has discontinued a

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.660 
problem since Clarion has discontinued a
lot<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.290> their<00:00:07.440> older<00:00:07.770> remote<00:00:08.099> controls<00:00:08.460> for

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
lot of their older remote controls for

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.530 
lot of their older remote controls for
the<00:00:08.760> marine<00:00:09.059> applications<00:00:09.780> now<00:00:10.940> right<00:00:11.940> here<00:00:12.360> I

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
the marine applications now right here I

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.039 
the marine applications now right here I
have<00:00:13.170> an<00:00:13.320> MW<00:00:13.860> -<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:14.940> an<00:00:15.059> on<00:00:15.210> LCD<00:00:15.660> style

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
have an MW - this is an on LCD style

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.109 
have an MW - this is an on LCD style
marine<00:00:16.379> remote<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.699> another<00:00:17.910> version

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
marine remote and it's another version

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.480 
marine remote and it's another version
that<00:00:18.539> they<00:00:18.690> have<00:00:18.869> which<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.320> MW<00:00:19.920> one<00:00:20.189> which

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
that they have which is the MW one which

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.720 
that they have which is the MW one which
has<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.760> same<00:00:21.210> features<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.869> little<00:00:22.230> bigger

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
has the same features a little bigger

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.370 
has the same features a little bigger
stainless<00:00:23.730> steel<00:00:23.910> bezel<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.720> has<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.990> LCD

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
stainless steel bezel and it has the LCD

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.380 
stainless steel bezel and it has the LCD
readout<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.949> have<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.609> one<00:00:26.760> at<00:00:26.789> one<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.150> nice

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
readout I have that one at one it's nice

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.910 
readout I have that one at one it's nice
but<00:00:27.689> they<00:00:27.779> both<00:00:27.930> essentially<00:00:28.470> do<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.619> same

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
but they both essentially do the same

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.510 
but they both essentially do the same
functions<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:29.580> here's<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.570> problem<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:31.520> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
functions but here's the problem on the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.250 
functions but here's the problem on the
newer<00:00:32.730> ones<00:00:33.090> you'll<00:00:33.360> see<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:34.050> pin

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
newer ones you'll see the pin

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.100 
newer ones you'll see the pin
configuration<00:00:35.270> round<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.930> other

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
configuration round just like the other

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.580 
configuration round just like the other
one<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:38.100> guy<00:00:38.340> here<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.850> an<00:00:39.000> 8<00:00:39.270> pin<00:00:39.510> now<00:00:40.469> if

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
one is this guy here is an 8 pin now if

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.500 
one is this guy here is an 8 pin now if
you<00:00:40.680> look<00:00:40.890> at<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> years<00:00:41.790> prior<00:00:42.329> model<00:00:44.510> looks

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
you look at the years prior model looks

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.590 
you look at the years prior model looks
very<00:00:45.750> much<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.020> same<00:00:46.700> but<00:00:47.700> not<00:00:47.879> exactly<00:00:48.390> if

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
very much the same but not exactly if

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.979 
very much the same but not exactly if
you<00:00:48.690> count<00:00:48.989> them<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.890> got<00:00:50.070> 6<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> 6<00:00:51.780> is

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
you count them up you got 6 so a 6 is

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.689 
you count them up you got 6 so a 6 is
definitely<00:00:52.559> not<00:00:52.739> going<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.980> plug<00:00:53.190> into<00:00:53.340> here

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
definitely not going to plug into here

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.819 
definitely not going to plug into here
well<00:00:54.480> don't<00:00:54.690> they<00:00:54.780> make<00:00:54.899> an<00:00:55.050> adapter<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.620> ask

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
well don't they make an adapter you ask

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.080 
well don't they make an adapter you ask
no<00:00:56.399> they<00:00:56.610> do<00:00:56.670> not

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
no they do not

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.990 
no they do not
so<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:59.160> current<00:00:59.489> models<00:00:59.789> say

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
so if you have the current models say

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.979 
so if you have the current models say
the<00:01:00.180> CMB<00:01:00.539> one<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.399> CMD<00:01:02.820> 7<00:01:03.180> CMD<00:01:03.660> 6

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the CMB one you have the CMD 7 CMD 6

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.410 
the CMB one you have the CMD 7 CMD 6
this<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.159> what<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> doctor<00:01:05.880> ordered<00:01:06.119> for<00:01:06.270> you

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
this is what the doctor ordered for you

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.469 
this is what the doctor ordered for you
either<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.900> MW<00:01:07.409> 1<00:01:07.560> or<00:01:07.710> NW<00:01:08.189> 2<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.210> have

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
either the MW 1 or NW 2 but if you have

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.590 
either the MW 1 or NW 2 but if you have
this<00:01:10.350> guy<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.770> 6<00:01:11.250> pin<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:12.030> say<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
this guy the 6 pin you say you have a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.850 
this guy the 6 pin you say you have a
CMD<00:01:12.960> 5<00:01:13.290> CMD<00:01:13.799> for<00:01:14.070> C<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.460> D<00:01:14.640> 3<00:01:15.470> that's<00:01:16.470> about<00:01:16.740> as

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
CMD 5 CMD for C and D 3 that's about as

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.080 
CMD 5 CMD for C and D 3 that's about as
far<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.220> goes<00:01:17.250> before<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.939> they<00:01:18.060> had

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
far as it goes before that they had

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.030 
far as it goes before that they had
another<00:01:18.420> remote<00:01:18.780> which<00:01:19.320> we<00:01:19.500> won't<00:01:19.619> go<00:01:19.740> into

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
another remote which we won't go into

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.890 
another remote which we won't go into
that's<00:01:20.280> kind<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.670> old<00:01:20.820> at<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.030> point<00:01:21.390> but

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
that's kind of old at that point but

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.469 
that's kind of old at that point but
this<00:01:22.229> one<00:01:22.439> here<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.860> 6<00:01:23.100> pin<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.330> only

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
this one here the 6 pin this is only

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.770 
this one here the 6 pin this is only
compatible<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.259> m101<00:01:26.210> rx<00:01:27.210> see<00:01:27.479> that

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
compatible with the m101 rx see that

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.380 
compatible with the m101 rx see that
this<00:01:28.049> cable<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.500> only<00:01:28.650> working<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.390> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
CMR c1 s B that's what this cable here

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.179 
CMR c1 s B that's what this cable here
is<00:01:39.240> going<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.630> good<00:01:39.810> for<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.290> only<00:01:40.950> those

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
is going to be good for and only those

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.999 
is going to be good for and only those
so<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> recap<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> newer

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
so just to recap if you have the newer

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.020 
so just to recap if you have the newer
model<00:01:44.430> MW<00:01:44.909> 1<00:01:45.090> mu<00:01:45.420> NW<00:01:45.960> 2<00:01:46.140> remote<00:01:46.439> controls<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.850> 8

model MW 1 mu NW 2 remote controls the 8

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.580 
model MW 1 mu NW 2 remote controls the 8
pin<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> one<00:01:48.689> you're<00:01:48.840> looking<00:01:48.930> for<00:01:49.140> and

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
pin is the one you're looking for and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.950 
pin is the one you're looking for and
that's<00:01:50.310> going<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.390> what<00:01:51.659> you're<00:01:51.810> going<00:01:51.930> to
