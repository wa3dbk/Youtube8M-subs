00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.240
 ok nice all guys are always 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:13.450
 magic logi are here to address a 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.110
 topic that I should have addressed a 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.790
 some time ago since now the thing is 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:25.480
 taken a long time ago 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:30.160
 or rather the capri simulator ok one 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:33.940
 goat is just a goat that goes around in 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.989
 I walk around like a goat to grow one 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:41.440
 stupid goat that goes around and puts on 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:46.629
 rockets on flies like superman 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.809
 but it is a goat bumps into it 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.180
 people how does a goat is 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.610
 invested by cars and motorcycles 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.239
 like a goat and they made us a 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.839
 game like a goat goat goat goat 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.170
 goat the game of vittorio sgarbi 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:08.830
 boys don't have 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.470
 what shall I say June beautiful I must say 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.410
 that this game is really nice to you 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.770
 you think if I said this 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.590
 game the mind is not beautiful is a worlds 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.720
 with ethics it is ugly would not be right 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.540
 to classify in any ranking 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.070
 world can not be said to be ugly 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.260
 it ca n't be said how nice 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.060
 then I tell you the first thing I have 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.980
 thought it always seemed gta ok 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.310
 it seemed just that instead of one 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.690
 person there was an ok room we lacked 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:45.700
 only vittorio sgarbi that already goat goat 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:49.300
 because why the paper because someone 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.670
 has any ideas for maybe these 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.330
 intellectual philosophers have thought 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.560
 but the goat is certainly a certain goat 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.640
 sure sure 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.920
 then let's try obviously not 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.810
 they will doctor you play but I think that 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.640
 we all know it is also enough sought 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.119
 k online simulators I think that from 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.110
 ninety webs will come out several clones are 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.580
 already sure 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.890
 I'm not telling you not to play I'm in 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.470
 I'm telling you, it's not a game 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.180
 but not even a gambling game is a 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.950
 something that you have to have fun with 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.360
 if you play a game to pass the 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.800
 its real life on a screen then not 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.930
 that point is more a game at that point 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.360
 it seems to me something to pass the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.280
 time in an idiotic way 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.740
 only instead you do it with a goat and 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.680
 this is a speech because someone is me 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:47.950
 explain why you could do any 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:50.870
 what to tell the truth I discovered the secret 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.580
 of life is more or less the time 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.520
 our time must be employed for 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.680
 do smart things things that we do 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.850
 like things with interesting things that 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.550
 they make us open our minds 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:08.959
 if you are going to play the simulator 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:10.880
 k you are goats and with this is the 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.800
 finish here I'm not here to lose any more 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.580
 time to talk about a game 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.380
 useless is an uninteresting game 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.580
 since the gameplay is really stupid 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.970
 who can also do it 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.920
 the first idiot who turns on a computer 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.190
 here's what gaming is becoming a 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.370
 something open to make it easier 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:38.110
 easier than turning on a computer 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:43.930
 here is everything here if you play a 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.930
 Capri Simulator You 're a whole goat
