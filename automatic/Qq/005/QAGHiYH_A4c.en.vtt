I tell you what I think of this and then

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.740 
I tell you what I think of this and then
one<00:02:00.549> of<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.759> things<00:02:00.820> I<00:02:01.060> kept<00:02:01.270> mentioning<00:02:01.479> in

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
one of the things I kept mentioning in

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.749 
one of the things I kept mentioning in
that<00:02:01.899> video<00:02:02.049> was<00:02:02.350> yeah<00:02:02.890> these<00:02:03.040> brief<00:02:03.340> em<00:02:03.520> kits

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
that video was yeah these brief em kits

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.350 
that video was yeah these brief em kits
they're<00:02:03.969> a<00:02:04.000> little<00:02:04.240> pricey<00:02:04.420> compared<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.200> the

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
they're a little pricey compared to the

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.950 
they're a little pricey compared to the
so<00:02:05.960> this<00:02:06.740> is<00:02:06.920> probably<00:02:07.220> about<00:02:07.430> 80<00:02:08.300> minutes<00:02:08.720> a

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
so this is probably about 80 minutes a

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.500 
so this is probably about 80 minutes a
point<00:02:11.200> well<00:02:12.200> it's<00:02:13.130> not<00:02:13.280> very<00:02:13.340> look<00:02:14.270> quite

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
point well it's not very look quite

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.880 
point well it's not very look quite
clear<00:02:14.810> in<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.050> bottle<00:02:15.320> what<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.530> have<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.740> say

mean<00:05:14.460> yeah<00:05:14.730> some<00:05:14.970> of<00:05:15.060> their<00:05:15.180> beers<00:05:15.450> are<00:05:15.660> very

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
mean yeah some of their beers are very

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.040 
mean yeah some of their beers are very
high<00:05:16.440> ABV<00:05:17.070> you<00:05:17.430> know<00:05:17.520> quite<00:05:17.850> their<00:05:18.390> speciality

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
high ABV you know quite their speciality

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.780 
high ABV you know quite their speciality
beers<00:05:19.290> they're<00:05:19.590> not<00:05:19.740> sessionable<00:05:20.340> piece<00:05:20.610> but

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
beers they're not sessionable piece but

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.880 
beers they're not sessionable piece but
this<00:05:21.360> one<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:21.960> raspberry<00:05:22.410> actually<00:05:23.040> is<00:05:23.820> I

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
this one the raspberry actually is I

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.630 
this one the raspberry actually is I
don't<00:05:25.890> think<00:05:26.100> is<00:05:26.160> very<00:05:26.310> high<00:05:26.610> in<00:05:26.930> ABV<00:05:28.460> five<00:05:29.460> and

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
don't think is very high in ABV five and

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.560 
don't think is very high in ABV five and
half<00:05:29.760> percent<00:05:29.940> so<00:05:33.920> five<00:05:34.920> and<00:05:35.130> half<00:05:35.250> percent

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
half percent so five and half percent

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:41.870 
half percent so five and half percent
very<00:05:36.570> clean<00:05:36.960> very<00:05:37.350> crisp<00:05:38.280> very<00:05:39.170> suitable<00:05:40.880> only

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
very clean very crisp very suitable only

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.780 
very clean very crisp very suitable only
problem<00:05:42.690> is<00:05:42.990> you<00:05:43.770> only<00:05:43.920> get<00:05:44.160> about<00:05:44.190> eleven

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
problem is you only get about eleven

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.320 
problem is you only get about eleven
litres<00:05:45.320> at<00:05:46.320> the<00:05:46.470> end<00:05:46.620> of<00:05:46.800> the<00:05:46.860> kick<00:05:47.100> so<00:05:47.610> it's

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
litres at the end of the kick so it's

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.970 
litres at the end of the kick so it's
not<00:05:48.450> going<00:05:48.660> to<00:05:48.720> hang<00:05:48.870> around<00:05:48.990> too<00:05:49.350> long<00:05:49.380> but

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
not going to hang around too long but

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.860 
not going to hang around too long but
then<00:05:50.160> again<00:05:50.280> we<00:05:50.970> don't<00:05:51.090> tend<00:05:51.390> to<00:05:51.450> have<00:05:51.540> very

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
then again we don't tend to have very

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.310 
then again we don't tend to have very
long<00:05:52.080> summers<00:05:52.610> here<00:05:53.610> in<00:05:53.730> the<00:05:53.820> UK<00:05:54.180> so<00:05:54.320> it's

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
long summers here in the UK so it's

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.230 
long summers here in the UK so it's
probably<00:05:55.590> not<00:05:55.740> too<00:05:55.950> bad<00:05:56.190> bigger<00:05:56.520> problem<00:05:56.970> but

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
probably not too bad bigger problem but

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.000 
probably not too bad bigger problem but
I'll<00:05:57.600> definitely<00:05:57.780> be<00:05:58.170> enjoying<00:05:58.680> a<00:05:58.710> few<00:05:58.890> of

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
I'll definitely be enjoying a few of

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.620 
I'll definitely be enjoying a few of
these<00:05:59.130> out<00:05:59.880> on<00:06:00.120> the<00:06:00.180> patio

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
these out on the patio

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.290 
these out on the patio
when<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.110> weather<00:06:01.290> allows<00:06:01.380> I<00:06:02.000> have<00:06:03.000> sent<00:06:03.240> a

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
when the weather allows I have sent a

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.900 
when the weather allows I have sent a
couple<00:06:03.450> of<00:06:03.660> these<00:06:03.750> out<00:06:04.020> so<00:06:04.760> you'll<00:06:05.760> probably

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
couple of these out so you'll probably

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.330 
couple of these out so you'll probably
get<00:06:06.180> some<00:06:06.440> or<00:06:07.440> you<00:06:07.620> may<00:06:07.740> see<00:06:07.800> some<00:06:08.160> other

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
get some or you may see some other

both in the bottle so it'd be

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.720
