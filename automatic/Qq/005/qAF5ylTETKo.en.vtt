I'll come back all month one more thing
but<00:03:24.700> I<00:03:24.730> just<00:03:25.150> remembered<00:03:25.540> before<00:03:25.660> I<00:03:25.930> just<00:03:26.319> put

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
but I just remembered before I just put

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.970 
but I just remembered before I just put
that<00:03:26.739> thing<00:03:26.920> up<00:03:27.069> on<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:28.239> practice<00:03:28.799> standing<00:03:29.799> up

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
that thing up on to practice standing up

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.080 
that thing up on to practice standing up
and<00:03:30.220> stand<00:03:30.640> down<00:03:30.970> shutting<00:03:31.900> down<00:03:32.079> man<00:03:32.410> I<00:03:33.090> guess

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
and stand down shutting down man I guess

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.880 
and stand down shutting down man I guess
you<00:03:34.209> could<00:03:34.239> stand<00:03:34.720> out<00:03:34.989> if<00:03:35.170> you<00:03:35.260> want<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.650> but

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
you could stand out if you want to but

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.420 
you could stand out if you want to but
um<00:03:36.190> I<00:03:36.910> don't<00:03:37.329> do<00:03:37.690> this<00:03:37.900> but<00:03:38.500> I<00:03:38.709> probably<00:03:38.950> should

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
um I don't do this but I probably should

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.069 
um I don't do this but I probably should
because<00:03:39.670> it<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.360> really<00:03:40.480> does<00:03:40.810> make<00:03:41.019> a

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
because it it really does make a

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:48.020 
because it it really does make a
difference<00:03:41.319> when<00:03:41.620> you're<00:03:41.739> standing<00:03:42.280> up
