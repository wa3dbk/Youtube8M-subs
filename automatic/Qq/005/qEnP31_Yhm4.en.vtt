to<00:00:43.710> other<00:00:43.829> things<00:00:44.190> then<00:00:44.969> once<00:00:45.300> kids<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.780> that

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
to other things then once kids have that

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.990 
to other things then once kids have that
basic<00:00:46.350> understanding<00:00:47.100> about<00:00:47.190> location<00:00:47.820> you

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
basic understanding about location you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.220

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
south when you describe things you can

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.290 
south when you describe things you can
have<00:00:56.180> arrows<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.570> walls<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.829> showing

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.630 
understand those ideas when you bring
them<00:01:11.250> into<00:01:11.400> their<00:01:11.610> daily<00:01:11.790> lives<00:01:13.400> you<00:01:14.400> also

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
them into their daily lives you also

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.420 
them into their daily lives you also
want<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:16.229> them<00:01:16.530> begin<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.920> make<00:01:17.100> maps

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
want to have them begin to make maps

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.460 
want to have them begin to make maps
they<00:01:18.090> can<00:01:18.299> make<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> map<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.869> their<00:01:18.990> classroom

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
they can make a map of their classroom

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.929 
they can make a map of their classroom
or<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.680> their<00:01:19.830> school<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.280> their<00:01:20.430> school<00:01:20.700> yard

or of their school of their school yard
they<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.659> start<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.080> plot<00:01:22.560> things<00:01:22.860> out<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
they can start to plot things out and

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.480 
they can start to plot things out and
see<00:01:23.640> how<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> represent<00:01:24.390> them<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:25.110> paper

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
see how to represent them on paper

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.890 
see how to represent them on paper
that's<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.610> good<00:01:26.790> way<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.000> them<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.420> begin<00:01:27.659> to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
that's a good way for them to begin to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.550 
that's a good way for them to begin to
understand<00:01:28.380> mapping<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:30.000> also<00:01:30.560> have

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
understand mapping you can also have

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.700 
understand mapping you can also have
them<00:01:31.850> do<00:01:32.850> games<00:01:33.680> by<00:01:35.270> giving<00:01:36.270> them<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.630> map<00:01:37.470> and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
them do games by giving them a map and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.010 
them do games by giving them a map and
then<00:01:37.799> having<00:01:38.009> them<00:01:38.220> plot<00:01:39.060> things<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.840> map

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
then having them plot things on the map

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.889 
then having them plot things on the map
they<00:01:40.560> can<00:01:40.770> also<00:01:41.240> play<00:01:42.240> games<00:01:42.479> where<00:01:42.689> they<00:01:42.810> have

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
they can also play games where they have

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.219 
they can also play games where they have
to<00:01:43.020> identify<00:01:43.229> states<00:01:44.040> or<00:01:44.340> continents<00:01:45.170> on<00:01:46.170> a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
to identify states or continents on a

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.100 
to identify states or continents on a
map<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.100> they<00:01:47.460> might<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> blank<00:01:48.210> map<00:01:48.840> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
map so they might have a blank map and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.289 
map so they might have a blank map and
they<00:01:49.200> color<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:50.729> states<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.119> they've

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
they color in the states that they've

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.060 
they color in the states that they've
visited<00:01:51.509> they<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.619> be<00:01:52.710> able<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.920> identify

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
visited they have to be able to identify

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.249 
visited they have to be able to identify
it<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.729> find<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.390> map<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.869> color<00:01:55.079> it

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
it and find it on the map and color it

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.480 
it and find it on the map and color it
in<00:01:55.969> puzzles<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.329> other<00:01:58.200> objects<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.070> have

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
in puzzles and other objects that have

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.090 
in puzzles and other objects that have
maps<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.420> them<00:02:00.780> are<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.110> good<00:02:01.530> way<00:02:01.680> for<00:02:01.710> them<00:02:02.040> to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
maps on them are a good way for them to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.850 
maps on them are a good way for them to
have<00:02:02.490> more<00:02:02.729> exposure<00:02:03.409> assembling<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.500> puzzle

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
have more exposure assembling a puzzle

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.180 
have more exposure assembling a puzzle
of<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.520> United<00:02:05.969> States<00:02:06.030> or<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.649> continent

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
of the United States or of the continent

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.010 
of the United States or of the continent
of<00:02:08.220> Europe<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.759> really<00:02:09.030> help<00:02:09.149> them<00:02:09.390> to

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
of Europe can really help them to

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.980 
of Europe can really help them to
their<00:02:11.490> understanding<00:02:12.490> of<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:13.330> locations<00:02:13.840> of

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
their understanding of the locations of

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.410 
their understanding of the locations of
things<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.680> have<00:02:14.920> practice<00:02:15.160> using<00:02:16.060> maps

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
things and to have practice using maps

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.890 
things and to have practice using maps
so<00:02:17.260> those<00:02:17.620> are<00:02:17.770> some<00:02:17.890> ideas<00:02:17.920> about<00:02:18.400> teaching

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
so those are some ideas about teaching

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.650 
so those are some ideas about teaching
kids<00:02:19.900> map<00:02:20.380> skills
