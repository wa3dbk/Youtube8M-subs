an<00:00:08.370> invitation<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.780> this<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.170> bow<00:00:10.349> we're

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
an invitation and this is the bow we're

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.240 
an invitation and this is the bow we're
looking<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.950> tie<00:00:14.059> now<00:00:15.059> I've<00:00:15.900> chosen<00:00:16.260> seven

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
looking to tie now I've chosen seven

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.640 
looking to tie now I've chosen seven
hundred<00:00:17.490> millimeter<00:00:17.880> length<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.930> ribbon<00:00:19.080> to

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
hundred millimeter length of ribbon to

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.920 
hundred millimeter length of ribbon to
wrap<00:00:19.680> around<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.520> Ivan<00:00:21.090> that's<00:00:21.210> 140

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
wrap around and Ivan that's 140

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.279 
wrap around and Ivan that's 140
millimeters<00:00:22.199> wide<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:23.789> wraps<00:00:24.090> around

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
millimeters wide it wraps around

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.890 
millimeters wide it wraps around
completely<00:00:25.289> around<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.920> item<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:27.269> there

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
completely around the item the there

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.570 
completely around the item the there
will<00:00:28.109> be<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.500> reasonable<00:00:29.070> amount<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.310> waste

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
will be a reasonable amount of waste

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.330 
will be a reasonable amount of waste
with<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.000> but<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.960> make<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.009> any<00:00:32.189> smaller

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
with this but if you make it any smaller

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.490 
with this but if you make it any smaller
you'll<00:00:32.790> probably<00:00:33.000> find<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.600> it's<00:00:34.320> difficult

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
you'll probably find that it's difficult

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.369 
you'll probably find that it's difficult
to<00:00:35.040> manipulate<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.760> bow<00:00:36.739> firstly<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:39.379> lay

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
to manipulate the bow firstly you lay

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.369 
to manipulate the bow firstly you lay
the<00:00:40.790> right-hand<00:00:41.790> end<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.149> ribbon<00:00:42.379> over

I<00:00:45.960> am<00:00:46.140> NOT<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:48.379> then<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.559> make<00:00:49.739> sure<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
I am NOT and then you make sure the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.229 
I am NOT and then you make sure the
ribbon<00:00:50.579> lies<00:00:51.149> flat<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> iron<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:53.239> usually

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
loop and then pull tightly now you can

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.690 
loop and then pull tightly now you can
take<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> paper<00:01:22.590> clip<00:01:22.890> out<00:01:23.689> and<00:01:24.689> start<00:01:25.200> to

take the paper clip out and start to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.510 
take the paper clip out and start to
manipulate<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.909> ribbon<00:01:27.380> hold<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.619> I'd<00:01:29.040> say<00:01:29.340> on

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
manipulate the ribbon hold on I'd say on

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.819 
manipulate the ribbon hold on I'd say on
this<00:01:29.670> right-hand<00:01:30.299> loop<00:01:30.780> hold<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.740> the

this right-hand loop hold on to the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.280 
this right-hand loop hold on to the
fixed<00:01:32.130> part<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> loop<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.880> pull<00:01:33.049> the<00:01:34.049> tail

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
fixed part of the loop and pull the tail

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.560 
fixed part of the loop and pull the tail
of<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.560> ribbon<00:01:34.829> until<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.880> make<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.420> about

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
of the ribbon until you make it about

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.960 
of the ribbon until you make it about
the<00:01:36.810> length<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.200> want<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:38.340> same<00:01:38.579> with

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the length that you want the same with

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.350 
the length that you want the same with
the<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:40.439> right<00:01:40.979> hand<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.700> left<00:01:41.729> hand<00:01:42.150> loop

the the right hand the left hand loop

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.069 
the the right hand the left hand loop
you<00:01:42.930> do<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.229> same<00:01:43.439> thing<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.149> you<00:01:45.149> then<00:01:45.750> you

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
you do the same thing and you then you

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.100 
you do the same thing and you then you
hold<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.710> these<00:01:46.860> two<00:01:47.250> loops<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.090> pull<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
hold on to these two loops and pull the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.310 
hold on to these two loops and pull the
tails<00:01:49.740> down<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.880> try<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.320> get<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:53.509> bow<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:55.049> sit

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
tails down to try to get the bow to sit

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.380 
tails down to try to get the bow to sit
the<00:01:55.500> way<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.680> want<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:57.649> now<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:59.009> can<00:01:59.490> cut<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the way you want it to now I can cut the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.330 
the way you want it to now I can cut the
tails<00:02:00.689> at<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.579> fancy<00:02:02.689> the<00:02:03.689> fancy<00:02:04.110> cut<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.619> I

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
tails at a fancy the fancy cut and I

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
tails at a fancy the fancy cut and I
double<00:02:05.820> up<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:07.530> ribbon<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.149> hold<00:02:09.149> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
double up the the ribbon and hold the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.770 
double up the the ribbon and hold the
scissors<00:02:10.110> at<00:02:10.349> an<00:02:10.470> angle<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
scissors at an angle and

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.910 
scissors at an angle and
cut<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:13.310> form<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.910> fancy<00:02:14.420> cut<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.530> do<00:02:15.770> the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
cut to form a fancy cut and I do the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:23.170 
cut to form a fancy cut and I do the
same<00:02:16.160> with<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:17.030> right<00:02:17.240> hand<00:02:17.569> Taylor<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:23.060> a

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
same with the right hand Taylor and a

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.540 
same with the right hand Taylor and a
little<00:02:23.540> bit<00:02:23.780> more<00:02:23.959> off<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.530> so<00:02:25.280> I'll<00:02:25.520> just

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
little bit more off that so I'll just

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:33.360 
little bit more off that so I'll just
double<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.330> other<00:02:26.480> game<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:31.239> cut<00:02:32.239> an<00:02:32.390> angle

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
double that other game and cut an angle

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.660 
double that other game and cut an angle
and<00:02:35.319> there<00:02:36.319> we<00:02:36.560> have<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:37.100> bow<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.239> we<00:02:38.360> wanted
