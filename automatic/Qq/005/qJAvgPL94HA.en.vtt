00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.099
 hello everyone today we will be again with 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.570
 I already showed you to open the stew 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.000
 this stew 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:19.100
 family budget but I showed a small 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.420
 jar and there was written grade 1 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.910
 for some reason, some viewers did not pay 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.369
 attention to the fact that the stew it was not 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.189
 top grade and 1 grade 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.719
 and started there says the whole compare it 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.370
 for some reason with the highest grade 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.079
 but it is wrong first grade it is not 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.120
 above 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.890
 but nonetheless like that stew first 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.020
 varieties 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.170
 link to the video and below who have not seen 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.030
 look here i will attach 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.510
 be sure to look it nonetheless 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.000
 it was a very good bank here 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.660
 count us 2 times more 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.510
 this is the highest grade well, but that's about we 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.330
 it was bought for 130 rubles if 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.659
 the bank cost 77 rubles here it is me 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.210
 bought for 130 but this one is generally expensive 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.650
 the store where it took it is quite 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:20.180
 maybe it's cheaper somewhere and she 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.990
 already top grade 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.549
 made by guest 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.650
 beef fat beef onion salt 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:33.030
 cooking food before black out 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.549
 laurel and everything else I want 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.009
 what to call your attention when you 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.920
 choose a stew look so that it does not 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.329
 gurgled because sometimes you take 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.930
 the jar is like that 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:49.590
 it gurgles gurgles it means there 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.990
 water water in stew should not be no 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.320
 as even when we do homework 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.380
 the stew itself water there is not formed but 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.170
 not like this bank has of course begun 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.200
 open believe me this is homemade 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:09.750
 stew no water eat meat 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.710
 broth and fat must be 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.540
 add fat as is stew 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.720
 is taken the jar lays there raw meat 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.100
 sliced 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:25.000
 salt pepper there spices to taste 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.410
 closes the lid and lays down in any 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.680
 is laid either autoclave or in 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.150
 pressure cooker is great because 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.560
 pressure cooker also provides us 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.350
 required pressure and temperature without 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.160
 pressure cookers just there in the oven or 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.020
 boil well we will not get the stew 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:50.750
 a real stew that would be kept 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:52.970
 so long so what if water there means 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.370
 that the manufacturer we cheat he go there 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:00.200
 topping up the water and well what's some soup 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.690
 I do not know the real good stew water 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.730
 should not be 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.640
 respectively, to delve into this nothing 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.500
 should not and gurgle therefore I 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.670
 I don't specifically buy these banks 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.130
 that gurgle even for the camera I'm not 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.830
 began to buy them because well, I do not want 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.180
 support such a bad thing 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.940
 manufacturer who is deceiving us 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.370
 let it taste good there 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:30.860
 these are now very chemical additives 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:38.180
 much you can make any delicious there 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:47.830
 do not poop in this let's open 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:47.830
 and see 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:04:04.450
 that's what we see here is a hole vest 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:04.450
 such a broth and meat now try 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
 delicious 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:22.570
 these look what kind of meat is natural 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:24.370
 whole lump meat is delicious here too 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.860
 fat must be put down 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:32.530
 why because otherwise we will have it 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:39.400
 Nuu severely dry not much tasty here 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:41.440
 this class is even tastier than here 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.210
 so first grade well naturally here 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:49.210
 goes and the meat is better in quality and all 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.400
 the rest of it will not warm up because 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.500
 what I have already seen on the first grade that 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.840
 stew awesome so I don't see 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.260
 sense and we prefer vodka 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.260
 cold 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.370
