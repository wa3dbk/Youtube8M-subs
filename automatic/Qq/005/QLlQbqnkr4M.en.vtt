00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
there's that full size comparison pretty

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:10.090 
there's that full size comparison pretty
close<00:01:04.780> about<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.900> same<00:01:06.080> width<00:01:06.640> as<00:01:07.640> well<00:01:09.100> but

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
close about the same width as well but

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.470 
close about the same width as well but
there's<00:01:10.310> that<00:01:10.580> for<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:10.970> first<00:01:11.210> times

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
there's that for you first times

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.980 
there's that for you first times
comparison<00:01:13.060> so<00:01:14.060> me<00:01:14.210> figures<00:01:14.540> you<00:01:14.690> get<00:01:14.810> two

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
comparison so me figures you get two

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.670 
comparison so me figures you get two
droids<00:01:15.230> with<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:16.010> original<00:01:16.490> blasters<00:01:17.000> the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
droids with the original blasters the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.710 
droids with the original blasters the
sort<00:01:18.680> of<00:01:18.740> megaphone<00:01:21.190> blaster<00:01:22.190> cannons<00:01:22.720> and

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
sort of megaphone blaster cannons and

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.170 
sort of megaphone blaster cannons and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
then you get this little thing and I

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.840 
then you get this little thing and I
seriously<00:01:26.180> have<00:01:26.600> no<00:01:26.630> idea<00:01:26.840> what<00:01:27.260> this<00:01:27.350> is<00:01:27.850> it

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
seriously have no idea what this is it

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.410 
seriously have no idea what this is it
rolls<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:29.960> then<00:01:30.890> it<00:01:31.070> opens<00:01:31.550> up<00:01:31.790> and<00:01:32.060> there's

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
rolls and then it opens up and there's

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.420 
rolls and then it opens up and there's
stuff<00:01:32.690> in<00:01:32.840> there<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.440> I<00:01:34.010> don't<00:01:34.070> know<00:01:34.220> what<00:01:34.340> it

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
stuff in there and I don't know what it

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.130

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
one of my first sets since it came out

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.380 
one of my first sets since it came out
in<00:02:52.670> 1999<00:02:53.379> a<00:02:54.379> very<00:02:54.829> good<00:02:54.980> detail<00:02:55.160> just<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.879> good

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
in 1999 a very good detail just a good

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.180 
in 1999 a very good detail just a good
design<00:02:56.780> for<00:02:57.079> ship<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:59.799> was<00:03:00.799> kind<00:03:01.010> of<00:03:01.040> hoping

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
design for ship I was kind of hoping

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.039 
design for ship I was kind of hoping
they'd<00:03:01.519> do<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:02.140> there<00:03:03.140> there<00:03:03.379> was<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.760> n64<00:03:04.760> game

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
they'd do the there there was a n64 game

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.190 
they'd do the there there was a n64 game
based<00:03:06.049> on<00:03:06.290> Phantom<00:03:07.250> Menace<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:08.180> there<00:03:08.780> was<00:03:08.959> a

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
based on Phantom Menace and there was a

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.220 
based on Phantom Menace and there was a
blue<00:03:10.299> Naboo<00:03:11.299> Starfighter<00:03:11.810> that<00:03:11.989> looked<00:03:12.170> a

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
blue Naboo Starfighter that looked a

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.229 
blue Naboo Starfighter that looked a
little<00:03:12.260> bit<00:03:12.440> different<00:03:12.739> than<00:03:12.829> this<00:03:12.920> one<00:03:13.239> and

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
little bit different than this one and

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.849 
little bit different than this one and
Lego<00:03:14.870> never<00:03:15.049> made<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.319> now<00:03:15.650> it's<00:03:15.739> gonna

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
Lego never made that now it's gonna

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.780 
Lego never made that now it's gonna
hoping<00:03:16.129> it<00:03:16.250> would<00:03:17.049> well<00:03:18.049> anyways<00:03:18.639> some<00:03:19.639> other

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
hoping it would well anyways some other

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.280 
hoping it would well anyways some other

you keep it perfectly flat it's good but
it<00:04:11.209> does<00:04:11.329> tip<00:04:11.569> really<00:04:11.840> easily<00:04:12.549> you<00:04:13.549> can<00:04:13.699> see

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
it does tip really easily you can see

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.409 
it does tip really easily you can see
and<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:14.959> spins<00:04:15.199> really<00:04:15.349> easy<00:04:16.239> well<00:04:17.239> there's

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
and it spins really easy well there's

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.430 
and it spins really easy well there's
that<00:04:19.180> so<00:04:20.180> yeah<00:04:20.449> if<00:04:20.599> you<00:04:20.690> can<00:04:20.840> find<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:21.140> I'd<00:04:21.289> go
