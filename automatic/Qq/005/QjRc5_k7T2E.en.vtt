00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
that with us once we'd really figured

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.280 
that with us once we'd really figured
out<00:00:32.940> where<00:00:33.940> our<00:00:34.120> story<00:00:34.329> went<00:00:34.690> where<00:00:34.960> it<00:00:34.989> wound

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
out where our story went where it wound

up what Bruce's a conclusion is in a

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.860 
up what Bruce's a conclusion is in a
sense<00:00:39.100> then<00:00:40.030> it<00:00:40.059> became<00:00:40.329> something<00:00:40.540> I<00:00:40.690> had<00:00:40.840> to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
sense then it became something I had to

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.200 
sense then it became something I had to
do<00:00:41.140> and<00:00:41.380> really<00:00:42.370> wanted<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:42.760> show<00:00:42.969> to<00:00:43.030> the

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.800 
characters in a pretty interesting place
I<00:01:04.739> felt<00:01:05.730> very<00:01:05.790> strongly<00:01:06.120> we're<00:01:06.540> trying<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
I felt very strongly we're trying to

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.870 
I felt very strongly we're trying to
make<00:01:06.900> one<00:01:07.080> unified<00:01:07.470> story<00:01:07.830> here<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.370> it's<00:01:08.760> not

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
make one unified story here so it's not

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.630 
make one unified story here so it's not
another<00:01:09.120> you<00:01:09.510> know<00:01:09.600> episode<00:01:10.050> and<00:01:10.640> another

the<00:01:47.640> jumping-off<00:01:48.000> point<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> story

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
the jumping-off point for the story

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.109 
the jumping-off point for the story
really<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.020> how<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.130> person<00:01:50.640> who<00:01:50.850> has

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
really is how can this person who has

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.570 
really is how can this person who has
become<00:01:51.680> disconnected<00:01:52.680> who<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.160> in<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.369> sort<00:01:53.550> of

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
become disconnected who is in a sort of

become disconnected who is in a sort of
self-imposed<00:01:54.210> exile<00:01:54.810> from<00:01:55.100> society<00:01:56.100> how<00:01:56.250> can

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
self-imposed exile from society how can

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:06.640 
self-imposed exile from society how can
he<00:01:56.550> reconnect<00:01:57.090> with<00:01:57.149> life
