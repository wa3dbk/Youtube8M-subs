00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.609
 Hello everyone in this video I am short 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.550
 I will tell what is my tea for what we 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.639
 apply mulch is a protective layer 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.660
 which we lay on the ground is laid 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.199
 after planting our seedlings 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.650
 mulching is a good way 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.100
 turn poor soil into mischief 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.390
 soil plants even if 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.910
 form well envy then just 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.340
 losing them the same case is mulching well 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.539
 plant root system develops 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.690
 I feel very good 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.649
 develop as an organic 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.340
 mulches use a variety of materials 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:43.579
 straw sawdust manure feather 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.300
 plant residues from weeds 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:51.180
 needles fallen leaves poop from under the seeds 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.460
 tormenting what is common need mulch the most 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.500
 most importantly it retains moisture in the soil 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.750
 reduces weeds 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.050
 prevents burnt out soil in summer and 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.680
 freezing in winter prevents erosion 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.400
 soil crust formation on the soil that 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.560
 improves water absorption into the soil 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.270
 preserves soil looseness 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.979
 the soil is constantly loose and constantly 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.470
 wet and what was hot weather not 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.250
 was 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.250
 right now I 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:27.569
 do u have mulch and see earth land 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:30.789
 the look is constantly wet 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:33.149
 soft wet earth and crumbles into 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.149
 hands 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:42.009
 the mulch plant forms a large 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.460
 large number of adventitious roots 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.960
 her husband, as if to pour all here because 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.720
 that it is gradually recycled 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.610
 ground and feeds its level 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.970
 optimal level of mulch should be 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.970
 57 centimeters if you leave 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.090
 man of winter must be in spring 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.680
 take it to the earth warmed up 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.680
 thank you all for watching bye
