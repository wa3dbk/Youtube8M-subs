then to finish off I'll be adding in an
isolation<00:00:25.289> exercise<00:00:25.859> bringing<00:00:26.519> about<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
isolation exercise bringing about the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.460 
isolation exercise bringing about the
leg<00:00:27.090> attachment<00:00:27.689> over<00:00:27.900> there<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.260> work

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
leg attachment over there on the work

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.160 
leg attachment over there on the work
bench<00:00:28.640> first<00:00:29.640> off<00:00:29.849> we'll<00:00:30.420> be<00:00:30.480> doing<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.900> single

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
bench first off we'll be doing a single

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.319 
bench first off we'll be doing a single
leg<00:00:31.590> lunge<00:00:31.920> run<00:00:32.130> here<00:00:32.309> really<00:00:32.880> develop<00:00:33.300> that

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
leg lunge run here really develop that

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.540 
leg lunge run here really develop that
outer<00:00:34.079> sweep<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.770> hit<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> hamstring<00:00:35.460> and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
outer sweep and hit the hamstring and

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:47.170 
outer sweep and hit the hamstring and
glute<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.329> let's<00:00:36.600> get<00:00:36.690> into<00:00:36.930> it

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:01:04.460 

Oh

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.810 

now<00:01:05.470> of<00:01:05.619> course<00:01:05.650> I'm<00:01:06.159> sure<00:01:06.340> you<00:01:06.430> see<00:01:06.610> many

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
now of course I'm sure you see many

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.120 
now of course I'm sure you see many
people<00:01:06.880> do<00:01:07.360> lunges<00:01:07.720> with<00:01:08.409> either<00:01:08.680> dumbbells

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
people do lunges with either dumbbells

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.880 
people do lunges with either dumbbells
or<00:01:09.250> barbells<00:01:09.369> in<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.240> gym<00:01:10.479> but<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:11.500> benefit

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
or barbells in the gym but the benefit

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.219 
or barbells in the gym but the benefit
of<00:01:11.920> doing<00:01:12.190> it<00:01:12.430> on<00:01:12.610> a<00:01:12.640> plate<00:01:13.060> loaded<00:01:13.270> machine<00:01:13.720> is

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
of doing it on a plate loaded machine is

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.399 
of doing it on a plate loaded machine is
that<00:01:14.920> a<00:01:15.070> with<00:01:15.610> that<00:01:15.820> incline<00:01:16.270> plate<00:01:16.570> really

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
that a with that incline plate really

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.680 
that a with that incline plate really
keeps<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.979> resistance<00:01:18.729> that<00:01:18.909> increases<00:01:19.540> the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
keeps the resistance that increases the

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.840 
keeps the resistance that increases the
tension<00:01:20.250> overloading<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.340> front<00:01:21.610> part<00:01:21.820> the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
tension overloading the front part the

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.120 
tension overloading the front part the
teardrop<00:01:22.360> here<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:22.899> by<00:01:23.530> bringing<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.890> back

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
teardrop here and by bringing the back

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.880 
teardrop here and by bringing the back
leg<00:01:24.369> back<00:01:24.580> down<00:01:25.330> and<00:01:26.110> with<00:01:26.440> it<00:01:26.530> being<00:01:26.560> lower

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
leg back down and with it being lower

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.399 
leg back down and with it being lower
than<00:01:26.920> this<00:01:27.310> foot<00:01:27.820> step<00:01:28.090> it<00:01:28.119> really<00:01:29.080> keeps<00:01:29.259> all

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
than this foot step it really keeps all

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.590 
than this foot step it really keeps all
of<00:01:29.500> that<00:01:29.649> weight<00:01:29.890> over<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.909> hamstring<00:01:31.390> and

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.750 

coughs<00:02:47.770> are<00:02:48.010> getting<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.190> good<00:02:48.340> workout<00:02:48.700> in

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
coughs are getting a good workout in

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.140 
coughs are getting a good workout in
here<00:02:49.000> too<00:02:49.319> and<00:02:50.340> slow<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:51.520> tempo<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:51.940> down

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
here too and slow that tempo it down

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.090 
here too and slow that tempo it down
really<00:02:52.480> squeeze<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.260> engage<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.740> muscle

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
really squeeze and engage the muscle

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:15.780 
really squeeze and engage the muscle
every<00:02:54.760> time<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.090> push<00:02:55.300> back<00:02:55.480> up

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.590 

Wow

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.910 

so<00:03:22.600> just<00:03:22.960> that<00:03:23.170> simple

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
so just that simple

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.650 
so just that simple
change<00:03:24.340> they're<00:03:24.670> switching<00:03:25.090> up<00:03:25.180> adding<00:03:25.540> in

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
change they're switching up adding in

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.960 
change they're switching up adding in
that<00:03:25.840> new<00:03:26.050> dynamic<00:03:26.560> or<00:03:26.980> shifting<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.730> toes

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
that new dynamic or shifting the toes

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.820 
that new dynamic or shifting the toes
around<00:03:28.120> really<00:03:29.080> can<00:03:29.290> make<00:03:29.410> quite<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.650> big

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
around really can make quite a big

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.340 
around really can make quite a big
difference<00:03:29.950> in<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:31.240> part<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.780> leg<00:03:31.990> that

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
difference in the part of the leg that

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.900 
difference in the part of the leg that
you're<00:03:32.470> working<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:33.040> going<00:03:33.250> that<00:03:33.430> little<00:03:33.820> bit

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
you're working and going that little bit

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.670 
you're working and going that little bit
lower<00:03:34.090> than<00:03:34.300> you<00:03:34.420> might<00:03:34.600> do<00:03:34.810> if<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.440> always

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
lower than you might do if you always

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.590 
lower than you might do if you always
focusing<00:03:36.190> on<00:03:36.250> going<00:03:36.490> a<00:03:36.550> heavy<00:03:36.790> weight<00:03:37.000> will

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
focusing on going a heavy weight will

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.940 
focusing on going a heavy weight will
allow<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:38.020> get<00:03:38.110> that<00:03:38.260> extra<00:03:38.530> tie<00:03:38.890> in

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
allow you to get that extra tie in

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.160 
allow you to get that extra tie in
bringing<00:03:39.730> in<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.880> hamstring<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.600> glute

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
bringing in the hamstring and the glute

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.990 
bringing in the hamstring and the glute
so<00:03:41.560> every<00:03:41.830> now<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.100> again<00:03:42.130> drop<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.850> weight

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
so every now and again drop the weight

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.480 
so every now and again drop the weight
down<00:03:43.210> go<00:03:43.870> a<00:03:43.900> little<00:03:44.230> bit<00:03:44.440> lower<00:03:44.620> just<00:03:44.950> make

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
down go a little bit lower just make

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.740 
down go a little bit lower just make
sure<00:03:45.610> that<00:03:45.670> you<00:03:45.880> have<00:03:46.000> your<00:03:46.150> feet<00:03:46.420> in<00:03:46.600> the

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
sure that you have your feet in the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.780 
sure that you have your feet in the
right<00:03:46.780> position<00:03:47.290> so<00:03:47.470> that<00:03:47.800> your<00:03:48.040> knees<00:03:48.250> are

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
right position so that your knees are

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.790 
right position so that your knees are
not<00:03:49.000> pushing<00:03:49.270> over<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.020> toes<00:03:50.200> that'll<00:03:50.709> keep

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
not pushing over the toes that'll keep

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.830 
not pushing over the toes that'll keep
all<00:03:51.010> of<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.190> weight<00:03:51.340> firmly<00:03:51.790> on<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.420> legs<00:03:52.600> we

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
all of the weight firmly on the legs we

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.110 
all of the weight firmly on the legs we
should<00:03:53.080> be<00:03:53.200> working<00:03:53.520> time<00:03:54.520> to<00:03:54.670> move<00:03:54.790> over<00:03:55.060> to

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
should be working time to move over to

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.330 
should be working time to move over to
our<00:03:55.270> third<00:03:55.739> exercising<00:03:56.739> for<00:03:56.830> this<00:03:56.950> one<00:03:57.160> an

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
our third exercising for this one an

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.030 
our third exercising for this one an
isolation<00:03:58.300> leg<00:03:58.510> extension<00:03:59.230> again<00:03:59.830> really

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
isolation leg extension again really

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.010 
isolation leg extension again really
working<00:04:00.340> on<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.520> teardrop<00:04:01.000> and<00:04:01.150> trying<00:04:01.810> some

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
working on the teardrop and trying some

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.530 
working on the teardrop and trying some
hamstring<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.800> quad<00:04:03.550> separation<00:04:04.120> at<00:04:04.360> the

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
hamstring and quad separation at the

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.320 
hamstring and quad separation at the
same<00:04:04.690> time<00:04:08.040> leg<00:04:09.040> extension<00:04:09.700> is<00:04:09.820> probably<00:04:10.120> one

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
same time leg extension is probably one

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.960 
same time leg extension is probably one
of<00:04:10.360> the<00:04:10.510> best<00:04:10.660> exercises<00:04:10.840> for<00:04:11.590> really

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
of the best exercises for really

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.160 
of the best exercises for really
defining<00:04:12.970> an<00:04:13.090> adding<00:04:13.360> conditioning<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:14.080> the

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
defining an adding conditioning to the

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.050 
defining an adding conditioning to the
legs<00:04:14.350> beside<00:04:15.010> a<00:04:15.040> big<00:04:15.250> movement<00:04:15.489> like<00:04:15.820> the

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
legs beside a big movement like the

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.420 
legs beside a big movement like the
squat<00:04:16.359> but<00:04:16.900> we're<00:04:17.049> saving<00:04:17.260> this<00:04:17.470> one<00:04:17.680> for<00:04:18.340> the

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
squat but we're saving this one for the

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.890 
squat but we're saving this one for the
end<00:04:18.549> because<00:04:18.940> with<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.359> big<00:04:19.510> compound

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
end because with the big compound

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.659 
end because with the big compound
movement<00:04:20.320> from<00:04:20.500> doing<00:04:20.769> that<00:04:20.919> step<00:04:21.310> back<00:04:21.489> lunge

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
movement from doing that step back lunge

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.740 
movement from doing that step back lunge
and<00:04:22.000> then<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:23.040> four-legged<00:04:24.040> leg<00:04:24.640> press<00:04:24.940> we

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
and then the four-legged leg press we

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.870 
and then the four-legged leg press we
don't<00:04:25.900> have<00:04:26.050> as<00:04:26.169> much<00:04:26.320> energy<00:04:26.560> left<00:04:26.830> in<00:04:27.610> the

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
don't have as much energy left in the

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.909 
don't have as much energy left in the
muscles<00:04:28.270> so<00:04:28.390> this<00:04:28.570> allows<00:04:28.870> us<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:29.229> isolate<00:04:29.410> and

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
muscles so this allows us to isolate and

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.030 
muscles so this allows us to isolate and
really<00:04:30.100> focus<00:04:30.400> on<00:04:30.490> what<00:04:30.550> we<00:04:30.790> have<00:04:30.940> left

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
really focus on what we have left

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.020 
really focus on what we have left
again<00:04:33.040> slight<00:04:33.340> difference<00:04:33.700> we're<00:04:33.850> going<00:04:33.970> to

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
again slight difference we're going to

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.969 
again slight difference we're going to
angle<00:04:34.270> those<00:04:34.419> toes<00:04:34.690> outwards<00:04:35.380> focusing<00:04:35.860> on

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
angle those toes outwards focusing on

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.680 
angle those toes outwards focusing on
more<00:04:36.100> this<00:04:36.310> teardrop<00:04:36.760> helping<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.360> add<00:04:37.510> some

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
more this teardrop helping to add some

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.190 
more this teardrop helping to add some
separation<00:04:37.900> between<00:04:38.800> these<00:04:39.100> major<00:04:39.430> four<00:04:40.300> quad

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
muscles but again by bringing it all the

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.900 
muscles but again by bringing it all the
way<00:04:43.870> up<00:04:44.050> like<00:04:44.290> that<00:04:44.620> fully<00:04:45.400> stretching<00:04:45.820> out

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
way up like that fully stretching out

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.719 
without allowing the weight to touch
back<00:04:59.290> this<00:04:59.590> will<00:04:59.770> again<00:04:59.950> keep<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.340> tension

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
back this will again keep the tension

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.750 
back this will again keep the tension
high<00:05:00.970> on<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:01.810> legs<00:05:02.020> and<00:05:02.260> by<00:05:03.040> increasing<00:05:03.700> the

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
weight up and each work set allowing you

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.250 
weight up and each work set allowing you
to<00:05:05.620> overload<00:05:06.100> the<00:05:06.250> muscle<00:05:06.610> we<00:05:07.450> really<00:05:07.720> tax<00:05:08.020> it

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
to overload the muscle we really tax it

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:41.310 
to overload the muscle we really tax it
as<00:05:08.890> you<00:05:09.130> hit<00:05:09.340> your<00:05:09.550> training<00:05:09.880> threshold

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.960 

one<00:05:42.320> more<00:05:42.500> tip<00:05:42.710> and<00:05:43.070> that's<00:05:43.250> through<00:05:43.520> the<00:05:43.550> toes

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
one more tip and that's through the toes

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.990 
one more tip and that's through the toes
keeping<00:05:44.960> the<00:05:45.050> toes<00:05:45.260> pulled<00:05:45.770> in<00:05:45.950> will<00:05:46.820> help

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
keeping the toes pulled in will help

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.900 
keeping the toes pulled in will help
lengthen<00:05:47.440> the<00:05:48.440> calf<00:05:48.680> muscle<00:05:49.130> and<00:05:49.400> also<00:05:49.790> the

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.790 
lengthen the calf muscle and also the
hamstrings<00:05:50.360> so<00:05:50.570> even<00:05:51.290> when<00:05:51.410> you<00:05:51.500> learn<00:05:51.680> the

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
hamstrings so even when you learn the

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.320 
hamstrings so even when you learn the
way<00:05:51.890> back<00:05:52.100> down<00:05:52.310> try<00:05:52.760> to<00:05:52.790> keep<00:05:52.880> those<00:05:53.060> toes

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
way back down try to keep those toes

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.090 
way back down try to keep those toes
pulled<00:05:53.870> up<00:05:53.960> upwards<00:05:54.380> towards<00:05:54.740> your

helping<00:05:56.060> to<00:05:56.210> lengthen<00:05:56.540> these<00:05:56.720> muscles

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
helping to lengthen these muscles

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.740 
helping to lengthen these muscles
engaging<00:05:57.890> them<00:05:58.220> even<00:05:58.550> more<00:05:58.700> and<00:05:59.300> recruiting

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
engaging them even more and recruiting

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.810 
engaging them even more and recruiting
them<00:05:59.870> as<00:06:00.080> a<00:06:00.140> part<00:06:00.290> of<00:06:00.320> this<00:06:00.410> movement<00:06:00.650> so<00:06:01.610> again

three exercises focus on slowing down

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.330 
three exercises focus on slowing down
the<00:06:04.730> tempo<00:06:05.150> going<00:06:05.960> a<00:06:06.080> little<00:06:06.230> bit<00:06:06.410> lower<00:06:06.650> maybe

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
the tempo going a little bit lower maybe

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.980 
the tempo going a little bit lower maybe
not<00:06:07.580> quite<00:06:07.790> as<00:06:08.000> heavy<00:06:08.240> on<00:06:08.450> the<00:06:08.570> weight<00:06:08.690> that<00:06:08.900> he

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
not quite as heavy on the weight that he

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.350 
not quite as heavy on the weight that he
might<00:06:09.170> normally<00:06:09.500> lift<00:06:09.860> and<00:06:10.220> angle<00:06:11.030> the<00:06:11.150> toes

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
might normally lift and angle the toes

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.180 
might normally lift and angle the toes
outwards<00:06:12.020> putting<00:06:12.680> them<00:06:12.770> up

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
outwards putting them up
