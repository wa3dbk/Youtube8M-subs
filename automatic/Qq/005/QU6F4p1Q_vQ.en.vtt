00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
the calories from those food now that we

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.360 
the calories from those food now that we
have<00:05:36.990> the<00:05:37.080> food<00:05:37.289> selected<00:05:37.770> we<00:05:37.889> just<00:05:38.099> have<00:05:38.250> to

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
have the food selected we just have to

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.360 
have the food selected we just have to
enter<00:05:38.699> the<00:05:38.970> grams<00:05:39.240> so<00:05:39.630> let's<00:05:39.840> put<00:05:40.110> in<00:05:40.199> 50<00:05:40.740> grams

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
enter the grams so let's put in 50 grams

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.950 
enter the grams so let's put in 50 grams
of<00:05:41.699> steak<00:05:42.330> let's<00:05:43.259> put<00:05:43.530> in<00:05:43.680> maybe<00:05:44.159> say<00:05:44.610> 30<00:05:44.970> grams

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
of steak let's put in maybe say 30 grams

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.460 
of steak let's put in maybe say 30 grams
and<00:05:46.470> then<00:05:46.680> four<00:05:47.009> eggs<00:05:47.270> 106<00:05:48.270> grams<00:05:48.419> because<00:05:48.840> one

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
and then four eggs 106 grams because one

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.920 
and then four eggs 106 grams because one
egg<00:05:49.650> is<00:05:49.830> 53<00:05:50.669> grams<00:05:50.909> and<00:05:51.360> so<00:05:51.389> that<00:05:51.659> just<00:05:51.870> shows

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
egg is 53 grams and so that just shows

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.570 
egg is 53 grams and so that just shows
you<00:05:52.080> on<00:05:52.349> the<00:05:52.440> carton<00:05:52.800> so<00:05:52.979> we'll<00:05:53.070> put<00:05:53.220> two<00:05:53.400> eggs

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
you on the carton so we'll put two eggs

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.749 
you on the carton so we'll put two eggs
so<00:05:54.270> as<00:05:54.389> you<00:05:54.479> can<00:05:54.570> see<00:05:54.810> our<00:05:55.110> protein<00:05:55.919> from<00:05:56.550> this

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 
so as you can see our protein from this

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:00.649 
so as you can see our protein from this
quantities<00:05:57.389> is<00:05:57.659> 34<00:05:58.289> grams<00:05:58.560> and<00:05:59.039> we<00:05:59.759> are<00:06:00.150> in<00:06:00.509> a

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659 
quantities is 34 grams and we are in a

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.810 
quantities is 34 grams and we are in a
deficit<00:06:01.169> of<00:06:01.199> seven<00:06:01.830> so<00:06:02.070> we<00:06:02.159> need<00:06:02.310> to<00:06:02.430> add<00:06:02.550> more

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
deficit of seven so we need to add more

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.879 
deficit of seven so we need to add more
protein<00:06:03.300> to<00:06:03.630> this<00:06:03.750> meal<00:06:03.990> so<00:06:04.020> let's<00:06:04.440> bump<00:06:04.710> this

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
protein to this meal so let's bump this

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.939 
protein to this meal so let's bump this
up<00:06:04.949> to<00:06:05.130> 70<00:06:06.000> grams<00:06:06.210> of<00:06:06.570> beef<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:07.139> there<00:06:07.710> you<00:06:07.800> go

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
up to 70 grams of beef and there you go

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.330 
up to 70 grams of beef and there you go
we<00:06:08.430> have<00:06:08.460> 40<00:06:08.909> grams<00:06:09.150> of<00:06:09.510> protein<00:06:10.320> we<00:06:10.800> have<00:06:10.830> 36

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
we have 40 grams of protein we have 36

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.940 
we have 40 grams of protein we have 36
grams<00:06:11.639> of<00:06:11.820> fats

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
grams of fats

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.920 
grams of fats
this<00:06:13.040> hits<00:06:13.370> our<00:06:13.610> goal<00:06:14.030> as<00:06:14.180> you<00:06:14.300> can<00:06:14.390> see<00:06:14.540> zero

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
this hits our goal as you can see zero

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.080 
this hits our goal as you can see zero
zero<00:06:15.710> and<00:06:16.010> there's<00:06:16.370> a<00:06:16.400> little<00:06:16.490> bit<00:06:16.610> of<00:06:16.670> carbs

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
zero and there's a little bit of carbs

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.430 
zero and there's a little bit of carbs
in<00:06:17.180> this<00:06:17.330> meal<00:06:17.510> even<00:06:17.870> though<00:06:17.960> we<00:06:18.080> don't<00:06:18.290> want

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
in this meal even though we don't want

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.590 
in this meal even though we don't want
carbs<00:06:18.740> but<00:06:18.860> that<00:06:19.040> is<00:06:19.280> natural<00:06:19.790> forms<00:06:20.180> of<00:06:20.270> carbs

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
carbs but that is natural forms of carbs

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.700 
carbs but that is natural forms of carbs
so<00:06:20.660> we're<00:06:20.810> not<00:06:20.900> going<00:06:21.050> to<00:06:21.110> worry<00:06:21.290> about<00:06:21.440> that

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
so we're not going to worry about that

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.850 
so we're not going to worry about that
so<00:06:22.250> there<00:06:22.460> is<00:06:22.670> our<00:06:23.240> quantities<00:06:23.930> we<00:06:24.140> want<00:06:24.410> this

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
so there is our quantities we want this

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.620 
so there is our quantities we want this
is<00:06:25.010> what<00:06:25.160> we<00:06:25.280> way<00:06:25.700> out<00:06:25.880> in<00:06:26.060> food<00:06:26.300> scales
