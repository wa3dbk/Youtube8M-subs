we're<00:00:06.299> looking<00:00:06.390> at<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.720> video<00:00:06.899> from<00:00:07.259> the

new design from Veneto called air step

new design from Veneto called air step
the<00:00:22.890> simple<00:00:23.189> fact<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.640> all<00:00:24.119> boat<00:00:24.390> hulls

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the simple fact is that all boat hulls

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.900 
the simple fact is that all boat hulls
no<00:00:24.900> matter<00:00:25.080> how<00:00:25.350> large<00:00:25.650> or<00:00:25.830> small<00:00:25.890> create<00:00:26.670> drag

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
no matter how large or small create drag

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.060 
no matter how large or small create drag
as<00:00:27.180> they<00:00:27.330> travel<00:00:27.689> through<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.930> water<00:00:28.140> this

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
as they travel through the water this

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.980 
as they travel through the water this
drag<00:00:29.369> affects<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> boat<00:00:30.029> speed<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.660> how<00:00:30.840> much

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
drag affects the boat speed and how much

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.450 
drag affects the boat speed and how much
power<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.410> needs<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.800> move<00:00:31.920> through<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> water

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
power it needs to move through the water

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.639 
power it needs to move through the water
the<00:00:33.390> traditional<00:00:33.899> approach<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.140> dealing<00:00:34.530> with

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
the traditional approach to dealing with

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.380 
the traditional approach to dealing with
this<00:00:34.860> drag<00:00:35.130> has<00:00:35.340> been<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.610> modify<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.059> shape

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
this drag has been to modify the shape

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.410 
this drag has been to modify the shape
of<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> hull<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.020> add<00:00:37.440> more<00:00:37.649> horsepower

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
of the hull and add more horsepower

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.700 
of the hull and add more horsepower

approach they chose to reduce the drag
