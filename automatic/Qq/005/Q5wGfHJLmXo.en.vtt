 for example that we are the last oscar in mobile technology we are 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.660
 talking about a touch terminal the design is very different than what up 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.400
 the date we had in the market their countries nor finished with a design 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.310
 renewed mukuru pirineo both the lower part and the upper court assaulted 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.179
 then the body is aluminum, the tennis player is ultra-resistant 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.660
 very light in spite of having the children nor 0 the details also says side 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.540
 dark madóz also blew makes very very different 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.700
 and then years of theology what stands out most perhaps what most surprises 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.500
 consumer is the optics carl zeiss 12-megapixel lens with the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.130
 placebo is worth it is second generation with four themes dominance 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.690
 in a smaller size and also 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.000
 not only are the 12 megapixels per se but also what size of the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.380
 pixel tam building top 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.040
 also has 720p high-definition recording at 30 frames per 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.170
 second and work outside both with what is the microphone the rear as with 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.400
 the microphone 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.299
 then what is the screen is showing a screen 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:13.659
 Peeters with 5 inches capacitive multi-touch voucher so at the level of 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.819
 fact that they are the applications because we can make the most of what is 

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:20.090
 he awarded 3 to all the fingers on the screen 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.200
 we are also talking of course all 3g connectivity and wi-fi cescon 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.040
 5g and other gps accelerometer that lets you of course rotate the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.040
 screen and what 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.180
 LOL 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.940
 marek who can percent maybe the counter as alleged command of assassins 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.910
 we have also discussed the whole part d in the internal peace of the double processor 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.800
 has a central well that is a murderers rm 80 megahertz and also a 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.170
 processor for the basic part that is the one that manages the whole part of the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.220
 graphic interaction with the terminal 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.780
 of course it has everything that is the interface of this operating symbian 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.320
 loan Saturday the new symbian 3 ie it is an improved fire more 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.730
 fast that allows to manage everything that are the characteristics of the 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.029
 terminal in a much more fluid way 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:12.349
 percent the poplar and even what is able to live and is the most 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.469
 It stands out for the final, because we are talking about a very good optics 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.969
 but also the high definition recording but also the output 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.769
 well of me do not help me is done directly with the dog 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.249
 connector that is in the area in the upper flap is worth 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:29.349
 with which you could connect connect a terminal or a 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.259
 comic better connect it to a 720p high definition monitor 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.459
 NATO and its people take advantage of the Treviso city that has its own with experts 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.129
 with 5 millimeters with which I could do it from 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.929
 different ways 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:46.259
 the wolf also have what is the connector like minibus r for the part 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:49.469
 d dane data connectivity a peculiarity of this meeting 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:54.149
 microbuses once is that you have your st on the go pocoyó 'for the farac i a hard drive 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:58.319
 external or puma key you externally directly and then this time I 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.359
 you recognize 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.359
 the contents that exist at that time in which the court 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.689
 what we have more then we have the connectors as the typical thing to block 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:07.710
 the screen 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.889
 the volume the photography part as we said 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.250
 ip why he what is the part d of access to the menu 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.760
 this is typical a peculiarity that we do not have the buttons of which after 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.130
 dosed call orders and he min ko place because this case physically 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.340
 with the interface of the menu itself determine
