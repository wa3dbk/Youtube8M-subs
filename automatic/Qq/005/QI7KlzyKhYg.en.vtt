00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.330 
the locks we used their their their
design<00:01:42.320> where<00:01:42.650> you<00:01:42.680> cannot<00:01:42.950> get<00:01:43.070> a<00:01:43.130> bolt

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
design where you cannot get a bolt

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.800 
design where you cannot get a bolt
cutter<00:01:43.400> around<00:01:43.850> them<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:44.119> you<00:01:44.210> can't<00:01:44.420> cut<00:01:44.659> the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
cutter around them so you can't cut the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.730 
cutter around them so you can't cut the
locks<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.729> gauge<00:01:47.479> is<00:01:47.720> still<00:01:47.990> we<00:01:48.200> use<00:01:48.409> is

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
locks the the gauge is still we use is

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.990 
locks the the gauge is still we use is
sticking<00:01:49.070> up<00:01:49.159> to<00:01:49.280> where<00:01:49.400> you'd<00:01:49.520> have<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:49.820> have

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
sticking up to where you'd have to have

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.899 
sticking up to where you'd have to have
a<00:01:50.360> pretty<00:01:51.140> good-sized<00:01:51.590> saw<00:01:52.130> with<00:01:52.580> a<00:01:52.610> metal

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
a pretty good-sized saw with a metal

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.330 
a pretty good-sized saw with a metal
blade<00:01:53.060> on<00:01:53.299> it<00:01:53.479> it's<00:01:54.080> actually<00:01:54.500> you<00:01:54.680> know<00:01:54.830> break

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
blade on it it's actually you know break

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.569 
blade on it it's actually you know break
into<00:01:55.640> our<00:01:55.670> cages<00:01:56.290> and<00:01:57.290> plus<00:01:58.159> they're<00:01:58.369> there

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
into our cages and plus they're there

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.399 
into our cages and plus they're there
they're<00:01:58.880> bolted<00:01:59.299> down<00:01:59.450> in<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.810> stationary

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
they're bolted down in the stationary

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.039 
they're bolted down in the stationary
and<00:02:00.650> concrete<00:02:01.299> there's<00:02:02.299> some<00:02:02.450> preset<00:02:02.930> in

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
and concrete there's some preset in

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.469 
and concrete there's some preset in
concrete<00:02:03.439> so<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.340> feel<00:02:04.520> you<00:02:04.700> physically

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
concrete so you feel you physically

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.100 
concrete so you feel you physically
can't<00:02:05.720> move<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:06.020> cage

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
can't move the cage

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.320 
can't move the cage
it's<00:02:07.380> stationary<00:02:07.940> pretty<00:02:08.940> much<00:02:09.060> where<00:02:09.240> it

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
it's stationary pretty much where it

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.870 
it's stationary pretty much where it
sits<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:09.990> it's<00:02:10.860> proven<00:02:11.280> effective<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.850> far

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
sits so it's proven effective so far

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.590 
sits so it's proven effective so far
