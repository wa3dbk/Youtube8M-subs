00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
live in brown I really in this year this

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.780 
live in brown I really in this year this
season<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.620> really<00:03:24.130> like<00:03:24.280> it<00:03:24.459> this<00:03:24.609> is<00:03:24.760> a

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
season so I really like it this is a

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.150 
season so I really like it this is a
numero<00:03:25.420> honey<00:03:25.660> if<00:03:25.900> anyways<00:03:26.260> asking<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:26.889> I<00:03:26.950> got

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
numero honey if anyways asking and I got

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.420 
numero honey if anyways asking and I got
it<00:03:27.310> in<00:03:28.230> size<00:03:30.959> extra<00:03:31.959> large<00:03:31.989> but<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.130> fits<00:03:33.340> like

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
it in size extra large but it fits like

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.280 
it in size extra large but it fits like
a<00:03:33.549> large<00:03:34.019> which<00:03:35.019> will<00:03:35.170> get<00:03:35.290> all<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.560> enemies

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
a large which will get all the enemies

a large which will get all the enemies
so<00:03:36.920> this<00:03:37.700> is<00:03:37.849> another<00:03:38.680> think<00:03:39.680> this<00:03:39.829> is<00:03:39.980> numero

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370
