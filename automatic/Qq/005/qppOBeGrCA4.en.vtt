00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.010
 hello everyone means in this video like 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.679
 would tell you how to make 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.929
 training leader for training on 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.030
 grass and strictly speaking 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:17.679
 I have already shot a couple of previous videos 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.679
 weeks ago during this time 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.700
 I have some kind of practice 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.800
 some experience here some information 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:29.419
 additional last video is not enough 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.160
 of course came out today but I myself 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.870
 looked and in addition I want 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.690
 tell how to do training 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.780
 leader here because well in principle for 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.550
 killings so let's say buy leaders by 5 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.379
 dollars is not particularly cost-effective i think 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.480
 that's not very profitable them elementary 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.479
 can be imposed from some old woods 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.110
 and of course one of my mistakes was 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:57.589
 This is what I trained on asphalt and 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.489
 of course on asphalt but not wrong 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.610
 are confused 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.559
 that the cord that the user but no matter what 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.510
 one thing the other is very much killed 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:10.280
 since it pays clear what works 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.600
 like sandpaper here by cord leader this 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.020
 Of course consumables but the cord is 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.990
 develops this very frustrating but the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.330
 no less I had a mistake i hope 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.950
 that you will not have me therefore 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.200
 exercise better on the grass 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.719
 but why I did not train on the grass 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.619
 because I have very, very confused 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:33.409
 the leader is strongly about grass and constantly 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.719
 Islands are some small bushes 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.469
 some blade of grass constantly traval 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:44.390
 ohmuha well my imitation can say so 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:47.899
 here and literally here recently 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.789
 going to the store where I bought everything 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.829
 your fly fishing gear 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.480
 I talked to the seller he is not talking about 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:58.120
 what are elementary and solutions like 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.480
 make a leader for training itself 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.950
 saying this is the solution I mean you 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.380
 showed already 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.900
 this node is the most common will 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.060
 knot how you can tie it you can 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.400
 see in my previous videos there 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.250
 there are two knitting options for this pattern 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:21.010
 Here are the links there certainly is in the signature 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:23.250
 there is on the node we do not cut off the tips 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.310
 at the root of the knot 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.910
 we leave approximately somewhere in millimeters 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.430
 10-15 from each end, so I also thought 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.410
 that so all the jokes that nothing 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.320
 will firstly during flight 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.790
 does not interfere in the second 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.820
 absolutely not confused island 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.010
 that is, but I do not know for let's say 2 hour 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.920
 I could have a workout 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.410
 2-3 cliffs this is most likely 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.830
 due to the fact that we hit the fly 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.020
 rod turned out well, let's mess 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.520
 for my mistakes they are from grass because 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.110
 first training when I went to 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.350
 grass with ordinary bought 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.570
 completely neat leader without knots 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.620
 confusion got instantly here 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.290
 now 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.360
 thanks to such a leader in tips 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.760
 protruding 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.790
 it means there is absolutely no aunt's powder box 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:20.520
 I want to show you to my leader by the way this 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:23.350
 he already trained I took it off the cord 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:28.540
 then here comes my little forest first 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:31.390
 05 here we see if you can see the camera 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.320
 if she takes stick out the ends just fruit 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.560
 they also then 10 millimeters 12 can 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.160
 be then this forest. 04 again stick out 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.900
 tips 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.120
 Then little forest 0302 will lead, fearing if 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.640
 it can be seen everywhere stick up the tips and of course 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.340
 I would like to say 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.040
 One caveat about training 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:00.430
 I recommended the leader in the previous video 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:03.170
 do follow rf from 05 and to 014 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.209
 Precisely sharp to the nameplate 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.880
 taper 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.700
 here for the training leader me 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.310
 It seems the thinnest fishing line as leashes 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.150
 you can use 018 that is from sharp 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:20.600
 make it short too but go down 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:24.540
 let's say from fishing line 06 to 0 18 this is quite 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.330
 enough that is, the more you will have 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.070
 little forest than the leash will be thinner 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.670
 will break faster because the water 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.560
 still more tender than grass and 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.990
 any effects of grass , of course, too 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.730
 will impact your leash and he 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.860
 will also wear out and break off 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.140
 here and of course this one 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.590
 when tying a fly is also possible 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.480
 leave, too, can not be cut well 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.030
 in fact, that's all I wanted 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.390
 say priests training leader and yes 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.470
 yes yes one more I want to show the nuance 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.770
 mean if 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.050
 if we bind an ordinary simple look 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:06.450
 double knot 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:11.510
 who also showed in the past video 1 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:14.130
 and 2 for what double i think you know 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.690
 the past video is all there is to watch 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:20.850
 please I honestly did not feel 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:25.020
 but it seems to me that the tips will go 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:27.510
 along the cord along the leader himself and they don't 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.090
 will work so efficiently though you can 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.470
 try you can try here 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.880
 By the way , I also need to say that 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.610
 friend training people in me he doesn't 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.050
 one of course this and you understand it 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.200
 because for training I at least 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:47.100
 I take with me 5 such people here 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.210
 hunting some old hooks mean to 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.420
 first section 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:54.540
 first here on this loop knot 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:58.050
 of course it crashes and here on the first 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:00.870
 sections on going from in my case 0504 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.000
 I will say that you can cut off the tips too 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.250
 because here before the powerful fishing line 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.530
 that she is never confused in her life 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.230
 will not be here confused basically already 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.530
 somewhere starting from 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.990
 02 here that is, start me first 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:20.030
 it seems that these tips can be somewhere 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:21.500
 between 0302 here that is first place 054 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.640
 can be cut 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.510
 you can not cut the second between 0403 too 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.170
 can be cut 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:33.320
 and between 0302 already leave conditional 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:35.540
 saying that 's what he wanted said 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.270
 as you see everything is very elementary everything 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:42.340
 easy and simple all thank you all for 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.340
 attention and success in training
