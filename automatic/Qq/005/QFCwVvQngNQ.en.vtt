degree<00:02:12.600> Celsius<00:02:13.050> first<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.100> need<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.310> choose

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
degree Celsius first you need to choose

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.920 
degree Celsius first you need to choose
the<00:02:15.540> program<00:02:18.380> in<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.530> bottom<00:02:19.860> here<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:21.480> you

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
the program in the bottom here and you

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.090 
the program in the bottom here and you
can<00:02:22.110> select<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.530> temperature<00:02:25.580> 250<00:02:26.580> degrees
