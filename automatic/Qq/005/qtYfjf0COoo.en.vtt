so<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.930> did<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.199> series<00:00:22.410> for<00:00:22.769> modern<00:00:23.220> warfare

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
so I did this series for modern warfare

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.160 
so I did this series for modern warfare
3<00:00:23.640> classes<00:00:24.449> but<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.600> didn't<00:00:24.779> get<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.900> cover

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
3 classes but I didn't get to cover

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.839 
3 classes but I didn't get to cover
quite<00:00:25.470> as<00:00:25.650> many<00:00:25.830> guns<00:00:26.039> as<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.369> would<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:26.550> liked

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
quite as many guns as I would have liked

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.599 
quite as many guns as I would have liked
to<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.539> 4<00:00:27.689> black<00:00:27.869> ops<00:00:27.900> 2<00:00:28.349> whenever<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.160> find<00:00:29.460> a

to so 4 black ops 2 whenever I find a
class<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.060> feel<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.750> really<00:00:31.320> good<00:00:31.590> has

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
class that I feel is really good has

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.170 
class that I feel is really good has
some<00:00:31.980> great<00:00:32.189> strong<00:00:32.550> points<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.030> can

first episode of the series here with
the<00:00:43.020> MSMC<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.309> course<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.210> my

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the MSMC of course this is just my

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.900 
the MSMC of course this is just my
favorite<00:00:46.070> setup<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.430> gun<00:00:47.610> at<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
favorite setup for this gun at the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.360 
favorite setup for this gun at the
moment<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.809> make<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.289> video<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:50.160> may

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
moment that I make this video it may

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.650 
moment that I make this video it may
change<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.850> little<00:00:50.940> bit<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.239> guys<00:00:51.420> may<00:00:51.629> have

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
change a little bit you guys may have

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.630 
change a little bit you guys may have
slight<00:00:52.230> variations<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.340> feel<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
slight variations that you feel a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.459 
slight variations that you feel a
slightly<00:00:54.059> better<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.719> that's<00:00:55.020> all<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.350> you

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
slightly better and that's all so you

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.810 
slightly better and that's all so you
can<00:00:55.590> feel<00:00:56.160> free<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.399> share<00:00:56.550> them<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
can feel free to share them in the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.189 
can feel free to share them in the
comment<00:00:57.180> section<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.510> guys<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:57.989> discuss

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
comment section you guys can discuss

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.770 
comment section you guys can discuss
that<00:00:58.530> but<00:00:59.010> for<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.760> given<00:01:00.000> setup<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.480> feel

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
that but for this given setup I feel

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.200 
that but for this given setup I feel
this<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.710> best<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> MSMC<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.030> very

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
this is the best of the MSMC is a very

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.870 
this is the best of the MSMC is a very
popular<00:01:03.480> submachine<00:01:04.140> gun<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.500> anyway<00:01:05.489> but

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
popular submachine gun and anyway but

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.490 
popular submachine gun and anyway but
focusing<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> class<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:06.960> I've<00:01:07.170> got<00:01:07.320> on

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
focusing on the class that I've got on

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.570 
focusing on the class that I've got on
screen<00:01:07.799> here<00:01:08.010> I'm<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.250> run<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.549> through

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
screen here I'm going to run you through

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.490 
screen here I'm going to run you through
every<00:01:09.210> single<00:01:09.390> little<00:01:09.780> bit<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.350> is

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
every single little bit so this is

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.130 
every single little bit so this is
specifically<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> class<00:01:11.909> setup<00:01:12.330> for<00:01:12.659> going<00:01:12.960> for

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
specifically a class setup for going for

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.140 
specifically a class setup for going for
high<00:01:13.350> kill<00:01:13.799> streets<00:01:14.159> or<00:01:14.340> high<00:01:14.490> school<00:01:14.850> streaks

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
high kill streets or high school streaks

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.850 
high kill streets or high school streaks
so<00:01:15.450> starting<00:01:15.810> off<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> most<00:01:16.229> important

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
so starting off with the most important

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.200 
so starting off with the most important
part<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.310> class<00:01:17.520> setup<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.150> that's

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
part of this class setup and that's

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.300 
part of this class setup and that's
actually<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.689> attachments<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.860> MSMC

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
actually the attachments for the MSMC

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.730 
actually the attachments for the MSMC
because<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> attachments<00:01:21.750> directly<00:01:21.869> affect

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
because the attachments directly affect

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.679 
because the attachments directly affect
how<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.100> gun<00:01:23.460> reacts<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.939> how<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> gun<00:01:24.360> plays

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
how the gun reacts and how the gun plays

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.749 
how the gun reacts and how the gun plays
the<00:01:25.470> silencer<00:01:25.920> itself<00:01:26.250> means<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.670> you're

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
the silencer itself means that you're

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.460 
the silencer itself means that you're
not<00:01:26.850> appearing<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.299> course<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.689> red<00:01:27.930> dot<00:01:28.200> on

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
not appearing of course is red dot on

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.859 
not appearing of course is red dot on
the<00:01:28.650> enemies<00:01:28.920> map<00:01:29.159> but<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.000> key<00:01:30.210> part<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.750> this

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the enemies map but the key part of this

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.630 
the enemies map but the key part of this
is<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.170> fact<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.159> didn't<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.520> a

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
is the fact that if you didn't have a

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.399 
is the fact that if you didn't have a
science<00:01:33.090> Ruan<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.079> those<00:01:34.200> longer

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
science Ruan going on those longer

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.600 
science Ruan going on those longer
school<00:01:34.680> tricks<00:01:34.890> would<00:01:35.009> be<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> lot<00:01:35.430> more

this gameplay I did actually have the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.280 
this gameplay I did actually have the

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
longer use that I switched it out for

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.150 
longer use that I switched it out for
the<00:03:59.850> concussion<00:04:00.450> so<00:04:00.870> both<00:04:01.019> a<00:04:01.140> concussion<00:04:01.500> c4

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
the concussion so both a concussion c4

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.610 
the concussion so both a concussion c4
and<00:04:02.459> scavenger<00:04:03.000> work<00:04:03.239> well<00:04:03.540> together<00:04:03.780> very

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
and scavenger work well together very

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.740 
and scavenger work well together very
very<00:04:04.980> well<00:04:05.190> indeed<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.150> then<00:04:06.239> finally<00:04:06.600> here

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
very well indeed and then finally here

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.690 
very well indeed and then finally here
from<00:04:06.930> my<00:04:07.110> teeth<00:04:07.440> through<00:04:07.709> perk<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.190> have

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
from my teeth through perk I have

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.220 
from my teeth through perk I have
awareness<00:04:09.330> which<00:04:09.480> is<00:04:09.510> probably<00:04:09.930> quite

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
awareness which is probably quite

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.259 
awareness which is probably quite
surprising<00:04:11.160> her<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:11.489> be<00:04:11.580> using<00:04:11.880> I<00:04:11.940> think<00:04:12.090> a<00:04:12.150> lot

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
surprising her to be using I think a lot

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.120 
surprising her to be using I think a lot
of<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:12.420> guys<00:04:12.540> may<00:04:13.140> be<00:04:13.170> sticking<00:04:13.440> towards<00:04:13.950> sort

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130

of<00:04:14.190> tactical<00:04:14.670> mask<00:04:14.910> or<00:04:15.360> dexterity<00:04:15.690> but<00:04:16.560> for<00:04:16.739> me

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
of tactical mask or dexterity but for me

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.199 
of tactical mask or dexterity but for me
I<00:04:16.890> use<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.190> really<00:04:17.459> good<00:04:17.580> headset<00:04:18.000> and

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
I use a really good headset and

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.880 
I use a really good headset and
awareness<00:04:18.660> does<00:04:18.900> actually<00:04:19.109> allow<00:04:19.440> me<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:19.709> pick

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
awareness does actually allow me to pick

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.130 
awareness does actually allow me to pick
out<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.220> sound<00:04:20.520> of<00:04:20.729> enemy<00:04:21.419> footsteps<00:04:21.900> and
