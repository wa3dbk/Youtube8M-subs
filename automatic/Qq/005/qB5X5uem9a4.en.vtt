welcome<00:00:00.960> back<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.350> Anam<00:00:01.740> video<00:00:02.159> about<00:00:02.580> how<00:00:03.120> to

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
welcome back to Anam video about how to

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.220 
welcome back to Anam video about how to
draw<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:04.279> roller<00:00:05.279> Pentagon<00:00:05.819> upon<00:00:06.690> its<00:00:07.680> side<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.580> B

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
draw a roller Pentagon upon its side a B

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.169 
draw a roller Pentagon upon its side a B
well<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.500> place<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:11.010> compass<00:00:11.400> on<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:12.000> tip<00:00:12.150> of

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
well you place the compass on the tip of

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.129 
well you place the compass on the tip of
the<00:00:12.360> compass<00:00:12.540> on<00:00:12.809> point<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.710> take<00:00:14.580> until

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
the compass on point a and take until

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.689 
the compass on point a and take until
point<00:00:16.139> B<00:00:16.699> so<00:00:17.699> you're<00:00:17.940> going<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.240> draw<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.869> whole

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
point B so you're going to draw a whole

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.080 
point B so you're going to draw a whole
circle<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.740> do<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.920> same<00:00:23.220> thing<00:00:23.519> from<00:00:23.789> point

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
circle and do the same thing from point

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.220 
circle and do the same thing from point
B<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:25.560> you're<00:00:25.740> going<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.039> get<00:00:26.510> two<00:00:27.510> big<00:00:27.960> circles

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
B so you're going to get two big circles

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.080 
B so you're going to get two big circles
with<00:00:29.420> two<00:00:30.420> intersection<00:00:31.260> point<00:00:31.940> points<00:00:32.940> I'm

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
with two intersection point points I'm

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.440 
with two intersection point points I'm
going<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.590> stress<00:00:34.590> them<00:00:34.950> by<00:00:35.250> means<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.760> as

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
going to stress them by means of as

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.580 
going to stress them by means of as
usual<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.829> marker<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:39.690> recommend<00:00:40.379> you

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
usual of the marker and I recommend you

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.959 
usual of the marker and I recommend you
as<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.129> good<00:00:41.309> practice<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:43.350> always<00:00:43.610> label<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
as a good practice to always label the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.560 
as a good practice to always label the
points<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:46.320> are<00:00:46.730> getting<00:00:47.730> through<00:00:48.239> all<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
points you are getting through all the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.160 
points you are getting through all the
two<00:00:48.840> drawing<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:51.170> avoid

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
two drawing so that you can avoid

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.619 
two drawing so that you can avoid
getting<00:00:52.230> lost<00:00:54.260> in<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> process<00:00:56.699> next

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
getting lost in the in the process next

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.229 
getting lost in the in the process next
next<00:00:58.050> step<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:59.129> join<00:01:01.010> points<00:01:02.010> one<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.969> two

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
next step is to join points one to two

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.119 
next step is to join points one to two
in<00:01:03.690> order<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.110> get<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> perpendicular

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
in order to get the perpendicular

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.500 
in order to get the perpendicular
bisector<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.990> segment<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.350> B<00:01:07.549> let's<00:01:08.549> place<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
bisector of segment a B let's place the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.510 
bisector of segment a B let's place the
compass<00:01:09.900> again<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.530> tip<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> compass<00:01:11.189> one

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
compass again the tip of the compass one

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.140 
compass again the tip of the compass one
point<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.240> make<00:01:13.140> sure<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.770> get<00:01:14.549> Unseld

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
point to make sure that you get Unseld

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.609 
point to make sure that you get Unseld
point<00:01:15.420> B<00:01:15.780> or<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.159> same<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.780> I'll<00:01:19.080> rotate<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
point B or a the same so I'll rotate the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.320 
point B or a the same so I'll rotate the
compass<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.400> are<00:01:20.520> going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.759> draw<00:01:21.119> an

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
compass so that you are going to draw an

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.749 
compass so that you are going to draw an
arch<00:01:21.890> this<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:22.979> going<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.810> bring<00:01:24.810> about<00:01:24.990> again

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
arch this is going to bring about again

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.660 
arch this is going to bring about again
three<00:01:26.759> new<00:01:27.210> points<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.680> first<00:01:28.890> two

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
three new points and the first two

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.330 
three new points and the first two
circles<00:01:30.360> we<00:01:30.540> already<00:01:30.990> get<00:01:31.229> at<00:01:31.560> first

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
circles we already get at first

circles we already get at first
and<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.479> course<00:01:33.799> over<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.979> perpendicular

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
and of course over the perpendicular

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.120 
and of course over the perpendicular
sector<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> red<00:01:36.210> line<00:01:36.650> so<00:01:37.650> they<00:01:37.799> are<00:01:37.920> going

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
sector of the red line so they are going

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.030

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
now five and they are going to play a

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.270 
now five and they are going to play a
crucial<00:01:46.730> role<00:01:46.970> in<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:48.260> whole<00:01:48.620> thing<00:01:49.040> the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
this is as usual we are going to label

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.890 
this is as usual we are going to label
them<00:02:45.830> they<00:02:46.010> are<00:02:46.160> going<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.400> be<00:02:46.640> part<00:02:46.940> of<00:02:47.239> the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
them they are going to be part of the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.840 
them they are going to be part of the
paint<00:02:48.140> I<00:02:48.290> want<00:02:48.410> so<00:02:48.590> we're<00:02:49.370> going<00:02:49.519> to<00:02:49.670> use

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
paint I want so we're going to use

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.410 
paint I want so we're going to use
letters<00:02:50.480> in<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:50.840> case<00:02:51.680> upper<00:02:52.459> case<00:02:52.880> letters

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
letters in this case upper case letters

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.710 
letters in this case upper case letters
C<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.140> D<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:54.860> we<00:02:55.670> are<00:02:55.790> getting<00:02:56.060> closer<00:02:56.480> to

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
C and D so we are getting closer to

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.900 
C and D so we are getting closer to
there<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.350> the<00:02:57.440> outcome<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.190> final<00:02:58.459> outcome

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
there to the outcome the final outcome

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.670 
there to the outcome the final outcome
let's<00:02:59.209> change<00:02:59.660> again<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:02.600> thickness<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.470> the

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
let's change again the thickness and the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.229 
let's change again the thickness and the
color<00:03:03.920> of<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.340> lines<00:03:04.549> because<00:03:04.880> I'm<00:03:05.030> going<00:03:05.180> to

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
color of the lines because I'm going to

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.860 
color of the lines because I'm going to
join<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.690> point<00:03:05.930> A<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.500> point<00:03:06.860> C<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:08.269> point<00:03:08.570> B

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
join the point A to point C and point B

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.350 
join the point A to point C and point B
to<00:03:09.170> point<00:03:09.440> D<00:03:10.250> where<00:03:11.080> four<00:03:12.080> of<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.470> five
