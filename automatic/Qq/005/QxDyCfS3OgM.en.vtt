00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:18.890
 Oh dear 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.339
 Takuji Nakata 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.139
 It was not so wide before the enemy 

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:25.210
 I did not do it for a while 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.019
 Term is 5 years 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.380
 It is not so long though 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.079
 Sold by 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.699
 There were 10 mistakes among members, and so on 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.090
 I wonder if 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.200
 It has been done from the first game until the same time, hasn't it changed? 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.200
 To put it roughly 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.260
 I can feel my heart 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
 Within 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.780
 Such a person 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.970
 is not it 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.370
 From above 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.620
 It will be said variously 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.080
 I want you to add 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.580
 Another 24s 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.410
 Up to 20 days 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.300
 Talk to the Tachikawa department on the way to the top 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.330
 A little bit 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.930
 Mr. Yamaguchi is the second case in the prefecture to be drawn up 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.670
 Became third in the group league 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.670
 It seems to be satisfactory now as it is written that it becomes old age 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.730
 This festival will be invisible 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.680
 A little 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.370
 Fukuoka city downtown area 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.130
 I am here before getting married 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.790
 8 persons 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.790
 I entered the one I hit, but from 6 years ago 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.210
 Mr. Yamaguchi is the first to deal with Kokubunji 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.210
 Up until now, throw away with 70% 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.060
 Even from the Showa 30's, the noise of 47 stores is loud 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.460
 Half 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.940
 g1 I just wanted to do something I thought it was wrong 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.140
 And the force went 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.600
 Anhui dream came true 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.030
 There is a cause of sales increase 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.030
 Korean people's school building 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.540
 Mini 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.290
 It is delicious 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.290
 22nd Oita Nine Stone Dome 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.159
 Debt 1 with 3 daily losses 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:13.980
 I did it in particular 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.670
 There are also those who are turned over without entering the general election 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.269
 river 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.059
 That time 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.059
 Surround effect can be obtained at that seat 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:29.059
 Data communication card sounds indoors 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.399
 After that two people will bite 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:34.849
 Mr. Yamaguchi 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.849
 End 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.059
 Salt and pepper wind bells are not good 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.139
 The fire truck was concerned 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:48.509
 Up 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:50.869
 Elastic skin everywhere 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:53.930
 So now I am looking for vegetables myself 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.650
 Meat and fish are delicious but expensive 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.670
 It is not in seven times, and it means that it is good for a society 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.670
 There was no contrast with the other 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:04.729
 Each 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:07.779
 Washington 25 date and time 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.889

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.049
 Morahara 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.769
 I felt woods 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.379
 Summer day of the 17th 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:18.129
 Have a desk
