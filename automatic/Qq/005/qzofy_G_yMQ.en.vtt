00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
the only fault with it is it's not a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.600 
the only fault with it is it's not a
major<00:01:15.980> fault

major fault

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.870 
major fault
the<00:01:17.450> minute<00:01:17.690> hands<00:01:17.870> a<00:01:17.960> bit<00:01:18.050> loose<00:01:18.200> yes<00:01:18.880> but

the minute hands a bit loose yes but

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.510 
the minute hands a bit loose yes but
that's<00:01:20.270> something<00:01:21.260> that<00:01:21.290> can<00:01:21.950> be<00:01:21.980> is

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
that's something that can be is

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:31.660 
that's something that can be is
repairable<00:01:23.950> quarter<00:01:24.950> past<00:01:30.310> it's<00:01:31.310> got<00:01:31.430> a<00:01:31.460> very

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
repairable quarter past it's got a very

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.400 
repairable quarter past it's got a very
sharp<00:01:31.940> chime<00:01:32.420> but<00:01:32.720> I<00:01:32.750> like<00:01:32.990> it

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
sharp chime but I like it

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:46.140 
sharp chime but I like it
half<00:01:34.370> past

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.660 

core<00:01:47.150> -<00:01:50.350> it's<00:01:51.350> got<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.590> very<00:01:51.710> same<00:01:52.100> movement

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
core - it's got the very same movement

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.790 
core - it's got the very same movement
one<00:01:52.850> of<00:01:52.940> my<00:01:53.090> Smith's<00:01:53.480> has<00:01:56.200> in<00:01:57.200> particular<00:01:57.470> what

one of my Smith's has in particular what
I'm<00:01:57.890> referring<00:01:58.010> to<00:01:58.400> is<00:01:58.550> not<00:02:00.040> as<00:02:01.040> in<00:02:01.220> my

I'm referring to is not as in my
collection<00:02:01.820> but<00:02:01.850> it's<00:02:02.120> not<00:02:02.770> it's<00:02:03.770> not

collection but it's not it's not
operational<00:02:04.250> at<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.610> moment<00:02:05.710> what<00:02:06.710> it<00:02:06.830> is<00:02:07.010> but

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
operational at the moment what it is but

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.480 
operational at the moment what it is but
he's<00:02:07.730> only<00:02:07.880> just<00:02:08.180> been<00:02:08.330> fixed<00:02:08.800> but<00:02:09.800> it's<00:02:09.950> it's

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
he's only just been fixed but it's it's

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.970 
he's only just been fixed but it's it's
a<00:02:10.610> beautiful<00:02:11.060> example<00:02:11.330> this<00:02:11.840> one<00:02:12.020> what<00:02:12.920> I'm

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
a beautiful example this one what I'm

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.080 
a beautiful example this one what I'm
gonna<00:02:13.100> do<00:02:13.310> I'm<00:02:13.400> going<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.580> turn<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.880> cam

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
gonna do I'm going to turn the cam

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.360 
gonna do I'm going to turn the cam
around<00:02:14.120> for<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:14.630> second<00:02:15.020> while<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:15.860> sort<00:02:16.190> this

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
around for a second while I sort this

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.220 
around for a second while I sort this
out<00:02:16.580> -<00:02:16.730> flip<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.060> round<00:02:17.330> so<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.690> can<00:02:17.900> see<00:02:18.110> the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
out - flip it round so you can see the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.410 
out - flip it round so you can see the
back<00:02:18.380> of<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.830> we'll<00:02:19.820> take<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.030> look<00:02:20.270> at<00:02:20.360> the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
back of it and we'll take a look at the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.420 
back of it and we'll take a look at the
movement<00:02:20.630> let<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.260> show<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:22.010> show<00:02:22.310> the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
movement let you show and show the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.120 
movement let you show and show the
internal<00:02:22.820> movement<00:02:23.180> on<00:02:23.270> this<00:02:23.860> typical<00:02:24.860> Smith

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
internal movement on this typical Smith

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.870 
internal movement on this typical Smith
movement<00:02:26.800> NOLA<00:02:27.800> tell<00:02:28.040> us<00:02:28.160> emit<00:02:28.340> movement

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
movement NOLA tell us emit movement

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.380 
movement NOLA tell us emit movement
I<00:02:28.910> always<00:02:29.390> think<00:02:29.890> by<00:02:30.890> that<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:32.150> mottled<00:02:32.510> brass

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
I always think by that the mottled brass

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.000 
I always think by that the mottled brass
the<00:02:35.390> brass<00:02:35.420> has<00:02:35.810> got<00:02:35.990> patterns<00:02:36.410> on<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:37.630> and

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
the brass has got patterns on it and

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.640 
the brass has got patterns on it and
it's<00:02:40.010> an<00:02:40.370> under<00:02:40.850> strike<00:02:41.150> chime<00:02:41.810> it's<00:02:42.200> as<00:02:42.320> the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
it's an under strike chime it's as the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.600 
it's an under strike chime it's as the
rubs<00:02:42.860> are<00:02:43.010> underneath<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.340> pendulum<00:02:45.610> it's

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
rubs are underneath the pendulum it's

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.810 
rubs are underneath the pendulum it's
also<00:02:46.790> got<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:48.040> thing<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.160> can't<00:02:49.370> really<00:02:49.580> see

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
also got a thing you can't really see

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.380 
also got a thing you can't really see
but<00:02:50.060> what<00:02:50.240> there<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.650> back<00:02:51.890> on<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.030> corner

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
but what there is the back on the corner

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.670 
but what there is the back on the corner
it<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:53.630> can't<00:02:53.840> really<00:02:53.930> see<00:02:54.320> it<00:02:54.410> but<00:02:54.500> there's

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
it you can't really see it but there's

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.350 
it you can't really see it but there's
an<00:02:54.740> actual<00:02:54.890> thing<00:02:55.370> you<00:02:55.520> can<00:02:55.670> lock<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.060> Hammers

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
an actual thing you can lock the Hammers

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.460 
an actual thing you can lock the Hammers
down<00:02:56.570> so<00:02:57.530> if<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.800> clock<00:02:58.070> is<00:02:58.100> not<00:02:58.690> if<00:02:59.690> the<00:03:00.290> clock

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
down so if the clock is not if the clock

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.020 
down so if the clock is not if the clock
has<00:03:00.650> been<00:03:00.800> troubled<00:03:01.250> you<00:03:01.400> can<00:03:01.580> actually<00:03:01.850> lock

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
has been troubled you can actually lock

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.820 
has been troubled you can actually lock
the<00:03:02.239> Hammers<00:03:02.570> which<00:03:03.290> is<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.440> unique<00:03:03.770> feature

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
the Hammers which is a unique feature

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.920 
the Hammers which is a unique feature
I've<00:03:04.190> seen<00:03:04.430> only<00:03:04.550> on<00:03:04.730> Smith<00:03:05.000> clocks<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.540> very

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
I've seen only on Smith clocks and very

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.110 
I've seen only on Smith clocks and very
rarely<00:03:06.200> all<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.500> ones<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:07.640> allowed<00:03:07.820> to<00:03:07.910> do<00:03:08.000> the

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120

do<00:06:01.550> like<00:06:01.850> them<00:06:02.060> a<00:06:02.150> lot<00:06:02.330> they<00:06:02.510> were<00:06:02.570> very<00:06:02.780> nice

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.309 

beautiful<00:06:11.490> sound

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.240 

very<00:06:15.319> smooth<00:06:15.740> movement<00:06:16.430> that<00:06:17.410> if<00:06:18.410> he<00:06:18.770> loses

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
very smooth movement that if he loses

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:37.790 
very smooth movement that if he loses
quality<00:06:19.639> you<00:06:20.030> know

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.260 

she's<00:06:38.800> not<00:06:38.950> fully<00:06:39.250> in<00:06:39.430> beep<00:06:39.610> but<00:06:39.850> this<00:06:39.970> clocks

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
she's not fully in beep but this clocks

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.180 
she's not fully in beep but this clocks
got<00:06:40.510> a<00:06:40.540> strange<00:06:40.960> behavior<00:06:41.560> where<00:06:41.710> it<00:06:41.830> goes<00:06:41.980> in

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190 
got a strange behavior where it goes in

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.530 
got a strange behavior where it goes in
and<00:06:42.310> out<00:06:42.370> of<00:06:42.580> beat<00:06:42.820> by<00:06:43.000> itself<00:06:45.330> could<00:06:46.330> mean

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
and out of beat by itself could mean

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.140 
and out of beat by itself could mean
that<00:06:46.720> it<00:06:46.810> needs<00:06:46.960> cleaning<00:06:47.410> slightly<00:06:48.840> but

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
that it needs cleaning slightly but

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.190 
that it needs cleaning slightly but
apart<00:06:52.150> from<00:06:52.210> that<00:06:52.390> you<00:06:52.690> can<00:06:52.840> see<00:06:53.020> it's<00:06:53.140> an

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.200 
apart from that you can see it's an
