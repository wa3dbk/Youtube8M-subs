powerful<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.399> kill<00:00:56.579> stuff<00:00:56.850> faster<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.570> there<00:00:57.809> a

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
powerful to kill stuff faster is there a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.580 
powerful to kill stuff faster is there a
reason<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.710> use<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.070> no<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.329> then<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:01.410> it

reason not to use it no so then but it

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.740 
reason not to use it no so then but it
still<00:01:01.800> gives<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> option<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.609> swap<00:01:03.090> back
