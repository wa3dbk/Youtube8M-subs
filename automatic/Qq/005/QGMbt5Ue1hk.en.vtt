00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
linebacker spots we can do that if we

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.979 
linebacker spots we can do that if we
get<00:02:54.870> closer<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.799> goal<00:02:56.099> line<00:02:56.989> situation

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989

years ago in the playoffs in the middle

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.800 
years ago in the playoffs in the middle
of<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.709> field<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.160> team<00:03:14.370> four<00:03:15.030> times<00:03:15.360> had

I<00:03:37.290> came<00:03:37.410> in<00:03:37.769> seven<00:03:38.130> years<00:03:38.160> ago<00:03:38.459> that<00:03:38.819> I<00:03:39.299> thought

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
I came in seven years ago that I thought

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.860 
I came in seven years ago that I thought
very<00:03:39.980> very<00:03:40.980> highly<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.209> decided<00:03:42.810> that

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
very very highly of and and decided that

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.090 
very very highly of and and decided that
we're<00:03:42.989> going<00:03:43.079> to<00:03:43.139> keep<00:03:43.380> that<00:03:43.590> because<00:03:43.829> it

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
we're going to keep that because it

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.059 
we're going to keep that because it
works<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.400> successfully<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:46.650> that's<00:03:46.859> our

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
works so successfully so that's our

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.789 
works so successfully so that's our
overall<00:03:47.400> alignment<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.180> at<00:03:49.019> this<00:03:49.170> point<00:03:49.530> I

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
overall alignment and at this point I

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.150 
overall alignment and at this point I
