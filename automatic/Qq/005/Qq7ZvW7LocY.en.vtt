today<00:01:06.210> some<00:01:07.210> kind<00:01:07.479> of<00:01:07.539> over<00:01:07.899> feeding<00:01:08.200> on<00:01:08.560> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
today some kind of over feeding on the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.240 
today some kind of over feeding on the
side<00:01:10.810> of<00:01:11.050> the<00:01:11.110> making<00:01:11.440> sure<00:01:11.649> everyone<00:01:12.070> gets

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
side of the making sure everyone gets

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.510 
side of the making sure everyone gets
well<00:01:12.460> fed<00:01:13.289> because<00:01:14.289> I<00:01:14.560> am<00:01:14.740> doing<00:01:14.950> heavy<00:01:15.250> water

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
well fed because I am doing heavy water

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.330 
well fed because I am doing heavy water
changes<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.210> algae<00:01:16.630> will<00:01:17.560> go<00:01:17.740> away

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
changes the algae will go away

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.330 
changes the algae will go away
as<00:01:19.270> soon<00:01:19.450> as<00:01:19.570> I<00:01:19.690> do<00:01:19.750> some<00:01:20.020> XL<00:01:20.380> but<00:01:20.710> man<00:01:21.070> look<00:01:21.220> at

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
as soon as I do some XL but man look at

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.620 
as soon as I do some XL but man look at
that<00:01:21.509> I've<00:01:22.509> never<00:01:22.690> had<00:01:22.990> algae<00:01:24.420> quite<00:01:25.420> like

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
that I've never had algae quite like

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.240 
that I've never had algae quite like
this<00:01:25.899> and<00:01:26.350> it's<00:01:26.560> really<00:01:26.770> just<00:01:26.860> because<00:01:27.160> I

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
this and it's really just because I

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.300 
this and it's really just because I
haven't<00:01:27.990> been<00:01:28.990> dosing<00:01:29.259> with<00:01:29.590> any<00:01:29.770> Ferb's<00:01:30.100> or

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
haven't been dosing with any Ferb's or

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.639 
haven't been dosing with any Ferb's or
anything<00:01:30.490> in<00:01:30.700> this<00:01:30.820> tank<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:31.420> I<00:01:32.050> can<00:01:32.229> easily

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
anything in this tank and I can easily

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.700 
anything in this tank and I can easily
rectify<00:01:33.399> that<00:01:33.899> I'm<00:01:34.899> honestly<00:01:35.320> just<00:01:35.410> not

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
rectify that I'm honestly just not

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.139 
rectify that I'm honestly just not
worried<00:01:35.950> about<00:01:36.039> the<00:01:36.250> glance<00:01:36.490> right<00:01:36.729> now<00:01:36.940> and<00:01:37.119> I

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
worried about the glance right now and I

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.460 
worried about the glance right now and I
don't<00:01:37.209> want<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.539> add<00:01:37.630> anything<00:01:37.869> to<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.229> water

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
don't want to add anything to the water

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.139 
don't want to add anything to the water
until<00:01:40.950> I'm<00:01:41.950> really<00:01:42.250> just<00:01:42.369> focused<00:01:42.789> on<00:01:42.910> the

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
until I'm really just focused on the

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.719

baby<00:01:43.450> fish<00:01:43.780> so<00:01:44.709> I<00:01:44.740> can<00:01:45.099> always<00:01:45.280> get<00:01:45.520> these

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729
