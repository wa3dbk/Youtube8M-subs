00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
slider case and you can see kind of this

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.049 
slider case and you can see kind of this
cushiony<00:00:51.510> area<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.829> area<00:00:53.219> here<00:00:53.789> so

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
cushiony area in this area here so

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.760 
cushiony area in this area here so
slider<00:00:54.719> cases<00:00:55.170> are<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.469> be<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> bit

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
slider cases are going to be a bit

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.380 
slider cases are going to be a bit
tricky<00:00:55.980> when<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.489> talk<00:00:56.730> about<00:00:56.760> screen

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
protectors so just be aware of that let

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.760 
protectors so just be aware of that let

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
black and I'm going to slide this into

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.509 
black and I'm going to slide this into
place<00:01:04.170> first<00:01:04.500> thing<00:01:04.710> I'm<00:01:04.830> gonna<00:01:04.949> do<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.339> make

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
place first thing I'm gonna do is make

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.760 
place first thing I'm gonna do is make
sure<00:01:05.700> there's<00:01:06.090> no<00:01:06.540> particles<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.500> here

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
sure there's no particles in here

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.830 
sure there's no particles in here
because<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.760> got<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.939> be<00:01:09.030> real<00:01:09.270> careful<00:01:09.360> with

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
because you got to be real careful with

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.080 
because you got to be real careful with
slider<00:01:10.110> cases<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.189> got<00:01:11.430> particles<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
slider cases if you got particles and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.910 
slider cases if you got particles and
things<00:01:12.299> like<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:12.990> easily<00:01:13.320> scratch

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
things like that you can easily scratch

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.270 
things like that you can easily scratch
up<00:01:14.250> your<00:01:14.689> iPhone<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.770> see<00:01:17.070> that

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
up your iPhone so you can see that

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.789 
up your iPhone so you can see that
slides<00:01:18.000> into<00:01:18.150> place<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.930> give<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
slides into place like that give this a

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.649 
slides into place like that give this a
check<00:01:20.220> make<00:01:20.490> sure<00:01:20.520> there's<00:01:20.850> no<00:01:20.970> particles<00:01:21.479> in

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
check make sure there's no particles in

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.300 
check make sure there's no particles in
there<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.080> then<00:01:22.530> we're<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> slide<00:01:23.130> this

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
there and then we're going to slide this

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.480 
there and then we're going to slide this
bottom<00:01:23.759> piece<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.009> you're

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
bottom piece on just like that so you're

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.830 
bottom piece on just like that so you're
going<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.729> get<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.880> lay<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.240> table<00:01:27.270> design

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
going to get a lay on the table design

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.990 
going to get a lay on the table design
with<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.320> case<00:01:28.560> as<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:28.950> see<00:01:29.369> storm<00:01:29.820> and

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
with this case as you can see storm and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.210 
with this case as you can see storm and
black<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.290> show<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> little<00:01:31.860> bit<00:01:32.040> more

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
black is going to show a little bit more

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.640 
black is going to show a little bit more
