super-bright LEDs dot-com the LED output

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.599 
super-bright LEDs dot-com the LED output
is<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:20.130> believe<00:00:20.570> 350<00:00:21.570> lumens<00:00:22.220> the<00:00:23.220> outlet

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
is I believe 350 lumens the outlet

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.630 
is I believe 350 lumens the outlet
output<00:00:24.269> on<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.720> gig<00:00:24.990> aware<00:00:25.320> mic<00:00:25.769> projector<00:00:26.430> is

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
output on the gig aware mic projector is

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.609 
output on the gig aware mic projector is
10<00:00:27.150> lumens<00:00:27.420> but<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.930> believe<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.859> LED<00:00:29.400> input<00:00:29.970> is

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
10 lumens but I believe the LED input is

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.850 
10 lumens but I believe the LED input is
100<00:00:31.619> lumens<00:00:32.399> already<00:00:33.329> upgraded<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.170> 200

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
100 lumens already upgraded it to 200

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.860 
100 lumens already upgraded it to 200
and<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.160> wasn't<00:00:35.430> as<00:00:35.760> bright<00:00:36.059> as<00:00:36.270> I'd<00:00:36.450> like<00:00:36.690> it

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
and it wasn't as bright as I'd like it

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.459 
and it wasn't as bright as I'd like it
to<00:00:37.050> be<00:00:37.430> so<00:00:39.290> we're<00:00:40.290> going<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:41.120> try<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.469> 350

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
to be so we're going to try the 350

not<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:14.950> greatest<00:03:15.100> soldering<00:03:15.700> job<00:03:16.090> but<00:03:16.860> the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
not the greatest soldering job but the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.040 
not the greatest soldering job but the
projector<00:03:18.400> did<00:03:18.640> work<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:19.240> was<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.510> little

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
projector did work and was a little

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.130 
projector did work and was a little
brighter<00:03:20.320> not<00:03:20.800> bright<00:03:21.490> enough<00:03:21.520> so<00:03:22.180> we're

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
brighter not bright enough so we're

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.770 
brighter not bright enough so we're
going<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.350> go<00:03:23.500> ahead<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.390> remove<00:03:25.390> that

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
going to go ahead and and remove that

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.500 
going to go ahead and and remove that
LED<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.910> replace<00:03:27.910> it<00:03:28.180> with<00:03:29.020> the<00:03:29.280> 350<00:03:30.510> lumen

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
LED and replace it with the 350 lumen

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.410 
LED and replace it with the 350 lumen

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
LED using this heat sink compound that I

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.390 
LED using this heat sink compound that I
picked<00:03:37.690> up<00:03:37.840> from<00:03:38.080> RadioShack<00:03:38.620> it<00:03:39.160> is<00:03:39.280> an

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
picked up from RadioShack it is an

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.590 
picked up from RadioShack it is an
adhesive<00:03:39.820> heat<00:03:40.810> sink<00:03:41.140> compound<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:43.360> first

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
adhesive heat sink compound the first

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.710 
adhesive heat sink compound the first
time<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:43.990> remove<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.470> lead<00:03:44.710> it<00:03:45.040> is<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.720> very

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
time you remove the lead it is a very

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.780 
time you remove the lead it is a very
sticky<00:03:47.050> adhesive<00:03:47.430> heat<00:03:48.430> sink<00:03:48.730> compound

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
sticky adhesive heat sink compound

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.230 
sticky adhesive heat sink compound
almost<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:49.750> consistency<00:03:50.470> of<00:03:50.500> chewing-gum

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
almost the consistency of chewing-gum

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.880 
almost the consistency of chewing-gum
but<00:03:52.240> just<00:03:52.690> worked<00:03:52.990> it<00:03:53.170> a<00:03:53.230> little<00:03:53.500> with<00:03:53.860> a

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
but just worked it a little with a

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.070 
but just worked it a little with a
flathead<00:03:54.550> screwdriver<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:55.600> it<00:03:55.690> came<00:03:55.840> right

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
flathead screwdriver and it came right

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.440 
flathead screwdriver and it came right
off<00:03:56.230> okay

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.050 

I<00:04:01.480> removed<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:03.209> 200<00:04:04.209> lumen<00:04:04.570> LED<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:06.060> solder

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
I removed the 200 lumen LED the solder

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.310 
I removed the 200 lumen LED the solder
didn't<00:04:07.420> want<00:04:07.570> to<00:04:07.690> release<00:04:07.930> so<00:04:08.140> I<00:04:08.200> actually

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
didn't want to release so I actually

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.390 
didn't want to release so I actually
just<00:04:08.709> cut<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.130> wire<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.950> stripped<00:04:11.950> it<00:04:12.070> so<00:04:12.370> I

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
just cut the wire and stripped it so I

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.080 
just cut the wire and stripped it so I
can<00:04:12.820> solder<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.530> new<00:04:14.920> one<00:04:15.160> and<00:04:15.489> you<00:04:15.910> can

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
can solder to the new one and you can

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.190 
can solder to the new one and you can
see

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.620 

there's<00:04:23.200> a<00:04:23.320> plus/minus<00:04:24.520> on<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:26.230> led<00:04:26.890> and

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
there's a plus/minus on the led and

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.480 
there's a plus/minus on the led and
obviously<00:04:28.630> red<00:04:29.020> is<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.710> soldered<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.460> the

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
obviously red is the soldered to the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.410 
obviously red is the soldered to the
positive<00:04:31.090> and<00:04:31.300> black<00:04:31.420> to<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.900> negative<00:04:33.420> not

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
positive and black to the negative not

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.590 
positive and black to the negative not
the<00:04:34.600> best<00:04:34.840> job<00:04:35.080> soldering<00:04:35.620> but<00:04:36.450> we're<00:04:37.450> going

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
the best job soldering but we're going

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.750 
the best job soldering but we're going
to<00:04:37.660> put<00:04:37.870> it<00:04:37.960> back<00:04:38.140> together<00:04:40.110> okay<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.760> applied

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
to put it back together okay I applied

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.790 
to put it back together okay I applied
the<00:04:42.940> heat<00:04:43.120> sink<00:04:43.420> compound<00:04:43.740> and<00:04:45.840> set<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:47.050> LED

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
the heat sink compound and set the LED

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.840 
the heat sink compound and set the LED
on<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:49.860> heat<00:04:50.860> sink<00:04:51.190> and<00:04:53.100> you<00:04:54.100> can<00:04:54.280> still<00:04:54.580> move

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
on the heat sink and you can still move

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:01.200 
on the heat sink and you can still move
it<00:04:55.120> around<00:04:55.390> as<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:58.440> red<00:04:59.440> and<00:04:59.680> black<00:04:59.980> wire<00:05:00.310> need

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
it around as the red and black wire need

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.980 
it around as the red and black wire need
to<00:05:01.330> be<00:05:01.480> routed<00:05:02.020> when<00:05:02.950> you<00:05:03.480> attach<00:05:04.480> the<00:05:04.510> heat

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
to be routed when you attach the heat

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.590 
to be routed when you attach the heat
sink<00:05:05.320> with<00:05:05.980> the<00:05:06.130> spring<00:05:06.490> that's<00:05:07.240> going<00:05:07.450> to<00:05:07.510> be

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
sink with the spring that's going to be

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.880 
sink with the spring that's going to be
a<00:05:07.630> tighter<00:05:07.930> fit<00:05:08.350> as<00:05:08.710> it's<00:05:09.010> not<00:05:09.250> a<00:05:09.280> perfect<00:05:10.890> same

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
a tighter fit as it's not a perfect same

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.270 
a tighter fit as it's not a perfect same
size<00:05:12.130> as<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.550> original<00:05:12.610> LED<00:05:13.620> but<00:05:14.620> if<00:05:14.950> you<00:05:15.190> can

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
size as the original LED but if you can

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.790 
size as the original LED but if you can
get<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:15.580> heat<00:05:15.820> sink<00:05:16.090> and<00:05:16.210> spring<00:05:16.630> on<00:05:16.810> and<00:05:17.260> get

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
get the heat sink and spring on and get

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.390 
get the heat sink and spring on and get
it<00:05:17.920> aligned<00:05:18.610> a<00:05:19.500> projector<00:05:20.500> still<00:05:20.800> shoots<00:05:21.190> a

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
it aligned a projector still shoots a

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.950 
it aligned a projector still shoots a
great<00:05:21.850> shot<00:05:23.670> okay<00:05:24.670> I<00:05:24.700> got<00:05:24.970> the<00:05:25.150> heatsink<00:05:25.750> on

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
great shot okay I got the heatsink on

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.980 
great shot okay I got the heatsink on
now<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:26.620> spring<00:05:27.190> is<00:05:27.400> a<00:05:27.430> really<00:05:28.030> tight<00:05:28.330> fit<00:05:28.360> as

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
now the spring is a really tight fit as

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:36.090 
now the spring is a really tight fit as
you<00:05:29.170> can<00:05:29.320> see<00:05:33.870> and<00:05:34.870> there's<00:05:35.200> just<00:05:35.680> a<00:05:35.830> slight

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
you can see and there's just a slight

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.320 
you can see and there's just a slight
gap<00:05:37.590> between<00:05:38.590> the<00:05:39.210> heatsink

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
gap between the heatsink

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.660 
gap between the heatsink
and<00:05:40.450> the<00:05:40.750> housing<00:05:41.290> which<00:05:41.800> did<00:05:42.130> not<00:05:42.310> affect

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
and the housing which did not affect

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.690 
and the housing which did not affect
performance<00:05:43.300> last<00:05:44.080> time<00:05:44.410> but<00:05:45.250> I'm<00:05:45.490> going<00:05:45.640> to

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
performance last time but I'm going to

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.140 
performance last time but I'm going to
go<00:05:45.850> ahead<00:05:45.940> and<00:05:46.240> throw<00:05:46.510> it<00:05:46.570> back<00:05:46.630> together<00:05:46.930> and

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
go ahead and throw it back together and

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.170 
go ahead and throw it back together and
we'll<00:05:49.150> see<00:05:49.210> how<00:05:49.630> it<00:05:49.840> works<00:05:50.550> okay<00:05:51.550> here's<00:05:51.970> the

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
we'll see how it works okay here's the

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.840 
we'll see how it works okay here's the
result<00:05:55.110> still<00:05:56.110> not<00:05:56.350> as<00:05:56.530> bright<00:05:56.830> as<00:05:57.010> I<00:05:57.190> like<00:05:57.580> I

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
result still not as bright as I like I

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.240 
result still not as bright as I like I
might<00:05:58.240> even<00:05:58.750> try<00:05:59.200> and<00:05:59.350> go<00:05:59.560> with<00:05:59.590> a<00:05:59.920> brighter

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
might even try and go with a brighter

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:06.060 
might even try and go with a brighter
LED<00:06:01.050> but<00:06:02.050> it<00:06:02.230> is<00:06:02.410> much<00:06:02.950> better<00:06:03.310> than<00:06:03.490> away
