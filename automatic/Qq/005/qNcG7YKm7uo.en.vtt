00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.080 
let us know that Torkos demon inside of
him<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:27.720> probably<00:03:28.349> very<00:03:28.439> strong<00:03:29.010> because<00:03:29.970> we

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
him is probably very strong because we

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.030 
him is probably very strong because we
do<00:03:30.209> know<00:03:30.359> he<00:03:30.479> has<00:03:30.599> the<00:03:30.720> scars<00:03:31.049> on<00:03:31.319> his<00:03:31.439> face<00:03:31.470> and

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
do know he has the scars on his face and

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.119 
do know he has the scars on his face and
so<00:03:32.819> to<00:03:32.879> find<00:03:33.419> that<00:03:33.629> out<00:03:33.689> we<00:03:34.379> could<00:03:34.769> instantly

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
so to find that out we could instantly

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.580 
so to find that out we could instantly
assume<00:03:35.669> that<00:03:36.599> this<00:03:36.780> demon<00:03:37.109> has<00:03:37.229> to<00:03:37.349> be<00:03:37.409> very

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
assume that this demon has to be very

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.140 
assume that this demon has to be very
strong<00:03:37.709> inside<00:03:38.220> whore<00:03:38.489> go<00:03:38.669> since<00:03:38.879> we<00:03:38.970> already

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
strong inside whore go since we already

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.909 
strong inside whore go since we already
got<00:03:39.389> to<00:03:39.659> see<00:03:39.840> some<00:03:40.229> of<00:03:40.259> its<00:03:40.500> strength<00:03:40.680> we

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
got to see some of its strength we

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.589 
got to see some of its strength we
already<00:03:41.159> saw<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.340> blue<00:03:41.579> demon<00:03:41.879> inside<00:03:42.000> toriko
