00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.740 
here alongside a tangle teezer now at
the<00:00:55.110> time<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.860> slightly<00:00:56.789> prefer<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> tangle

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the time I slightly prefer the tangle

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.160 
the time I slightly prefer the tangle
teezer

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
teezer

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.740 
teezer
but<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:59.430> being<00:00:59.699> said<00:00:59.789> now<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.539> been<00:01:00.690> a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
but that being said now that it's been a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.900 
but that being said now that it's been a
few<00:01:00.989> years<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.649> tangle<00:01:02.039> teezer<00:01:02.190> barely

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
few years the tangle teezer barely

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.830 
few years the tangle teezer barely
lasted<00:01:03.300> me<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> year<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:05.299> started<00:01:06.299> using<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
lasted me a year and I started using the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.780 
lasted me a year and I started using the
Michelle<00:01:07.170> Mercier<00:01:07.590> brush<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.070> lot<00:01:08.340> more<00:01:08.549> often

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
Michelle Mercier brush a lot more often

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.060 
Michelle Mercier brush a lot more often
than<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> tangle<00:01:09.630> teaser<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.799> Michelle

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
than the tangle teaser and the Michelle

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.370 
than the tangle teaser and the Michelle
Mercier<00:01:11.490> brush<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.939> still<00:01:12.210> around<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.170> they're

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
Mercier brush is still around so they're

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.100 
Mercier brush is still around so they're
very<00:01:13.590> Hardy<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.970> bristles<00:01:15.450> haven't<00:01:15.869> even

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
very Hardy and the bristles haven't even

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.830 
very Hardy and the bristles haven't even
bent<00:01:16.409> whereas<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.040> tangle<00:01:17.430> teezer<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:18.060> think

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
bent whereas the tangle teezer I think

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.929 
bent whereas the tangle teezer I think
because<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> bristles<00:01:19.409> were<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:19.890> soft<00:01:20.520> they

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
because the bristles were so soft they

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.649 
because the bristles were so soft they
bent<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:21.720> quickly<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.640> yeah<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.090> have

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
bent really quickly and yeah I just have

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.450 
bent really quickly and yeah I just have
ended<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.020> really<00:01:25.409> loving<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.130> Michelle

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
different chunks I will have one side

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.280 
different chunks I will have one side
want<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:30.000> other<00:02:30.150> side<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.720> one<00:02:30.959> at<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.140> back

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
so I've got a lot of hair but it's very

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.030 
so I've got a lot of hair but it's very
very<00:02:42.030> fine<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.690> actual<00:02:43.080> hairs<00:02:43.380> themselves

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
very fine the actual hairs themselves

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.550 
very fine the actual hairs themselves
are<00:02:44.160> really<00:02:44.400> really<00:02:44.849> thin<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:45.959> I'm<00:02:46.319> gonna

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
are really really thin so I'm gonna

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.819 
are really really thin so I'm gonna
start<00:02:47.069> by<00:02:47.250> actually<00:02:47.819> using<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:48.329> normal<00:02:48.870> one

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
start by actually using the normal one

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.490 
start by actually using the normal one
on<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:51.120> least<00:02:51.510> knotty<00:02:51.750> part<00:02:52.049> of<00:02:52.140> my<00:02:52.260> hair

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
on the least knotty part of my hair

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.930

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
because I have a feeling the normal one

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.600 
because I have a feeling the normal one
isn't<00:02:54.209> gonna<00:02:54.299> work<00:02:54.540> as<00:02:54.780> well<00:02:54.989> for<00:02:55.019> me<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.610> will

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
as the review so as you can see that

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.849 
as the review so as you can see that
just<00:03:15.299> went<00:03:15.510> through<00:03:15.660> my<00:03:15.989> hair<00:03:16.530> really<00:03:16.739> really

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
just went through my hair really really

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.059 
just went through my hair really really
fast<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:18.120> on<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:18.780> side<00:03:19.049> which<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.440> bit<00:03:19.680> more

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
fast so on this side which is a bit more

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.099 
fast so on this side which is a bit more
tangled<00:03:20.489> because<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:20.970> sleep<00:03:21.209> on<00:03:21.420> my<00:03:21.569> right<00:03:21.600> side

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
tangled because I sleep on my right side

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.990 
tangled because I sleep on my right side
I<00:03:22.440> think<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.519> might<00:03:23.790> use<00:03:23.819> the<00:03:24.660> fine<00:03:25.500> hair<00:03:25.769> one

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
I think I might use the fine hair one

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.819 
I think I might use the fine hair one
now<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.060> fine<00:03:27.389> hair<00:03:27.600> again<00:03:27.840> is<00:03:28.079> the<00:03:28.380> white<00:03:28.620> one

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
now the fine hair again is the white one

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.759 
now the fine hair again is the white one
and<00:03:32.600> when<00:03:33.600> I<00:03:33.630> brush<00:03:33.810> my<00:03:33.989> hair<00:03:34.019> I<00:03:34.200> do<00:03:34.290> just<00:03:34.590> kind

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
and when I brush my hair I do just kind

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.830 
and when I brush my hair I do just kind
of<00:03:34.799> start<00:03:35.040> at<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.220> ends<00:03:35.519> before<00:03:35.819> I<00:03:35.880> go<00:03:36.090> fully

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
of start at the ends before I go fully

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.250 
of start at the ends before I go fully
up<00:03:37.139> the<00:03:37.950> hair<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:39.810> don't<00:03:40.019> break<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:41.930> let's<00:03:42.930> just

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
up the hair so don't break it let's just

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.050 
up the hair so don't break it let's just
fix<00:03:43.530> up<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.920> front<00:03:44.160> Charlie<00:03:46.819> Wow

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
fix up that front Charlie Wow

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.430 
fix up that front Charlie Wow
so<00:03:48.269> that's<00:03:48.450> just<00:03:48.660> gone<00:03:48.870> through<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:49.109> hair

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
so that's just gone through a hair

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.379 
so that's just gone through a hair
really<00:03:49.650> really<00:03:49.889> fast<00:03:50.190> as<00:03:50.430> well<00:03:50.609> probably<00:03:51.209> a

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
really really fast as well probably a
