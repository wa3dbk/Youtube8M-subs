button<00:02:21.740> there's<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.220> flight<00:02:22.490> plan<00:02:22.640> we're<00:02:23.000> going

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
button there's a flight plan we're going

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.440 
button there's a flight plan we're going
to<00:02:23.300> owe<00:02:23.330> our<00:02:23.570> 40<00:02:24.100> we've<00:02:25.100> selected<00:02:25.370> runway<00:02:25.940> 34

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
to owe our 40 we've selected runway 34

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.300 
to owe our 40 we've selected runway 34
and<00:02:26.720> make<00:02:26.900> sudden<00:02:27.230> glide<00:02:27.470> slope<00:02:27.770> in<00:02:27.920> of<00:02:28.070> three

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
and make sudden glide slope in of three

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.500 
and make sudden glide slope in of three
degrees<00:02:30.160> okay<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.220> this<00:02:31.490> is<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.700> traffic<00:02:32.120> target

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
degrees okay so this is a traffic target

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.070 
degrees okay so this is a traffic target
right<00:02:32.720> here<00:02:37.060> there<00:02:38.060> he<00:02:38.180> is<00:02:38.210> he's<00:02:38.480> 200<00:02:38.930> feet

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
right here there he is he's 200 feet

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:50.410 
right here there he is he's 200 feet
below<00:02:39.110> us<00:02:39.410> right<00:02:39.970> there<00:02:44.980> altitude<00:02:49.240> we<00:02:50.240> come

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
below us right there altitude we come

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.700 
below us right there altitude we come
around<00:02:50.540> here<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:50.900> can<00:02:51.050> see<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.260> synthetic

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
around here you can see the synthetic

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.340 
around here you can see the synthetic
approach<00:02:51.950> being<00:02:52.340> drawn<00:02:52.610> into<00:02:52.970> oh<00:02:53.240> our<00:02:53.690> 40<00:02:54.200> at

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
approach being drawn into oh our 40 at

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.200 
approach being drawn into oh our 40 at
the<00:02:54.410> three<00:02:54.740> degrees<00:02:55.100> runway<00:02:55.640> three<00:02:55.850> four<00:02:56.060> and

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
the three degrees runway three four and

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.050 
the three degrees runway three four and
there's<00:02:56.330> our<00:02:56.450> 40<00:02:57.490> so<00:02:58.490> if<00:02:58.550> you<00:02:58.640> fly<00:02:58.850> through

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
there's our 40 so if you fly through

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.670 
there's our 40 so if you fly through
those<00:02:59.240> boxes<00:02:59.780> we<00:02:59.930> should<00:03:00.140> end<00:03:00.290> up<00:03:00.440> at<00:03:00.560> the

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
those boxes we should end up at the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:09.710 
those boxes we should end up at the
airport<00:03:00.980> on<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.820> runway
