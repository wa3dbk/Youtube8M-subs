00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
life they're actually technically

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.660 
life they're actually technically
decaying<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:56.010> course<00:02:56.250> they<00:02:56.370> decay<00:02:56.640> over

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
decaying of course they decay over

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.430 
decaying of course they decay over
millions<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:57.690> years<00:02:57.870> but<00:02:57.989> that's<00:02:58.170> neither

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
millions of years but that's neither

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.620 
millions of years but that's neither
here<00:02:58.560> nor<00:02:58.709> there<00:02:59.150> larger<00:03:00.150> point<00:03:00.300> is<00:03:00.450> they

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
here nor there larger point is they

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.680 
here nor there larger point is they
don't<00:03:00.810> generate<00:03:01.290> any<00:03:01.440> kind<00:03:01.800> of<00:03:02.690> investment

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
don't generate any kind of investment

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.000 
don't generate any kind of investment
income<00:03:03.930> they<00:03:04.050> don't<00:03:04.200> generate<00:03:04.500> profit<00:03:04.890> and

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
income they don't generate profit and

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.170 
income they don't generate profit and
okay<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.220> dividend<00:03:05.610> they'll<00:03:05.700> pay<00:03:05.880> interest

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
okay a dividend they'll pay interest

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.420 
okay a dividend they'll pay interest
they<00:03:06.570> just<00:03:06.930> sit<00:03:07.200> there<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.500> collect<00:03:07.680> dust<00:03:08.070> and

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
they just sit there and collect dust and

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.580 
they just sit there and collect dust and
so<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.300> say<00:03:09.450> well<00:03:09.600> what<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.900> what<00:03:10.080> is<00:03:10.200> gold<00:03:10.380> and

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
so you say well what is what is gold and

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.320 
so you say well what is what is gold and
silver<00:03:10.980> if<00:03:11.100> not<00:03:11.280> an<00:03:11.400> investment<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.090> if<00:03:12.180> it's

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
silver if not an investment and if it's

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.850 
silver if not an investment and if it's
insurance<00:03:12.750> why<00:03:12.930> would<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.170> get<00:03:13.260> gold<00:03:13.560> or<00:03:13.739> silver

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
insurance why would I get gold or silver

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.410 
insurance why would I get gold or silver
well<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.160> reason<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.550> get<00:03:14.670> gold<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.060> silver

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
well the reason you get gold and silver

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.720 
well the reason you get gold and silver
is<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:16.140> hedge<00:03:16.500> against<00:03:16.800> hyperinflation<00:03:17.250> and

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
is to hedge against hyperinflation and

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.729 
is to hedge against hyperinflation and
the<00:03:18.390> other<00:03:18.540> reason<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.080> that<00:03:19.110> in<00:03:19.380> case<00:03:19.560> there's

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
the other reason is that in case there's

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.280 
the other reason is that in case there's
an<00:03:19.890> oh<00:03:20.070> shit<00:03:20.100> hits<00:03:20.550> the<00:03:20.640> fan<00:03:20.760> scenario<00:03:21.480> that's

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
an oh shit hits the fan scenario that's

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.900 
an oh shit hits the fan scenario that's
it<00:03:22.560> that's<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.830> end<00:03:22.890> that's<00:03:23.160> why<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.520> know<00:03:23.880> a

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
it that's the end that's why you know a

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.820 
it that's the end that's why you know a

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
why is because you don't need that much

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.160 
why is because you don't need that much
gold<00:03:32.670> or<00:03:32.910> silver<00:03:33.120> because<00:03:33.570> if<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.810> economy
