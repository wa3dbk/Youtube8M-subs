look in a racket to improve their
performance<00:02:41.560> which<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.460> did<00:02:42.670> also<00:02:43.000> will<00:02:43.150> take

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
performance which I did also will take

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.870 
performance which I did also will take
with<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.780> techno<00:02:44.080> fiber<00:02:44.290> but<00:02:44.620> in<00:02:45.340> terms<00:02:45.700> of

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
with the techno fiber but in terms of

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.170 
with the techno fiber but in terms of
colors<00:02:46.330> every<00:02:47.080> time<00:02:47.430> techno<00:02:48.430> fiber<00:02:48.670> changes

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
colors every time techno fiber changes

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.810 
colors every time techno fiber changes
the<00:02:49.270> design<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.840> better<00:02:50.140> than<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.500> last<00:02:50.530> one

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
the design is better than the last one

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.160 
the design is better than the last one
to<00:02:51.820> be<00:02:51.970> honest<00:02:52.270> with<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.720> first<00:02:52.900> one<00:02:53.110> I

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
to be honest with you the first one I

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.410 
to be honest with you the first one I
got<00:02:53.290> which<00:02:53.650> was<00:02:53.800> like<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.160> completely<00:02:54.910> black<00:02:55.180> I

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
got which was like a completely black I

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.240 
got which was like a completely black I
didn't<00:02:55.720> like<00:02:55.990> so<00:02:56.290> much<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.590> design<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:56.950> liked

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
didn't like so much the design I liked

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.610 
didn't like so much the design I liked
the<00:02:57.400> record<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.760> lot<00:02:57.910> but<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.930> every<00:02:59.290> time<00:02:59.500> they

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
the record a lot but the every time they

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:15.410 
the record a lot but the every time they
make<00:02:59.770> a<00:02:59.830> change<00:03:00.250> it's<00:03:00.820> better<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.300> better

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.559 

okay<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.410> was<00:03:17.040> really<00:03:17.190> saying<00:03:17.490> what<00:03:17.819> I<00:03:17.850> mean
