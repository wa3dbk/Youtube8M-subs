would<00:02:21.550> be<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.670> little<00:02:21.940> dot<00:02:22.660> in<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.870> mirror<00:02:23.110> but

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
would be a little dot in the mirror but

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.550 
would be a little dot in the mirror but
peeking<00:02:24.370> at<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.489> inside<00:02:25.019> it's<00:02:26.019> pretty<00:02:26.320> much

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
peeking at the inside it's pretty much

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.590

exactly<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.280> same<00:02:27.400> as<00:02:27.580> mine<00:02:27.910> one<00:02:28.239> thing<00:02:28.450> I

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
exactly the same as mine one thing I

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.690 
exactly the same as mine one thing I
really<00:02:28.840> like<00:02:29.019> on<00:02:29.320> these<00:02:29.560> on<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.980> SE<00:02:30.250> luxuries

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700

is<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.360> woodgrain<00:02:31.720> trim<00:02:31.989> you<00:02:32.230> get<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.680> think

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
is the woodgrain trim you get I think

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.220 
is the woodgrain trim you get I think
that<00:02:33.430> adds<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.730> really<00:02:34.180> nice<00:02:34.390> premium<00:02:34.810> look<00:02:35.049> to

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
one on the back and that's the only way

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.680 
one on the back and that's the only way
you<00:03:00.400> can<00:03:00.610> distinguish<00:03:01.030> that<00:03:01.209> this<00:03:01.360> one<00:03:01.540> is<00:03:01.660> a

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
you can distinguish that this one is a

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.050 
you can distinguish that this one is a
hybrid<00:03:01.959> so<00:03:02.650> Ford<00:03:02.950> wasn't<00:03:03.160> really<00:03:03.489> flashing

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
hybrid so Ford wasn't really flashing

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.479 
hybrid so Ford wasn't really flashing
like<00:03:04.239> hey<00:03:04.450> we<00:03:04.630> have<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.980> super<00:03:05.980> economically

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
like hey we have a super economically

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.600 
like hey we have a super economically
friendly<00:03:06.910> car<00:03:07.150> it<00:03:07.780> was<00:03:07.930> just<00:03:08.230> let's<00:03:08.950> make<00:03:09.280> a

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
friendly car it was just let's make a

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.039 
friendly car it was just let's make a
hybrid<00:03:10.450> fusion<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:12.220> they<00:03:12.430> did<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:13.720> can<00:03:13.870> see

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
hybrid fusion so they did you can see

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.539 
hybrid fusion so they did you can see
this<00:03:14.170> one<00:03:14.350> does<00:03:14.500> have<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.709> single<00:03:15.190> chrome

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
this one does have the single chrome

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.819 
this one does have the single chrome
dual<00:03:15.880> exhaust<00:03:16.239> or<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.200> single<00:03:17.440> chrome

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
dual exhaust or the single chrome

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.880 
dual exhaust or the single chrome
exhaust<00:03:18.070> no<00:03:18.489> dual<00:03:18.700> exhaust<00:03:19.060> on<00:03:19.269> this<00:03:19.390> one

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
exhaust no dual exhaust on this one

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.540 
exhaust no dual exhaust on this one
I<00:03:22.140> wish<00:03:23.140> that<00:03:23.530> they<00:03:23.740> would<00:03:23.950> put<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.400> dual

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
I wish that they would put the dual

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.780 
I wish that they would put the dual
exhaust<00:03:24.970> on<00:03:25.360> these<00:03:25.569> I<00:03:25.930> wish<00:03:26.740> it<00:03:26.890> would<00:03:27.010> become

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
exhaust on these I wish it would become

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.220 
exhaust on these I wish it would become
standard<00:03:28.240> on<00:03:28.360> all<00:03:28.390> of<00:03:28.720> them<00:03:28.870> because<00:03:28.959> I<00:03:29.170> think

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
standard on all of them because I think

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.220 
standard on all of them because I think
it<00:03:29.470> just<00:03:29.650> adds<00:03:29.770> a<00:03:30.270> super<00:03:31.270> premium<00:03:31.600> look<00:03:31.959> to<00:03:32.140> the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
it just adds a super premium look to the

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.580 
it just adds a super premium look to the
fusion<00:03:32.650> but<00:03:33.640> I<00:03:33.940> guess<00:03:34.569> that<00:03:34.959> they<00:03:35.110> have<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.410> cut

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
fusion but I guess that they have to cut

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.840 
fusion but I guess that they have to cut
corners<00:03:35.800> somewhere<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.459> that<00:03:36.520> was<00:03:36.670> one<00:03:36.819> of

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
corners somewhere and that was one of

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.940 
corners somewhere and that was one of
the<00:03:37.000> corners<00:03:37.300> they<00:03:37.450> chose<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.959> cut<00:03:38.170> this<00:03:38.800> one

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
the corners they chose to cut this one

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.650 
the corners they chose to cut this one
also<00:03:39.130> does<00:03:39.400> have<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:39.820> reverse<00:03:40.120> backup

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
also does have the reverse backup

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.570 
also does have the reverse backup
sensors<00:03:41.080> as<00:03:41.380> well<00:03:42.310> as<00:03:42.580> a<00:03:42.610> backup<00:03:43.300> camera<00:03:43.630> so

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
sensors as well as a backup camera so

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.190 
sensors as well as a backup camera so
that's<00:03:45.580> nice<00:03:45.880> you<00:03:46.570> also<00:03:46.600> have<00:03:46.930> your<00:03:47.050> little

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
that's nice you also have your little

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.729 
that's nice you also have your little
reflectors<00:03:47.739> right<00:03:47.950> down<00:03:48.130> below<00:03:52.620> speaking<00:03:53.620> in

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
reflectors right down below speaking in

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.890

this<00:03:53.890> side<00:03:54.160> this<00:03:54.880> one<00:03:55.090> does<00:03:55.360> not<00:03:55.630> have

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
this side this one does not have
