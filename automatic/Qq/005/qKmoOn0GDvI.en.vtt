00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
like most trucks and the body will come

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.760 
like most trucks and the body will come
up<00:00:58.219> so<00:00:58.550> if<00:00:58.820> you<00:00:58.879> do<00:00:59.239> a<00:00:59.270> 2<00:00:59.480> inch<00:00:59.899> lift<00:01:00.230> if<00:01:00.469> you<00:01:00.500> do

up so if you do a 2 inch lift if you do

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.770 
up so if you do a 2 inch lift if you do
a<00:01:00.800> 1<00:01:01.129> inch<00:01:01.340> lift<00:01:01.609> you<00:01:02.090> are<00:01:02.210> going<00:01:02.449> to<00:01:02.600> raise

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
a 1 inch lift you are going to raise

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.490 
a 1 inch lift you are going to raise
this<00:01:03.410> 1<00:01:04.280> inch<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:04.789> this<00:01:05.239> stays<00:01:05.630> here<00:01:05.990> or<00:01:06.140> this

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
this 1 inch and this stays here or this

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.550 
this 1 inch and this stays here or this
2<00:01:07.009> inch<00:01:07.250> okay<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:08.390> something<00:01:09.229> you<00:01:09.259> need<00:01:09.470> to

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
2 inch okay so something you need to

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.130 
2 inch okay so something you need to
consider<00:01:09.920> is<00:01:10.250> how<00:01:10.460> are<00:01:10.670> these<00:01:10.789> panels<00:01:11.360> going

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
consider is how are these panels going

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.240 
consider is how are these panels going
to<00:01:12.289> line<00:01:12.500> up<00:01:12.740> if<00:01:13.399> you<00:01:13.820> do<00:01:14.150> your<00:01:14.540> lift<00:01:14.810> okay<00:01:15.680> one

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
to line up if you do your lift okay one

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.760 
to line up if you do your lift okay one
inch<00:01:16.430> hardly<00:01:17.360> noticeable<00:01:17.810> like<00:01:18.350> you're

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
inch hardly noticeable like you're

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.920 
inch hardly noticeable like you're
raising<00:01:19.100> this<00:01:19.250> line<00:01:19.520> up<00:01:19.850> one<00:01:20.210> inch<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:20.600> it's<00:01:20.780> up

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
raising this line up one inch so it's up

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.140 
raising this line up one inch so it's up
here<00:01:21.170> in<00:01:21.380> your<00:01:21.560> bumper<00:01:22.310> corner<00:01:22.640> stays<00:01:22.909> right

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
here in your bumper corner stays right

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.450 
here in your bumper corner stays right
here<00:01:23.479> two<00:01:24.110> inch<00:01:24.380> gets<00:01:24.799> a<00:01:24.920> little<00:01:25.100> bit<00:01:25.280> more

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
here two inch gets a little bit more

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.390 
here two inch gets a little bit more
noticeable<00:01:26.060> so<00:01:26.950> maybe<00:01:27.950> two<00:01:28.189> inch

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
noticeable so maybe two inch

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.910 
noticeable so maybe two inch
cosmetically<00:01:29.210> isn't<00:01:29.960> something<00:01:30.320> that<00:01:30.590> you

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
cosmetically isn't something that you

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.890 
cosmetically isn't something that you
want<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.460> consider<00:01:31.759> if<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:32.540> have<00:01:32.750> an

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900
