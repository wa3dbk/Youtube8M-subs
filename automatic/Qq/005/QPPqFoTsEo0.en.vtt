were finally ready to sort of go back
into<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.289> cuz<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.439> mean<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.619> inactive<00:00:28.920> didn't

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
into it cuz I mean you inactive didn't

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.009

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
years I think what because there's such

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.180 
years I think what because there's such
a<00:00:33.239> there's<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.719> nostalgic<00:00:34.260> element<00:00:34.350> obviously
