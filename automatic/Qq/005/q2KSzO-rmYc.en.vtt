right back to where it was that diamond
means<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.870> it's<00:02:46.019> back<00:02:46.260> rounded<00:02:46.620> right<00:02:46.830> now

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
means that it's back rounded right now

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.100 
means that it's back rounded right now
but<00:02:47.340> if<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.550> hold<00:02:47.849> down<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.420> do<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.569> short<00:02:48.900> hold

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110

background and disabled and now you'll

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.460 
background and disabled and now you'll
see<00:02:57.800> that<00:02:58.800> it's<00:02:58.980> not<00:02:59.099> there<00:02:59.340> right<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:01.290> that's

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
see that it's not there right so that's

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.710 
see that it's not there right so that's
what<00:03:01.650> backgrounder<00:03:02.129> does<00:03:02.310> kind<00:03:02.879> of<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.060> it's

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
what backgrounder does kind of a it's

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.300 
what backgrounder does kind of a it's
almost<00:03:03.989> an<00:03:04.170> essential<00:03:04.680> like<00:03:04.859> if<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.129> don't

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
almost an essential like if you don't

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.709 
almost an essential like if you don't
have<00:03:05.430> background<00:03:05.879> or<00:03:06.120> you're<00:03:06.269> missing<00:03:06.599> out

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:06.719 
have background or you're missing out

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.259 
have background or you're missing out
even<00:03:07.379> if<00:03:07.499> you<00:03:07.620> use<00:03:07.829> native<00:03:08.249> multitasking<00:03:08.519> you

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
even if you use native multitasking you

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:09.600 
even if you use native multitasking you
should

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
should

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.770 
should
it<00:03:10.800> so<00:03:11.800> what<00:03:13.500> multiflo<00:03:14.500> does<00:03:14.770> multiflo<00:03:15.730> is<00:03:16.090> a

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
it so what multiflo does multiflo is a

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.580 
it so what multiflo does multiflo is a
tweak<00:03:17.260> on<00:03:18.120> backgrounder<00:03:19.120> that<00:03:19.780> allows<00:03:20.080> all<00:03:20.530> of

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
tweak on backgrounder that allows all of

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.710 
tweak on backgrounder that allows all of
your<00:03:20.920> stuff<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.490> be<00:03:24.180> background<00:03:25.180> in<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.480> certain

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
your stuff to be background in a certain

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.460 
your stuff to be background in a certain
way<00:03:26.140> okay<00:03:27.070> so<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:28.120> got<00:03:28.390> to<00:03:28.510> set<00:03:28.660> up<00:03:28.750> as<00:03:28.900> expose

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470

double-click you don't see the tests

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.810 
double-click you don't see the tests
which<00:04:59.530> are<00:04:59.680> come<00:04:59.890> up<00:05:00.010> in<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.190> bottom<00:05:00.280> the

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
which are come up in the bottom the

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.730 
which are come up in the bottom the
reason<00:05:01.180> for<00:05:01.210> that<00:05:01.360> is<00:05:01.630> is<00:05:01.840> because<00:05:01.870> I<00:05:02.350> use<00:05:02.530> this

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
reason for that is is because I use this

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.219 
reason for that is is because I use this
program<00:05:03.010> here<00:05:03.490> called<00:05:03.520> my<00:05:03.940> OS<00:05:04.300> my<00:05:05.260> OS<00:05:05.590> is<00:05:06.040> a

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
program here called my OS my OS is a

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.450 
program here called my OS my OS is a
little<00:05:08.229> tweak<00:05:08.470> that<00:05:08.650> allows<00:05:08.830> you<00:05:09.010> to<00:05:09.040> turn<00:05:09.220> on

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
little tweak that allows you to turn on

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.700 
little tweak that allows you to turn on
and<00:05:09.700> off<00:05:09.820> certain<00:05:10.180> little<00:05:10.390> functions<00:05:10.810> so<00:05:11.110> you

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
and off certain little functions so you

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.240 
and off certain little functions so you
see<00:05:11.860> I<00:05:11.890> got<00:05:12.130> a<00:05:12.160> multitasking<00:05:12.910> turned<00:05:13.210> off

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
see I got a multitasking turned off

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.680 
see I got a multitasking turned off
that's<00:05:15.250> basically<00:05:15.400> all<00:05:15.640> I<00:05:15.820> use<00:05:16.030> this<00:05:16.180> out<00:05:16.390> for

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
that's basically all I use this out for

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.450 
that's basically all I use this out for
so<00:05:17.020> with<00:05:17.530> the<00:05:18.630> multitasking<00:05:19.979> turned<00:05:20.979> off<00:05:21.190> it

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
so with the multitasking turned off it

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.310 
so with the multitasking turned off it
allows<00:05:21.700> you<00:05:21.880> to<00:05:22.000> use<00:05:22.120> backgrounder

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
allows you to use backgrounder

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.820 
allows you to use backgrounder
multiflo<00:05:23.980> properly<00:05:24.900> so<00:05:25.900> that's<00:05:26.500> pretty<00:05:26.710> much

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
multiflo properly so that's pretty much

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.320
