00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.760
 but 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.670
 or not 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.590
 very good to all friends that such 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.330
 welcome to a new video in which 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.570
 today I have will show how to block a 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.849
 web page by filtering dns that 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.759
 consists of modifying the hosts file 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.320
 that is in the folder there are 32 and this 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.660
 it's a very simple method that I hope that 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.509
 like it and work it well for 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:36.630
 start we have to go to what is 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:39.210
 home team is to place windows 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.170
 there are 32 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.589
 let's go to the drivers folder 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.539
 then to the folder etc double click and 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:50.059
 let's find the file that is called 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.000
 you fuck here is the safe file that 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.920
 it appears well what we have would be to give it 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.920
 right click copy 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.940
 and we're going to stick it on the path that you 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.570
 want for example I do not put the 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.460
 desk and well here I have it for 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.600
 bonus we have to give it double 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.689
 click and let's choose the notebook 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.540
 we will give in accept and come to cease 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.400
 files that we have to modify to 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.680
 power what a web page we have to 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.380
 copy what is that ip address from 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.049
 localhost let's give it right click 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.320
 copy and come has jumped its palaces 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:33.070
 after the local host about two and we're going 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.979
 to paste the one of this we're going to apply five 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.909
 spaces well to be able to block a 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:42.720
 page we have to write the url by 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.720
 example I will put 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.810
 to facebook 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.110
 we have blocked the facebook page and 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.480
 well then we do not believe pages we have to 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.930
 for each page that goes to block 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.479
 we have to locate a space we put the 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.510
 address and pere localhost let's have 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.740
 five spaces and we look for another url by 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.740
 example I will put youtube 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.459
 and ready we have what 22 web pages 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.370
 this is the filtering of ns that we 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.560
 will prevent scare these pages is a 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.659
 very useful way in case you want 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.879
 that someone 90 of your pages by 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.610
 example children who should not walk 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.959
 pages that do not have well once 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.510
 you have finished doing this we have 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.780
 that close the file and we're going to close it 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.909
 in saving well this is the host file 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.250
 that we have to copy again we are going to 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.680
 give you right click copy and we go to the 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.629
 folder where we were right now we're going to 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.069
 give you right click paste and we're going to 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.730
 replace the file where it says meet 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.950
 replace we give permits 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.800
 although I do not want it anymore the web pages 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.510
 we go to our browser this functional 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.180
 for any browser do not worry 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.430
 can work for mozilla firefox 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.860
 google chrome torch internet explorer 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.209
 for example so let's go to what 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.209
 is youtube 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.640
 not only was the promotion as you can see 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.040
 here it says that this page is not 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.780
 available because it is filtered 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.450
 by the method of inese 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.610
 and we also go to the page that we have 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.120
 what I do is on facebook we are going to 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.120
 click 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.540
 As you can see I can not enter either 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.620
 because we have blocked and filtered the 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.870
 web page using the host file and 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.760
 well if you want to return to normal 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.230
 this we have to go to the hosts file 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.410
 that we have copied that is like a 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.660
 support we will live with those of 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.240
 we are obviously going to give in 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.310
 accept good let's eliminate these 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.860
 ip addresses with their respective 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.320
 web pages we are going to give it to suppress 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.570
 and we will resave the file 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.940
 save and we're going to copy it back in 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.940
 what is the host folder 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.430
 32 folders exist 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.549
 folder drivers etc and we will be able to 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.980
 apply this file that you have pasted 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:20.490
 and let's give it to eat and replace 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.530
 and we are going to see that we have released the 

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.630
 web pages for example and then to 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.280
 youtube and facebook 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.500
 well as you can see it already unlocked the 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.220
 pages that I had blocked in this case 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:36.070
 it was YouTube and it was facebook 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.280
 one more tip when they are going to copy a 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.040
 url should not copy and with a bar 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.270
 for example this no character of what 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:48.310
 which is http two diagonal diagonal points 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:53.440
 we just have to copy it says wv 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.940
 rl point up to dotcom and well 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.830
