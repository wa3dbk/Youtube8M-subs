like I mentioned we do want to train the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.200 
like I mentioned we do want to train the
posterior<00:01:07.409> side<00:01:07.890> conditioning<00:01:08.850> because

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
posterior side conditioning because

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.210 
posterior side conditioning because
that's<00:01:09.600> gonna<00:01:09.840> help<00:01:10.020> us<00:01:10.229> if<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.530> catch<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.920> jolt

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
that's gonna help us if we catch a jolt

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.420 
that's gonna help us if we catch a jolt
purse<00:01:12.060> or<00:01:12.540> even<00:01:12.960> straight<00:01:13.350> or<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> lead

in line and understand that our are the
trauma<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.390> torque<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.990> happens<00:01:25.380> to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
trauma and the torque that happens to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.660 
trauma and the torque that happens to
the<00:01:25.650> brainstem

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
the brainstem

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.480 
the brainstem
at<00:01:28.330> least<00:01:28.690> 60%<00:01:29.229> of<00:01:29.620> the<00:01:29.680> time<00:01:29.920> is<00:01:30.070> caused<00:01:30.280> by

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
at least 60% of the time is caused by

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.130 
at least 60% of the time is caused by
hooks<00:01:30.760> and<00:01:31.000> shovel<00:01:31.330> hooks<00:01:31.510> and<00:01:31.690> uppercuts

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
hooks and shovel hooks and uppercuts

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.410 
hooks and shovel hooks and uppercuts
right<00:01:32.860> so<00:01:33.430> now<00:01:33.670> I'm<00:01:33.850> going<00:01:33.970> to<00:01:34.030> give<00:01:34.150> you<00:01:34.270> guys
