something I underestimated glowing

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.599 
something I underestimated glowing
mushrooms<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.500> before<00:00:16.830> i<00:00:16.859> get<00:00:17.010> into<00:00:17.039> glowing

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
mushrooms and before i get into glowing

mushrooms and before i get into glowing
mushrooms<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:18.390> want<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.720> say<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:18.869> hit<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.650> cursor

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
mushrooms I want to say I hit the cursor

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.710 
mushrooms I want to say I hit the cursor
so<00:00:20.400> you're<00:00:20.550> only<00:00:20.699> going<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:20.970> see<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.300> in-game

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
so you're only going to see the in-game

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.230 
so you're only going to see the in-game
cursor<00:00:22.289> hopefully<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.279> don't<00:00:23.850> know<00:00:24.029> if<00:00:24.119> that

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
cursor hopefully I don't know if that

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.820 
cursor hopefully I don't know if that
was<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> big<00:00:24.539> problem<00:00:24.930> with<00:00:24.990> people<00:00:25.230> or<00:00:25.650> what

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
was a big problem with people or what

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.200 
was a big problem with people or what
but<00:00:26.130> i<00:00:26.430> fixed<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:28.400> glowing<00:00:29.400> mushrooms<00:00:29.580> they

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
but i fixed it so glowing mushrooms they

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.810 
but i fixed it so glowing mushrooms they
are<00:00:30.359> probably<00:00:31.340> one<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.489> most<00:00:32.610> useful

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
are probably one of the most useful

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.639 
are probably one of the most useful
items<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.450> game<00:00:33.480> because<00:00:34.170> if<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.440> can't

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
items in the game because if you can't

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.900 
items in the game because if you can't
get<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.800> lot<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:34.980> these<00:00:35.190> lesser<00:00:35.610> healing

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
get a lot of these lesser healing

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.299 
get a lot of these lesser healing
potions<00:00:36.329> then<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:37.380> definitely<00:00:37.710> want<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.160> get

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
potions then you definitely want to get

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.729 
potions then you definitely want to get
as<00:00:38.579> many<00:00:38.820> mushrooms<00:00:39.149> as<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.230> possibly<00:00:40.559> can

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
as many mushrooms as you possibly can

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.729 
as many mushrooms as you possibly can
because<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.190> can<00:00:41.489> craft<00:00:41.730> these<00:00:42.000> together<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
because you can craft these together and

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.319 
because you can craft these together and
in<00:00:43.739> another<00:00:43.920> video<00:00:44.219> that's<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:45.000> I'm<00:00:45.059> going

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
in another video that's what I'm going

because
it's<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.070> lot<00:02:12.310> better<00:02:12.550> for<00:02:13.300> finding<00:02:13.720> stuff<00:02:13.990> or

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
it's a lot better for finding stuff or

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.680 
it's a lot better for finding stuff or
for<00:02:14.890> faster<00:02:15.490> times<00:02:15.730> when<00:02:16.210> digging<00:02:16.420> through

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690

you<00:02:47.920> can<00:02:48.130> grow<00:02:48.370> them<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.060> can<00:02:49.300> get<00:02:49.480> them

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
you can grow them so you can get them

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.930 
you can grow them so you can get them
above<00:02:49.930> ground<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.410> there's<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.680> lot<00:02:51.400> of<00:02:51.430> silver

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
good and the best thing about these

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.170 
good and the best thing about these
mushrooms<00:03:50.200> is<00:03:50.470> they<00:03:51.130> generate<00:03:51.640> back<00:03:51.850> so

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
mushrooms is they generate back so
