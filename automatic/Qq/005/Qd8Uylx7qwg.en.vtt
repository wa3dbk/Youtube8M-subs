that decisions based on how fast it is

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.460 
that decisions based on how fast it is
and<00:01:23.220> why<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.149> a<00:01:24.209> bow<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.899> the<00:01:24.959> feel<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and why it's a bow and the feel of the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.029 
and why it's a bow and the feel of the
song<00:01:25.970> then<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.539> kind<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.840> about<00:01:28.110> recording<00:01:28.740> a

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
or 11:00 which is great because it means

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.219
