00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.710 

the<00:00:16.610> reasons<00:00:16.910> we<00:00:17.000> went<00:00:17.180> to<00:00:17.330> three<00:00:17.540> zones

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
the reasons we went to three zones

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.780 
the reasons we went to three zones
reported<00:00:18.080> I<00:00:18.170> too<00:00:18.230> was<00:00:19.010> feedback<00:00:19.550> from<00:00:19.670> the

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:19.790 
reported I too was feedback from the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.280 
reported I too was feedback from the
players<00:00:19.970> and<00:00:20.119> they<00:00:20.330> really<00:00:20.570> wanted<00:00:20.779> a<00:00:20.900> better

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
players and they really wanted a better

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.109 
players and they really wanted a better
visual<00:00:21.619> world<00:00:22.040> they<00:00:22.340> wanted<00:00:22.640> a<00:00:22.790> world<00:00:22.820> that

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
visual world they wanted a world that

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.880 
visual world they wanted a world that
they<00:00:23.240> could<00:00:23.360> really<00:00:23.540> be<00:00:23.720> a<00:00:23.750> burst<00:00:24.020> in<00:00:24.230> and<00:00:24.410> by

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
they could really be a burst in and by

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.769 
they could really be a burst in and by
going<00:00:25.099> to<00:00:25.279> three<00:00:25.460> distinct<00:00:25.910> zones<00:00:25.970> it<00:00:26.510> really

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
going to three distinct zones it really

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.300 
going to three distinct zones it really
what<00:00:26.930> it<00:00:27.050> meant<00:00:27.200> was<00:00:27.439> that<00:00:27.470> we<00:00:27.740> could<00:00:27.890> give<00:00:28.070> a

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
what it meant was that we could give a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.029 
what it meant was that we could give a
greater<00:00:28.850> level<00:00:29.090> of<00:00:29.420> memory<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:30.289> resources

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
greater level of memory and resources

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.340 
greater level of memory and resources
and<00:00:31.310> just<00:00:31.490> focus<00:00:32.090> and<00:00:32.210> attention<00:00:32.570> that<00:00:32.900> our

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
and just focus and attention that our

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.960 
and just focus and attention that our
artists<00:00:33.770> could<00:00:33.860> deliver<00:00:34.160> to<00:00:34.309> each<00:00:34.489> zone<00:00:34.790> to

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
artists could deliver to each zone to

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.220 
artists could deliver to each zone to
make<00:00:35.090> them<00:00:35.270> absolutely<00:00:35.840> stunning<00:00:36.140> and

the<00:01:24.149> story<00:01:24.450> seldom<00:01:25.170> more<00:01:25.289> than<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.619> feel<00:01:25.830> of

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
the story seldom more than the feel of

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.100 
the story seldom more than the feel of
the<00:01:26.280> location<00:01:26.789> so<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.330> will<00:01:27.569> see<00:01:27.600> lots<00:01:27.959> of

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the location so you will see lots of

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.949 
the location so you will see lots of
guys<00:01:28.200> sitting<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:29.069> the<00:01:29.310> sidewalks<00:01:30.209> against

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:30.959 
guys sitting on the sidewalks against

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:34.999 
guys sitting on the sidewalks against
the<00:01:31.110> building's<00:01:31.560> kind<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.549> hiding<00:01:33.860> we<00:01:34.860> also

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the building's kind of hiding we also

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.539 
the building's kind of hiding we also
focused<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:35.970> having<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:37.229> dynamic<00:01:37.740> exposure<00:01:38.189> so

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
focused on having a dynamic exposure so

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.490 
focused on having a dynamic exposure so
that<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.880> could<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.240> dark<00:01:39.959> areas<00:01:40.350> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
that you could have dark areas and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.440 
that you could have dark areas and
bright<00:01:40.679> areas<00:01:41.099> and<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.489> having<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.179> camera

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
bright areas and and having the camera

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.290 
bright areas and and having the camera
really<00:01:42.569> adjust<00:01:42.989> for<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.410> so<00:01:43.849> it<00:01:44.849> didn't<00:01:45.090> feel

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
really adjust for that so it didn't feel

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.980 
really adjust for that so it didn't feel
like<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:46.080> monotone<00:01:47.239> area

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
like this this monotone area

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.090 
like this this monotone area
constant<00:01:49.950> intensity<00:01:50.930> a<00:01:51.930> lot<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.770> threat

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
constant intensity a lot of a threat

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.980 
constant intensity a lot of a threat
that<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.369> find<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> green<00:01:54.119> zone<00:01:54.390> is

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
that you find in the green zone is

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.440 
that you find in the green zone is
slightly<00:01:55.409> more<00:01:55.880> insidious<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.090> kind<00:01:57.360> of

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
slightly more insidious it's kind of

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.350 
slightly more insidious it's kind of
hidden<00:01:57.780> away<00:01:58.020> it's<00:01:58.860> not<00:01:59.130> as<00:01:59.340> overt<00:01:59.850> as<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.270> the
