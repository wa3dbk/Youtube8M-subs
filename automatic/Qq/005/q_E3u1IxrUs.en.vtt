as long as you want there will become a

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.590 
as long as you want there will become a
saturation<00:01:56.650> point<00:01:56.830> where<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.490> vodka<00:01:58.240> can<00:01:58.390> not

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
saturation point where the vodka can not

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.690 
saturation point where the vodka can not
become<00:01:58.750> any<00:01:59.080> stronger<00:01:59.590> so<00:02:00.340> if<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:00.520> wish<00:02:00.670> to

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.730 
become any stronger so if you wish to
try<00:02:00.940> a<00:02:00.970> very<00:02:01.240> strong<00:02:01.660> chili<00:02:02.050> vodka<00:02:02.440> you<00:02:02.590> can

leave<00:02:03.009> them<00:02:03.190> in<00:02:03.340> there<00:02:03.520> so<00:02:04.210> that's<00:02:04.360> how<00:02:04.509> we

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
leave them in there so that's how we

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.770 
leave them in there so that's how we
made<00:02:04.780> chili<00:02:05.110> infused<00:02:05.289> vodka
