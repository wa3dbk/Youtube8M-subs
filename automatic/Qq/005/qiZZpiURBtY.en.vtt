00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.410 
up um and he was a member of the i guess
the<00:00:30.510> marine<00:00:31.140> reef<00:00:31.529> society<00:00:32.430> something<00:00:35.329> he<00:00:36.329> was

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the marine reef society something he was

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.920 
the marine reef society something he was
like<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.690> director<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:38.090> washington<00:00:39.090> DC<00:00:39.270> of

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
like the director in washington DC of

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.060 
like the director in washington DC of
that<00:00:40.200> society<00:00:41.270> so<00:00:42.270> i<00:00:42.750> think<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.620> was<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> pretty

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
that society so i think it was a pretty

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.260 
that society so i think it was a pretty
good<00:00:44.190> purchase<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.450> i<00:00:46.789> have<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> few<00:00:48.059> questions

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
good purchase and i have a few questions

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:56.900 
good purchase and i have a few questions
I<00:00:49.910> know<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.390> piece<00:00:51.660> here<00:00:55.579> it<00:00:56.579> was<00:00:56.760> up

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
I know that this piece here it was up

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.060 
I know that this piece here it was up
into<00:00:57.149> here<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.530> input<00:00:59.390> because<00:01:00.770> it<00:01:01.770> says

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
into here is the input because it says

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.140 
into here is the input because it says
in<00:01:02.570> right<00:01:03.570> there<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.880> then<00:01:06.049> there's<00:01:07.049> another

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
in right there and then there's another

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:16.789 
in right there and then there's another
tube<00:01:09.150> here<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.780> output<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:15.799> I'm

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
tube here and that is the output and I'm

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.820 
tube here and that is the output and I'm
assuming<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.490> one<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.240> clean<00:01:19.049> ro/di

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
assuming this one is the clean ro/di

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.300 
assuming this one is the clean ro/di
water<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.729> i'm<00:01:20.880> using<00:01:21.560> for<00:01:22.560> my<00:01:22.710> fish<00:01:23.280> tank

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
water that i'm using for my fish tank

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:34.110 
water that i'm using for my fish tank
but<00:01:24.090> then<00:01:24.380> there's<00:01:25.380> another<00:01:25.610> output<00:01:28.490> it<00:01:29.780> says

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.920 

nptf<00:01:35.320> not<00:01:36.320> sure<00:01:36.530> that<00:01:36.860> stands<00:01:37.280> for<00:01:37.520> I<00:01:37.930> guess

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
nptf not sure that stands for I guess

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.850 
nptf not sure that stands for I guess
I'm<00:01:39.530> guessing<00:01:40.040> this<00:01:40.190> is<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:40.430> water<00:01:40.820> that<00:01:41.470> is

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.180 

wasted<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.040> not<00:01:47.140> pure<00:01:48.140> enough<00:01:48.170> for<00:01:48.740> my<00:01:48.890> fish

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
wasted and not pure enough for my fish

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.820 
wasted and not pure enough for my fish
tank<00:01:50.710> so<00:01:52.510> if<00:01:53.510> anyone<00:01:53.900> could<00:01:54.080> help<00:01:54.140> me<00:01:54.440> out<00:01:54.619> and

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
tank so if anyone could help me out and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.140 
tank so if anyone could help me out and
tell<00:01:55.130> me<00:01:55.310> what<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:56.900> do<00:01:57.080> with<00:01:57.229> those<00:01:57.790> or<00:01:58.790> if<00:01:59.000> I'm

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
tell me what to do with those or if I'm

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.810 
tell me what to do with those or if I'm
right<00:01:59.360> and<00:02:00.310> it<00:02:01.310> also<00:02:01.460> comes<00:02:02.030> with<00:02:02.240> this<00:02:03.820> pure

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
right and it also comes with this pure

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:13.710 
right and it also comes with this pure
check<00:02:05.150> monitor<00:02:05.920> um<00:02:09.820> know<00:02:10.820> if<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:11.120> works<00:02:11.360> but<00:02:12.230> um

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
check monitor um know if it works but um

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.330 
check monitor um know if it works but um
I<00:02:14.720> think<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:15.980> tds<00:02:16.459> meter<00:02:16.670> would<00:02:17.239> be<00:02:17.420> better

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
I think that tds meter would be better

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.090 
I think that tds meter would be better
so<00:02:19.340> I'll<00:02:19.489> just<00:02:19.580> get<00:02:19.910> one<00:02:20.120> of<00:02:20.239> those<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.830> take

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
so I'll just get one of those and take

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:29.970 
so I'll just get one of those and take
this<00:02:22.280> off<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:27.970> yeah<00:02:28.970> that's<00:02:29.180> pretty<00:02:29.330> much<00:02:29.600> it

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
this off and yeah that's pretty much it

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.590 
this off and yeah that's pretty much it
I<00:02:32.739> figured<00:02:33.739> out<00:02:33.890> i'll<00:02:34.010> be<00:02:34.430> buying<00:02:34.670> my<00:02:35.300> lights

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
I figured out i'll be buying my lights

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.530 
I figured out i'll be buying my lights
used<00:02:36.050> also<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:38.180> if<00:02:38.510> we<00:02:38.690> come<00:02:38.959> over<00:02:38.989> here<00:02:39.260> to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
used also and if we come over here to

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.170 
used also and if we come over here to
the<00:02:41.540> aquarium<00:02:43.030> um<00:02:45.130> it's<00:02:46.130> still<00:02:46.489> sitting<00:02:46.910> with

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
the aquarium um it's still sitting with

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.110 
the aquarium um it's still sitting with
chlorine<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:49.269> for<00:02:50.269> about<00:02:50.390> two<00:02:50.780> days<00:02:50.989> I<00:02:52.120> can

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
chlorine in it for about two days I can

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.539 
chlorine in it for about two days I can
still<00:02:53.239> smell<00:02:53.570> it<00:02:53.750> so<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:56.590> put<00:02:57.590> about<00:02:57.799> half<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.340> cup

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
still smell it so I put about half a cup

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.020 
still smell it so I put about half a cup
in<00:02:58.820> I<00:02:59.620> thought<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:00.769> would<00:03:00.860> be<00:03:01.040> gone<00:03:01.280> by<00:03:01.519> now<00:03:01.730> but

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
in I thought it would be gone by now but

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:14.510 
in I thought it would be gone by now but
i<00:03:04.239> guess<00:03:05.239> not<00:03:05.590> it's<00:03:06.590> still<00:03:06.920> there<00:03:08.829> and<00:03:09.829> then

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520
