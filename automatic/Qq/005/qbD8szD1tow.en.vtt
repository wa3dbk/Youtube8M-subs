 police officers and gendarmes 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.540
 equipped in France but its use 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.160
 is far from unanimous 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.990
 the controversy has reappeared 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.330
 for a week in favor of the trial 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.730
 which opposes Olivier Besancenot to the

 according to amnesty international 290 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.710
 people would have died after 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.269
 been affected by the taser basically 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.230
 in the United States should know that the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.410
 gun sends dumps 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.239
 50 thousand volts of what 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.399
 neutralize any madman 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.460
 investigation of a very controversial weapon 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.899
 jérôme dindar paris the men of the bac 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.120
 is about to leave on a mission 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.570
 the team of the commander alain schirmer 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.449
 to equip oneself well 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.780
 yeah the stuff at their disposal everything 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.780
 an arsenal 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.660
 we will prepare our lamps 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.180
 radios the binoculars 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.460
 inside this bag we can 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.760
 show there is the team in maintaining 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.670
 order 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.560
 the helmet the leggings the elbow patches and 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.759
 the defense stick which is the tonfa I 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.560
 you know the tiab flashball from 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.150
 cartridges that are bullets into 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.460
 rubber 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.869
 after the classics here is the novelty 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.869
 keep in a secure cabinet 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.510
 this is actually a pistol 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.180
 electric who will send a discharge 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.960
 electric is what is called in mode 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.240
 warm in the heart ie directly 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.400
 in touch on the individual joy by a 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.480
 probe jet the direct contact not it's 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.990
 simple I put you on the road for the 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.990
 test you open it and test it yourself 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.670
 the individual is far where needs to be 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.190
 neutralized because he has a bat of 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.360
 baseball because he has how 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.070
 I would say a knife and he is very 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.450
 angry we replace the cartridges 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.729
 here I am not going to trigger it 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.950
 if not she not a cartridge a sighting 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.790
 laser that will allow you to 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.290
 aim at the individual it works it works by 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.740
 a shot of dahra connected by wires 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.260
 electrical 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.640
 it's going to do exactly the same thing and 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.110
 the individual will fall neutralize 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.550
 unable to do anything to 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.780
 me these tears ideal of neutralization 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.430
 that is, we do not need anymore 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.920
 to go into contact with the individual 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.959
 we will neutralize it with the phenomenon 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.170
 electric and then once it's 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.390
 on the ground we will be able to go handcuff 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.310
 it's clear to the police this is 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.690
 of an anti- burr weapon it allows 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.269
 to avoid the use of firearms 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.440
 how does she work she is 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.440
 really safe 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.440
 his name tazer a jewel of technology 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.150
 invented in the united states guided by a 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.810
 laser beam they send towards his target 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.960
 two wires here in blue to their 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.760
 end two small ar metal bridge 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:07.930
 then an electric shock of 50 thousand 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:10.000
 volts course the son demonstration 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:22.240
 with this promotional film from the manufacturer 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:24.250
 American a colossal power doubled 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:34.210
 of another benefit he can neutralize 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:35.980
 a rabid beast without hurting her well 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.370
 sure most often the American police 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.080
 use it on humans sold 1600 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.420
 euros piece four times more than a 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.010
 traditional pistol he's trying 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.010
 to make the fortune of its manufacturer 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.170
 the policies of 63 countries have already adopted 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:04:04.110
 the manufacturer proposes besides a 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:06.910
 rather spectacular formation amsterdam 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.480
 the city welcomes that day the flagship 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.489
 European police 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.470
 alain gerber and his colleague pascal van 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.919
 roekeghem have made the trip since 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:29.950
 paris destination 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:34.740
 this big hotel they have an appointment with 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.740
 hans a former marine instructor 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.889
 the American manufacturer is interested in 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.600
 close to the European market 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.760
 so he gathered about sixty 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.820
 of elite officers to take an internship 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.410
 of training both will come next 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.880
 taser promoters in their 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:57.220
 respective police station both 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.060
 French they came privately 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.060
 to improve 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.030
 of the day 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.120
 exercises in real situation theme 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.740
 exercise in real situations 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:14.130
 eca police who can possibly get 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.130
 produce on the public highway 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.949
 these sessions are a special feature 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.290
 surprising 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.990
 the manufacturer requires every student has tested 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.960
 first the product on itself 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:42.930
 dutch has agreed to be filmed 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:42.930
 be careful it's awesome ok 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:51.210
 how you feel it hurts 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.210
 how are you 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:58.479
 your whole body is paralyzed you 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.970
 can not move and suddenly you 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:03.580
 you can not move and you 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.570
 were unconscious no we can see everything 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.340
 hear everything 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:12.750
 but we can not move and now 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.750
 go yeah now it's okay 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:22.160
 the advanced but it looks like you the sting 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:25.150
 so graveyard and it fits my skin 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.150
 certainly in provoc 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:34.880
 like a tear paralyzes 100 wounded 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.960
 that's why she's so effective 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.930
 look closely at this driver 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.610
 american for a few minutes they 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.490
 resist the injunctions of the 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.730
 the order the situation could escalate 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:50.330
 the man is robust and very determined 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:52.770
 You are under arrest 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.130
 you understand you are in condition 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.130
 arrest 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:05.510
 it is where the arrest is fast and 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:13.120
 especially without any bloodshed 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:13.120
 was going to give your hands I'm going to you 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:20.349
 this weapon of the third millennium 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.349
 would have everything to please 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:28.089
 yet in the United States as in France 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.089
 she is far from unanimous
