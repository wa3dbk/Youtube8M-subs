00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
astounding what's supposed to be like is

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.229 
astounding what's supposed to be like is
supposed<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.860> help<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.250> defend<00:00:50.670> against

supposed to help you defend against
attacks<00:00:51.620> but<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.890> doesn't<00:00:53.280> always<00:00:53.520> do<00:00:54.030> as<00:00:54.300> much

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
attacks but it doesn't always do as much

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.240 
attacks but it doesn't always do as much
as<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.930> think<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.410> would<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.710> actually<00:00:55.890> takes

as you think it would it actually takes

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.700 
as you think it would it actually takes
a<00:00:56.370> lot<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.789> slots<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.629> defense<00:00:58.020> up<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
a lot of slots of defense up just to

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.849 
a lot of slots of defense up just to
knock<00:00:58.980> off<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> few<00:00:59.760> hits<00:01:00.090> from<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.570> gun<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.410> not

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
knock off a few hits from a gun it's not

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.549 
knock off a few hits from a gun it's not
really<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.309> best<00:01:02.550> ability<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:04.110> certain

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
really the best ability but in certain

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.830 
really the best ability but in certain
situations<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.760> work<00:01:06.090> fairly<00:01:06.479> well<00:01:06.600> I

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
situations it can work fairly well I

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.990 
situations it can work fairly well I
guessed<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.380> certain<00:01:07.770> enemy<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.640> won't<00:01:08.820> say

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
guessed a certain enemy so I won't say

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.730 
guessed a certain enemy so I won't say
you<00:01:09.060> shouldn't<00:01:09.390> try<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.470> probably

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
you shouldn't try it but it's probably

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.710 
you shouldn't try it but it's probably
not<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> best<00:01:11.430> ability<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.360> should<00:01:12.540> go

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
not the best ability that you should go

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.140 
not the best ability that you should go
for<00:01:13.020> Oh<00:01:13.229> Frank<00:01:13.619> coming<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.040> at<00:01:14.250> number<00:01:14.760> 4

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
for Oh Frank coming in at number 4

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.940 
for Oh Frank coming in at number 4
probably<00:01:15.659> one<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.049> better<00:01:16.229> abilities<00:01:16.799> in

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
probably one of the better abilities in

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.700 
probably one of the better abilities in
my<00:01:17.100> opinion<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.700> swim<00:01:18.090> speed<00:01:18.360> up<00:01:18.420> at<00:01:18.810> 9<00:01:19.200> percent

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
my opinion is swim speed up at 9 percent

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.010 
my opinion is swim speed up at 9 percent
of<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> votes<00:01:20.100> swim<00:01:20.700> speed<00:01:21.000> up<00:01:21.060> does<00:01:21.479> exactly

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
of the votes swim speed up does exactly

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.230 
of the votes swim speed up does exactly
what<00:01:22.259> sounds<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.430> makes<00:01:23.670> your<00:01:23.850> swim

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
what sounds like and it makes your swim

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.940 
what sounds like and it makes your swim
speed<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.780> little<00:01:25.080> bit<00:01:25.170> faster

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
speed a little bit faster

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.890 
speed a little bit faster
that's<00:01:26.159> really<00:01:26.580> all<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.119> ability<00:01:27.390> does

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
that's really all this ability does

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.569 
that's really all this ability does
there's<00:01:28.290> no<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.590> fancy<00:01:28.829> tricks<00:01:29.340> or<00:01:29.520> anything

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
there's no like fancy tricks or anything

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.219 
there's no like fancy tricks or anything
with<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.240> where<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.509> really<00:01:30.900> comes<00:01:31.110> in

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
with it but where this really comes in

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.319 
with it but where this really comes in
helpful<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.770> when<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.310> ninja<00:01:32.850> squid<00:01:33.119> and

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
helpful is when you have ninja squid and

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.300 
helpful is when you have ninja squid and
you<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.900> use<00:01:34.049> those<00:01:34.200> combined<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:35.100> way

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
you can use those combined that way

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.030 
you can use those combined that way
since<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.790> ninja<00:01:36.060> squid<00:01:36.329> deduces<00:01:37.049> how<00:01:37.409> fast<00:01:37.860> you

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
since a ninja squid deduces how fast you

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.280 
since a ninja squid deduces how fast you
can<00:01:38.159> go<00:01:38.340> while<00:01:38.579> swimming<00:01:38.850> swim<00:01:39.600> speed<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:39.900> will

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
you know it's a nice correlation to hang

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.010 
you know it's a nice correlation to hang

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.649 
are jumping to when you do a super jump
so<00:02:05.250> if<00:02:05.310> one<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.490> your<00:02:05.670> teammates<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.210> deep<00:02:06.420> into

so if one of your teammates is deep into

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.779 
so if one of your teammates is deep into
enemy<00:02:06.869> territory<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.770> he<00:02:08.099> has<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.220> died
