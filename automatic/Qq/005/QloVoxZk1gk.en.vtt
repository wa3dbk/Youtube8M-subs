00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
back at this angle we've got to come

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.750 
back at this angle we've got to come
around<00:01:17.360> here<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.260> you<00:01:18.950> see<00:01:19.190> we<00:01:19.370> don't<00:01:19.490> cross

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
around here and you see we don't cross

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.600 
around here and you see we don't cross
over<00:01:20.060> our<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:20.660> get<00:01:20.930> into<00:01:21.170> our<00:01:21.290> position<00:01:21.830> until

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
over our and get into our position until

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.130 
over our and get into our position until
right<00:01:22.820> here<00:01:23.060> which<00:01:23.210> is<00:01:23.360> about<00:01:23.480> the<00:01:23.600> fourth<00:01:23.960> or

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
right here which is about the fourth or

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.370 
right here which is about the fourth or
fifth<00:01:24.170> jump<00:01:24.710> so<00:01:25.670> that's<00:01:26.420> pretty<00:01:26.780> tough<00:01:27.080> but

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
chance our headers not going to take

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.810 
chance our headers not going to take
care<00:01:42.350> of<00:01:42.470> it<00:01:42.560> we<00:01:42.680> probably<00:01:42.950> know<00:01:43.280> that<00:01:43.580> is

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
care of it we probably know that is

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.720 
care of it we probably know that is
we're<00:01:44.390> gonna<00:01:44.480> set<00:01:44.810> ourself<00:01:45.020> up<00:01:45.650> to<00:01:46.490> go<00:01:46.640> ahead

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
we're gonna set ourself up to go ahead

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.730 
we're gonna set ourself up to go ahead
and<00:01:47.000> catch<00:01:47.180> two<00:01:47.450> feet<00:01:47.750> when<00:01:47.930> this<00:01:48.110> happens<00:01:48.590> so

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
and catch two feet when this happens so

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.740 
and catch two feet when this happens so
this<00:01:48.890> is<00:01:49.040> how<00:01:49.190> we<00:01:49.250> do<00:01:49.490> that<00:01:49.760> so<00:01:50.240> our<00:01:50.390> header

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
this is how we do that so our header

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
get that steer on the second third

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.580 
get that steer on the second third
fourth<00:02:49.610> fifth<00:02:49.700> jump<00:02:50.240> if<00:02:50.450> our<00:02:50.990> header<00:02:51.200> gives<00:02:51.440> us

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
fourth fifth jump if our header gives us

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.310 
fourth fifth jump if our header gives us
this<00:02:51.800> really<00:02:52.130> sharp<00:02:52.340> handle<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.150> now<00:02:53.990> I'm

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
this really sharp handle so now I'm

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
and give us a good handle on steer that

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.260 
and give us a good handle on steer that
runs<00:03:00.980> right<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.460> show<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.790> difference<00:03:02.180> in

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
runs right and show the difference in

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.240 
runs right and show the difference in
what<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.480> position

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
what the position

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.530 
what the position
so<00:03:04.250> healers<00:03:04.610> now<00:03:04.820> we're<00:03:05.030> going<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.210> talk<00:03:05.390> about

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
so healers now we're going to talk about

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.720 
so healers now we're going to talk about
that<00:03:05.750> steer<00:03:06.020> that<00:03:06.140> runs<00:03:06.380> right<00:03:06.680> again<00:03:07.040> but

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
that steer that runs right again but

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.880 
that steer that runs right again but
then<00:03:08.030> our<00:03:08.330> header<00:03:08.720> gives<00:03:09.020> us<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.260> nice<00:03:09.440> soft

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
then our header gives us a nice soft

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.470 
then our header gives us a nice soft
handle<00:03:10.490> and<00:03:10.640> we're<00:03:11.000> gonna<00:03:11.090> put<00:03:11.360> everything

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
handle and we're gonna put everything

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.960 
handle and we're gonna put everything
together<00:03:11.930> we're<00:03:12.500> gonna<00:03:12.590> try<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:13.010> haze<00:03:13.310> then

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
together we're gonna try to haze then

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.850 
together we're gonna try to haze then
we're<00:03:14.150> gonna<00:03:14.270> back<00:03:14.570> off<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:15.200> our<00:03:15.560> header<00:03:15.740> is

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
we're gonna back off and our header is

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.380 
we're gonna back off and our header is
gonna<00:03:16.040> give<00:03:16.250> us<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.490> good<00:03:16.670> handle<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.300> we'll

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
gonna give us a good handle and we'll

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.330 
gonna give us a good handle and we'll
show<00:03:17.600> how<00:03:17.840> if<00:03:17.990> we<00:03:18.050> put<00:03:18.350> all<00:03:18.470> those<00:03:18.650> together<00:03:18.860> if

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
show how if we put all those together if

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.580 
show how if we put all those together if
our<00:03:19.760> header<00:03:20.000> helps<00:03:20.390> us<00:03:20.510> out<00:03:20.690> if<00:03:20.990> we're<00:03:21.440> doing

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
our header helps us out if we're doing

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.530 
our header helps us out if we're doing
our<00:03:21.800> job<00:03:22.130> right<00:03:22.370> how<00:03:22.610> much<00:03:22.760> easier<00:03:23.000> how<00:03:23.360> much
