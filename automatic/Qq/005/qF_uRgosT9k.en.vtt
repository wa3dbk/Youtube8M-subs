so<00:01:30.880> you<00:01:31.330> do<00:01:31.720> have<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:31.960> pay<00:01:32.170> attention<00:01:32.200> here<00:01:32.800> a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
so you do have to pay attention here a

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.520 
so you do have to pay attention here a
little<00:01:33.640> bit<00:01:33.760> because<00:01:34.090> if<00:01:34.450> it's<00:01:34.600> over<00:01:34.900> 100<00:01:35.320> you

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
little bit because if it's over 100 you

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.340 
little bit because if it's over 100 you
just<00:01:35.800> press<00:01:36.190> forward<00:01:36.430> or<00:01:37.000> back<00:01:37.270> one<00:01:37.750> time<00:01:37.990> and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
just press forward or back one time and

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.380 
just press forward or back one time and
the<00:01:40.320> damage<00:01:41.320> goes<00:01:41.560> back<00:01:41.890> because<00:01:42.640> if<00:01:42.910> it<00:01:43.150> goes

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
the damage goes back because if it goes

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.260 
the damage goes back because if it goes
above<00:01:43.660> 100<00:01:44.650> it<00:01:44.800> will<00:01:44.920> go<00:01:45.040> slower<00:01:45.400> so<00:01:45.790> what<00:01:46.180> you

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
above 100 it will go slower so what you

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.870 
above 100 it will go slower so what you
have<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.479> do<00:01:46.600> is<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.979> keep<00:01:48.340> pressing<00:01:48.580> this

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
over 40 combo get over a hundred combo

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.499 
over 40 combo get over a hundred combo
and<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.930> course<00:02:02.229> get<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.680> over<00:02:03.070> 400<00:02:04.030> combo

and of course get the over 400 combo
with<00:02:04.720> more<00:02:05.020> count<00:02:05.289> as<00:02:05.470> well<00:02:05.680> I<00:02:05.950> actually

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
with more count as well I actually

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.100 
with more count as well I actually
thought<00:02:06.670> that<00:02:06.729> we<00:02:07.030> just<00:02:07.300> give<00:02:07.479> this<00:02:07.660> character

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
thought that we just give this character

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.810 
thought that we just give this character
so<00:02:08.380> was<00:02:09.340> really<00:02:09.610> useful<00:02:09.929> but<00:02:10.929> yeah<00:02:11.080> um<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:12.670> way

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
so was really useful but yeah um the way

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.420 
so was really useful but yeah um the way
I<00:02:12.850> found<00:02:13.150> this<00:02:13.450> okay<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.290> figured<00:02:14.830> out<00:02:15.190> I

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
I found this okay I figured out I

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.500 
I found this okay I figured out I
couldn't<00:02:15.760> really<00:02:15.940> do<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.180> combo<00:02:16.750> with

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
couldn't really do a combo with

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.720 
couldn't really do a combo with
characters<00:02:19.510> because<00:02:19.840> actually<00:02:20.560> after<00:02:21.100> one<00:02:21.700> a

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
characters because actually after one a

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.790 
characters because actually after one a
couple<00:02:22.239> of<00:02:22.300> milliseconds<00:02:23.050> they<00:02:23.410> start

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
couple of milliseconds they start

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.979 
couple of milliseconds they start
recounting<00:02:24.610> so<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:25.590> got<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.739> first<00:02:27.040> challenger

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
recounting so I got the first challenger

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.150 
recounting so I got the first challenger
sand

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
sand

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.520 
sand
combo<00:02:30.160> with<00:02:30.820> links<00:02:31.330> final<00:02:31.870> smash<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:32.320> was

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
combo with links final smash so I was

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.070 
combo with links final smash so I was
thinking<00:02:32.920> oh<00:02:33.010> okay<00:02:33.459> which<00:02:33.820> move<00:02:34.090> does<00:02:34.840> give<00:02:35.049> a

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
thinking oh okay which move does give a

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.259 
thinking oh okay which move does give a
lot<00:02:35.320> of<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.650> mean<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.370> many<00:02:36.940> damage<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:39.269> that's

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
lot of I mean a many damage so that's

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.550 
lot of I mean a many damage so that's
when<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.600> came<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.290> this

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.600
