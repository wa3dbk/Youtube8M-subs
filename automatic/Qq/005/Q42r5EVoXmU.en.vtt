00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 water rockets water rocket launcher this is a simple to the spit of 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.600
 rockets that works with the pressure of air and water 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.760
 let's see some of the components to make the rocket bottles that 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.170
 we will use have the nozzle of the same dimensions of the tubes of 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.460
 plastic 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.590
 we will use the Australian method and anchor using a cable fixer 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.699
 placed in the mouthpiece of the bottle the sample is green 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:28.569
 we will use six of these devices and attach to your site 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:32.419
 With the help of an adapter tube as seen in the picture below this tube has 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.010
 also a rope attached to the bottom that serves as a trigger 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.530
 pulling the trigger releases the bottle to which the form has been given 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.560
 of a rocket and it goes flying to the heights 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.460
 At the other end of the tube, an auto valve is placed to allow the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.730
 air intake and prevent its exit from the bottle 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.710
 although the botiga of the bottle fits perfectly in the tube when 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.230
 Pumping air pressure this escapes due to high pressure before 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.620
 To avoid this the tube is heated a little and a protrusion is formed that 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.790
 It works as an air cap as you can see in the photo 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.330
 before launching the rocket we must understand that this one does and that he sees a lot 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.130
 potential energy and that if handled without care can hurt 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.130
 people or children so caution is advised 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.020
 it takes 1 piece of three meters of half-inch pvc tube 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.970
 1 piece of pvc some half inches two 90 degree pvc elbows 1 stopper 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.680
 for the turÃ³ of half two threaded connectors for had of half a cement 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.880
 for pvc 1 package of cable ties 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.200
 one press for wood that is slightly larger than the tube 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.090
 one automobile tire valve one bicycle inflator 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.490
 how it is done as we see next we must place the cable ties and 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.770
 on this the thick tube is placed 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.550
 then we secured the cable clips at the bottom with the 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.200
 hose press 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.040
 at the bottom you can see that the launcher is ready 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.090
 simply pumping air with the bicycle inflator is pulled from the 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.170
 rope that releases the fasteners and the rocket goes off
