00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.240
 curiosities that maybe you did not know about 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.240
 this great character 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.280
 and the joker's grades were bill 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.230
 finger box cane and jerry robinson and this 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.000
 it's been a fight and a mess since 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.040

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.290
 the true creator is said that those who 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.900
 more contributed to the character was bill that 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.879
 created the personality and jerry who did the 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.680
 look of the character and the first 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.100
 appearance of the joker was in 'batman 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.350
 number one of 1940 to create the joker 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.560
 were based on conrad veidt an actor that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.960
 he starred in the 1928 film called 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.060
 the man who laughs and who is based on 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.399
 a novel by vÃ­ctor hugo one of the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.740
 key contributions of jerry robinson was the 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.810
 the joker deck and the original deck is 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.090
 exhibited to the public at the William Museum 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.070
 brennan of the Jewish heritage in Atlanta 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.410
 Georgia and in the new Jewish museum 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.240
 york- the joker at first was 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.399
 destined to die in the first issue of 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.860
 batman in the hands of the dark knight ' 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.350
 however, the editor liked the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.240
 character who decided to keep it have been 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.220
 related many facts to find 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.420
 the true origin of the joker without 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.369
 However, they have never presented one 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.439
 and they have not confirmed the true 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.930
 name of him but for many the 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.520
 true name of joker in napier tal 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.850
 and how it happened in the tim movie 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.649
 burton but what the joker thinks 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.899
 The joker's head is totally 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.880
 confused until the same says that a 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.369
 Sometimes he remembers it one way and other times 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.259
 times from another different brand he says 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.750
 that if you are going to have a past that is a 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.850
 passed with options multiplies that 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.160
 pilgrims interpreted when hitting the series 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.319
 60s and interpreting this 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.180
 he refused to restore his whiskers 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.880
 so the make-up artists had 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.800
 than painting him white with his whiskers and not 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.290
 you have to be very observant to give yourself 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.299
 note that the mustache is still noticeable in 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.700
 the 70's is what now appeared in 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.709

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.450
 nicholson already had the smile and the 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.130
 intensity of the joker when he was chosen 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.030
 by Tim Burton to make the movie 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.290
 by eva duarte 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.500
 in fact the producer of the movie 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.360
 he used a picture of jack nicholson's 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.970
 film classic sign in to 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.010
