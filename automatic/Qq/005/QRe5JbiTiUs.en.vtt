00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
signs for a second here so when we look

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.450

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
at whey protein amino acids we're really

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.760 
at whey protein amino acids we're really
focused<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:44.879> muscle<00:00:45.270> protein<00:00:45.660> synthesis<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.739> I

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
focused on muscle protein synthesis so I

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.040 
focused on muscle protein synthesis so I
have<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.250> shake<00:00:47.670> 40<00:00:48.180> minutes<00:00:48.420> 30<00:00:48.629> mins<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:49.020> a

digest<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.190> hate<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.520> supplement

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969

nutritional<00:00:56.850> science<00:00:57.180> because<00:00:57.390> they<00:00:57.539> say

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
nutritional science because they say

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.869 
nutritional science because they say
always<00:00:58.109> fast<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.649> casing<00:00:58.980> slow<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.699> people

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
always fast in casing slow so people

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.459 
always fast in casing slow so people
assume<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.719> as<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.840> drink<00:01:01.050> while<00:01:01.260> your

already broken down but I still to break
that<00:01:12.659> down<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.869> little<00:01:12.960> bit<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.290> digestion

that down a little bit for digestion

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.770 
that down a little bit for digestion
then<00:01:14.159> your<00:01:14.280> cells<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.820> absorb<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.600> a

then your cells have to absorb it it's a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.660 
then your cells have to absorb it it's a
process<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.860> Mike<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.100> sit<00:01:17.250> here<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.430> say<00:01:17.549> it

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
process so Mike I sit here and say it

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.940 
process so Mike I sit here and say it
takes<00:01:17.880> 45<00:01:18.630> minutes<00:01:19.020> or<00:01:19.110> 60<00:01:19.350> minutes<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:19.740> in

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
takes 45 minutes or 60 minutes but in

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.499 
takes 45 minutes or 60 minutes but in
all<00:01:20.310> likelihood<00:01:20.340> with<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> research<00:01:21.330> we've

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
all likelihood with the research we've

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.539 
all likelihood with the research we've
seen<00:01:21.720> takes<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.380> little<00:01:22.530> longer<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:23.159> our

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
