that<00:01:34.329> up<00:01:34.420> so<00:01:34.539> I<00:01:34.569> think<00:01:35.259> of<00:01:35.409> the<00:01:35.469> box<00:01:35.649> of<00:01:35.799> what

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
that up so I think of the box of what

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.499 
that up so I think of the box of what
you<00:01:35.979> put<00:01:36.130> through<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.459> on<00:01:36.880> that<00:01:37.090> camping

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
you put through and on that camping

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.770 
you put through and on that camping
things<00:01:37.929> you<00:01:38.020> hear<00:01:38.249> nothing<00:01:39.249> could<00:01:39.399> have<00:01:39.490> a

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
things you hear nothing could have a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.760 
things you hear nothing could have a
replicate<00:01:40.780> what<00:01:40.929> they've<00:01:41.079> heard<00:01:41.289> and<00:01:41.439> things
