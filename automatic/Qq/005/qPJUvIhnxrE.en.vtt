00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.730 

let's<00:00:03.360> now<00:00:03.510> review<00:00:03.689> multiplication<00:00:04.620> and

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
let's now review multiplication and

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.340 
let's now review multiplication and
division<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.160> real<00:00:05.370> numbers<00:00:05.899> many<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:07.049> us<00:00:07.140> know

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
division of real numbers many of us know

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.690 
division of real numbers many of us know
that<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.649> negative<00:00:08.099> number<00:00:08.250> times<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.670> negative

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
that a negative number times a negative

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.180 
that a negative number times a negative
number<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.420> positive<00:00:09.719> answer<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.710> a

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
number is a positive answer and a

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.070 
number is a positive answer and a
negative<00:00:11.550> times<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.880> positive<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.540> negative

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
negative times a positive is a negative

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.839 
negative times a positive is a negative
let<00:00:13.440> me<00:00:13.530> share<00:00:13.710> with<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:13.920> why<00:00:14.190> that's<00:00:14.400> true

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
let me share with you why that's true

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.090 
let me share with you why that's true
hence<00:00:15.360> petition<00:00:15.750> saw<00:00:15.990> this<00:00:16.170> pattern<00:00:16.619> when

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
hence petition saw this pattern when

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.160 
hence petition saw this pattern when
they<00:00:17.190> multiplied<00:00:17.640> two<00:00:18.029> integers<00:00:18.930> together

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
they multiplied two integers together

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.970 
they multiplied two integers together
two<00:00:20.039> positive<00:00:20.580> numbers<00:00:20.609> from<00:00:21.390> our<00:00:21.600> world

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
two positive numbers from our world

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.380 
two positive numbers from our world
three<00:00:22.980> times<00:00:23.250> two<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.550> equal<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> positive

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
three times two is equal to a positive

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.130 
three times two is equal to a positive
six<00:00:25.099> two<00:00:26.099> times<00:00:26.310> 2<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.820> positive<00:00:27.240> 4<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.779> 1

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
six two times 2 is a positive 4 and 1

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.560 
six two times 2 is a positive 4 and 1
times<00:00:28.410> 2<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> positive<00:00:29.010> 2<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.849> they<00:00:30.060> saw<00:00:30.330> in

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
times 2 is a positive 2 and they saw in

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.299 
times 2 is a positive 2 and they saw in
that<00:00:30.599> pattern<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.140> if<00:00:31.380> they<00:00:31.560> reduce<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
that pattern that if they reduce the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.260 
that pattern that if they reduce the
first<00:00:32.730> factor<00:00:33.360> by<00:00:33.630> one<00:00:34.309> that<00:00:35.309> their<00:00:35.640> answer

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
first factor by one that their answer

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.660 
first factor by one that their answer
decreased<00:00:37.050> by<00:00:37.469> two<00:00:37.680> because<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.520> other

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
decreased by two because the other

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.110 
decreased by two because the other
multiple<00:00:39.300> was<00:00:39.450> Tibble<00:00:39.989> down<00:00:40.980> by<00:00:41.219> two<00:00:41.280> down<00:00:41.850> by

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
multiple was Tibble down by two down by

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.420 
multiple was Tibble down by two down by
two<00:00:42.180> decreases<00:00:42.989> by<00:00:43.140> two<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.190> when<00:00:44.399> I

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
two decreases by two and so when I

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.180 
two decreases by two and so when I
decrease<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.600> first<00:00:45.899> factor<00:00:46.260> again<00:00:46.950> by

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
decrease that first factor again by

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.209 
decrease that first factor again by
another<00:00:47.399> value<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.450> one<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.140> discovered<00:00:50.129> that

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
another value of one I discovered that

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.790 
another value of one I discovered that
my<00:00:50.460> answer<00:00:50.969> should<00:00:51.180> go<00:00:51.329> down<00:00:51.629> by<00:00:51.960> two<00:00:52.020> and

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
my answer should go down by two and

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.010 
my answer should go down by two and
therefore<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.090> pattern<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.570> discovered

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
therefore in that pattern I discovered

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
therefore in that pattern I discovered
that<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.170> negative<00:00:55.620> times<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.039> positive<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
that a negative times a positive is a

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.560 
that a negative times a positive is a
negative<00:00:56.969> answer<00:00:58.129> once<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.309> knew<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.520> I<00:01:00.000> could

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
negative answer once I knew that I could

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.150 
negative answer once I knew that I could
go<00:01:00.719> over<00:01:00.809> here<00:01:01.050> therefore<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.680> say<00:01:01.890> that

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
go over here therefore and say that

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.770 
go over here therefore and say that
since<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.550> know<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.760> positive<00:01:03.390> times<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.750> negative

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
since I know a positive times a negative

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.380 
since I know a positive times a negative
is<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.290> negative<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.670> positive<00:01:05.700> times<00:01:06.299> a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
is a negative and a positive times a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.429 
is a negative and a positive times a
negative<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.930> negative

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
negative is a negative

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.320 
negative is a negative
and<00:01:07.680> again<00:01:08.070> positive<00:01:08.549> times<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.850> negative<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and again positive times a negative is a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.679 
and again positive times a negative is a
negative<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.860> reduce<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.729> initial<00:01:12.479> this

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
negative and I reduce this initial this

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.219 
negative and I reduce this initial this
first<00:01:13.020> factor<00:01:13.229> by<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.950> every<00:01:14.640> time<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.420> see

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
first factor by one every time I see

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.200 
first factor by one every time I see
that<00:01:16.380> my<00:01:16.470> answer<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.890> over<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:17.460> are<00:01:17.610> going<00:01:17.909> up

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that my answer is over here are going up

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.590 
that my answer is over here are going up
by<00:01:18.990> two<00:01:19.049> each<00:01:19.710> time<00:01:19.790> from<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.909> negative<00:01:21.270> six<00:01:21.479> I

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
by two each time from a negative six I

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.649 
by two each time from a negative six I
go<00:01:21.840> up<00:01:22.110> by<00:01:22.350> two<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> negative<00:01:23.520> form<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.150> go<00:01:24.450> up

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
go up by two to a negative form I go up

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.920 
go up by two to a negative form I go up
by<00:01:25.080> two<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.430> go<00:01:26.580> up<00:01:26.820> by<00:01:27.150> two<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.570> zero

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
by two and I go up by two to zero

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.440 
by two and I go up by two to zero
so<00:01:28.080> here<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.619> go<00:01:28.860> up<00:01:29.070> by<00:01:29.460> two<00:01:29.520> when<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.150> in

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
so here I go up by two when I in

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.800 
so here I go up by two when I in
decrease<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.680> factor<00:01:32.250> by<00:01:32.850> one<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.509> I

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
decrease that factor by one and I

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.240 
decrease that factor by one and I
discovered<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> negative<00:01:34.829> times<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.220> negative

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
discovered the negative times a negative

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.310 
discovered the negative times a negative
would<00:01:35.880> therefore<00:01:36.210> indeed<00:01:36.780> be<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> positive

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
would therefore indeed be a positive

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.740 
would therefore indeed be a positive
because<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.220> pattern<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:39.270> let's<00:01:39.479> just

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
because of this pattern so let's just

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.100 
because of this pattern so let's just
write<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.650> summary<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.460> practice<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.390> few

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
write in summary and practice a few

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.460 
write in summary and practice a few
problems<00:01:43.380> including<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.340> fraction<00:01:44.790> or<00:01:44.909> two

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
problems including a fraction or two

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.240 
problems including a fraction or two
that<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:46.740> now<00:01:46.979> know<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.939> negative<00:01:48.540> number

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
that we now know that a negative number

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.510 
that we now know that a negative number
times<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.579> negative<00:01:50.610> number<00:01:52.100> gives<00:01:53.100> us<00:01:53.340> a

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
times a negative number gives us a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.719 
times a negative number gives us a
positive<00:01:54.259> results<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.409> then<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.250> negative

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
positive results and then the negative

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.770 
positive results and then the negative
number<00:01:57.259> times<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.500> positive<00:01:58.530> number

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
number times a positive number

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.370 
number times a positive number
gives<00:02:00.650> us<00:02:00.950> a<00:02:01.220> negative<00:02:01.880> result<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.510> therefore

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
gives us a negative result and therefore

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.330 
gives us a negative result and therefore
for<00:02:04.040> example<00:02:04.160> a<00:02:04.930> negative<00:02:05.930> three<00:02:06.320> times<00:02:07.160> the

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
for example a negative three times the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.850 
for example a negative three times the
positive<00:02:07.580> five<00:02:08.149> again<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:08.960> negative<00:02:09.229> times<00:02:09.740> a

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
positive five again a negative times a

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.590 
positive five again a negative times a
positive<00:02:09.970> would<00:02:10.970> give<00:02:11.180> me<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.390> negative<00:02:11.860> 15

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
positive would give me a negative 15

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.720 
positive would give me a negative 15
eight<00:02:14.710> times<00:02:15.710> a<00:02:16.100> negative<00:02:17.060> four<00:02:17.800> a<00:02:18.800> positive

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
eight times a negative four a positive

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.580 
eight times a negative four a positive
times<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.090> negative<00:02:20.120> gives<00:02:20.990> me<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.230> negative

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
times a negative gives me a negative

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.620 
times a negative gives me a negative
result<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.490> eight<00:02:22.730> times<00:02:23.000> four<00:02:23.300> is

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
result and eight times four is

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.740 
result and eight times four is
thirty-two<00:02:25.209> let's<00:02:26.209> take<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.420> look<00:02:26.600> at<00:02:26.720> a

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
thirty-two let's take a look at a

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.770 
thirty-two let's take a look at a
fraction<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.470> negative<00:02:28.570> 8/3<00:02:29.570> times<00:02:30.760> 9<00:02:31.760> over<00:02:32.450> 4

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
fraction a negative 8/3 times 9 over 4

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.770 
fraction a negative 8/3 times 9 over 4
is<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.950> negative<00:02:34.580> times<00:02:34.850> a<00:02:35.000> positive<00:02:35.030> so<00:02:35.750> that

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
is a negative times a positive so that

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.949 
is a negative times a positive so that
will<00:02:36.050> give<00:02:36.230> me<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.410> negative<00:02:36.650> results<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:38.420> I

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
will give me a negative results and I

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.470 
will give me a negative results and I
would<00:02:39.800> go<00:02:39.950> ahead<00:02:40.100> and<00:02:40.250> notice<00:02:40.730> instead<00:02:41.360> of

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
would go ahead and notice instead of

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.270 
would go ahead and notice instead of
calling<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:42.050> in<00:02:42.320> the<00:02:42.560> numerator<00:02:42.739> on

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
calling this in the numerator on

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.229 
calling this in the numerator on
negative<00:02:44.060> 72<00:02:44.959> over<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.560> positive<00:02:46.100> 12<00:02:46.790> which<00:02:47.030> I

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
negative 72 over a positive 12 which I

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.900 
negative 72 over a positive 12 which I
could<00:02:47.540> do<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:48.020> then<00:02:48.470> reduce<00:02:48.830> I<00:02:49.070> would<00:02:49.670> like<00:02:49.790> to

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
could do and then reduce I would like to

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.750 
could do and then reduce I would like to
choose<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.660> notice<00:02:51.440> that<00:02:51.590> 3<00:02:51.830> goes<00:02:51.860> into<00:02:52.190> 3<00:02:52.280> once

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
choose to notice that 3 goes into 3 once

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.310 
choose to notice that 3 goes into 3 once
and<00:02:53.120> 3<00:02:53.900> goes<00:02:54.080> into<00:02:54.290> 9<00:02:54.380> 3<00:02:55.310> times<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:56.110> 4<00:02:57.110> goes

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
and 3 goes into 9 3 times and 4 goes

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.040 
and 3 goes into 9 3 times and 4 goes
into<00:02:57.470> 4<00:02:57.620> once<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.489> four<00:02:58.940> goes<00:02:59.150> into<00:02:59.420> 8<00:02:59.660> twice

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
into 4 once and four goes into 8 twice

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.840 
into 4 once and four goes into 8 twice
I'll<00:03:00.530> put<00:03:00.770> that<00:03:00.890> sign<00:03:01.190> up<00:03:01.220> there<00:03:01.520> so<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:01.700> don't

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
I'll put that sign up there so I don't

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.910 
I'll put that sign up there so I don't
forget<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.840> see<00:03:03.050> that<00:03:03.170> my<00:03:03.230> final<00:03:03.650> answer

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
forget it and I see that my final answer

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.949 
forget it and I see that my final answer
for<00:03:04.040> this<00:03:04.160> problem<00:03:04.250> is<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.700> negative<00:03:05.209> 2<00:03:05.450> times<00:03:05.840> a

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
for this problem is a negative 2 times a

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.979 
for this problem is a negative 2 times a
positive<00:03:06.410> 3<00:03:06.650> or<00:03:06.860> a<00:03:06.950> negative<00:03:07.790> 6<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.480> the

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
positive 3 or a negative 6 and the

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.560 
positive 3 or a negative 6 and the
denominator<00:03:09.470> 1<00:03:09.680> times<00:03:09.950> 1<00:03:10.190> is<00:03:10.340> 1<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:11.180> I<00:03:11.209> would<00:03:11.450> be

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
denominator 1 times 1 is 1 so I would be

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.030 
denominator 1 times 1 is 1 so I would be
able<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.840> just<00:03:12.080> write<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.470> answer<00:03:12.830> as<00:03:12.860> a

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
able to just write the answer as a

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.470 
able to just write the answer as a
negative<00:03:13.610> 6<00:03:14.680> let's<00:03:15.680> look<00:03:15.920> at<00:03:16.160> a<00:03:16.370> few<00:03:17.000> problems

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
negative 6 let's look at a few problems

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.800 
negative 6 let's look at a few problems
that<00:03:17.570> involve<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:19.760> negative<00:03:20.420> times<00:03:20.660> a<00:03:20.780> negative

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
that involve a negative times a negative

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.580 
that involve a negative times a negative
so<00:03:21.470> let's<00:03:21.980> go<00:03:22.220> with<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.549> negative<00:03:23.150> 8<00:03:23.390> times<00:03:24.290> a

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
so let's go with a negative 8 times a

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.590 
so let's go with a negative 8 times a
negative<00:03:25.070> 2<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.640> might<00:03:25.790> see<00:03:26.060> it<00:03:26.150> written<00:03:26.209> like

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
negative 2 you might see it written like

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.590 
negative 2 you might see it written like
that<00:03:26.660> a<00:03:27.700> negative<00:03:28.700> times<00:03:28.970> a<00:03:29.060> negative<00:03:29.090> is<00:03:29.570> just

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
that a negative times a negative is just

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.130 
that a negative times a negative is just
a<00:03:29.900> positive<00:03:30.140> value<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:30.769> 8<00:03:31.040> times<00:03:31.370> 2<00:03:31.640> is<00:03:31.670> 16<00:03:32.140> you

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
a positive value and 8 times 2 is 16 you

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.720 
a positive value and 8 times 2 is 16 you
might<00:03:33.320> see<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.620> very<00:03:33.860> same<00:03:34.100> problem<00:03:34.310> written

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
might see the very same problem written

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.900 
might see the very same problem written
like<00:03:35.030> this<00:03:35.329> a<00:03:35.570> negative<00:03:36.110> 8<00:03:36.470> times<00:03:37.340> a<00:03:37.489> negative

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
like this a negative 8 times a negative

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.600 
like this a negative 8 times a negative
2<00:03:38.150> is<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.930> positive<00:03:38.959> 16<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.950> just<00:03:40.130> look<00:03:40.250> for

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
2 is a positive 16 to just look for

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.810 
2 is a positive 16 to just look for
various<00:03:41.060> ways<00:03:41.360> for<00:03:41.390> that<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.900> be<00:03:42.019> written<00:03:42.350> a

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
various ways for that to be written a

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.780 
various ways for that to be written a
negative<00:03:43.820> 12<00:03:44.180> times<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:45.019> negative<00:03:45.650> 10<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.670> a

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
negative 12 times a negative 10 and a

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.500 
negative 12 times a negative 10 and a
negative

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
negative

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.750 
negative
the<00:03:47.659> negative<00:03:47.989> of<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.170> positive<00:03:48.739> and<00:03:49.010> 12

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
the negative of the positive and 12

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.809 
the negative of the positive and 12
times<00:03:50.000> 10<00:03:50.330> is<00:03:50.510> 120<00:03:50.959> and<00:03:51.590> then<00:03:52.159> funny<00:03:52.430> would<00:03:52.700> you

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
times 10 is 120 and then funny would you

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.869 
times 10 is 120 and then funny would you
just<00:03:53.060> notice<00:03:53.480> that<00:03:54.110> if<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.319> multiply<00:03:54.879> several

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
just notice that if you multiply several

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.940 
just notice that if you multiply several
values<00:03:56.269> together<00:03:56.720> it<00:03:57.079> one<00:03:57.379> so<00:03:57.680> I'd<00:03:57.769> like<00:03:57.890> you

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
values together it one so I'd like you

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.009 
values together it one so I'd like you
to<00:03:58.129> notice<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.579> signs<00:03:58.879> that<00:03:59.209> result<00:04:02.019> let's

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
to notice the signs that result let's

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.199 
to notice the signs that result let's
multiply<00:04:03.260> those<00:04:03.709> together<00:04:04.069> and<00:04:04.790> let's<00:04:05.030> work

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
multiply those together and let's work

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.680 
multiply those together and let's work
from<00:04:05.450> left<00:04:05.599> to<00:04:05.780> right<00:04:06.049> so<00:04:06.950> a<00:04:07.190> negative<00:04:07.610> times<00:04:07.879> a

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
from left to right so a negative times a

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.470 
from left to right so a negative times a
negative<00:04:08.720> is<00:04:09.319> a<00:04:09.409> positive<00:04:09.730> 15<00:04:12.609> and<00:04:13.609> then<00:04:14.180> again

sorry<00:04:27.590> about<00:04:27.800> that<00:04:28.160> would<00:04:29.060> you<00:04:29.240> please<00:04:29.570> notice

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
sorry about that would you please notice

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.580 
sorry about that would you please notice
that<00:04:30.110> you<00:04:30.410> have<00:04:30.650> one<00:04:31.039> two<00:04:31.520> three<00:04:31.880> four

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
that you have one two three four

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.680 
that you have one two three four
negative<00:04:33.590> signs<00:04:33.860> in<00:04:34.070> that<00:04:34.250> problem<00:04:34.760> from<00:04:35.479> now

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
negative signs in that problem from now

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.779 
negative signs in that problem from now
on<00:04:35.900> I'm<00:04:36.289> going<00:04:36.740> to<00:04:36.830> say<00:04:37.100> that<00:04:37.310> if<00:04:37.400> you<00:04:37.550> have<00:04:37.669> an

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
on I'm going to say that if you have an

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:42.879 
on I'm going to say that if you have an
even<00:04:38.560> number<00:04:39.560> of<00:04:40.419> negative<00:04:41.419> signs<00:04:41.889> that

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
even number of negative signs that

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.469 
even number of negative signs that
you're<00:04:43.100> going<00:04:43.280> to<00:04:43.310> get<00:04:43.490> a<00:04:43.699> positive<00:04:45.130> answer

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
you're going to get a positive answer

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.700 
you're going to get a positive answer
for<00:04:47.479> that<00:04:47.510> problem<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:48.169> you<00:04:48.289> wouldn't<00:04:48.560> have

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
for that problem and you wouldn't have

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.740 
for that problem and you wouldn't have
to<00:04:48.860> go<00:04:49.010> through<00:04:49.490> all<00:04:49.729> this<00:04:49.940> work<00:04:50.240> if<00:04:50.510> you<00:04:50.600> just

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
to go through all this work if you just

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.740 
to go through all this work if you just
notice<00:04:51.050> that<00:04:51.080> there's<00:04:51.350> one<00:04:51.590> two<00:04:51.979> three<00:04:52.010> four

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
notice that there's one two three four

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.050 
notice that there's one two three four
negative<00:04:53.750> signs<00:04:54.050> so<00:04:54.349> you<00:04:54.889> can<00:04:55.099> set<00:04:55.310> up<00:04:55.460> an<00:04:55.610> even

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
negative signs so you can set up an even

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.920 
negative signs so you can set up an even
number<00:04:56.360> of<00:04:56.389> negative<00:04:57.080> signs<00:04:58.479> therefore<00:04:59.479> my

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
number of negative signs therefore my

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.719 
number of negative signs therefore my
answer<00:05:00.349> is<00:05:00.470> positive<00:05:00.740> and<00:05:01.280> you<00:05:01.400> could<00:05:01.580> just

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
answer is positive and you could just

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.930 
answer is positive and you could just
say<00:05:01.849> 3<00:05:02.120> times<00:05:02.300> 5<00:05:02.599> is<00:05:02.780> 15<00:05:03.260> times<00:05:03.830> 2<00:05:04.099> is<00:05:04.130> 30<00:05:04.280> times

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
say 3 times 5 is 15 times 2 is 30 times

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.240 
say 3 times 5 is 15 times 2 is 30 times
one<00:05:05.180> is<00:05:05.330> 30<00:05:05.599> and<00:05:05.900> just<00:05:06.320> give<00:05:06.530> your<00:05:06.710> answer<00:05:07.070> of<00:05:07.160> a

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
one is 30 and just give your answer of a

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.080 
one is 30 and just give your answer of a
positive<00:05:07.699> 30

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
positive 30

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.500 
positive 30
in<00:05:08.440> contrast<00:05:09.440> would<00:05:10.250> you<00:05:10.430> notice<00:05:10.669> that<00:05:11.060> if<00:05:11.300> I

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
in contrast would you notice that if I

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.339 
in contrast would you notice that if I
had<00:05:11.840> an<00:05:12.260> odd<00:05:13.160> number<00:05:13.669> of<00:05:13.699> negative<00:05:14.210> signs<00:05:14.479> so<00:05:14.870> a

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
had an odd number of negative signs so a

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:19.960 
had an odd number of negative signs so a
negative<00:05:15.919> 2<00:05:16.220> times<00:05:17.120> a<00:05:17.240> negative<00:05:17.270> 5<00:05:17.870> times<00:05:18.970> a

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
negative 2 times a negative 5 times a

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.409 
negative 2 times a negative 5 times a
negative<00:05:20.690> 7<00:05:21.169> if<00:05:22.130> I<00:05:22.340> work<00:05:22.550> from<00:05:22.760> left<00:05:22.910> to<00:05:23.090> right

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
negative 7 if I work from left to right

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.900 
negative 7 if I work from left to right
a<00:05:23.750> negative<00:05:24.710> times<00:05:25.099> a<00:05:25.220> negative<00:05:25.250> is<00:05:25.820> a

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
a negative times a negative is a

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.100 
a negative times a negative is a
positive<00:05:26.330> 10<00:05:27.220> and<00:05:28.220> then<00:05:28.760> this<00:05:29.300> positive<00:05:29.870> 10

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
positive 10 and then this positive 10

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.100 
positive 10 and then this positive 10
times<00:05:30.470> a<00:05:30.590> negative<00:05:31.039> 7<00:05:31.520> is<00:05:31.729> a<00:05:31.760> negative<00:05:31.880> 70<00:05:32.870> I

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
times a negative 7 is a negative 70 I

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.180 
times a negative 7 is a negative 70 I
can<00:05:33.740> see<00:05:33.949> that<00:05:34.070> if<00:05:34.190> I<00:05:34.310> have<00:05:34.550> 1<00:05:34.849> 2<00:05:35.419> 3<00:05:35.860> if<00:05:36.860> I<00:05:37.070> have

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
can see that if I have 1 2 3 if I have

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:44.980 
can see that if I have 1 2 3 if I have
an<00:05:37.310> odd<00:05:38.710> number<00:05:39.710> of<00:05:40.659> negative<00:05:41.659> signs<00:05:41.990> I<00:05:43.990> will

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
an odd number of negative signs I will

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.119 
an odd number of negative signs I will
get<00:05:45.199> a<00:05:45.380> negative

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:46.129 
get a negative

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:50.739 
get a negative
to<00:05:46.839> the<00:05:47.839> answer<00:05:48.229> and<00:05:48.499> so<00:05:49.239> again<00:05:50.239> let's<00:05:50.419> just<00:05:50.599> go

00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:50.749 
to the answer and so again let's just go

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:53.049 
to the answer and so again let's just go
back<00:05:50.959> and<00:05:51.199> look<00:05:51.319> at<00:05:51.469> the<00:05:51.559> basic<00:05:52.219> just<00:05:52.759> two

00:05:53.049 --> 00:05:53.059 
back and look at the basic just two

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:57.549 
back and look at the basic just two
factors<00:05:53.979> we<00:05:54.979> had<00:05:55.309> a<00:05:55.610> negative<00:05:56.119> two<00:05:56.419> times<00:05:57.379> a

00:05:57.549 --> 00:05:57.559 
factors we had a negative two times a

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:58.719 
factors we had a negative two times a
positive<00:05:57.769> seven

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
positive seven

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.899 
positive seven
that's<00:05:59.659> one<00:06:00.319> negative<00:06:00.979> sign<00:06:01.339> that's<00:06:01.580> an<00:06:01.699> odd

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:01.909 
that's one negative sign that's an odd

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:04.179 
that's one negative sign that's an odd
number<00:06:02.599> of<00:06:02.779> negative<00:06:03.169> signs<00:06:03.349> should<00:06:03.919> give<00:06:04.069> us

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:04.189 
number of negative signs should give us

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:05.439 
number of negative signs should give us
a<00:06:04.309> negative<00:06:04.429> answer<00:06:04.729> we<00:06:05.059> have<00:06:05.209> said<00:06:05.419> a

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.449 
a negative answer we have said a

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.519 
a negative answer we have said a
negative<00:06:05.959> times<00:06:06.169> a<00:06:06.289> positive<00:06:06.319> is<00:06:06.949> a<00:06:07.639> negative

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:08.529 
negative times a positive is a negative

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:12.519 
negative times a positive is a negative

even number of negative signs my answer
is<00:06:17.479> positive<00:06:17.899> we<00:06:18.379> all<00:06:18.589> know<00:06:18.860> that<00:06:19.219> a<00:06:19.249> negative

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
is positive we all know that a negative

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.879 
is positive we all know that a negative
times<00:06:19.909> a<00:06:20.269> negative<00:06:20.300> is<00:06:20.929> a<00:06:21.769> positive

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.109 

good<00:06:24.889> pause<00:06:25.159> and<00:06:25.490> then<00:06:25.580> we're<00:06:25.699> look<00:06:25.879> at<00:06:25.969> the

00:06:26.109 --> 00:06:26.119 
good pause and then we're look at the

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:27.409 
vision and compare it to multiplication

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:31.569 
vision and compare it to multiplication
and<00:06:27.800> see<00:06:28.009> why<00:06:28.189> it<00:06:28.249> follows<00:06:28.789> the<00:06:28.969> same<00:06:29.149> rules
