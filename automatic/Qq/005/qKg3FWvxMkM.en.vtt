00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:42.677
Harvest is a hard working time for farmers.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.580
Unfortunately, part of its effects goes to waste.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.484
Mown straw is usually
assigned for fodder or animal

00:00:50.485 --> 00:00:54.187
Bedding but usually left in
the field in big quantities.

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:59.660
Why not to make the most of it as a cheap and ecological fuel?

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:06.233
Technology of making straw briquettes for both
industrial and home use has been developed by ASKET.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:10.104
Roman Długi, Director General of ASKET Company:
Since 10 years we are involved in renewable energy

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:12.020
And in particular making biomass from agricultural waste.

00:01:12.912 --> 00:01:18.653
We hold a patented technology of briquetting
dump straw which is unique by world standards.

00:01:18.654 --> 00:01:23.383
ASKET machines make briquettes from raw
material of humidity up to 30 percent,

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:26.653
Allowing to omit the drying process.

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:35.729
Briquettes made by Biomasser have a hole providing access
of air to the inside improving the process of combustion.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.634
The heating value is roughly 16
mega joules per 1 kg of briquettes,

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:47.607
Although one should consume 25 percent of briquettes
more, it is cheaper fuel when compared to coal.

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:52.179
The ASKET Company offers a gamut of straw briquetting machines.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:57.684
Biomasser Duo-Set would be the best answer for small farm needs.

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:04.324
A combined set of straw chopper and
briquette maker form a complete

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:08.228
Production line with efficiency up to 140 kg per hour.

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:14.534
But professional producers of gold
coal need even more efficient methods.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:19.439
For those, the company from Poznan
offers the Biomasser Maxi-Multi machine

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.944
With efficiency of up to 1120 kg per hour.

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:29.116
Our best product is BIOMASSER MOBILE.

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:34.421
This is a factory built on a farm trailer,
which can draw up to a haystack

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.923
And produce briquettes directly in the field.

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:44.631
Two persons only can operate the machine,
and its efficiency reaches 840 kg per hour.

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:48.402
Straw briquette is an ecological and cheap fuel.

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:54.241
It can be used in every cauldron, coke
oven or furnace for any solid fuels.

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:58.278
Gas emission during the process of
briquette combustion is negligible

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:01.782
And a balance of circulation of CO2 in
the environment is on a zero level.

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:08.755
After combustion, there is a little ash
left which is perfect as a fertilizer.

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:15.629
Every farmer has a lot of raw material around,
which can be processed as his own fuel.

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.968
Furthermore, excess quantities of
fuel can be sold giving extra income.

00:03:22.462 --> 00:03:27.062
A Biomasser briquetting machine is
practically “a must” on every farm.
