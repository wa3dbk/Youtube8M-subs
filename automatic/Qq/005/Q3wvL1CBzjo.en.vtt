but anyway so this is pretty Stahli and
um<00:05:59.600> i<00:05:59.900> guess<00:06:00.050> i<00:06:00.590> will<00:06:00.940> just<00:06:02.020> say<00:06:03.020> that<00:06:03.350> that

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
um i guess i will just say that that

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.380 
um i guess i will just say that that
