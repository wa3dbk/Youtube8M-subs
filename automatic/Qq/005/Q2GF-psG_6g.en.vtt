can<00:03:52.190> just<00:03:52.400> look<00:03:52.700> at<00:03:52.880> him<00:03:53.120> and<00:03:53.330> see<00:03:53.720> that<00:03:53.900> he's

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
can just look at him and see that he's

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.890 
can just look at him and see that he's
worn<00:03:54.410> down<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:54.740> he's<00:03:55.130> fatigued<00:03:55.610> and<00:03:55.850> I<00:03:56.390> mean

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
worn down and he's fatigued and I mean

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.420 
worn down and he's fatigued and I mean
I'll<00:03:57.020> show<00:03:57.290> that<00:03:57.320> it's<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.680> complete<00:03:58.040> answer

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
I'll show that it's the complete answer

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.820 
I'll show that it's the complete answer
to<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:58.940> equation<00:03:59.060> Teddy<00:03:59.780> but<00:04:00.320> you've<00:04:00.560> got<00:04:00.800> to

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
to the equation Teddy but you've got to

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.890 
to the equation Teddy but you've got to
think<00:04:01.130> that<00:04:01.310> all<00:04:01.370> those<00:04:01.640> body<00:04:01.940> shots<00:04:02.090> add<00:04:02.600> up

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
think that all those body shots add up

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.600 
think that all those body shots add up
to<00:04:03.230> make<00:04:03.350> it<00:04:03.530> that<00:04:03.680> way<00:04:03.830> yeah<00:04:04.070> now<00:04:04.310> I<00:04:04.400> add

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
to make it that way yeah now I add

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.280 
to make it that way yeah now I add
something<00:04:04.910> into<00:04:05.210> a<00:04:05.240> defensible<00:04:05.810> part<00:04:06.170> you

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
something into a defensible part you

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.440 
something into a defensible part you
just<00:04:06.320> touched<00:04:06.890> on<00:04:07.100> it<00:04:07.220> very<00:04:07.460> well<00:04:07.730> that<00:04:08.030> it's

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
just touched on it very well that it's

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.610 
just touched on it very well that it's
breaking<00:04:08.810> up<00:04:08.870> town<00:04:09.050> but<00:04:09.230> it's<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:09.440> mental

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
breaking up town but it's the mental

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.490 
breaking up town but it's the mental
part<00:04:09.830> they<00:04:10.280> start<00:04:10.670> to<00:04:10.820> discourage<00:04:11.720> you<00:04:11.930> they

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
part they start to discourage you they

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.470 
part they start to discourage you they
take<00:04:12.770> you<00:04:12.920> will<00:04:13.220> away<00:04:13.580> a<00:04:13.610> little<00:04:13.880> bit<00:04:14.000> and

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
take you will away a little bit and

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.019 
take you will away a little bit and
we're<00:04:14.720> seeing<00:04:14.990> that<00:04:16.359> anglers<00:04:17.359> got<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:17.840> feel
