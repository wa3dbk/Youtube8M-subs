00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.309
 director of the spring of the arts of 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.080
 monte carlo marc monnet had the very 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.450
 nice idea one more to propose to the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.580
 public a night of the congo by inviting a 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.440
 surprising orchestra orchestrated 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.050
 kimbanguist symphony of kinshasa 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.630
 composed of amateur musicians and directed 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.550
 by armand diangienda line driver 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.199
 armand diangienda left office 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.119
 because a plane he had to take 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.140
 orders crashed in the middle of 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.820
 the equatorial forest 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.410
 this furious accident like a 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.390
 revelation already musicians 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.280
 passionate instrumentalists he undertook 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.840
 a conductor training for 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.149
 take the lead of the orchestra 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.829
 symphonic kimbanguists and this in 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.120
 a poor neighborhood of one of the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.950
 the poorest cities in the world 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.010
 kinshasa it was my father who had me 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.410
 asked to open the doors to all those 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.280
 who wanted to share them 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.289
 this musical passion and it takes 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.820
 recognize that people are they 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.969
 came to my side he was first 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.820
 passionate about music and together 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.840
 with them we started dancing and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.820
 work first 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.500
 very exciting because we were 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.140
 really the discovery it was really 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.859
 an adventure to which all musicians 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.750
 really got hooked to get 

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:19.789
 today in Monaco so it's really 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.100
 a collective commitment it's really 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:24.740
 a desire for collective work is 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.179
 this desire to want to bring something 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.329
 new thing to want to do 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:31.189
 something that would not be a job 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.020
 individual but a collective work 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.209
 the musicians of the symphony orchestra 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.890
 kimbanguiste all amateurs and 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:38.840
 self-taught professions 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.179
 as diverse as flower sellers 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.679
 taxi carpenter painter building or 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.479
 coachbuilder which is very useful 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.880
 when it comes to replacing the strings 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.799
 of a violin by dufy fishing repair a 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.379
 trombone a trumpet from 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.579
 the hubcap a car touched by 

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:54.439
 this musical and human adventure 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.459
 extraordinary musicians of 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.619
 the philharmonic orchestra of 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.459
 carlo monte spontaneously came the 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.679
 support 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.500
 replace one or two failed desks 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.539
 and provide that market piccolo 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.969
 and even a violin I had the opportunity 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.889
 just now give them a 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.769
 instrument violin I offer them 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:14.690
 violin archers the tiles the complete kit 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.600
 if I can say who will allow 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.100
 possibly one of theirs is 2 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.840
 to change and play on this 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.450
 instrument I know they have little 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.610
 supplies at the instrument level and 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.130
 even the violin decorations of the grounds 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.640
 so I think that's going to be okay 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.470
 help them 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.730
 maybe a new calling who knows 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.910
 so that was a 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.080
 instrument that I had at home that I 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.430
 had not been playing for some time 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.650
 and I said the other day like 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.840
 but of course we have to offer it to 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.459
 those who really need it and who 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.459
 wait after instruments 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.500
 the kimbanguist symphonic orchestra 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.760
 brings together faithful musicians of the church 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.670
 kimbanguiste a religious current 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.800
 prophetic of Protestant obedience 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.820
 third religion of the congo we say 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.410
 in our church even let's say sing 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.120
 it's praying twice when I saw 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.770
 I was offered the date of April 6 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.840
 which is a pretty important date for 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.210
 we humanists by stop these days 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.100
 there that the prophet is me who marks 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.110
 as in season but his ministry I 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.360
 am told the date of April 6th 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.290
 but it's a very important date so 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.880
 I can not refuse 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.220
 and that's how I said to all 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.140
 notice we have to hang ourselves 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.380
 will work 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.850
 not necessarily to show that 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.860
 we are the great musicians it is 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:46.180
 to go share our love for 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.830
 this passion we have for music 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.770
 it is pleasant it is without it that we are 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.660
 come in really to bring the 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.590
 message of love a message of peace a 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.590
 sharing message 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.630

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.800

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.380

 offered them a concert harp a 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.070
 valuable instrument that obviously he does not 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.450
 not own by promising them their 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.400
