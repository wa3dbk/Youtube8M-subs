00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
putting your hair in a high ponytail so

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.719

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
neck but anyway I got these shorts from

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.399 
neck but anyway I got these shorts from
Hollister<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.420> especially<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:13.140> these

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
Hollister and I especially like these

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.590 
Hollister and I especially like these
shorts<00:01:13.950> with<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.490> top<00:01:14.790> because<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.390> has<00:01:15.570> a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
shorts with this top because it has a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.800 
shorts with this top because it has a
travel<00:01:16.229> print<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.799> which<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.640> think

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
travel print on it which I think

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
travel print on it which I think
complements<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.960> design<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> crochet

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
complements the design on the crochet

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.010 
complements the design on the crochet
top<00:01:20.130> same<00:01:20.850> thing<00:01:21.060> goes<00:01:21.270> with<00:01:21.479> these<00:01:21.659> shorts

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
top same thing goes with these shorts

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.990 
top same thing goes with these shorts
now<00:01:22.530> there's<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.770> lot<00:01:23.009> more<00:01:23.220> going<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.820> these

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
now there's a lot more going on in these

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.179 
now there's a lot more going on in these
shorts<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.750> more<00:01:24.960> psychedelic<00:01:25.560> design

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
shorts it's a more psychedelic design

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.100 
shorts it's a more psychedelic design
and<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.640> top<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.390> has<00:01:27.540> lace<00:01:27.869> at<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
and on top of that it has lace at the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.469 
and on top of that it has lace at the
bottom<00:01:28.229> however<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.430> think<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.210> everything

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
bottom however I think that everything

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.740 
bottom however I think that everything
goes<00:01:30.780> together<00:01:31.110> quite<00:01:31.409> nicely<00:01:31.909> also<00:01:32.909> these
