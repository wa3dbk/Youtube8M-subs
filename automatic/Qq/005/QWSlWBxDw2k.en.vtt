00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
collection and it came out a couple of

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.760 
collection and it came out a couple of
years<00:00:42.210> ago<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.600> think<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.350> I've<00:00:43.440> kind<00:00:43.710> of

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
years ago I think and I've kind of

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.959 
years ago I think and I've kind of
always<00:00:43.920> been<00:00:44.129> really<00:00:44.250> interested<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.820> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
always been really interested in it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.139 
always been really interested in it
because<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.239> don't<00:00:45.450> think<00:00:45.660> matt<00:00:45.870> has<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.260> many

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
because I don't think matt has that many

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.299 
because I don't think matt has that many
really<00:00:48.149> good<00:00:48.300> crease<00:00:48.690> brushes<00:00:49.170> where<00:00:49.440> this

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
really good crease brushes where this

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.580 
really good crease brushes where this
one's<00:00:50.579> kind<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.000> really<00:00:51.300> nice<00:00:51.600> tapered

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
one's kind of a really nice tapered

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.680 
one's kind of a really nice tapered
blending<00:00:52.710> brush<00:00:52.949> which<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.760> really<00:00:54.120> nicely

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
blending brush which is really nicely

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.619 
blending brush which is really nicely
into<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.199> crease<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.120> lot<00:00:57.449> smaller

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
into the crease and it's a lot smaller

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.080 
into the crease and it's a lot smaller
than<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> 224<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.010> 224<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.640> lot<00:00:59.850> fluffier

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
than the 224 the 224 is a lot fluffier

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.150 
than the 224 the 224 is a lot fluffier
and<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:01.020> doesn't<00:01:01.289> have<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> kind<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.739> tapered

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
and it doesn't have the kind of tapered

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.920 
and it doesn't have the kind of tapered
end<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:03.120> wasn't<00:01:03.239> really<00:01:03.420> interested<00:01:03.690> in

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
end and I wasn't really interested in

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.390 
end and I wasn't really interested in
anything<00:01:04.229> else<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> collection<00:01:05.100> because

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
anything else of the collection because

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.490 
anything else of the collection because
I<00:01:05.580> have<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.600> kind<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.080> good<00:01:07.320> size

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
I have I do have like kind of good size

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.590 
I have I do have like kind of good size
and<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.740> don't<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.130> pick<00:01:08.189> up<00:01:08.490> things<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.360> to
