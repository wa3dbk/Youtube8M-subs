00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
for them is even more important so when

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.109

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.580 
sure that we take a time to cut out any
of<00:01:44.910> the<00:01:45.030> dead<00:01:45.300> branches<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.990> may<00:01:46.140> be<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
of the dead branches that may be on the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.680 
of the dead branches that may be on the
inside<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.370> next<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.270> want<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.510> make<00:01:48.660> sure

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
inside and next we want to make sure

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.990 
inside and next we want to make sure
that<00:01:49.050> we<00:01:49.140> look<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.410> the<00:01:49.500> future<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:50.160> how<00:01:50.940> we

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
that we look to the future of how we

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.910 
that we look to the future of how we
keep<00:01:51.360> these<00:01:51.600> shrubs<00:01:51.870> under<00:01:52.260> control<00:01:52.590> beside

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
keep these shrubs under control beside

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.620 
keep these shrubs under control beside
this<00:01:53.130> pathway<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.940> that's<00:01:54.330> going<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.510> be

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
this pathway and that's going to be

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.510 
this pathway and that's going to be
talking<00:01:54.810> about<00:01:55.020> inward<00:01:55.650> facing<00:01:55.860> buds<00:01:56.340> and

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
talking about inward facing buds and

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.210 
talking about inward facing buds and
outward<00:01:57.270> facing<00:01:57.510> buds<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.230> how<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> control

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
outward facing buds and how to control

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.120 
outward facing buds and how to control
the<00:01:59.460> shape<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.910> your<00:01:59.940> shrub<00:02:00.330> going<00:02:00.690> forward

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
the shape of your shrub going forward

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.920 
the shape of your shrub going forward
now<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.430> an<00:02:02.580> inward<00:02:03.000> facing<00:02:03.210> bud<00:02:03.720> I<00:02:03.750> know

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
now this is an inward facing bud I know

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.600 
now this is an inward facing bud I know
this<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.470> going<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.740> grow<00:02:04.860> more<00:02:05.070> upward

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
this is going to grow more upward

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.210 
this is going to grow more upward
helping<00:02:06.090> us<00:02:06.210> control<00:02:06.660> which<00:02:07.410> way<00:02:07.619> our<00:02:07.770> plan<00:02:08.010> is

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
helping us control which way our plan is

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.830 
helping us control which way our plan is
growing<00:02:08.670> it's<00:02:08.820> going<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.060> give<00:02:09.149> us<00:02:09.270> density

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
growing it's going to give us density

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.050 
growing it's going to give us density
and<00:02:09.929> height<00:02:10.140> upwards<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.640> an<00:02:11.790> outward

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
and height upwards this is an outward

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.210 
and height upwards this is an outward
but<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.510> we<00:02:12.780> would<00:02:12.959> not<00:02:13.140> want<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.440> cut<00:02:13.650> above<00:02:13.950> it

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
but I we would not want to cut above it

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.980 
but I we would not want to cut above it
because<00:02:14.640> it's<00:02:14.820> going<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.000> shoot<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.360> next

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
because it's going to shoot the next

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.410 
because it's going to shoot the next
cane<00:02:16.320> right<00:02:16.560> out<00:02:16.709> into<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.160> pathway<00:02:17.700> now<00:02:18.270> this

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
cane right out into the pathway now this

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.280 
cane right out into the pathway now this
lateral<00:02:19.050> but<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:19.740> can<00:02:20.459> help<00:02:20.640> fill<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.000> holes<00:02:21.660> or

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
lateral but I can help fill in holes or

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.380 
lateral but I can help fill in holes or
areas<00:02:22.740> that<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:23.010> want<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.310> thicken<00:02:23.550> up<00:02:23.880> so

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
areas that you want to thicken up so

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.330 
areas that you want to thicken up so
when<00:02:24.540> you're<00:02:24.660> pruning<00:02:24.900> your<00:02:25.050> roses<00:02:25.650> make<00:02:26.130> sure

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
when you're pruning your roses make sure

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.920 
when you're pruning your roses make sure
that<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:26.700> take<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.910> little<00:02:27.090> bit<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.360> time<00:02:27.660> to

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
that you take a little bit of time to

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.570 
that you take a little bit of time to
see<00:02:28.170> which<00:02:28.320> way<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.680> next<00:02:28.920> gains<00:02:29.220> going<00:02:29.520> to

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
see which way the next gains going to

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.280 
see which way the next gains going to
grow<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.270> will<00:02:30.360> give<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.660> great<00:02:30.959> shape

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
grow and it will give you a great shape

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.680 
grow and it will give you a great shape
for<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.590> future<00:02:31.970> now<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.240> understand

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
for the future now that you understand

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.990 
for the future now that you understand
how<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.870> properly<00:02:34.350> prune<00:02:34.800> your<00:02:34.950> roses<00:02:35.610> you

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
how to properly prune your roses you

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.160 
how to properly prune your roses you
might<00:02:36.180> want<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.390> take<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.570> little<00:02:36.750> bit<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:36.959> time

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
might want to take a little bit of time

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.900 
might want to take a little bit of time
and<00:02:37.410> clean<00:02:37.650> those<00:02:37.860> beds<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.400> don't<00:02:38.550> get<00:02:38.700> ready

for spring as we can see these knockouts

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.759 
for spring as we can see these knockouts
really<00:02:42.000> drop<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.269> lot<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.720> debris<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.500> pine
