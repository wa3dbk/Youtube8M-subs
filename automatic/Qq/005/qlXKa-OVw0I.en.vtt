 insufficient amounts of the fiber 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.330
 amount of ideal for a good 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.299
 nutrition is between 25 and 35 grams at 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.979
 day an average American citizen 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.720
 consumes only 15 grams of fiber 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.820
 newspapers 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.710
 fiber is very beneficial for 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.440
 health and collaborates with the regularization 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.880

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.440
 the level of sugar in the blood and 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.070
 collaborates with the operation of 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.900
 property of the digestive system 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.060
 to increase fiber consumption in your 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.880
 diet incorporates a portion daily 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.620
 of beans or nuts in your meals the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.479
 protein that these elements possess 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.130
 will help control appetite and 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.280
 fiber physically collaborates with the 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.619
 Digestive process 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.659
 You can include half a cup of beans in 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.310
 each of your meals and between meals 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.190
 you can choose a handful of fruits 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.130
 dried 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.720
 whole grains avoid the consumption of 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.940
 bread and products made with flour 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.820
 refined white replaced the by 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.930

 regularize your sugar level in the 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.350
 blood 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.600
 On the other hand your body should work 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.430
 harder and for more time to digest 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.610
 whole grains and convert them 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.230
 in energy, high whole grains 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.530
 in fibers provide a feeling of fullness 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.670
 for a longer period of time 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.030
 avoiding in this way that you fall in the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.140
 temptation to snack between meals 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.150
 start your day with a portion of 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.220

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.980
 fiber can be a portion of oatmeal 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.830
 whole grain mixed with seeds 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.560
 linen to add extra fiber 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.180
 the fruits and vegetables the fruits and 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.400
 vegetables are healthy foods 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.470

 large amount of nutrients but that 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.540
 provide significant amounts of fiber 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.310
 and water 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.010
 the advisable thing is to consume daily 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.769
 from 2 to 4 servings of fruit of three to 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.659
 five servings of vegetables for another 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.030
 side diets rich in fruits and 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.280
 vegetables help prevent diseases 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.370

 if you are worried about consuming too much 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.920
 fructose natural fruit sugar 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.010
 choose fruits like the glycemic contribution 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.380
 things like apples cherries berries 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.350
 damask and grapefruit

 the dairy the dairy is a good 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.710
 calcium source vitamin d 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.570
 unfortunately these foods 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.960
 they contain a lot of fat and 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.340
 lactose milk sugar you can 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.920
 decrease the amount of fats that 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.140
 contribute dairy products by consuming 2% of 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.270
 cheese and 1% milk 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.280
 other delicious options for these 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.060
 products are yogurts and low cheeses 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.790
 in fat 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.860
 if you are lactose intolerant or you should 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.750
 or want to consume less amount of 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.860
 Lactose-rich products you can 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.650
 replace them with products 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.570
 these foods contain 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.760
 the same amount of calcium and vitamins 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.980
 than regular dairy with the 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.830
 difference from that of having less 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.420
 sugar concentration then 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.510
 we will see the carbohydrates that you should 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.760
 avoid sugar what's wrong with the 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.310
 sugar the sulfur contains calories 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.190
 empty however it is not so 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.570
 harmful if consumed in moderation 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.430
 most of the current diets 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.620
 consider that sugar should be consumed 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.720
 in moderation many foods 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.290
 processed supports a high content of 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.210

 even foods that do not have a 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.950
 particularly sweet flavor contain 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.980
 sugar since it is used for 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.050
 enhance the flavor of these foods the 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.400
 Sugar is also used to enhance 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.020
 the taste of low products in 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.090

 to diet they do not manage to stabilize their level 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.800

 Ideally, avoid sugar reserve the 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.110
 consumption of sweets 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.660
 for special occasions and control the 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.920
 portion sizes do not trust 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.140
 do not trust the sweeteners 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.700

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.300
 food cravings rich in carbohydrates 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:13.570

 sugar is usually present in 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.360
 packaged products with names like 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:24.870
 high fructose alcohol corn syrup 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:27.600
 of sugar his car destroys and lactose 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.400
