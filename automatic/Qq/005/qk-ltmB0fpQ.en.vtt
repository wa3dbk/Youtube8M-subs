 its fast taken on y tube 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.160
 over the year, more than 100 tried to channel him 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.900
 thousands of people 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.260
 Meet maxim well in those on 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.260
 blogger 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.470
 how did the show start 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.759
 probably 1 what we shot this video 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.700
 called and the field 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.220
 it was basically so funny 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.650
 the parody of steve jobs was not very 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.970
 few years it was on about 5 years ago and we all 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.620
 equal in years lie on youtube on habr u 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.500
 Naturally became strongly zaminusovali 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.970
 when I was in grade 11 there is such 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.160
 site iphones.ru site 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.440
 and they held a competition and recruited 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.960
 I wrote the authors as it passed the competition 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.420
 the nose said what my name is sir 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.979
 i live in germany i am 25 years old and i am so 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.239
 sorry to write articles in Japanese well 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.580
 naturally there after some time 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.729
 kicked out because it didn't fit 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.320
 quality requirements I settled on 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.659
 apple insider and that's when 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.760
 they launched their audio podcast i 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.520
 thought it would be cool to make a video 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.360
 podcasts and here somehow with a bunch of 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.650
 pilot clips we together with my friend 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.210
 one of the Mukhin co-founder of the project 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.549
 sockets then he deals just 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.250
 video filming we started to keep 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.810
 such a show but also how to do it 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.990
 pilot clips did n't let them go anywhere 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.970
 just trained here then after 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.110
 I sent another pilot 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.110
 him 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.950
 his new ship's day and he's cool 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.080
 let's creed work on karamba all 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.460
 hi with you alexander ivy and rosettes 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.900
 show what alexander ivyushev 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.660
 the usual days of ty on filming is late 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.130
 which was 10 issues enough on 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.750
 successful there were us releases were 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.120
 800,000 views 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.050
 then half a year I sat at home nothing 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:59.230
 making absolutely crazy calling dino 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.240
 Guilder need to do something urgent 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.710
 crystals quotes and how 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.810
 propose a project in summer 2011 and started 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.940
 little by little raise the bar for quality 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.550
 do exactly the format that i'm 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.850
 Now in the channel is your main job 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.590
 at the moment the channel on is one of 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.030
 two main works still have a project 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.980
 which is called whom to way more 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.660
 through our viewers not to know what it is but 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.600
 if you watch the videos to the end 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.790
 sockets any review there will be at the end 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.990
 indicated that the production studio a lot here 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.060
 our second job 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.700
 we shoot more and advertising but in general 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.970
 how to find the main project for the 5 box 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.860
 your project for the project about united here we are 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.930
 how would we work on it with true night 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.490
 can you give your prediction and further 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.940
 motorola judges under the auspices of 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.980
 lenovo 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.470
 I think everything will be about the same 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.390
 level 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.390
 we at least for the next 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.600
 three years now lenovo 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.970
 probably there will be more knowledge in the field 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.130
 sales of smartphones they are not fools to 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.200
 change the brand because they see what 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.730
 people like it they see what 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.860
 people like naked android on 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.420
 scooter all these chips in turn 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.850
 and therefore to turn on the camera or 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.260
 active display when you're on old nokia 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.450
 see notifications on the screen or there 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.980
 activation voice like this people i 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.960
 I do not think that Lenovo will be from this 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.090
 refuse to where you're from some 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.890
 university I graduated from 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.510
 vladimir to be more precise vladimir 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.730
 area city Sudogda studied at school 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.820
 after grade 9 moved to live in Vladimir 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.090
 master this face and number one entered 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.470
 vladimir state 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.780
 Humanities University 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.990
 I studied there a Russian language teacher and 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.350
 literature 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.910
 i didn't finish it threw moved to 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.130
 Moscow because there is no all tired of it 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.970
 I had to do something in the city because 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.950
 that she wanted to do something moved 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.210
 in moscow again with smoke he was 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.890
 English teacher I was 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.270
 we are Russian teacher at the same time 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.130
 all abandoned and 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:54.990
 moved Moscow live we arrived in 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.670
 forest cult from journalism often we still 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.250
 we continue studying at the correspondence department 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.350
 Well, that's how much we have left two or 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.330
 half years and what do you think of the Hindus 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:08.400
 he is a rather weak system 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:12.450
 she certainly has already won a good 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.520
 market share here but it is in no 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.860
 The comparison does not go any advice from android and 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.390
 until microsoft changes its mind 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.090
 whole operating system with these 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.260
 I don’t think she’s like somewhere 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.920
 break out because she is reality 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.930
 boring me too i enjoyed some 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.070
 time windows phone can absolutely not 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.080
 pleased no she is a cool system but 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.650
 there is no beauty in it 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.930
 which will be better than android or 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.940
 no amazing possibilities and 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.800
 and it's just not even blackberry for me 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.750
 more interesting than windows phone what 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.000
 impressions of the exhibition mvc 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.460
 first time was on mc impression 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.220
 normal interesting but I would not say 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.230
 what's the capacity 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.110
 Well, nothing is not shown cool 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.360
 Well, f5 to galaxy s5 showed although always 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.890
 didn't like samsung for me it was still 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.530
 one reason postebatsya though the phone 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.420
 really turned out quite good and touchwiz 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.790
 redrawn more beautiful made and 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.330
 crammed all that is possible what is unusual 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.270
 gadget 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.910
 you can have yourself can 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:19.380
 be google glass ahalai mahalay 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:21.030
 here it is which everyone is interested in which 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.910
 problems can solve google 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.350
 no answers like smart smart watches then 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.740
 There is a principle all push that you 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:31.710
 comes to you comes here frames you don't 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.840
 doing this hands navi 2 probably 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.410
 useful feature is you constantly mod 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.490
 to shoot 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:41.310
 photograph without hands and without 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.410
 special watering have become say so 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.410
 retaining thing actually because 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.860
 they cost unrealistically expensive in the second 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.710
 yet he is functional he is futuristic 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.950
 such and it's just interesting like this 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.460
 can be so cool but new effect but in 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.630
 life you don't often use it 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.790
 use only what is really 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.370
 useful here at the moment useful 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.310
 getting push and helpful 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.669
 filming if there was Russian in google 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.430
 the glass 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:13.560
 It would still be useful there and voice 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.150
 managing to become google and either respond 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.200
 on smsas that's cool . give them 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.789
 have to perceive 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.620
 such eyes and you answer what you need 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:24.780
 Sorry this can be a man in place 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.150
 music about what you tell on your 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.820
 lectures recently in tver perry was there at 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.610
