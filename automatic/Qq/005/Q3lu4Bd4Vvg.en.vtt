we<00:02:40.230> hold<00:02:40.349> on<00:02:43.640> now<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.819> would<00:02:44.940> explain<00:02:45.180> why

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
we hold on now that would explain why

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.289 
we hold on now that would explain why
yep

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
yep

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.960 
yep
so<00:02:48.560> basically<00:02:49.560> whenever<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.130> shoot<00:02:50.459> your<00:02:50.670> gun

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.210 

the<00:02:55.640> we<00:02:56.640> focus<00:02:57.390> this<00:02:57.920> every<00:02:58.920> time<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.069> shoot

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
the we focus this every time you shoot

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.080 
the we focus this every time you shoot
you're<00:02:59.370> gone<00:02:59.599> the<00:03:00.599> ammo<00:03:00.840> increases<00:03:02.000> costs<00:03:03.000> or

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
you're gone the ammo increases costs or

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.900 
you're gone the ammo increases costs or
whatever<00:03:03.209> using<00:03:03.540> shotguns<00:03:04.370> submachine<00:03:05.370> gun

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
whatever using shotguns submachine gun

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.830 
whatever using shotguns submachine gun
you<00:03:06.330> know<00:03:06.450> your<00:03:07.040> m16<00:03:11.030> sniper<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.269> also<00:03:12.420> uses<00:03:12.660> to

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
you know your m16 sniper it also uses to

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.360 
you know your m16 sniper it also uses to
rapid<00:03:13.170> fire<00:03:13.200> stuff<00:03:13.680> like<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:13.950> could<00:03:14.130> shoot<00:03:14.250> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
rapid fire stuff like I could shoot the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.849 
rapid fire stuff like I could shoot the
sniper<00:03:14.640> as<00:03:14.819> fast<00:03:15.090> as<00:03:15.239> I<00:03:15.330> want<00:03:15.569> now<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:16.739> would

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
sniper as fast as I want now this would

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.620 
sniper as fast as I want now this would
help<00:03:16.980> with<00:03:17.190> certain<00:03:17.459> missions<00:03:17.790> like<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.390> guess

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
help with certain missions like I guess

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.160 
help with certain missions like I guess

on<00:03:42.690> here<00:03:42.900> because<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.829> obviously<00:03:43.950> never<00:03:44.280> had

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
on here because you obviously never had

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.509 
on here because you obviously never had
that<00:03:44.609> before<00:03:44.639> either<00:03:45.200> say<00:03:46.200> my<00:03:46.319> guys<00:03:46.470> um<00:03:46.829> that's

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
that before either say my guys um that's

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.099 
that before either say my guys um that's
pretty<00:03:47.760> much<00:03:47.850> it

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
pretty much it

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.960 
pretty much it
that's<00:03:49.530> how<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.680> get<00:03:49.859> infinite<00:03:50.190> ammo<00:03:50.489> gta3

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
that's how to get infinite ammo gta3

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.970 
that's how to get infinite ammo gta3
requires<00:03:51.810> your<00:03:51.959> device<00:03:52.319> to<00:03:52.440> be<00:03:52.530> jailbroken

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
requires your device to be jailbroken

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.379 
requires your device to be jailbroken
but<00:03:55.340> definitely<00:03:56.340> a<00:03:56.370> pro<00:03:56.639> for<00:03:56.910> why<00:03:57.000> she<00:03:57.209> jet

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
but definitely a pro for why she jet

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.660 
but definitely a pro for why she jet
work<00:03:57.510> anyway<00:03:57.810> um<00:03:58.019> so<00:03:59.010> yeah<00:03:59.130> that's<00:03:59.549> how<00:03:59.639> you

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
work anyway um so yeah that's how you

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.039 
work anyway um so yeah that's how you
get<00:04:00.090> for<00:04:00.299> an<00:04:00.359> ammo<00:04:00.569> gta3<00:04:01.109> i<00:04:02.840> really<00:04:03.840> think<00:04:03.959> that

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
get for an ammo gta3 i really think that

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.319 
get for an ammo gta3 i really think that
might<00:04:04.230> be<00:04:04.350> as<00:04:05.280> far<00:04:05.459> as<00:04:05.579> I<00:04:05.670> know<00:04:05.730> that's<00:04:06.090> the

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
might be as far as I know that's the

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.289 
might be as far as I know that's the
only<00:04:06.359> way<00:04:06.569> I<00:04:06.600> know<00:04:06.750> of<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:07.319> do<00:04:08.190> it<00:04:08.459> it<00:04:08.760> works<00:04:09.000> well
