so<00:00:01.520> moving<00:00:02.520> on<00:00:02.730> with<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.000> cartwheel<00:00:03.449> we<00:00:03.870> had

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
so moving on with the cartwheel we had

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.230 
so moving on with the cartwheel we had
that<00:00:04.170> frontal<00:00:04.740> cartwheel<00:00:05.220> now<00:00:05.850> what<00:00:06.089> we're

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
that frontal cartwheel now what we're

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.249 
that frontal cartwheel now what we're
going<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.420> do<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.660> we're<00:00:06.779> going<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:06.930> turn<00:00:07.109> it

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
going to do is we're going to turn it

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.799 
going to do is we're going to turn it
into<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.470> square<00:00:07.770> hip<00:00:08.280> cart<00:00:08.580> with<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.970> square<00:00:09.570> hip

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
into a square hip cart with a square hip

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.290 
into a square hip cart with a square hip
cartwheel<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.590> cartwheel<00:00:11.190> where<00:00:12.000> there's<00:00:12.210> a

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
cartwheel is a cartwheel where there's a

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.470 
cartwheel is a cartwheel where there's a
180<00:00:12.929> degree<00:00:13.380> turn<00:00:13.410> as<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.190> go<00:00:14.400> so<00:00:14.670> if<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.089> start

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
180 degree turn as I go so if I start

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.810 
180 degree turn as I go so if I start
finishing<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.109> one<00:00:16.289> direction<00:00:16.470> when<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.310> finish

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
finishing in one direction when I finish

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.700 
finishing in one direction when I finish
I'll<00:00:18.060> be<00:00:18.330> facing<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.170> opposite<00:00:19.650> direction

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
I'll be facing the opposite direction

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.390 
I'll be facing the opposite direction
that's<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.820> square<00:00:21.090> hip<00:00:21.300> cartwheel<00:00:22.250> just<00:00:23.250> as

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
that's a square hip cartwheel just as

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.790 
that's a square hip cartwheel just as
the<00:00:23.519> name<00:00:23.670> describes<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.539> hips<00:00:24.840> are<00:00:25.170> squared

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
the name describes the hips are squared

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.040 
the name describes the hips are squared
from<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.039> beginning<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.609> they<00:00:27.449> finish<00:00:27.810> at

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
from the beginning and they finish at

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.439 
from the beginning and they finish at
the<00:00:28.470> end<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.800> same<00:00:29.010> way<00:00:29.070> just<00:00:29.670> opposite<00:00:30.240> leg

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
the end the same way just opposite leg

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.590 
the end the same way just opposite leg
in<00:00:30.599> front<00:00:30.750> as<00:00:31.109> simple<00:00:31.800> as<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.009> now<00:00:32.520> it's<00:00:33.270> easy

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
in front as simple as that now it's easy

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.750 
in front as simple as that now it's easy
to<00:00:33.960> say<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.410> thing<00:00:34.710> but<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.130> hard<00:00:35.489> to

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
to say this thing but it's hard to

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.729 
to say this thing but it's hard to
actually<00:00:35.940> perform<00:00:36.570> what<00:00:37.320> we're<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.590> do

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
actually perform what we're going to do

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.990 
actually perform what we're going to do
is<00:00:37.829> we're<00:00:37.950> going<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.129> take<00:00:38.250> our<00:00:38.430> concept<00:00:38.940> of

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
is we're going to take our concept of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.459 
is we're going to take our concept of
the<00:00:39.180> line<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.809> we're<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.050> stay<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.440> that

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
the line and we're going to stay on that

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.369 
the line and we're going to stay on that
line<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.489> we're<00:00:41.730> just<00:00:41.930> initiate<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
line and we're just initiate the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.040 
line and we're just initiate the
cartwheel<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.340> little<00:00:44.820> different<00:00:45.239> instead<00:00:45.960> of

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
cartwheel a little different instead of

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.290 
cartwheel a little different instead of
starting<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:46.770> frontal<00:00:47.309> plane<00:00:47.610> I'm<00:00:48.120> going

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
starting in this frontal plane I'm going

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.299 
starting in this frontal plane I'm going
to<00:00:48.360> start<00:00:48.600> facing<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> line<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.890> hips<00:00:50.129> are

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
to start facing the line so hips are

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.490 
to start facing the line so hips are
square<00:00:50.670> I'm<00:00:51.329> going<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.780> take<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> big<00:00:52.320> step

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
square I'm going to take a big step

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.299 
square I'm going to take a big step
forward<00:00:53.210> lunge<00:00:54.210> hips<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:54.930> still<00:00:55.199> square<00:00:55.559> arms

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
forward lunge hips are still square arms

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.580 
forward lunge hips are still square arms
are<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:56.489> what<00:00:57.210> I'm<00:00:57.329> going<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.570> think<00:00:57.629> about<00:00:58.140> is

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
are up what I'm going to think about is

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.689 
are up what I'm going to think about is
my<00:00:58.829> concept<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.550> handstand<00:01:01.250> which<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
my concept of handstand which is just a

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.910 
my concept of handstand which is just a
kick<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.120> handstand<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.470> kick<00:01:04.739> up<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
kick up to handstand and that kick up to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.890 
kick up to handstand and that kick up to
handstand<00:01:05.489> what<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.909> want<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.210> focus<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.869> not

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
handstand what I want to focus on is not

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.350 
handstand what I want to focus on is not
meeting<00:01:07.590> feet<00:01:08.070> together<00:01:08.310> I'm<00:01:08.880> going<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.180> try

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
meeting feet together I'm going to try

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.990 
meeting feet together I'm going to try
to<00:01:09.390> maintain<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.080> split<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.250> one<00:01:11.430> more<00:01:11.610> time<00:01:11.790> I'm

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
to maintain a split so one more time I'm

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.300 
to maintain a split so one more time I'm
here<00:01:12.330> arms<00:01:12.720> are<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:12.900> big<00:01:13.619> step

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
here arms are up big step

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.719 
here arms are up big step
hips<00:01:14.729> are<00:01:14.909> square<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.689> reach<00:01:16.259> forward<00:01:16.770> hit<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
hips are square I reach forward hit a

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.130 
hips are square I reach forward hit a
handstand<00:01:18.229> keep<00:01:19.229> my<00:01:19.380> legs<00:01:19.740> split<00:01:20.630> once<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.810> have

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
handstand keep my legs split once I have

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.429 
handstand keep my legs split once I have
that<00:01:22.759> handstand<00:01:23.759> with<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> split<00:01:24.570> now<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.110> can

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
that handstand with a split now I can

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.640 
that handstand with a split now I can
start<00:01:25.650> thinking<00:01:25.890> about<00:01:26.340> taking<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.939> into<00:01:27.299> a

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
start thinking about taking it into a

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.380 
start thinking about taking it into a
frontal<00:01:28.650> plane<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.579> that's<00:01:30.000> going<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> require

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
frontal plane so that's going to require

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.770 
frontal plane so that's going to require
a<00:01:30.630> little<00:01:30.810> turning<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.130> start<00:01:32.520> arms<00:01:32.909> up<00:01:33.119> big

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
a little turning so I start arms up big

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.440 
a little turning so I start arms up big
step<00:01:34.259> as<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:35.189> reach<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.729> I'm<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.150> lead

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
step as I reach in I'm going to lead

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.200 
step as I reach in I'm going to lead
with<00:01:37.020> my<00:01:37.049> first<00:01:37.590> hand<00:01:38.009> which<00:01:38.640> was<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.970> same

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
with my first hand which was the same

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.380 
with my first hand which was the same
hand<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.689> had<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> semi<00:01:40.650> circle<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.820> this

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
hand I had in the semi circle and this

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.310 
hand I had in the semi circle and this
is<00:01:42.479> what<00:01:42.600> I'm<00:01:42.689> looking<00:01:42.840> at

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
is what I'm looking at

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.260 
is what I'm looking at
reach<00:01:44.119> turn<00:01:45.119> I'm<00:01:46.189> opening<00:01:47.189> up<00:01:47.310> my<00:01:47.490> chest<00:01:47.820> into

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
reach turn I'm opening up my chest into

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.560 
reach turn I'm opening up my chest into
that<00:01:48.450> frontal<00:01:49.439> plane<00:01:49.710> which<00:01:49.950> was<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> same

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
that frontal plane which was the same

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.069 
that frontal plane which was the same
lateral<00:01:51.570> lunge<00:01:51.810> stepping<00:01:53.090> now<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> very

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
lateral lunge stepping now I have a very

I end up facing the opposite direction I

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.630 
I end up facing the opposite direction I
know<00:02:55.770> this<00:02:56.010> sounds<00:02:56.250> like<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.400> lot<00:02:56.610> of

we got that frontal plane a finish with
hips<00:03:05.040> square<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:06.120> our<00:03:06.270> arms<00:03:06.990> up<00:03:07.230> big<00:03:07.980> step
