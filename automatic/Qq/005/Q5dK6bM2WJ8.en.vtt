 that says grabbing ore 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:11.859
 he is two weeks long 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:14.979
 he shoots graveyards 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:16.329
 no i am not satisfied 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.329
 rabah saadane bob de jong opposite 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.599
 the turnover is October 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.779
 do not grab the end like that but that does not say everything it is one that Sunday 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.069
 leeuwarden anp a month after he was on the sand 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.670
 the international 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.670
 from a great distance 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.370
 for the many wanted 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.370
 because the side is right for the field 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.790
 buy walk-through ball 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.480
 my sponsors 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.910
 I think it's the right way 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.070
 the banks appear to be entering the competition 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.070
 that penalty for points 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.130
 I try the freezer 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.530
 by the best what your neighbor of dalto have to do this 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.500
 it's god's waste from dalto 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.500
 the competition is slightly tilted 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.500
 move ahead 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.510
 eric de vries 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.510
 tim bakker 3 the avans rebound 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:23.069
 running from the oldehove 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.739
 everyone continued 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.869
 on behalf of london anp 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.869
 three points behind the team from Driebergen 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.709
 in total must do something 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.659
 good attempts 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.019
 follow on would therefore hit a shooting incident 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.169
 chris hijacker 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:12.169
 2 more minutes in the first half 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:16.729
 repressed outside by making carpenter 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.639
 9 13 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.639
 the retreat just before rest 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.959
 roxanne detention 

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:50.799
 amber rose endellion 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.809
 the beginning of the second half 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:56.809
 Rafael Nadal 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.549
 too much speed and then immediately the freezer 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.719
 17 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.180
 completely without itself including the freezer with a nice shot 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.979
 jos roseboom 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.919
 a good shot rose tree 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.919
 you build for carpenter 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.800
 this is important 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.090
 if the women in the neighborhood let brands do the work for the car then 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.090
 May the rose tree is in the lead 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.050
 it's guessing 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.050
 roland garros between then and now only 3 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.499
 14 and 17 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:59.499
 jos roseboom 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:03.789
 when someone carpenter bergsma 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.559
 get the space 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:06.789
 but i don't 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.279
 but I love ilona van den berg 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:13.279
 she shot attacks from kz mr 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.650
 dordrecht 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.889
 amrabat 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.889

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.719
 17 19 it's going to be only 2 for you first 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:41.150
 the press and public comes to loose 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.919
 according to 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:44.949
 koog zaandijk 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.259
 that for the third time in the final is the third time in a row 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.259
 the profit for the grab has click for the field 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:00.119
 silver among us last year 

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:03.119
 a good check was found for the field shed 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.849
 this did not satisfy tim baker 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:22.650
 Novum news before the end of the competition 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.650
