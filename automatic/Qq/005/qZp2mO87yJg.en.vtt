00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.500
 Hello everyone. 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 It is 【God】 thing 【ぇ ど る】. 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
 I would like to comment on this from "captions" (subtitles) this time as well 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Nice to meet you. 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.800
 This stage is "Action Mode 1" of "Itos". 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.300
 This device has a surprising damage judgment, and the damage it receives is "2," so be sure to avoid it. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 If you jump here, you will fall into the hole. 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.050
 "Bird's gondola" 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Through w 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 This "ball of fire" will fly at random "up, down, left and right", but once it is destroyed it will not fly. 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.500
 I will get off because I will definitely get rid of it. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 You can not defeat "Black Uncle" without breaking "twice". 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.800
 Wow! ? "Tengu" and! 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.300
 I will wait for a moment. 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.800
 Firmly measure the timing ... 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.700
 ·························· 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 This "tip" can not be destroyed, so it can only be avoided. 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.100
 Once you get here, Tengu won't come later. 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.400
 In fact, it is okay to hit the "hand enemy" w 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.400
 Pay attention to the "rock" falling from above! 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.800
 Natsu! ? Were you ahead? 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.800
 I will wait for a while. 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.800
 ※ This time we are waiting for the "fireball" instead of the "temple" 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.200
 It seems to be able to go to the "right side" of "crate", but eventually I could not find a way to go ... 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.700
 Of course, it is "immediate death" when it falls to "lava". 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.200
 Here is an introduction to the Tengu strategy. 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.700
 Yes this is w 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.200
 If you get used to it, you can surprisingly easily defeat it. 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 It's in the way, so be sure to beat it! 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.800
 Crash: Annihilate the enemy on the screen 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.300
 ※ The items below are going to be picked up later 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Tokai: "Ki" jumps out of the sword and can attack from a distance 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.500
 Because this attack is the best of this stage, it is "magic prohibited", but I will use it without hesitation. 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.200
 Hmm, useful w 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.100
 It is finally a "boss game"! 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.600
 Ryuryu: It rushes around at high speed with the Boss of ACT 1 in Itosu, and it rushes. 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.600
 This boss is easy to win if there is a "sword spirit" w 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.100
 Let's roll and die at the initial position! 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.600
 However, when the boss approaches, I definitely avoid it. 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.100
 ※ Because there is time to release "water blade" at the same time as "Rush"! 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.600
 By the way, there is no damage judgment on the boss's "body". 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.600
 Oops! It is already the last blow ... 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.100
 Because the attack power of "Tokai" is "2," be careful not to overkill. 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.700
 This was the last minute w 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.200
 This clears "Action Mode 1" of "Itos". 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.700
 Next, move on to the creation mode of AITO. 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.390
 Thank you for your viewing. Let's look forward to Part 11!
