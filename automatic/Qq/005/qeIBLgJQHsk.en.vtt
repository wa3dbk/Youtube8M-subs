and then Android swapped everything and

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.819 
and then Android swapped everything and
look<00:02:02.820> more<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:03.689> anyways<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.469> be<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
first of all it seems that the company

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.510 
first of all it seems that the company
is<00:02:18.300> considering<00:02:18.750> adding<00:02:19.170> an<00:02:19.739> extra<00:02:19.920> row<00:02:20.459> of

operating<00:02:23.099> system<00:02:23.670> which<00:02:23.819> is<00:02:23.970> great<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.630> know

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
operating system which is great you know

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.930 
operating system which is great you know

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
interesting is that apparently the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.880 
interesting is that apparently the

let's see how that goes and finally for

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.470 
let's see how that goes and finally for
the<00:02:43.590> very<00:02:43.890> very<00:02:44.430> interesting<00:02:45.060> news<00:02:45.239> of<00:02:45.390> the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
the very very interesting news of the

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.110 
the very very interesting news of the
day<00:02:45.660> we<00:02:45.840> get<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.260> first<00:02:46.620> leaked<00:02:47.010> photo<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.790> the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
to be the 4.7 inch variant or not but it

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.559 
to be the 4.7 inch variant or not but it
sure<00:02:53.610> looks<00:02:53.819> like<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.239> looks<00:02:54.390> like<00:02:54.450> a

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
sure looks like it it looks like a

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.229 
sure looks like it it looks like a
bigger<00:02:54.959> iphone<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:55.980> every<00:02:56.280> way<00:02:56.459> but<00:02:56.519> it<00:02:57.000> looks

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
bigger iphone in every way but it looks

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.840 
bigger iphone in every way but it looks
a<00:02:57.390> lot<00:02:57.540> like<00:02:57.810> an<00:02:58.049> iPhone<00:02:58.470> it's<00:02:59.459> just<00:02:59.700> really

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
a lot like an iPhone it's just really

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.250 
a lot like an iPhone it's just really
interesting<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.450> see<00:03:00.600> that<00:03:00.720> there<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:00.900> really

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
interesting to see that there is really

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.050 
interesting to see that there is really
not<00:03:01.440> much<00:03:01.650> change<00:03:02.040> in<00:03:02.190> design<00:03:02.580> here<00:03:02.819> except

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
not much change in design here except

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.280 
not much change in design here except
for<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.239> fact<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.569> it's<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.810> bigger<00:03:03.989> phone

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
for the fact that it's a bigger phone

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.500 
for the fact that it's a bigger phone
but<00:03:04.650> even<00:03:05.370> though<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.549> could<00:03:05.940> say<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.239> this

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
but even though I could say that this

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.720 
but even though I could say that this
could<00:03:06.720> be<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.900> 3d<00:03:07.470> print<00:03:07.860> out<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.190> photo<00:03:08.430> did

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
could be a 3d print out this photo did

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.670 
could be a 3d print out this photo did
come<00:03:08.940> from<00:03:08.970> Foxconn<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:09.989> since<00:03:10.290> apples

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
come from Foxconn and since apples

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.770 
come from Foxconn and since apples
become<00:03:10.980> terrible<00:03:11.340> at<00:03:11.459> keeping<00:03:11.610> secrets<00:03:12.030> we

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
become terrible at keeping secrets we

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.000 
become terrible at keeping secrets we
could<00:03:12.989> just<00:03:13.140> say<00:03:13.319> that<00:03:13.470> this<00:03:13.560> is<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.830> real

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
could just say that this is the real

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.949 
could just say that this is the real
deal<00:03:14.250> but<00:03:14.489> aside<00:03:14.700> from<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.569> know<00:03:15.600> this

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
deal but aside from that you know this

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.530 
deal but aside from that you know this
designer<00:03:16.830> made<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.280> mock-up<00:03:17.640> of<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.000> recent
