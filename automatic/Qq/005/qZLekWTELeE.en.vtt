 Hello and welcome here 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.950
 a little video of one 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:14.630
 table saw madita so we catch 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:19.859
 right now down to her then here the 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:24.019
 flips and then turns or vice versa 95 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.119
 grad determined 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.480
 That's clear every saw I hope 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:37.550
 that we are a bit bad then 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:41.790
 to pay a blow in parallel 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:50.370
 different tables public 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:54.570
 Two things take off from boxers 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.530
 similar saw then you can do it here 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.039
 are with the eye then is a protection 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.790
 you can quickly lions with that 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.790
 you can definitely pull out the wedge 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.080
 you can solve their black 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.100
 plastic piece decreases 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.000
 the stock up completely and then boosts 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.009
 barely two screws outside 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.259
 that's good when you 're full and 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.150
 wants to make connections then is 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.150
 that is really so 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.760
 here you can screw two of 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.510
 the stop 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.840
 here the alu piece appeared to her 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:41.920
 Coming brinkmann grad fall 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.650
 change 60 degrees on both sides 50 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.690
 everything stated 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.710
 if you pull it out of here here 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.900
 you do not need that 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.540
 that's how tight this is 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.850
 hold on we are so far went up 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:01.780
 both sides 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:05.170
 you work down what was the first 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.729
 prank so the did not have electricity and 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.759
 there the cable is clicked on and 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:14.560
 connection for vacuum cleaner then we have 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.570
 here is a large table saw the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.870
 art strong current works just as much 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.750
 power like the other drive blow 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.970
 shown there is fresh and mix 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.420
 sender the teeth bleach individual 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.360
 Delivered the table still combine 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.890
 Turn it up and down here if you want something 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:40.780
 It does not make any sense 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:42.190
 then pull out that really 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.040
 because I introduce them very often 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.590
 to use my videos 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.810
 which also show a piano piece by 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:57.100
 Notz 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:03:02.490
 sometimes big goal in one 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.490
 hand of bad 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:22.340
 hit like that 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:26.510
 Well, that's about me despite that 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:29.630
 Actually saw blade is left with 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.630
 rough 10 has very little 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:37.330
 outfitters inform there it has 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:40.540
 None is really that big 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.880
 format boaters in the smut 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.840
 have front here in front of the saw blade for 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.970
 I cut another leaf 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.380
 You can drive this out and then 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.680
 That beats her a bit 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.820
 broken then there's no equipment 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.820
 I do not need it here 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:05.959
 then I'm flat again 1 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.630
 Sawing off 1 for bach also comes on it 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.290
 I can do that too 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:14.959
 Now I have to stop burning and notice 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.630
 and the rest you will have one more 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.250
 more videos i think i hope so 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.020
 I do not forget it too now 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.830
 shit the sheet one the board at 100 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.140
 I hope I have nothing now 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.340
 to forget 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.840
 I actually think everything 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.810
 shown is already very good rule 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.920
 you have to say there are from roche 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.960
 I do not know if I already 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.260
 mentioned 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:45.470
 So a similar bit cheaper 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:52.280
 old but i like makita because of that 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:55.580
 I have this makita and yes it is true 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:05:03.460
 her about me and so on a channel in 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:05.840
 those of a description or something else 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.030
 if you have any videos else 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.460
 Want to say write his description 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.420
 not in the writing description in 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.690
 the comments 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:21.070
 I like to answer it yes I think 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:23.990
 that's it, you can saw blades 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.820
 Mooring is done here from saw blades 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.670
 hang on it 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:33.250

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.400

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:46.940

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:53.330

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:55.310
