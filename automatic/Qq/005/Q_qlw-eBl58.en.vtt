00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.630
 on the slope we perform already 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.719
 familiar to us 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.509
 turning access to everything 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.099
 in order to board we do not uefa 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.490
 if from the body 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.689
 is at large on interest 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.730
 let's call it snowy on 2 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.429
 5 successful and 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.249
 Stalin 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.349
 and without us remains on the snow coasting 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.519
 after we 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:31.800
 spread shoulders 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.700
 develop a sport 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.890
 put his foot on the floor 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.660
 to implement 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.660
 first we descend mostly stands 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.980
 not producing 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.850
 and no moving chickens 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.750
 see how to do it 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.840
 exercise 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.840
 our taste 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.170
 I'll show you the mistakes now 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.780
 which can meet at 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.520
 initial training 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.520
 man became speed scored 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.880
 and then he got scared and starts doing 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.880
 all sorts of hand movements 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.960
 now try to do the following 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.450
 stage 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.730
 same so 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.270
 we start moving 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.240
 and trying to f3 Russia idle tzagi with 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.240
 tender and at the crossroads and back 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.550
 for a start we replenish it 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.550
 moving with a little hook up 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 but 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.740
 P 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.470
 but that 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.280
 the God 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.880
 x 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.880
 m 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.329
 deputy 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:34.259
 not 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:41.149
 one 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:51.829
 next exercise who will be loading 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.829
 Don snow crust 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.200
 look how it's done on the spot with 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.789
 using the structure 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:02.789
 then see how it is done in print 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.249
 very important to beginners 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:07.650
 snowboarders looked only ahead 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.679
 in the direction of travel 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:12.460
 loading the back leg 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.659
 and going to the starting position 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.079
 you will feel how it changes with 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.459
 pride 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.609
 look again at doing this 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.609
 the project 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:30.209
 2 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.449
 to face 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.139
 as we said 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.909
 the board has an order radius of 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.729
 the constitutional court of something more 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:40.670
 radius 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.749
 which allows you to make purchases 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:46.279
 to carry out in turns we need 

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:47.879
 upload some part 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.409
 born in front of him 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.860
 to start the boards loading 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.249
 the community will appear in the dark transfer of Odessa 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:55.979
 bodies 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:57.869
 to say 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:00.209
 and at an angle of 45 degrees 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.869
 on the front 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:04.869
 either 45 degrees for December 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:08.339
 depending on the state of the environment 

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:11.009
 this download can be redistributed 

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:13.659
 if the snow is tighter then we 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.999
 we can do more loading 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:18.919
 Moskal and respectively 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.969
 if the snow is completely clear 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.849
 then we carry out the average load 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.150
 blackboard 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.380
 however baseball averaging construction 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.380
 so that we do not catch our inventory 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.909
 Now we look at the preparatory 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.659
 chef mastering exercises 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.809
 for the beginning of the butoma monolith 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:41.809
 the student takes the starting position 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:44.009
 front knee noginsk headed 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.339
 to port 45 degrees to the side 

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:49.029
 assumed cornering while 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:51.079
 we need to pull the gas and give the opportunity 

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:53.699
 pupils will feel that he can himself 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.969
 load the board in a way that will start 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.449
 work and foreground a site 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.550
 the table needs to be explained to him what it is 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.699
 safely 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.870
 but as the second leg of freedom 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.819
 and he can step forward at any moment 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:11.819
 n 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.680
 look again and how it is performed 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.680
 defeats 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:25.229
 the same happens with the back 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:26.029
 by the course 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:28.309
 but when this happens the following 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:30.429
 as much as possible turns 

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:32.330
 chefs direction 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.909
 there is another technique 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.550
 toward the intended 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.569
 of our center AvtoVAZ 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:39.439
 head turns in 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.689
 cornering 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:43.740
 come up with another exercise 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.680
 preferably country recognized 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.330
 the center of gravity moves smoothly 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.979
 without any hesitation 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.449
 here we see how the download is performed 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.219
 front edge pay attention to 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:00.219
 staging free snow 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:12.690
 now we are doing the same 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.629
 exercise only loading danish 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:18.629
 Ukrainian company 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:13.120
 after loading the front 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.419
 transafghan 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:16.129
 we start to train download 

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:17.789
 sites 

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:19.490
 look in more detail 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.490
 data execution 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.509
 if you are doing well 

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:32.580
 try to get down from the flat 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.749
 cyclone 

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:35.789
 on one strapped energy 

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:36.750
 this is very 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.210
 good exercise to maintain 

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.750
 equilibrium
