00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
I guess you could say where you have to

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.750 
I guess you could say where you have to
go<00:00:25.019> find<00:00:25.350> all<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.710> spaceship<00:00:26.189> parts<00:00:26.430> and

there were a few others as well so this

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.290

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
is pretty much more or less with the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.690 
is pretty much more or less with the
whole<00:00:30.510> idea<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.900> an<00:00:31.109> alien<00:00:31.320> dlc<00:00:31.859> did<00:00:32.279> come<00:00:32.460> into

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
happen now I kind of came up with this

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.780 
happen now I kind of came up with this
crazy<00:00:39.719> idea<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.320> these<00:00:40.710> aliens<00:00:41.010> take<00:00:41.610> over

be completely insane having ray guns and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.490 
be completely insane having ray guns and
of<00:01:14.340> course<00:01:14.549> there<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:14.790> be<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> few<00:01:15.210> other

of course there will be a few other

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.570 
of course there will be a few other
futuristic<00:01:16.500> guns<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.920> guess<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.220> could<00:01:17.369> say

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
futuristic guns I guess you could say

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.609 
futuristic guns I guess you could say
but<00:01:17.759> apart<00:01:18.180> from<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.420> flying<00:01:18.900> wise<00:01:19.170> if<00:01:19.439> we

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
but apart from that flying wise if we

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.280 
but apart from that flying wise if we
can't<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> UFO<00:01:20.580> then<00:01:20.939> possibly<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.570> jetpack

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
can't have a UFO then possibly a jetpack

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.260 
can't have a UFO then possibly a jetpack
but<00:01:22.799> then<00:01:22.950> again<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.369> jetpack<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.820> also

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
but then again this jetpack is also

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.670 
but then again this jetpack is also
strapping<00:01:24.570> ray<00:01:24.930> guns<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.500> all<00:01:25.560> that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
strapping ray guns and all that

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.679 
strapping ray guns and all that
futuristic<00:01:26.040> stuff<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.759> well<00:01:26.970> by<00:01:27.240> either<00:01:27.360> way

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
futuristic stuff as well by either way

the<00:01:37.439> ray<00:01:37.590> guns<00:01:37.860> itself<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.549> think<00:01:38.820> he'll<00:01:38.970> be

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the ray guns itself I think he'll be

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.880 
the ray guns itself I think he'll be
pretty<00:01:39.390> sweet<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.930> another<00:01:40.229> pretty<00:01:40.680> cool

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
pretty sweet and another pretty cool

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.889 
pretty sweet and another pretty cool
thing<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.549> dlc<00:01:41.970> pack<00:01:42.420> would<00:01:42.720> be

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
thing to have in the dlc pack would be

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.679 
thing to have in the dlc pack would be
to<00:01:43.229> probably<00:01:43.680> fly<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> UFO<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.060> think<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.600> would

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
to probably fly a UFO I think that would

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.450 
to probably fly a UFO I think that would
be<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.020> much<00:01:46.170> fun<00:01:46.470> or<00:01:46.680> if<00:01:46.829> I'm<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.009> exactly<00:01:47.369> a

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
be so much fun or if I'm not exactly a

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.270 
be so much fun or if I'm not exactly a
UFO<00:01:48.090> any<00:01:48.420> type<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.750> futuristic<00:01:49.619> vehicle<00:01:49.829> will

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
UFO any type of futuristic vehicle will

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.249 
UFO any type of futuristic vehicle will
do<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.700> gift<00:01:50.939> fly<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.299> isn't<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.720> plane<00:01:52.020> I

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
do that gift fly that isn't a plane I

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.810 
do that gift fly that isn't a plane I
would<00:01:52.530> love<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.740> see<00:01:52.979> something<00:01:53.220> like<00:01:53.579> that

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
would love to see something like that

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.639 
would love to see something like that
and<00:01:54.060> then<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> futuristic<00:01:55.079> vehicle<00:01:55.259> would

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
and then the futuristic vehicle would

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.380 
and then the futuristic vehicle would
probably<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.250> another<00:01:56.490> little<00:01:56.909> reward<00:01:57.210> as

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
probably be another little reward as

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.940 
probably be another little reward as

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
completely agree on but this may be a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.469 
completely agree on but this may be a

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
completely understand but then again if

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.410
