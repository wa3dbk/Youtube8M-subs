00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.850
 hello we are the research group 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.400
 terminal of the educational institution 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.920
 Orange of the rural area of the municipality 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.890
 of quimbaya in the department of 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.350
 QuindÃ­o our group is born from the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.750
 2010 with the arrival of Professor JosÃ© 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.900
 noÃ© sanchez and the support of the coordinator 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.740
 john will director jon wilder tower and of 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.620
 our rector gerardo res 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.810
 but they are proper to settle for near 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.780
 of 20 students here from fifth 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.110
 grade 11 that in class times is 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.340
 say in the afternoons we meet for 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.920
 work on the different projects that 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.320
 we propose in this way 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.500
 investigates has become a very good 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.930
 way to take advantage of free time 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.060
 in this year 2012 with the support of 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.830
 program waves and the University of 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.330
 QuindÃ­o we started a new project 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.940
 will benefit all growers of 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.260
 fish so we want to tell you what 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.060
 it is about 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.490
 our project is born by observing the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.520
 processes that developed in the 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.350
 fish ponds of the institution already 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.869
 that were a little abandoned by the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.210
 association that had them in charge to see 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.369
 that they did not take care of those who 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.620
 we did in that responsibility and there it 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.290
 use the penalties of success 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.990
 what you need to do to grow weight 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.900
 how you can improve the process of 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.600
 fish culture in the institution how 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.730
 you can make the most of the water in 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.490
 the fish ponds using the 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.040
 electronics 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.739
 to begin our trajectory of 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.580
 inquiry we consulted consults on 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.650
 the fish in this case the red mojarra 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.590
 we investigate about the care that 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.930
 they must have with them the feeding 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.769
 and the characteristics of water as they are 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.860
 the ph the temperature the turbidity and how 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.990
 you could take advantage of the rainy waters 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.030
 to develop our project 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.850
 research we use the method 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.320
 scientific and blas methodology is by 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.110
 what research questions 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.390
 that arise in this process are very 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.000
 important when trying 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.920
 our hypotheses since they allow us 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.570
 formulate new solutions for 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.220
 problems that are presented in 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.220
 our trajectory in migration 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:02.100
 that is a small sample of the force 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.100
 that has the motor pump 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.600
 topic 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.410
 the whole effect on tour and it got 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.170
 simply by adding some accessories 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.590
 of pvc and a small hose to the 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.600
 water outlet 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.330
 when passing the water compression by the tf 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.850
 sucks the air from the hose and this 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.180
 We can check to cover the 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.180
 hose 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.300
 let's go to the 'red' oreochromis was tied 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.400
 foundations in the pond making 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.390
 most used species in crops 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.940
 Now warm lakes between 25 and 34 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.220
 degrees cents when they are alevinos 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.560
 can feed with a concentrator 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.560
 with proteins 3 to 4 times a day 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.620
 to take advantage of the water of it 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.990
 pond and use the same motor pump 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.660
 we use natural filters of this 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.820
 way cleaning gravel we keep the 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.100
 ph and we avoid towards the changes 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.080
 frequent of it 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.780
 the onion we take advantage of thanks to 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.090
 these reserve tanks that we assemble the 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.550
 picture of the waters of the roof of the 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.350
 bathrooms and with this pond we can of the 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.350
 water refills on the stand 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.780
 initially we thought that our 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.020
 control systems would do through a 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.260
 computer and we developed a program 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.260
 visual of 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.610
 and an electron circuit 

00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:27.179
 connected to the parallel port of the pc 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:29.459
 These tried with a model the 

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:32.279
 which was arranged in the file of 

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:34.679
 the sciences as it is complicated in a 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:37.409
 computer next to the pond we want 

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:41.129
 develop an electronic circuit that 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:42.959
 turn on for two hours for half an hour 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.999
 and that can also be controlled 

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:47.249
 through a mobile phone 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:50.009
 in this way we say the consumption of 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:52.469
 electricity and we optimize the process of 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.350
 oxygenation starts the water of our 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:55.750
 state 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.590
 is projecting narrator because it gives us 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:02.950
 all the clothes using the same 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.650
 elements that they possess having we know 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.980
 the necessary pvc and circuit 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.840
 electronic that the most economical of this 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.100
 way with an investment that can be 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.100
 mean the crops 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.770
 ah 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.770
 ah
