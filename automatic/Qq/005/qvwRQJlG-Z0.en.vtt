00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
the slide all the way in the back like

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.599 
the slide all the way in the back like
that<00:02:59.299> it<00:02:59.450> could<00:02:59.630> wiggle<00:02:59.840> on<00:03:00.109> you<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:01.100> simply

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
that it could wiggle on you so simply

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.110 
that it could wiggle on you so simply
push<00:03:01.819> a<00:03:01.850> button<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.420> now<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.230> goes<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.620> slide

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.570 

and<00:03:07.120> that<00:03:07.630> is<00:03:07.840> really<00:03:08.440> going<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:08.920> do<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.130> lot<00:03:09.400> to

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
and that is really going to do a lot to

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.670 
and that is really going to do a lot to
open<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.940> up<00:03:10.030> in<00:03:10.210> here<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.990> is<00:03:11.140> kind<00:03:11.440> of<00:03:11.560> the

open it up in here this is kind of the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.460 
open it up in here this is kind of the
same<00:03:11.860> concept<00:03:12.490> as<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.670> hybrid<00:03:13.000> camper<00:03:13.690> except

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.840 
same concept as a hybrid camper except
for<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.710> fact<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:15.040> everything<00:03:15.340> is<00:03:15.580> hard

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
to deal with the other advantage there's

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.450 
to deal with the other advantage there's
a<00:03:23.080> lot<00:03:23.200> of<00:03:23.320> national<00:03:23.710> parks<00:03:23.950> won't<00:03:24.190> let<00:03:24.340> you
