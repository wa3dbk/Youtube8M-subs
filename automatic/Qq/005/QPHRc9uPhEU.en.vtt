against<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.620> Marquez<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:24.060> know<00:02:24.209> everything<00:02:25.019> is

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
against a Marquez you know everything is

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.110 
against a Marquez you know everything is
against<00:02:25.440> us<00:02:25.530> because<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.160> devastating

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
against us because of the devastating

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.930 
against us because of the devastating
knockout<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.480> mark<00:02:27.810> gets<00:02:27.959> put<00:02:28.230> on<00:02:28.349> patio<00:02:29.310> but

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
knockout the mark gets put on patio but

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.410

you<00:02:30.030> know<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.450> think<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:31.310> Bradley

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
you know I just think that a Bradley

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.449 
you know I just think that a Bradley
styles<00:02:33.420> make<00:02:33.569> fights<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.980> don't<00:02:35.310> think

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
styles make fights and I don't think

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.710 
styles make fights and I don't think
Marcus<00:02:35.819> would<00:02:36.000> do<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.330> same<00:02:36.360> thing<00:02:36.540> to

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
Marcus would do the same thing to

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.360 
Marcus would do the same thing to
Bradley<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.200> he<00:02:37.319> did<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.500> back<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:38.040> back<00:02:38.069> down

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
Bradley that he did to back to back down

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.000 
Bradley that he did to back to back down
okay
