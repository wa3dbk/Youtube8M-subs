00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.670
 Hello everyone , welcome this 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.350
 minecraft episode mod 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.350
 today we will talk about a fashion day 1 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.060
 point 7.10 and of one of his then don 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.270
 impression fashion is part of the core cycle 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.930
 or chicken bone you want to call and the mode 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.940
 in question is the multipart forge is 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.559
 pretty much what this fashion does 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.960
 introduces the possibility of having i 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.440
 many of the many vanilla cubes of the cubes 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.900
 assembled cubes cut in half made a 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.879
 column made with a hole in the middle and 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.940
 similar to create covers maybe for i 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.190
 our doubts in the modÃ  series yourself this 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.090
 mode makes it in practice to greater 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.770
 part of cubes that are known as microblogs 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.890
 then this mod 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.829
 in addition to his Don needs 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.780
 usually be put by hand 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.500
 in what sense should I introduce the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.899
 hippies and codes to be able to bring i 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.880
 cut cubes if you have to do it 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.119
 manually the woman did not do that 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.030
 integrate perfectly that add 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.280
 tested up to 50 safe modes 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.869
 microblog then does it automatically 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.250
 in fact now we are going to see with the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.960
 fashions that have remained within 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.470
 this package is to see that they are all 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.710
 cut 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.110
 now activate the skin you already see of 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.330
 alongside all the cubes cut into this 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.030
 case we could see vanilla cubes now 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.670
 I take them, not just the ryemas, too 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.500
 ingots of all the rest crafting of 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.600
 nt everything even smaller in this 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.040
 case also integrates with many objects e 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.420
 of fashions 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.330
 then let's see if I can find one 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:57.090
 someone here is the basic pillar here 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.970
 or the piller produces look at that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.119
 cool with all the objects also 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.210
 mode then let's take some other cube 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.149
 of these here we take no that yes his 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.400
 charge things the rest of the usual 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.290
 gold and no hours that is normal anyway 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.269
 it integrates very well even with fashions 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.600
 here in here there are 56 mod 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:23.709
 so don't worry there are none 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:27.579
 however many are tested up to 50 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:30.019
 if I can put myself as a coloqui 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:32.120
 see when you're going to place these 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.829
 doubts will make you a transparent shape 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.810
 because these can be placed 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.150
 like this for example lateral for 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.909
 below for above as you like but second 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.389
 how you will get up he leans here 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:48.650
 see or almost and they are going to join 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:50.930
 one to the other you see these for example 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.250
 it's convenient for when we do installations 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.109
 with pipes that must pass 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.510
 inside the walls instead of leaving 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.220
 you will only leave an entire empty cube 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.560
 the central part for the doubts was alone 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.409
 you will cover and there are as we have said 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.590
 also of other materials like this that 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:11.629
 in other words, it is made of bushes 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:15.469
 made of pumpkin made of oil sand 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:18.109
 look at the strange facts of stone bric 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:21.859
 so you will also take materials already 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:25.939
 complete I made them of emerald minerals 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:27.769
 and look at or done with the graph in 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:30.349
 the rebel will not work mycroft in 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.049
 the ball to the boys is only the cube is 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.030
 just an embellishment like the TNT does not 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.440
 will work 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.379
 and then there will also be microblogs 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.299
 individual see there a shape is formed 4 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.260
 in this shape 4 we could place 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.049
 these micro blogs 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.579
 let's say to our liking at the sides 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:52.040
 here they are rightly next to you 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.509
 we could add more and more 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.209
 we will add more will grow this 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:04:00.259
 microblog you see now it becomes one 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.540
 complete so we can create everything 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:05.329
 from the small to the large also the columns e 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.220
 also integrated with fashions 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.220
 this for example mineral of the 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.500
 fashion's inside that lagani Sneijder 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.840
 see this one instead is a normal one 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.829
 grafting can always be set to one 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.409
 certain distance 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.909
 because you see that this area has an air 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:22.970
 we can work with micro blogs 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:26.539
 for example this is nothing by this 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.430
 ways introduces these elements italy 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.800
 lengthens them makes them flat if not 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.300
 I was there are also the covers that cover 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.190
 they are the most comfortable thing there is about 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.629
 miss everything in this way the 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.330
 minecraft founded I have a little if 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:42.120
 we find the covers then those on 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.180
 cut covers and double covers and there 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.080
 should be just the panel e 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.539
 this is the cover 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.460
 here it is, the cover is very comfortable 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.800
 same for the pipes or for plants or for 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.840
 cover the machinery that makes sense 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.819
 the cover in the same way as this one 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.710
 other cubes to a selection see the which 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:05.099
 means we can do something 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.469
 of the genre and create just one 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:09.659
 precise wall cover that you go to 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:13.409
 hook one to another perhaps even from 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:15.599
 above and place tubes inside 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.789
 liquid what we want then goes to 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.819
 cover in a way that you do n't 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.289
 just a wall being cover is also 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:25.259
 very fine so it should not give 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:28.169
 very interesting problems then 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:30.419
 this fashion indeed these two models and 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.629
 you will find in the description in the links 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:36.870
 in description forge multipartner form 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:38.460
 then multipart integration woman 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.840
 to make it work automatically and 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.360
 fashions to create these beautiful 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.699
 cut effects are updated 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.860
 both 1.7 very 10 if there are 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:49.860
