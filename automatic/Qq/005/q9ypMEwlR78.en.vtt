00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.360 
split the pursuit and now you see his
track<00:03:41.239> ability<00:03:41.810> starting<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.560> take<00:03:42.769> over<00:03:42.980> he's

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
track ability starting to take over he's

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.759 
track ability starting to take over he's
a<00:03:43.400> linear<00:03:43.879> guy<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:44.780> think<00:03:44.959> when<00:03:45.199> you<00:03:45.290> look<00:03:45.319> at

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
a linear guy so I think when you look at

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.349 
a linear guy so I think when you look at
it's<00:03:45.949> going<00:03:45.980> to<00:03:46.129> be<00:03:46.220> stopping<00:03:46.609> Denard<00:03:47.120> in<00:03:47.269> the

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
it's going to be stopping Denard in the

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.839 
it's going to be stopping Denard in the
pass<00:03:47.599> game<00:03:47.930> where<00:03:48.349> he's<00:03:48.530> quickly<00:03:48.889> developing

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
pass game where he's quickly developing

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.939 
pass game where he's quickly developing
into<00:03:50.480> a<00:03:50.510> guy<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:51.139> can<00:03:51.260> give<00:03:51.530> you<00:03:51.680> some

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:51.949 
into a guy that can give you some

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:53.800 
into a guy that can give you some
trouble<00:03:52.370> with<00:03:52.699> his<00:03:52.879> arm<00:03:53.090> as<00:03:53.239> well<00:03:53.269> they

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
trouble with his arm as well they

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.860 
trouble with his arm as well they
averaged<00:03:54.190> 16.7<00:03:55.190> yards<00:03:55.910> per<00:03:56.150> completion<00:03:56.480> that

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
averaged 16.7 yards per completion that

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.289 
averaged 16.7 yards per completion that
is<00:03:57.049> second<00:03:57.500> best<00:03:57.650> in<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.489> nation<00:03:58.639> so<00:03:59.000> you<00:03:59.060> see

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
is second best in the nation so you see

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.819 
is second best in the nation so you see
some<00:03:59.480> progress<00:03:59.690> certainly<00:04:00.260> being<00:04:00.440> made<00:04:00.620> in

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
some progress certainly being made in

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.030 
some progress certainly being made in
that<00:04:01.370> passing<00:04:01.849> game
