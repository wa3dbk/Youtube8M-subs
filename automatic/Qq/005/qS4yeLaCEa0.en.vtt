00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.939 

I<00:00:10.360> think<00:00:11.139> the<00:00:11.469> most<00:00:12.039> important<00:00:12.610> quality<00:00:13.089> or

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:13.949 
I think the most important quality or

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.640 
I think the most important quality or
prerequisite<00:00:14.949> is<00:00:15.129> that<00:00:15.969> the<00:00:16.930> principal

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
prerequisite is that the principal

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.429 
prerequisite is that the principal
should<00:00:17.770> have<00:00:17.859> been<00:00:17.980> a<00:00:18.009> good<00:00:18.189> teacher<00:00:18.369> I<00:00:19.439> think

in the building who are those people who
are<00:00:47.110> great<00:00:47.380> sort<00:00:47.680> of<00:00:47.770> to<00:00:47.950> almost<00:00:48.550> within<00:00:48.850> the

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
are great sort of to almost within the

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.460 
are great sort of to almost within the
building<00:00:49.510> you<00:00:50.470> have<00:00:50.500> your<00:00:50.829> own<00:00:50.860> University<00:00:51.850> of

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
building you have your own University of

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.870 
building you have your own University of
great<00:00:53.470> methodology<00:00:54.130> that<00:00:54.160> works<00:00:54.550> what

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
great methodology that works what

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.180 
great methodology that works what
doesn't<00:00:55.090> work<00:00:55.380> with<00:00:56.380> whom<00:00:56.500> you<00:00:56.620> can<00:00:56.649> partner

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
doesn't work with whom you can partner

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.370 
doesn't work with whom you can partner
so<00:00:57.970> the<00:00:58.090> principal<00:00:58.480> has<00:00:58.630> to<00:00:58.780> have<00:00:58.989> an<00:00:59.140> eye<00:00:59.350> on

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380

everybody

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.099 

I<00:01:05.159> think<00:01:06.159> in<00:01:06.310> experience<00:01:06.969> with<00:01:07.359> children<00:01:07.390> I

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:08.109 
I think in experience with children I

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:11.580 
I think in experience with children I
think<00:01:08.859> the<00:01:09.250> people<00:01:09.460> who<00:01:10.020> speak<00:01:11.020> loudly<00:01:11.320> about

think the people who speak loudly about

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.580 
think the people who speak loudly about
that<00:01:11.950> really<00:01:12.280> have<00:01:12.460> not<00:01:12.869> not<00:01:13.869> had<00:01:14.110> hands-on

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590

that really have not not had hands-on
experience<00:01:15.130> with<00:01:15.310> kids<00:01:15.840> once<00:01:16.840> you've<00:01:17.020> been<00:01:17.170> in

that they know their one what what I

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.020 
that they know their one what what I
call<00:01:34.780> one-trick<00:01:35.439> ponies<00:01:35.829> they<00:01:36.310> know<00:01:36.549> one<00:01:36.819> way

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
call one-trick ponies they know one way

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.029 
call one-trick ponies they know one way
to<00:01:37.060> teach<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.780> if<00:01:38.049> you<00:01:38.319> don't<00:01:38.500> get<00:01:38.679> it<00:01:38.860> that

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
to teach and if you don't get it that

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.460 
to teach and if you don't get it that
way<00:01:39.220> something's<00:01:39.759> wrong<00:01:39.939> with<00:01:40.060> you<00:01:40.209> so<00:01:41.200> I

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
way something's wrong with you so I

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.440 
way something's wrong with you so I
think<00:01:41.590> part<00:01:42.220> of<00:01:42.399> what<00:01:42.579> has<00:01:42.729> to<00:01:42.880> happen<00:01:42.909> is<00:01:43.420> a

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
think part of what has to happen is a

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.899 
think part of what has to happen is a
development<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.500> sometimes<00:01:45.340> it<00:01:45.489> can't<00:01:45.729> be

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
development and sometimes it can't be

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.669 
development and sometimes it can't be
sending<00:01:46.270> them<00:01:46.360> off<00:01:46.479> to<00:01:46.509> university<00:01:47.349> it<00:01:47.500> really

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
sending them off to university it really

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:49.819 
sending them off to university it really
has<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.890> be<00:01:48.039> internal<00:01:48.579> development<00:01:48.849> of

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
has to be internal development of

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.010 
has to be internal development of
multiple<00:01:50.829> ways<00:01:51.039> of<00:01:51.489> getting<00:01:51.880> kids<00:01:52.179> not<00:01:52.989> only

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
multiple ways of getting kids not only

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.960 
multiple ways of getting kids not only
into<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.619> language<00:01:53.770> but<00:01:54.220> loving<00:01:54.520> loving

language<00:01:55.509> loving<00:01:55.840> math<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.380> I<00:01:57.069> really

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
language loving math and I really

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.419 
language loving math and I really
believe<00:01:58.000> that<00:01:58.030> most<00:01:58.390> faculties<00:01:59.170> have<00:01:59.429> those

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
believe that most faculties have those

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.729 
believe that most faculties have those
kinds<00:02:00.759> of<00:02:00.819> creatively<00:02:01.299> crazy<00:02:01.689> maniacs<00:02:02.229> but

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:02.739 
kinds of creatively crazy maniacs but

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:05.819 
kinds of creatively crazy maniacs but
who<00:02:03.129> can<00:02:03.369> if<00:02:03.700> released<00:02:04.149> bring<00:02:05.049> kids<00:02:05.469> up<00:02:05.679> to

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
who can if released bring kids up to

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.309 
who can if released bring kids up to
speed<00:02:06.069> not<00:02:06.759> everybody<00:02:07.179> can<00:02:07.360> do<00:02:07.509> it<00:02:07.659> there<00:02:08.200> are

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
speed not everybody can do it there are

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.719 
speed not everybody can do it there are
some<00:02:08.500> teachers<00:02:08.679> who<00:02:08.950> are<00:02:08.979> wonderful<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:09.549> this

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
some teachers who are wonderful and this

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.970 
some teachers who are wonderful and this
one<00:02:09.940> thing<00:02:10.269> that<00:02:10.450> they<00:02:10.569> do<00:02:10.630> what<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:11.709> really

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
one thing that they do what you really

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.940 
one thing that they do what you really
want<00:02:12.340> is<00:02:12.549> a<00:02:12.880> person<00:02:13.569> who<00:02:13.600> is<00:02:13.950> Renaissance

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
want is a person who is Renaissance

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.569 
want is a person who is Renaissance
purrs<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:16.660> think<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.019> more<00:02:17.260> just<00:02:18.250> we<00:02:18.430> can

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
purrs and I think the more just we can

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.150 
purrs and I think the more just we can
grow<00:02:18.850> those<00:02:19.209> kinds<00:02:19.600> of<00:02:19.720> human<00:02:20.380> beings<00:02:20.739> with

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
grow those kinds of human beings with

back<00:03:11.340> in<00:03:11.610> his<00:03:11.790> agriculture<00:03:12.530> we<00:03:13.530> were<00:03:13.650> all

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
back in his agriculture we were all

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.250 
back in his agriculture we were all

strangers in this place except the
Native<00:03:16.530> Americans<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:18.120> think<00:03:18.390> that<00:03:18.540> we

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
Native Americans and I think that we

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.620 
Native Americans and I think that we
have<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:19.050> have<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.430> lot<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.460> focus<00:03:20.820> on<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.360> but

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
have to have a lot of focus on that but

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.170 
have to have a lot of focus on that but
a<00:03:21.660> kind<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:22.050> embracing<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:23.160> what<00:03:23.490> what

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
a kind of embracing of what what

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.660 
a kind of embracing of what what
everybody<00:03:24.540> brings<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.250> think<00:03:26.490> we're

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
everybody brings and I think we're

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.840 
everybody brings and I think we're
getting<00:03:26.940> in<00:03:27.030> kindergarten<00:03:27.780> I'm<00:03:28.490> pre-k<00:03:29.490> for

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
getting in kindergarten I'm pre-k for

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.180 
getting in kindergarten I'm pre-k for
kids<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.420> feel<00:03:30.780> good<00:03:31.170> about<00:03:31.290> themselves<00:03:31.620> and

kids to feel good about themselves and

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
to be made to think that they're smart

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.340 
to be made to think that they're smart
because<00:03:35.400> smart<00:03:35.730> starts<00:03:36.210> when<00:03:36.930> they<00:03:37.080> have<00:03:37.230> the

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
because smart starts when they have the

training other things to happen with

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.620 
training other things to happen with
kids<00:03:47.220> so<00:03:47.280> some<00:03:47.580> of<00:03:47.610> his<00:03:47.820> teacher<00:03:48.060> training

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
kids so some of his teacher training

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.510 
kids so some of his teacher training
some<00:03:49.110> of<00:03:49.230> us<00:03:49.320> looking<00:03:49.680> at<00:03:49.830> institutional

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
some of us looking at institutional

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.280 
some of us looking at institutional
kinds<00:03:50.820> of<00:03:50.940> changes<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.570> think<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.900> has<00:03:52.020> to<00:03:52.080> be

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
kinds of changes I think it has to be

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:00.230 
kinds of changes I think it has to be
made<00:03:52.500> but<00:03:53.190> it's<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.430> mindset

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.900 

I<00:04:00.860> think<00:04:03.620> there's<00:04:04.620> been<00:04:04.800> a<00:04:05.340> big<00:04:06.120> influx<00:04:06.810> of

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
I think there's been a big influx of

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.730 
I think there's been a big influx of
different<00:04:08.910> populations<00:04:09.600> in<00:04:09.930> schools<00:04:10.350> and<00:04:10.620> I

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
different populations in schools and I

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.010 
different populations in schools and I
think<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.130> that's<00:04:11.450> glorious<00:04:12.450> in<00:04:12.660> its<00:04:12.810> own

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
think that that's glorious in its own

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.850 
think that that's glorious in its own
way<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.620> has<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.220> be<00:04:15.080> certainly<00:04:16.080> attended<00:04:16.620> to

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
way and has to be certainly attended to

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.340 
way and has to be certainly attended to
in<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.310> variety<00:04:17.459> of<00:04:17.850> ways<00:04:17.940> but<00:04:18.900> I<00:04:18.930> think<00:04:19.230> it's

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
in a variety of ways but I think it's

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.900 
in a variety of ways but I think it's
wonderful<00:04:19.530> because<00:04:19.950> it<00:04:20.220> speaks<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.580> what<00:04:20.790> our

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
wonderful because it speaks to what our

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.360 
wonderful because it speaks to what our
country<00:04:21.120> is<00:04:21.330> supposed<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:22.050> be<00:04:22.500> about<00:04:22.620> the

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
country is supposed to be about the

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.960 
country is supposed to be about the
incorporation<00:04:24.030> of<00:04:24.390> that<00:04:25.580> multiple<00:04:28.760> how<00:04:29.760> can

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
incorporation of that multiple how can

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.840 
incorporation of that multiple how can
we<00:04:30.060> say<00:04:30.270> it<00:04:30.420> just<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:31.020> multiracial

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
we say it just the multiracial
