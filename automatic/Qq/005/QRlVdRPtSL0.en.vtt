00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:10.160
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.019
 mac preview presented by neu.de i 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.750
 I'm the chaos mol and I want you 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.530
 Today the new map of the winding forest 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.900
 imagine 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.749
 and of course you will now tell the 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.650
 bound reithelm new card start 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:24.800
 there's already a long time ago 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.640
 yes that's right but has enough now 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.369
 on the pda a new version of the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.050
 tied valdez and i released 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.180
 Now, first of all, I want to be very short 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.550
 show the old map 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.010
 before I change the content to new map 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.309
 change with the old card is rather like that 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.910
 that here in the north of the whole map 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.250
 Then the cancer has plus flatness later 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.649
 the kite then a special one 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.760
 donated weapons and then you have just 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:58.219
 stop in the middle of the card 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.530
 other jungle where one shares in cancer 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.539
 Find the one ep and give gold 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.870
 and of course that's very important 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.700
 is here in the middle of the map 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.870
 the ex human one year 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.470
 usually the red bach gives like 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.960
 you know that from the past and 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.450
 yes that was so far the bound 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.680
 Forest in the normal version I would 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.110
 say we change to the current one 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.440
 version over so I am now 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.870
 on the new found world map and 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.540
 I look at the map myself with san 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.550
 luis is a new patch champion if 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.890
 you have the champions sorry of 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.450
 ellis want to look at us click 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.540
 just below a video description 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.670
 on the left and yes what has 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.150
 actually bound in soon everything 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.770
 Changed now the first important thing is 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.930
 Of course the graphic covers that one 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.600
 here , however, looks quite playful 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.490
 important is the seed balcony because you 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.690
 Can not do the super vasalls anymore 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.270
 last sound then the 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.250
 Resuscitation platform pull around there 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.450
 just part of this superdome the the 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.860
 let go away 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.619
 can not bunker it anymore 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.890
 just in the beginning was the now by 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.950
 a bit defused and there is also 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.050
 new items for the bound forest to 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.200
 For example , here is this switch cap 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.930
 this replaces us with death 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.410
 and these items are also natural 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.480
 new effects or even news effects or 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.459
 also passive effects like for example 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.950
 the black fire church which is very short 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.330
 has seen or what it also shares 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.910
 What I find very funny in the 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.040
 the name says it according to van damme 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.870
 I like the name very much 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.250
 So here's also a moderate 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.620
 a lot has been done of course there is still 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.720
 a lot more items but i have them now 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.220
 first omitted and yes it has 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.980
 actually done so except the 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.069
 graphical update and the little update 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.319
 I have to say relatively to the balcony 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.110
 So first the bound forest is 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.090
 no longer in sound but just part 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.640
 now on the shadow island 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.609
 that is why graphically the im 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.709
 jungle monster something changed this 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.870
 namely a little undead now 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.910
 as you can see here are the ghosts 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.290
 become even more ghostly 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.850
 The wolves are not whole anymore 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.709
 healthy and yes you have said as the 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.440
 Middle jungle rebuilt a bit 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.120
 from the look fro sees the bushes here 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.400
 are now a bit different and 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.590
 the superficial has disappeared 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.170
 moved to the back and completely 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.150
 important here is the rapper sec 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.590
 now only one 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.510
 speed and of course 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.250
 you will ask now hey is there 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.290
 Now go 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.019
 it has now been rebuilt 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.450
 here now a bach these altars and 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.489
 if you stand on such an altar 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.389
 but take it slowly but surely for 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.849
 his team 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.829
 and if it is taken then it will 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.380
 he first closed for a moment 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.700
 he can not then for a few minutes 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.660
 be taken over again 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.239
 as you can see and then you get 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.359
 first altar a brook that one 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.280
 a lot of gold gets extra cup and what 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.379
 actually happens when you get the two 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.799
 I have claimed altars for myself 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.229
 now talk very briefly 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.090
 and most importantly, the altars are 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.590
 not immediately available from the beginning 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.129
 also take a while to get them 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.720
 because can be taken here 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:29.129
 happens the same as the first one 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.930
 is closed and can not anymore 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:33.210
 just be taken and you get 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.639
 now a creek that you also still 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.970
 Ten effects are noticed and ten 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.789
 percent more cheap image of this brook 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.020
 remains in part as long as persist 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.110
 content of one of the altars again from the 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.340
 opponent team was taken 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.169
 yes that's definitely the case first 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.650
 the big memory in the middle 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.180
 journal 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.360
 but what's more interesting is that 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.860
 northern jungle was 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.270
 namely there are there 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.490
 only one animal, namely the kite 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.300
 or rather the kites are there 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.300
 not more 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.710
 there is now a huge spider waiting 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.750
 video you just see that's because only 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.490
 because you yourself are now, so to speak 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:19.530
 spider please the baron of this card 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:25.259
 and that causes quite a bit of damage 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:27.750
 like for example some nasty tricks on it like 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:33.750
 to the now here he pretty 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:35.479
 can see that is the whole bus is not 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.409
 without 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.770
 and I will be here now too 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.050
 again 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.360
 and yes these are the big changes 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.800
 at the new card so said one has 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.460
 the northern jungle almost completely 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.139
 rausgenommen 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.330
 you have the middle journal something 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.360
 compressed together and I think the 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.289
 Change I have to say pretty well 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.000
 Just write in yours 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.759
 opinion fits in the comments below or 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.199
 from holding and yes it was already 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:03.270
 again with the map preview to the tortuous 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:06.440
 further I hope that the fallen and 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.440
 See you next time
