00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
how we were getting through this because

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.500 
how we were getting through this because
my<00:00:50.010> husband<00:00:50.309> lost<00:00:50.430> his<00:00:50.579> father<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.000> me<00:00:51.210> weeks

eventually<00:00:57.690> came<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.260> conclusion<00:00:58.770> that

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
eventually came to the conclusion that

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.299 
eventually came to the conclusion that
we<00:00:59.010> needed<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.340> do<00:00:59.609> something<00:01:00.350> with<00:01:01.350> with

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
we needed to do something with with

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
Netaji's death that meant something so

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.980 
Netaji's death that meant something so
it<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.100> wouldn't<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.549> tragedy<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.869> know

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
it just wouldn't be a tragedy you know

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.710 
it just wouldn't be a tragedy you know
just<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:07.650> sad<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.850> said<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.299> can

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
just like this is so sad we said we can

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.539 
just like this is so sad we said we can
build<00:01:09.900> something<00:01:10.229> out<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.890> because<00:01:11.130> you

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
build something out of this because you

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.630 
build something out of this because you
have<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:12.290> you<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.650> energy<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.549> you

have this you have this energy that you
don't<00:01:14.880> know<00:01:14.970> what<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:15.689> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
don't know what to do with it's a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.140 
don't know what to do with it's a
sadness<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.040> think<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.460> could<00:01:17.640> use<00:01:17.909> this

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
sadness and you think I could use this

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.330 
sadness and you think I could use this
sadness<00:01:18.540> though<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.860> could<00:01:20.100> build

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
sadness though and I could build

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.570 
sadness though and I could build
something<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:22.380> decided<00:01:22.830> then<00:01:23.250> when<00:01:23.490> we

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
something so we decided then when we

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.120 
something so we decided then when we
lived<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.850> an<00:01:23.970> hour<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.240> will<00:01:24.360> come<00:01:24.600> here<00:01:25.130> we

that they're going to actually go to
Detroit<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.780> they<00:01:40.140> don't

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
going through but they don't really

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.260 
going through but they don't really
understand<00:01:54.530> this<00:01:54.799> so<00:01:55.579> if<00:01:55.759> you<00:01:55.850> keep<00:01:56.030> listening

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270

of it but you don't have any money but

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.919 
of it but you don't have any money but
you<00:02:01.100> know<00:02:01.210> then<00:02:02.210> you'll<00:02:02.420> believe<00:02:02.539> that<00:02:02.840> you

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
you know then you'll believe that you

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:11.320 
you know then you'll believe that you
can't<00:02:03.200> do<00:02:03.409> it<00:02:08.739> in<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.979> early<00:02:10.310> 80s<00:02:10.759> we<00:02:10.940> actually

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
can't do it in the early 80s we actually

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.020 
can't do it in the early 80s we actually
had<00:02:11.540> staff<00:02:12.019> that<00:02:12.290> was<00:02:12.379> meditating<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.280> they

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
had staff that was meditating and they

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.250 
had staff that was meditating and they
just<00:02:14.209> thought<00:02:14.330> this<00:02:14.480> would<00:02:14.660> be<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.780> perfect

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
just thought this would be a perfect

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.900 
just thought this would be a perfect
place<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.440> do<00:02:15.709> it<00:02:15.739> because<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.280> didn't<00:02:16.700> have<00:02:16.730> to

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
place to do it because I didn't have to

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.059 
place to do it because I didn't have to
go<00:02:17.030> through<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.330> bureaucracy<00:02:18.049> that<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.560> might

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
go through the bureaucracy that I might

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.170 
go through the bureaucracy that I might
have<00:02:19.360> had<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.420> encounter<00:02:21.260> if<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.530> had<00:02:21.709> been<00:02:21.920> a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
have had to encounter if I had been a

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.540 
have had to encounter if I had been a
district<00:02:23.180> school
