00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 Perez 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.549
 well here we are with Adrian nothing more 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.770
 normal that each dri how are you happy 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.530
 to be here we will also have 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:18.640
 is how beautiful the project is and what color 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:21.279
 it's your funny to put on queue over 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.460
 It seemed to be a milestone polar volantÃ­n 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.110
 but it is polar if exact is micro polar and 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.619
 What is also good is that the 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.000
 not need sewing is a simple thing 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.309
 to do because you see that it is 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.470
 directly cut and sublimated is a 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.140
 pretty interesting work and already 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.559
 what are animations an output 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.660
 work and I also take to give 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.059
 thank you for your eternal signature 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.539
 because as of today he is with us 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.920
 in welcome so welcome 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.550
 eternal thank you very much for being resolved 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.070
 opening up 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.039
 yes good thank you very much thank you 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.170
 normal that as they are then what 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.839
 what we are going to do is sublimation that 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.890
 I need a common paper 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.520
 computation 80 90 grams and of course 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.509
 pencil 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.420
 for eternal sublimation in the palette with 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:19.270
 the English green color counts the line 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.640
 with 40 colors can be mixed between 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.640
 yes and we can also lighten the 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.710
 consistency with water what we are going to 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.159
 to do is a very simple design 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.530
 I'm just going to draw some lines that 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.829
 they are going to be the support guides of my 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.350
 leaves of course you can 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:41.110
 have transferred the design and 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.079
 just fill in what we're going to 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.349
 do with very loose brushstrokes are 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.840
 make this line of sheets with this 

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:52.780
 move something to keep in mind that it is 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.259
 a particularity of this painting does not 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.220
 there is white color but if we have 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:03.189
 a colorless that what it does is lower the 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.979
 intensity to color 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.890
 once we do so the line and the 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.250
 leaves let's move now to our 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.319
 flowers we wash the brush with water as 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.330
 everything we use with this painting 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.510
 that can be cleaned 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.569
 with water and with the red color of cadmium 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.829
 let's start 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:30.209
 to simulate roses simply with 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:33.329
 very loose brushstrokes giving it different 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.569
 guidance for when 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:40.500
 ironing is not always the same design 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:44.069
 as you can see the painting flows with a lot 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.510
 ease something to keep in mind when 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:51.540
 we iron the color changes 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.689
 varies by the heat effect of the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.909
 iron then it is convenient to paper 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.500
 write down the color that we use because 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.409
 once we iron it we are not going to 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.949
 know exactly what color it is once 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:07.859
 that we do so several papers we leave 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:10.260
 dry very well and let's move on to what 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:14.209
 It's the iron 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:19.349
 the iron is a common household iron 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:23.150
 Dry without steam the fabric in this case 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.079
 polar is a polar micro is a fine polar 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.799
 always the fabric has to have 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:31.500
 polyester 70% polyester in this case 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.140
 This fabric contains acrylic and it is also 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.840
 possible to sublimate what we need 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.840
 then it is the paper is very dry that 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.319
 As you can see, I made several papers because 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.810
 time to stamp we need to have 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:49.549
 papers with dry paint to be able 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:53.639
 design we put the dry paper guide 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:57.239
 iron with a medium temperature like 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:59.659
 to start and we need pressure and 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.980
 heat I will raise the temperature a little 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:07.400
 and I'm going to see if he has stamped 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.220
 I want it to be stronger then I go 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.709
 to put the iron and I'm going to delay 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.580
 a little bit more but how will they realize 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:19.390
 this is instantaneous 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.790
 then this is the guide of the leaves and 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:25.300
 What I'm going to do now is put the 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.310
 flowers like I have the leaf made with 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.260
 these flowers I can not stamp the 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.550
 directly because I would go the place that I 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.130
 I do not want then that's why I have 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.430
 cut the papers to be able to locate 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.200
 in the place that I want the flower for 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.300
 Of course, in this way I can not 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.900
 place the iron because then yes 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.620
 I would burn the web I should always have a 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:54.550
 paper that I put on the paper that is 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:58.870
 painted iron and supported again 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:02.470
 with pressure and heat we are going to stamp 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.020
 our rose observed without lifting 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.940
 I want stronger left the iron for 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.520
 Of course this technique always 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.800
 can do because I have the paint for 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.220
 sublimate of eternal 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.550
 in this way on the dry paint that 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.849
 I have the paper I'm going to pass to the canvas 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:27.180
 by means of a heat source 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:30.150
 I return to support the plate moving it 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:34.919
 and if it does not sublimate it is because it lacks heat 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:37.860
 I stop a minute I raise and so I go 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:41.639
 forming my design at this time the 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:45.330
 design that has this is already a guide to 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:48.630
 leaves with flowers but I could do 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:53.060
 something random is to say placed another 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:55.740
 paper and I'm going to generate a print 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.789
 so it's a good proposal because 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:02.580
 I can also stamp the fabrics 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:05.880
 thus generating different designs in this 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:09.020
 case I made a guide with flowers but 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:12.660
 it could also be a floral print 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:16.550
 then I use another one of my 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:20.360
 roses and supporting the paper 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:22.820
 We transfer 40 colors to the fabric 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:27.080
 can mix together very colors 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:29.969
 bright that change their color a little 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.509
 by the effect of heat 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:37.649
 so always moving to give it 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:41.219
 movement to this line so simple 

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:45.610
 like this is sublimation simply 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:49.419
 a paper iron and paint 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:53.770
 this standard prices of course that as 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:55.840
 you'll see the texture does not change 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.569
 it is directly we can put it in the 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.250
 washing machine and the paint is left 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:02.740
 unalterable 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:05.439
 very nice is interesting is a good 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.599
 exit and it is also fast and clean and 

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:10.180
 clean and very clean very much because there 

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:12.099
 stains the fabric instead in this way 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.930
 paint the papers dry if they achieve 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:15.849
 but doing it in Polish that usually 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.400
 one believes since polar could not be put 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:21.069
 the iron over me that's why we use 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.650
 the clear micro ocular or calculate what is 

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:25.210
 very thick if you use it could sublimate 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.139
 but what happens is the effect of 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.139
 the clear iron 

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:38.169
 good project the next standard thank you 

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:42.569
 all good and now we continue with Jorge 

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:42.569
