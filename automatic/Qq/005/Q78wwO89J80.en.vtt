00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:09.190
 I would like to try on the Mazda Axela Hybrid today 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:13.209
 jc 08 mode fuel consumption is 10.8 k 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:16.770
 It's a pretty good number . How is your sense of driving ? 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.770
 Let's actually run 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:41.470
 It is a driving sense of the Axela hybrid, but quite 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:44.710
 It is this Axela hybrid that there is an impression close to Prius 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:48.110
 Back system of pulleys thin 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:53.870
 It is called like ths ii though 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:58.640
 This is called Mazda 's 2 liter skyactiv g 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:02.210
 It's a gasoline engine united 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.880
 And the highest output figures 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.440
 Maximum torque value 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.659
 What is exactly the same bet that including up to rotation speed 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.329
 That is good 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:19.350
 As a developer of Mazda receiving the supply of ths ii from Toyota 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:25.370
 At the time there active g power 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:30.140
 It is such a unit that all adjusted and united 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:35.930
 So it seems that I have struggled to develop this 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.120
 From the user's point of view, it's all the other way around, so what about driving? 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.590
 It will be 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:47.480
 As so will you when the power performance even as I mentioned earlier is 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:52.520
 I think that the driving feeling is almost the same in the same country as it is the same as the group 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:56.480
 Speaking to fit the capacity performance to the normal type of gasoline engine 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.920
 a but not as much as 2.4 liters 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:05.420
 You have the power of a Marnie weather-liter class 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.720
 And one more thing that I think is well done like Axela I think that's the brake 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.750
 It is a feeling 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:16.260
 Hybrid vehicles are used for driving when the accelerator is released or the plate is braked . 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:21.030
 Generate electricity with the motor and 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:26.710
 Because it does the thing that the battery battery for drive addition and the previous term are stored, how is ordinary 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.790
 So so but the car felt the braking is changed 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.579
 the japan 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.579
 In this heat, the wedding is held down considerably 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:55.879
 Buber true how 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:03:00.400
 Think of Masser's concept of " Good Star Heights " 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:03.640
 I think Fu that I wish I wonder become the world feeling 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:09.280
 Though it is driving sense other than that 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:13.700
 Because the base is Axela, the feeling of operation etc is quite accurate. 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:18.110
 Because you want to react fairly exactly if you want a fairly small 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:24.349
 When it is easy to do it, it will be handled like the wind 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:28.470
 Things force is happy Hey tatami Japanese-style because it reflects the movement of the car also Appendix cheese 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:33.900
 It seems like an interview properly 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:37.480
 Then I'm cornering, but this is the case of the acceleration of yeah 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:42.010
 There is pretty grade equipped with 18 inches tire 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:48.510
 But it has a sporty image It is the per is still quiet slightly 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:53.040
 The ear that has been worn is 16 days and the Fujita type in adolescence 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:57.480
 Because I am installed, so much I can not say Iguchi is shaking high 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:04.019
 However, since such as the rigidity of the body has been built properly 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:08.500
 Fun to drive in the sense that because I finished in the Well in short good car of the running of identity 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:11.550
 That 's enough there is that it is driving stability play 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:18.290
 2 a rear wheel also firm and even die 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.290
 Dissatisfaction has a phone-like impression when driving Emma without feeling so much 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:43.050
 I'm going to see another world in a different world. 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:44.430
 From now on, various variations are added and the hybrid world is also fun 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.700
 I wish I could get it 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.700
 It is one hybrid that is the that makes you feel that way
