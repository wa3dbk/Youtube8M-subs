additions<00:07:17.490> overall<00:07:17.880> i<00:07:18.030> was<00:07:18.240> going<00:07:18.480> to<00:07:18.540> go<00:07:18.690> for

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:18.930 
additions overall i was going to go for

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.690 
additions overall i was going to go for
something<00:07:19.140> a<00:07:19.350> bit<00:07:19.380> portuguese<00:07:20.040> heavy<00:07:20.430> based

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:20.700 
something a bit portuguese heavy based

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.340 
something a bit portuguese heavy based
on<00:07:20.880> the<00:07:21.000> earlier<00:07:21.240> practice<00:07:21.570> but<00:07:21.750> i<00:07:21.930> just<00:07:22.170> have

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.350 
on the earlier practice but i just have

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.770 
on the earlier practice but i just have
to<00:07:22.500> try<00:07:22.710> out<00:07:22.860> Benzema<00:07:23.310> deny<00:07:23.550> i<00:07:23.760> think<00:07:24.630> that's

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 
to try out Benzema deny i think that's

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.330 
to try out Benzema deny i think that's
