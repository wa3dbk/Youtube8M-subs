00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.810 
killer toy and I've got the the actual a
new<00:00:57.239> prototype<00:00:57.720> there<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:59.100> very<00:00:59.280> realistic

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
new prototype there the very realistic

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.119 
new prototype there the very realistic
was<00:00:59.939> going<00:01:00.330> and<00:01:00.479> very<00:01:00.960> realistic<00:01:01.650> for<00:01:01.769> a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
was going and very realistic for a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.560 
was going and very realistic for a
really<00:01:02.790> great<00:01:03.000> AI<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.720> and<00:01:04.549> so<00:01:05.549> failing<00:01:06.450> us

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
really great AI in it and so failing us

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.969 
really great AI in it and so failing us
for<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.810> first<00:01:07.020> time<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.530> Michael
