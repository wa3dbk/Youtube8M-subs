00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
will start with a blank white paper and

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.930 
will start with a blank white paper and
you<00:01:30.960> stop<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.860> leave<00:01:32.040> your<00:01:32.190> white<00:01:32.400> gaps<00:01:32.670> and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
then you add the darker colors so we're

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.120
