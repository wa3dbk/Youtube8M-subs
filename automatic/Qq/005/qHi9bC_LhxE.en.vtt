 battlefields for daredevils and his enemies 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:37.980
 everybody likes to compare years 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.170

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.220
 many of my friends did not believe that this 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.200
 district exists in reality because of 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.640
 his unusual name for this moment 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.950
 worth staying more 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.810
 the fact is that for hundreds of years 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.790

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.189
 twentieth century authorities introduced another 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.409

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.720
