00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
using this for us distance it won't

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.620 
using this for us distance it won't
deposit<00:03:13.690> too<00:03:14.050> much<00:03:14.260> color<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.100> don't<00:03:15.310> go

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
deposit too much color so you don't go

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.850 
deposit too much color so you don't go
too<00:03:16.630> overboard<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:20.140> then<00:03:20.320> i'm<00:03:20.560> just<00:03:20.590> gonna

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
too overboard so then i'm just gonna

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.270 
too overboard so then i'm just gonna
blend<00:03:21.610> it<00:03:21.850> out

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.430 

for<00:03:27.280> dates<00:03:27.610> I<00:03:27.970> think<00:03:28.300> it's<00:03:28.720> probably<00:03:28.870> best<00:03:29.260> to

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
for dates I think it's probably best to

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.190 
for dates I think it's probably best to
avoid<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:30.130> right<00:03:30.820> red<00:03:31.150> lip<00:03:31.420> or<00:03:31.720> anything<00:03:32.020> too

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
avoid the right red lip or anything too

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.360 
avoid the right red lip or anything too
bold<00:03:32.470> or<00:03:32.620> anything<00:03:32.890> that<00:03:33.010> should<00:03:33.130> have<00:03:33.280> to

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
bold or anything that should have to

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.670 
bold or anything that should have to
worry<00:03:33.550> about<00:03:33.670> reapplying<00:03:34.290> she<00:03:35.290> still<00:03:35.500> has<00:03:35.650> a

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
worry about reapplying she still has a

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.010 
worry about reapplying she still has a
little<00:03:35.830> bit<00:03:36.040> of<00:03:36.100> lip<00:03:36.430> balm<00:03:36.700> there<00:03:37.390> so<00:03:37.750> I'm<00:03:37.840> just

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
little bit of lip balm there so I'm just

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.750 
little bit of lip balm there so I'm just
going<00:03:38.140> to<00:03:38.200> use<00:03:38.320> a<00:03:38.350> lip<00:03:38.530> pencil<00:03:38.710> just<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.610> add

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
going to use a lip pencil just to add

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.550 
going to use a lip pencil just to add
some<00:03:39.790> color<00:03:42.060> okay<00:03:43.060> so<00:03:43.120> that's<00:03:43.360> it<00:03:43.600> so<00:03:44.380> this

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
some color okay so that's it so this

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.830 
some color okay so that's it so this
would<00:03:44.740> be<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.100> nice<00:03:45.430> simple<00:03:45.790> classic<00:03:46.630> date

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840
