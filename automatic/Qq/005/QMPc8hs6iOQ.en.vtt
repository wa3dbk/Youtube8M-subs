floors<00:00:10.250> if<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.429> had<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.760> to<00:00:11.880> do<00:00:12.000> all<00:00:12.030> over<00:00:12.179> again

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
floors if I had it to do all over again

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.169 
floors if I had it to do all over again
I<00:00:12.660> would<00:00:12.990> definitely<00:00:13.259> not<00:00:13.740> have<00:00:13.920> tried<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.400> and

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
I would definitely not have tried it and

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.710 
I would definitely not have tried it and
I'll<00:00:15.330> tell<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:15.599> why<00:00:16.069> I<00:00:17.269> prepped<00:00:18.269> this<00:00:18.449> floor<00:00:18.689> I

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
I'll tell you why I prepped this floor I

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.839 
I'll tell you why I prepped this floor I
took<00:00:19.140> me<00:00:19.289> three<00:00:19.529> gallons<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.009> stripper<00:00:20.339> in<00:00:20.550> 12

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:20.849 
took me three gallons of stripper in 12

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:22.550 
took me three gallons of stripper in 12
hours<00:00:21.149> or<00:00:21.269> pressure<00:00:21.539> washing<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.140> get<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.409> old

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
hours or pressure washing to get the old

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.450 
hours or pressure washing to get the old
coat<00:00:22.859> off<00:00:23.119> so<00:00:24.119> if<00:00:24.239> you<00:00:24.359> look<00:00:24.539> at<00:00:24.659> the<00:00:24.810> ends<00:00:25.460> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
coat off so if you look at the ends the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.919 
coat off so if you look at the ends the
side<00:00:26.729> and<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.089> front<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.419> the<00:00:27.479> garage<00:00:27.599> you'll

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:27.929 
side and the front of the garage you'll

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.290 
side and the front of the garage you'll
see<00:00:28.109> where<00:00:28.259> it's<00:00:28.380> darker<00:00:28.849> well<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:30.089> reading

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
see where it's darker well in reading

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.770 
see where it's darker well in reading
the<00:00:31.460> directions<00:00:32.460> on<00:00:32.850> here<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.149> mean<00:00:33.359> they<00:00:33.570> talk

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
the directions on here I mean they talk

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.569 
the directions on here I mean they talk
about<00:00:33.929> humidity<00:00:34.469> parameters<00:00:35.280> and

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
about humidity parameters and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.830 
about humidity parameters and
temperature<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.179> all<00:00:36.269> that<00:00:36.420> kind<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.750> stuff

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
temperature and all that kind of stuff

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.810 
temperature and all that kind of stuff
and<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.859> where<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.129> think<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.460> got<00:00:38.640> screwed

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
and this is where I think I got screwed

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.910 
and this is where I think I got screwed
and<00:00:39.179> I<00:00:39.269> figured<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.719> out<00:00:39.809> based<00:00:40.199> on<00:00:40.410> talking<00:00:40.710> to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
and I figured it out based on talking to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.430 
and I figured it out based on talking to
one<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.190> their<00:00:41.309> tech<00:00:41.550> reps<00:00:41.820> I've<00:00:42.809> been<00:00:42.989> trying

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
one to their tech reps I've been trying

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.279 
one to their tech reps I've been trying
to<00:00:43.500> dry<00:00:43.769> this<00:00:44.039> for<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> week<00:00:44.519> first<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.629> use<00:00:45.839> fans

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
to dry this for a week first I use fans

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.650 
to dry this for a week first I use fans
then<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.309> use<00:00:47.579> some<00:00:47.789> heat<00:00:47.999> and<00:00:48.239> then<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.449> got<00:00:48.629> a

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
then I use some heat and then I got a

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.270 
then I use some heat and then I got a
dehumidifier<00:00:49.589> and<00:00:51.409> dehumidified<00:00:52.409> it<00:00:52.620> to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
dehumidifier and dehumidified it to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.739 
dehumidifier and dehumidified it to
where<00:00:53.519> the<00:00:53.670> air<00:00:53.850> was<00:00:54.089> just<00:00:54.390> 30<00:00:54.659> percent

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:54.749 
where the air was just 30 percent

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:57.020 
where the air was just 30 percent
relative<00:00:55.230> humidity<00:00:55.499> was<00:00:56.010> super<00:00:56.489> dry<00:00:56.670> didn't

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
relative humidity was super dry didn't

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.819 
relative humidity was super dry didn't
do<00:00:57.089> any<00:00:57.210> good<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.659> didn't<00:00:58.350> think<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.620> was<00:00:58.739> going

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
do any good I didn't think it was going

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.349 
do any good I didn't think it was going
to<00:00:58.890> work<00:00:59.069> because<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.429> was<00:00:59.550> epoxy<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.269> was

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
to work because it was epoxy but it was

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.270 
to work because it was epoxy but it was
worth<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.690> try<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.019> the<00:01:01.230> first<00:01:01.499> tech<00:01:01.800> rep<00:01:02.069> that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
worth a try and the first tech rep that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.609 
worth a try and the first tech rep that
I<00:01:02.309> spoke<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.989> thought<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.259> it<00:01:04.439> would

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
I spoke to thought that it would

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.969 
I spoke to thought that it would
eventually<00:01:05.540> perhaps<00:01:06.540> get<00:01:07.049> harder<00:01:07.470> which<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
eventually perhaps get harder which I

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.010 
eventually perhaps get harder which I
don't<00:01:08.040> really<00:01:08.250> get<00:01:08.579> so<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.479> got<00:01:09.689> off<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
don't really get so I just got off the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.389 
don't really get so I just got off the
phone<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.290> these<00:01:10.530> people<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.159> realized

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
phone with these people and I realized

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.030 
phone with these people and I realized
that<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.540> reason<00:01:12.899> this<00:01:12.990> came<00:01:13.259> out<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.680> shitty

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
that the reason this came out so shitty

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.910 
that the reason this came out so shitty
was<00:01:14.369> because<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> followed<00:01:15.210> their<00:01:15.360> directions

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
was because I followed their directions

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.999 
was because I followed their directions
if<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.130> look<00:01:17.399> here<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.799> directions<00:01:19.799> for

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
if you look here on the directions for

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.010 
if you look here on the directions for
this<00:01:20.130> epoxy<00:01:23.180> you'll<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.450> here<00:01:24.750> where<00:01:24.899> they

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
this epoxy you'll see here where they

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.039 
this epoxy you'll see here where they
talked<00:01:25.290> about<00:01:25.469> drying<00:01:25.979> times<00:01:26.479> if<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.659> look<00:01:27.869> at

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
talked about drying times if you look at

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.560 
talked about drying times if you look at
the<00:01:28.170> temperatures<00:01:28.710> 71<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> 80<00:01:29.670> they<00:01:30.060> suggest

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
the temperatures 71 to 80 they suggest

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.469 
the temperatures 71 to 80 they suggest
start<00:01:30.869> trimming<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.439> edges<00:01:31.640> 10<00:01:32.640> minutes

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
start trimming the edges 10 minutes

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.569 
start trimming the edges 10 minutes
after<00:01:33.810> mixing<00:01:34.079> well<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> reason<00:01:35.219> for<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.430> is

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
after mixing well the reason for that is

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.980 
after mixing well the reason for that is
because<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.880> epoxy<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.689> chemical

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
because it's epoxy and it's a chemical

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.380 
because it's epoxy and it's a chemical
reaction<00:01:37.250> here's<00:01:38.250> what<00:01:38.520> screwed<00:01:38.880> me<00:01:39.060> if<00:01:39.270> you

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
reaction here's what screwed me if you

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.660 
reaction here's what screwed me if you
look<00:01:39.600> below<00:01:39.960> there<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.469> says<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
look below there it says it's the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.840 
look below there it says it's the
temperature<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.299> 81<00:01:42.719> to<00:01:42.990> 85<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:44.310> temperature

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
temperature is 81 to 85 the temperature

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.330 
temperature is 81 to 85 the temperature
was<00:01:45.060> 81<00:01:45.719> to<00:01:45.869> 85<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.859> see<00:01:47.100> where<00:01:47.250> it

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
was 81 to 85 and if you see where it

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.969 
was 81 to 85 and if you see where it
says<00:01:47.579> start<00:01:47.909> brushing<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:49.289> says<00:01:49.590> immediately

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
says start brushing it says immediately

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.359 
says start brushing it says immediately
after<00:01:50.369> mixing<00:01:50.899> well<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.170> look<00:01:52.439> if<00:01:52.710> where<00:01:53.340> I

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
after mixing well if you look if where I

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.789 
after mixing well if you look if where I
had<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.789> problem<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:55.259> followed<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
had the problem is I followed the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.550 
had the problem is I followed the
directions<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.399> was<00:01:56.579> 81<00:01:57.030> degrees<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.659> I

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
directions it was 81 degrees and I

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.810 
directions it was 81 degrees and I
started<00:01:59.750> painting<00:02:00.750> around<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.229> edges

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
started painting around the edges

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.669 
started painting around the edges
immediately<00:02:02.899> after<00:02:03.899> really<00:02:04.109> mixing<00:02:04.590> it

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
immediately after really mixing it

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:05.990 
immediately after really mixing it
through<00:02:04.859> well<00:02:05.100> that's<00:02:05.250> what<00:02:05.460> screwed<00:02:05.700> me

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
through well that's what screwed me

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.240 
through well that's what screwed me
because<00:02:06.960> with<00:02:07.200> those<00:02:07.409> what<00:02:07.890> they

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
because with those what they

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.390 
because with those what they
in<00:02:08.640> these<00:02:08.790> directions<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.680> that<00:02:10.680> it's<00:02:11.009> ten

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
in these directions is that it's ten

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.520 
in these directions is that it's ten
minutes<00:02:11.580> if<00:02:11.910> it's<00:02:12.090> 80<00:02:12.270> degrees<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.050> start

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
minutes if it's 80 degrees and start

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.370 
minutes if it's 80 degrees and start
immediately<00:02:14.040> if<00:02:14.250> it's<00:02:14.400> 81<00:02:14.810> so<00:02:15.810> in<00:02:16.020> hindsight

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
immediately if it's 81 so in hindsight

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.980 
immediately if it's 81 so in hindsight
what<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:16.830> should<00:02:17.160> have<00:02:17.190> done<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.720> should<00:02:18.960> have

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
what I should have done is I should have

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.420 
what I should have done is I should have
given<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.350> five<00:02:19.530> minutes<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.220> wouldn't

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
given it five minutes and I wouldn't

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.920 
given it five minutes and I wouldn't
have<00:02:20.550> had<00:02:20.610> any<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.090> problems<00:02:21.510> but<00:02:21.720> that's

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
have had any of this problems but that's

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.500 
have had any of this problems but that's
not<00:02:22.140> what<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.410> direction<00:02:22.890> said<00:02:23.510> it's

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
not what the direction said it's

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.380 
not what the direction said it's
interesting<00:02:24.960> with<00:02:25.470> only<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.800> degree<00:02:26.040> off<00:02:26.430> they

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
interesting with only a degree off they

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.450 
interesting with only a degree off they
claim<00:02:27.660> no<00:02:27.870> time<00:02:28.170> or<00:02:28.380> ten<00:02:28.560> minutes<00:02:28.890> ridiculous

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
claim no time or ten minutes ridiculous

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.240 
claim no time or ten minutes ridiculous
so<00:02:30.210> I've<00:02:30.390> spent<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.140> week<00:02:31.350> decking<00:02:31.830> around<00:02:32.100> with

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
so I've spent a week decking around with

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.180 
so I've spent a week decking around with
this<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.670> just<00:02:33.180> talked<00:02:33.780> with<00:02:34.050> them<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.440> they

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
this I just talked with them and they

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.100 
this I just talked with them and they
say<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.820> have<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.300> scrape<00:02:36.810> off<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.590> tacky<00:02:37.950> edge

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
say I have to scrape off this tacky edge

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.830 
say I have to scrape off this tacky edge
to<00:02:40.110> reapply<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.530> second<00:02:41.010> coat<00:02:41.330> so<00:02:42.330> it's<00:02:42.630> been<00:02:42.810> a

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
to reapply a second coat so it's been a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.470 
to reapply a second coat so it's been a
total<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.470> complete<00:02:43.500> pain<00:02:44.220> in<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.910> ass<00:02:45.090> I've

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
total and complete pain in the ass I've

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.060 
total and complete pain in the ass I've
got<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.370> well<00:02:47.370> 12<00:02:47.850> hours<00:02:48.180> pressure<00:02:48.540> washing<00:02:49.070> two

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
got a well 12 hours pressure washing two

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.510 
got a well 12 hours pressure washing two
hours<00:02:50.430> paintin<00:02:51.080> took<00:02:52.080> me<00:02:52.230> forever<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.740> three

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
hours paintin took me forever to three

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.740 
hours paintin took me forever to three
gallons<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:54.060> stripper<00:02:55.490> us<00:02:56.490> I<00:02:56.850> would<00:02:57.209> wish<00:02:57.600> I

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
gallons of stripper us I would wish I

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.840 
gallons of stripper us I would wish I
would<00:02:57.930> have<00:02:58.050> never<00:02:58.170> used<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.830> they<00:02:59.700> give

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
would have never used it and they give

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.360 
would have never used it and they give
you<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.000> DVD<00:03:00.420> as<00:03:00.870> far<00:03:01.170> as<00:03:01.320> an<00:03:01.560> application<00:03:02.250> which

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
you a DVD as far as an application which

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.480 
you a DVD as far as an application which
is<00:03:02.520> absolutely<00:03:03.270> worthless<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:04.400> don't<00:03:05.400> even

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
is absolutely worthless I don't even

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.120 
is absolutely worthless I don't even
know<00:03:05.670> why<00:03:05.820> they<00:03:05.880> include<00:03:06.360> in<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.600> kit<00:03:06.690> I

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
know why they include in the kit I

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.490 
know why they include in the kit I
followed<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.250> directions<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:08.970> tee<00:03:09.270> and<00:03:10.020> now

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
followed the directions to a tee and now

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.570 
followed the directions to a tee and now
I'm<00:03:10.650> getting<00:03:10.920> down<00:03:11.070> where<00:03:11.310> I'm<00:03:11.370> going<00:03:11.520> to

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
I'm getting down where I'm going to

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.150 
I'm getting down where I'm going to
screw<00:03:11.850> around<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.360> do<00:03:12.630> some<00:03:12.870> half-ass<00:03:13.440> job<00:03:13.470> of

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
screw around and do some half-ass job of

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.790 
screw around and do some half-ass job of
stripping<00:03:14.700> what<00:03:15.000> I've<00:03:15.150> tried<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.290> get<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.560> dry

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
stripping what I've tried to get to dry

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.460 
stripping what I've tried to get to dry
for<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.070> week<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:17.670> my<00:03:18.420> recommendation<00:03:19.290> would<00:03:19.410> be

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
for a week so my recommendation would be

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.360 
for a week so my recommendation would be
to<00:03:19.620> not<00:03:19.980> use<00:03:20.340> rust-oleum<00:03:21.709> epoxy<00:03:22.709> field<00:03:22.980> for

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
to not use rust-oleum epoxy field for

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.870 
to not use rust-oleum epoxy field for
our<00:03:23.459> garage<00:03:23.640> floor<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.180> think<00:03:24.330> it<00:03:24.570> sucks
