00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello world is past 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.759
 find in a new tutorial is 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.330
 as you guessed this tutorial 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.740
 so how to make chopsticks 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.520
 so it's like these are there that 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.449
 can accommodate that the other one is a 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.029
 bun like that 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:26.539
 dolby like that it's all simple 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.539
 but what are you 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.110
 So here we go so we're going 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:41.820
 start with the material you have 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:46.140
 need me I do it now I have 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:50.730
 same time to do two films before 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:55.170
 at the light green wood camp but you 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.750
 can also take sara according to your 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.239
 ambitions for me personally I 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:05.449
 prefer to take circles 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.449
 I had already opened I bought 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:18.420
 so you dry pastel so I took so 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.350
 two colors super known so the yellow 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.360
 clear and the English red but not 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.689
 see it's so it's not you have to red 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:37.430
 it's no it's more like brown marot 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:40.829
 orange is good that I call cotton 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.150
 as well as a knife some of which 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.170
 knives frankly it's better during 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.170
 scalpel for himself 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:55.460
 tutorial there I want to take a bit so 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.670
 I will show you in the how 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.240
 make the slightest escape and peace cooked 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:07.910
 to sting you after the bread 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.520
 I 'll do the tutorial so we already 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.110
 talk to them a little beautiful you see 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.050
 expect you show them so the prices 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:21.260
 I took a new like that it was 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.650
 parking so here you do something 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
 like that 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.230
 then you want both chimou the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.830
 wanted to flip to the side for that 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.830
 stay like that 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.700
 the fines here and wanted or the 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.810
 long by the way you make a wand 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.700
 in fact a thurlbeck attack is in 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.070
 do so you make their intentions 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.510
 only one phase is flat so 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.310
 you do how do you take so 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.310
 your knife and you do like that 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.160
 I do that the side there because my 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:09.140
 knife a big 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.140
 So basically as is France 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:19.920
 so that's it fun a little trick 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.739
 like that so you can do them at 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:30.360
 finger if you prefer me I'm fine 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:32.069
 the roundness sugar soup then so 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:40.940
 of course you take your character 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:40.940
 pastel forgiveness you scratch both 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:49.200
 Saudi reprimanding those outside 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:04:02.400
 I personally prefer to take 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:04:04.290
 of cotton and you eat so think well 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.560
 obviously you take your time 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:13.530
 can recover a little father from 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:15.930
 arouse sure too soon and so you 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.489
 put a little bit on top 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.380
 so be careful you have to 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.020
 the body you scratch there is more than 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.330
 you started scratching the yellow in 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:35.340
 first that is, there will be more 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:39.690
 of yellow then in the scratching of the 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.900
 red you made two small 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.840
 parties on a part you put so 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.160
 missed a few things 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.780
 really a little bit and especially 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.800
 you scratch a little bit 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.370
 I think you see there it's a 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:01.950
 little more and here it's really all 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:04.240
 start with the a little bit more 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.960
 play closely how to say and you so 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.820
 put on the sides roughly you 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:16.840
 start with the darker you 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:19.510
 put on the side the less the bottom the 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.960
 less French walleye actually say one 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:26.560
 puts more people at least 2 to 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.020
 pigmenter more his name and then we 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.640
 you see been more crazy that's really 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:35.590
 against slightly on the sides so that 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.010
 it gives a much more bronze effect 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.750
 have put or there a little more so darken 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:48.310
 on the sides to really put 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:50.980
 slightly on the top one like that 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:54.580
 so where it looks like it's yellow 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:59.650
 completely when it seems that 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:09.580
 it's shon full orange concert 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:19.330
 super nice it's weird sorry 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:21.600
 colors are not at all the same as 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.600
 Earth 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.500
 that's a long time ago that I think it's 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.100
 beautiful then so you see well your 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.270
 knife is super important 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.310
 then so instead of taking this 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.650
 part there you know part there and 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:45.790
 you cut so you can not you 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:47.710
 just make ea marks because 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:54.250
 it's better to take that side because 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:57.300
 it's thicker it's prettier 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:02.260
 you can do that if you wish 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:06.670
 win his head anyway 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:08.470
 more effect that's the wand 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.260
 then you have to desire so here we go 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.840
 still a little bit and you put it slightly 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:22.690
 inside the cru for it to be 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:27.160
 more realistic one way there if you want 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:30.520
 more cooked put more simply and 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:33.780
 so for that also present makes the same 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:36.010
 operation you cut in half like that 

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:39.010
 but except that you are doing fit 

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:42.310
 there will be made a killing of a second 

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:47.650
 or so you are like these as 

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:49.300
 that if it's like that it's just too much 

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:52.530
 too cute I think I'm going in 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.530
 do it because here I have three chopsticks 

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.740
 here you have ideas of how 

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.870
 what could I do with 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.280
 do not hesitate to I 

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:07.080
 religion I hope this video you 

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.080
 will have rain and lease
