last<00:01:25.860> year<00:01:26.070> good<00:01:26.340> gameplay<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.479> got<00:01:27.659> some

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
last year good gameplay so I got some

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.990 
last year good gameplay so I got some
new<00:01:27.930> batteries<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.560> put<00:01:28.680> him<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.700> guess

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
new batteries and put him in and guess

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.670 
new batteries and put him in and guess
what<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.450> him<00:01:30.630> actually<00:01:30.869> works<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.439> little<00:01:31.590> bit

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
what to him actually works a little bit

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.890 
what to him actually works a little bit
after<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.340> all<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> sudden<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.150> put<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
after that and all of a sudden I put the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.740 
after that and all of a sudden I put the
controller<00:01:34.259> down<00:01:34.320> for<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> bit<00:01:35.119> so<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> had<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.570> go

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
controller down for a bit so I had to go

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.140 
controller down for a bit so I had to go
get<00:01:37.409> something<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.040> then<00:01:38.369> all<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.700> sudden<00:01:38.729> I
