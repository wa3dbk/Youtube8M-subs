00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.570
 hello everyone this is fabien I you 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:15.519
 found today for a whole 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.320
 new compilation of an iphone game on 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.509
 the multiplayer of call of duty black ops 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.910
 so after the map after maths that's 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.660
 on the drones map to pass 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.460
 so on naive lunge simply 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.310
 there are 3 on this map so three 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.390
 relatively simple except the 3rd naive 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.940
 lunge then I will introduce you to a 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.250
 very small the edge quite fun so 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.019
 it's just a tiny bonus so 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.300
 your buddy to position himself at this 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.989
 place so go back or face you 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.460
 only change nothing you 're going to run 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.649
 given a stab so it costs the 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.600
 combat or ballistic knives and in 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.309
 the stride arm yourself your tomahawk or 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.829
 your c4 so an equipment of 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.600
 preference that does not explode so that 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.160
 you can resume again in 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.710
 your hand because otherwise you will have to 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.989
 start again each time to reach 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.149
 small edge that are pretty fun at 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.259
 clap most are useless unless 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.390
 you never want to use it to 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.190
 your montages for example so led 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.200
 which are pretty high or led ge 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.970
 simply inaccessible in time 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.470
 normal to be able to do your tricks 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.050
 shot or anything to you 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.970
 find of utility personally I the 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.160
 do it only by passion it's just 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.349
 simply very very fun ii 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.789
 to access places where do we 

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:26.020
 can not normally access the 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.970
 never again do you have two three friends 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.500
 in the part I can guarantee you that 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.599
 adds little spice to all this 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.640
 so here is a second tie flunch so 

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:35.739
 this one is also very very simple 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.289
 your teammate so get placed in the 

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:40.660
 corner of the small room with the tarpaulin 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.880
 blue on it then you make the naive 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.229
 lunge simply so the third 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.880
 iphone edge is a bit more complicated 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.560
 because in fact your teammate is going to have to 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.780
 to be well placed one that is going 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.340
 absolutely do everything so in fact there 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.780
 really have to place themselves as 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.239
 on the video we it seems to me that 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.679
 it's really at the end of the song 

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:58.479
 which is on the desktop so 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.369
 you're currently seeing on the screen and 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.869
 so just go back 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.239
 you will run that you are arming yourself 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.220
 your throwing knife or other c4 and 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:08.560
 you are going to land on this place so 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.750
 half or a gap in the rails at 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.980
 above the door 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.080
 so here are the friends I'll leave you 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.280
 on a very small secret spot in 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.270
 hoping these videos you and more 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.950
 you will be back very soon 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.950
 wear well and see you next time 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.630
 we had
