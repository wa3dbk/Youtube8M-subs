like<00:01:52.290> Mortal<00:01:52.619> Kombat<00:01:52.950> back<00:01:53.159> into<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
like Mortal Kombat back into the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.270 
like Mortal Kombat back into the
mainstream<00:01:54.049> so<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.080> think<00:01:55.229> that's<00:01:56.189> an

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
mainstream so I think that's an

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.859 
mainstream so I think that's an
interesting<00:01:56.670> story<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.150> it<00:01:57.210> turns<00:01:57.450> out<00:01:57.630> also

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
interesting story and it turns out also

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.710 
interesting story and it turns out also

generating our generating numbers that

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.569 
generating our generating numbers that
are<00:02:15.750> competitive<00:02:16.319> with<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.189> type<00:02:17.430> of

are competitive with the type of

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.670 
are competitive with the type of
demographic<00:02:17.849> programming<00:02:18.689> you'd<00:02:18.810> see<00:02:19.019> in
