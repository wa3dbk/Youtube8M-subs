of taking over New York City what was
that<00:04:34.180> like<00:04:34.360> obviously<00:04:35.200> it's<00:04:35.350> you<00:04:35.890> know<00:04:35.920> a

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
that like obviously it's you know a

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.860 
that like obviously it's you know a
unique<00:04:36.490> experience<00:04:36.970> for<00:04:37.270> people<00:04:37.390> to<00:04:37.660> see<00:04:37.840> a

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
unique experience for people to see a

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.690 
unique experience for people to see a
dinosaur<00:04:38.140> walking<00:04:38.710> around<00:04:39.010> that's<00:04:39.430> what<00:04:39.610> the

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
dinosaur walking around that's what the

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.060 
dinosaur walking around that's what the
show<00:04:39.880> success<00:04:40.300> is<00:04:40.450> I<00:04:40.570> suppose<00:04:40.980> audiences<00:04:41.980> can

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
show success is I suppose audiences can

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.490 
show success is I suppose audiences can
expect<00:04:42.130> to<00:04:42.490> see<00:04:42.900> 170<00:04:43.900> million<00:04:44.080> years<00:04:44.350> of

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
expect to see 170 million years of

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.080 
expect to see 170 million years of
dinosaur<00:04:45.040> history<00:04:45.460> in<00:04:45.640> about<00:04:45.910> a<00:04:45.940> hundred

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
dinosaur history in about a hundred

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.060 
dinosaur history in about a hundred
minutes<00:04:46.540> basically<00:04:46.750> so<00:04:47.590> as<00:04:47.740> you<00:04:47.890> can<00:04:48.010> imagine

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
minutes basically so as you can imagine

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.640 
minutes basically so as you can imagine
it's<00:04:48.550> pretty<00:04:48.990> jam-packed<00:04:49.990> evening<00:04:50.440> in<00:04:50.560> the
