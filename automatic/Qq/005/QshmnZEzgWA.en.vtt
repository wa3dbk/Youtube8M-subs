00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:12.250
 so today I present you a 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:15.879
 wifi card chi cabaye the gct vwp 86,7 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.000
 shots and there a cartridge and in 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.010
 pci-express 1x 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.250
 it supports wifi at its 900 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:29.910
 that is 867 megabit per second 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:34.930
 it also supports bluetooth 4.0 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:39.210
 we are in dual band is in duel stream 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.210
 we will do everything from the box 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:53.530
 we listened to it and the bottom then the 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:57.489
 below so it always takes the top 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.809
 efficient and 1867 the pc remains we see 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.439
 two in the bundle 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:06.310
 the antenna board and a usb cable the 

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:15.700
 wifi ac in dual band the dual screen the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:18.250
 bluetooth the wifi then the capital and to 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.539
 inside we have a usb cable for doubt 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:26.860
 where we connect here on the map here created 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:33.670
 here on a usb port 2 internally a 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:39.280
 antenna then the antenna the rest falls 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:47.500
 like that if we have a piano mission of the pro 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:50.069
 tech data and here we have two connectors 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:56.950
 opinion is on the map 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:59.190
 then we have a manual in several 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.190
 languages 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:15.780
 in Chinese in English especially French 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:15.780
 we have the pilot Ã  la carte 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:45.840
 So then 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.180
 right here 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.650
 so this is the goals card behind here 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.300
 we will put the sites for 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:58.440
 antennas our ports pci express to nice to 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.680
 the rear drinking both Attraction 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.180
 a picture of one of prologis towers here 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.680
 so what really interests us 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.450
 finally it's the small map that 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.519
 inside why because it's really 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.750
 she the wifi card it was 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.230
 the location to put the poor 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.980
 respect we had earlier if 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.220
 you have to necker 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.459
 you can unscrew to change the 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.260
 case for our apc coco farm then we 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:32.730
 note here that it is a wifi card 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:35.430
 intel ac 72 cents that is put in 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.269
 it's just a PCI adapter 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:42.290
 express express mini pekin must know 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:46.079
 for cards that are up to 300 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:51.170
 dates back to 133 are therefore 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.170
 four for versions and neurology m 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.170
 this is what it is for the map 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.769
 I hope you enjoyed these videos and I 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.769
 tell you see you soon
