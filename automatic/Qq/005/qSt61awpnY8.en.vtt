certainly<00:03:46.239> handy<00:03:46.660> for<00:03:47.230> buybacks<00:03:47.739> which<00:03:48.190> were

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
certainly handy for buybacks which were

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.250 
certainly handy for buybacks which were
needed<00:03:48.940> last<00:03:49.120> time<00:03:49.360> to<00:03:49.480> make<00:03:49.630> that<00:03:49.660> happen<00:03:49.810> and

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
needed last time to make that happen and

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.620 
needed last time to make that happen and
I<00:03:50.290> reckon<00:03:50.860> that<00:03:51.010> could<00:03:51.190> be<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:52.150> Cape<00:03:52.330> again

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
I reckon that could be the Cape again

I reckon that could be the Cape again
here<00:03:52.930> they<00:03:53.230> will<00:03:53.650> have<00:03:53.890> a<00:03:53.920> glyph<00:03:54.250> so<00:03:54.519> that's

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
here they will have a glyph so that's

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.729 
here they will have a glyph so that's
something<00:03:55.030> that<00:03:55.209> will<00:03:56.019> certainly<00:03:56.200> be<00:03:56.500> in

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
something that will certainly be in

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.620 
something that will certainly be in
their<00:03:56.950> favor<00:03:57.340> like<00:03:57.850> as<00:03:58.000> well<00:03:58.209> might<00:03:58.510> be<00:03:58.570> able
