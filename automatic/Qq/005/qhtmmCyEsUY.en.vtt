hours or overnight I think that the

hours or overnight I think that the
paper<00:04:13.980> cups<00:04:14.310> are<00:04:14.459> perfect<00:04:14.880> for<00:04:15.060> this<00:04:15.150> recipe

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
paper cups are perfect for this recipe

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.599 
paper cups are perfect for this recipe
particularly<00:04:16.409> because<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:17.099> does<00:04:17.250> tend<00:04:17.489> to

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
particularly because it does tend to

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.699 
particularly because it does tend to
separate<00:04:18.060> if<00:04:18.269> you<00:04:18.390> use<00:04:18.539> a<00:04:18.570> bigger<00:04:18.840> mold<00:04:19.109> when

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
separate if you use a bigger mold when

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:20.920 
separate if you use a bigger mold when
you<00:04:19.829> are<00:04:19.979> ready<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.489> eat<00:04:20.519> the
