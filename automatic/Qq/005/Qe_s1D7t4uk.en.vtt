00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
different colors on there first if I

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.130 
different colors on there first if I
can't<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:26.239> what<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.269> do<00:02:27.390> with<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.720> X<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.049> know

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
can't so what I do with the X you know

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.309 
can't so what I do with the X you know
you<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.410> boil<00:02:29.250> them<00:02:29.599> cool<00:02:30.599> them<00:02:30.810> down<00:02:30.840> and

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
you just boil them cool them down and

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.170 
you just boil them cool them down and
peel<00:02:31.980> them<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:32.250> they<00:02:32.370> just<00:02:32.519> cut<00:02:32.790> them<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.000> half

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
peel them and they just cut them in half

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.160 
peel them and they just cut them in half
so<00:02:33.450> that's<00:02:33.599> easy

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
so that's easy

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.839

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
same thing with string beans you just

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.819 
same thing with string beans you just
blanch<00:02:36.120> in<00:02:36.299> more<00:02:36.450> boiling<00:02:36.870> now<00:02:37.500> I'm<00:02:37.620> putting

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
I'm gonna make a lot of dressing because

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.080 
I'm gonna make a lot of dressing because
these<00:04:11.570> are<00:04:11.810> big<00:04:12.320> huge<00:04:12.590> salads<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:13.280> I've

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
these are big huge salads and I've

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.000 
these are big huge salads and I've
learned<00:04:14.390> from<00:04:14.660> past<00:04:14.990> experience<00:04:15.590> that<00:04:15.800> if<00:04:15.890> I

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
learned from past experience that if I

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.220 
learned from past experience that if I
don't<00:04:16.070> make<00:04:16.370> a<00:04:16.790> lot<00:04:17.000> of<00:04:17.030> it<00:04:17.269> I<00:04:17.510> end<00:04:17.989> up<00:04:18.110> having

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
don't make a lot of it I end up having

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:25.390 
don't make a lot of it I end up having
to<00:04:18.410> do<00:04:18.560> it<00:04:18.680> twice<00:04:18.920> so<00:04:22.780> it's<00:04:23.780> like<00:04:24.070> three<00:04:25.070> parts

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
to do it twice so it's like three parts

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.520 
to do it twice so it's like three parts
oil<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.820> one<00:04:26.000> part<00:04:26.030> vinegar<00:04:26.600> I<00:04:26.870> think<00:04:27.200> if<00:04:27.380> you

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
oil to one part vinegar I think if you

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.130 
oil to one part vinegar I think if you
just<00:04:27.740> just<00:04:28.270> start<00:04:29.270> off<00:04:29.420> like<00:04:29.630> that<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:29.870> just

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
just just start off like that and just

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:50.420 
just just start off like that and just
taste<00:04:30.380> it<00:04:39.730> I'll<00:04:40.730> show<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:43.090> I<00:04:44.090> start
