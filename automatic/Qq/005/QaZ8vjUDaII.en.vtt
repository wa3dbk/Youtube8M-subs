little<00:02:01.590> Ommegang<00:02:02.040> twists<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.580> a<00:02:02.640> lot<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.910> our

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
little Ommegang twists to a lot of our

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.880 
little Ommegang twists to a lot of our
beers<00:02:03.330> that<00:02:03.540> are<00:02:03.660> traditional<00:02:04.320> ascents<00:02:04.770> but

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
beers that are traditional ascents but

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.740 
beers that are traditional ascents but
not<00:02:05.040> strictly<00:02:05.430> traditional<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.570> are

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
not strictly traditional so we are

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.900 
not strictly traditional so we are
improvising<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:08.009> innovating<00:02:08.460> a<00:02:08.520> little<00:02:08.759> bit

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
improvising and innovating a little bit

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.370 
improvising and innovating a little bit
and<00:02:09.090> our<00:02:09.149> bottled<00:02:09.570> beers<00:02:09.810> are<00:02:09.990> all<00:02:10.140> Bala

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
and our bottled beers are all Bala

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.290 
and our bottled beers are all Bala
conditions<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.100> the<00:02:11.190> Belgian<00:02:11.550> tradition<00:02:12.060> I

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
conditions in the Belgian tradition I

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.120 
conditions in the Belgian tradition I
think<00:02:12.570> sour<00:02:12.810> beers<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.410> something<00:02:13.830> we'll

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
think sour beers is something we'll

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.160 
think sour beers is something we'll
start<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.880> experiment<00:02:15.210> more<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:15.750> more<00:02:15.930> with

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
start to experiment more and more with

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.080 
start to experiment more and more with
you<00:02:16.590> can<00:02:16.680> see<00:02:16.860> we're<00:02:17.040> fairly<00:02:17.370> kind<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.910> hemmed

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
you can see we're fairly kind of hemmed

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.570 
you can see we're fairly kind of hemmed
in<00:02:18.330> here<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:18.870> our<00:02:18.900> challenges<00:02:19.650> as<00:02:19.860> we<00:02:20.040> grow<00:02:20.310> is

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
in here so our challenges as we grow is

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.940 
in here so our challenges as we grow is
creating<00:02:21.000> more<00:02:21.260> not<00:02:22.260> just<00:02:22.290> putting<00:02:22.709> in<00:02:22.800> more

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
creating more not just putting in more

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.800 
creating more not just putting in more
process<00:02:23.550> equipment<00:02:23.820> but<00:02:24.209> creating<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.690> space

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
process equipment but creating the space

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.090 
process equipment but creating the space
to<00:02:25.140> put<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:25.410> in

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.610 

but<00:02:31.790> we<00:02:31.880> do<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.030> lot<00:02:32.300> of<00:02:32.620> microbiological

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
but we do a lot of microbiological

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.820 
but we do a lot of microbiological
analysis<00:02:34.490> you<00:02:34.970> have<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.180> highly<00:02:35.420> qualified

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
analysis you have a highly qualified

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.810 
analysis you have a highly qualified
microbiologist<00:02:36.830> as<00:02:37.010> our<00:02:37.130> lab<00:02:37.310> manager

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
microbiologist as our lab manager

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.970 
microbiologist as our lab manager
basically<00:02:38.420> in<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.540> nutshell<00:02:38.720> we<00:02:39.140> test<00:02:39.410> every

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
basically in a nutshell we test every

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.610 
basically in a nutshell we test every
form<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.430> process<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.150> entire<00:02:41.620> room

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
form of the process and the entire room

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.860 
form of the process and the entire room
so<00:02:43.370> everything<00:02:43.760> from<00:02:43.880> raw<00:02:44.120> ingredients<00:02:44.150> to

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
so everything from raw ingredients to

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.110 
so everything from raw ingredients to
final<00:02:45.230> product<00:02:45.470> we<00:02:45.830> even<00:02:46.070> do<00:02:46.190> some<00:02:46.430> weird<00:02:46.850> odd

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
final product we even do some weird odd

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.180 
final product we even do some weird odd
tests<00:02:47.540> like<00:02:47.780> if<00:02:48.020> we're<00:02:48.260> deciding<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.160> change

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
tests like if we're deciding to change

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.030 
tests like if we're deciding to change
the<00:02:49.730> quor'toth<00:02:50.120> box<00:02:50.690> like<00:02:50.960> doing<00:02:51.620> like

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
the quor'toth box like doing like

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.710 
the quor'toth box like doing like
structural<00:02:52.520> integrity<00:02:53.060> tests<00:02:53.450> we're

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
structural integrity tests we're

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.060 
structural integrity tests we're
starting<00:02:54.020> to<00:02:54.110> move<00:02:54.230> towards<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.620> little<00:02:54.740> bit<00:02:54.980> of

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
starting to move towards a little bit of

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.130 
starting to move towards a little bit of
a<00:02:55.130> molecular<00:02:55.370> basis<00:02:55.970> with<00:02:56.630> testing<00:02:56.990> which<00:02:57.110> is

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
a molecular basis with testing which is

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.690 
a molecular basis with testing which is
kind<00:02:57.530> of<00:02:57.590> new<00:02:57.740> to<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:57.950> brewing<00:02:58.190> industry<00:02:58.310> but

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
kind of new to the brewing industry but

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.220 
kind of new to the brewing industry but
it's<00:02:58.820> something<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.180> we<00:02:59.690> want<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.960> try<00:03:00.110> out

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
it's something that we want to try out

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.570 
it's something that we want to try out
so<00:03:00.470> that<00:03:00.680> we're<00:03:00.830> making<00:03:00.860> sure<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.400> we're

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
so that we're making sure that we're

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.370 
so that we're making sure that we're
ahead<00:03:01.670> of<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.910> game<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.540> batch<00:03:02.750> goes<00:03:03.080> wrong

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
ahead of the game the batch goes wrong

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.890 
ahead of the game the batch goes wrong
it's<00:03:03.710> my<00:03:03.800> job<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.040> go<00:03:04.910> through<00:03:05.180> all<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.720> data

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
it's my job to go through all the data

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.450 
it's my job to go through all the data
that<00:03:05.960> we've<00:03:06.200> gathered<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.830> basically

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
that we've gathered and basically

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.010 
that we've gathered and basically
finding<00:03:07.790> out<00:03:07.940> what<00:03:08.210> went<00:03:08.360> wrong<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.810> caused

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
finding out what went wrong that caused

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.780 
finding out what went wrong that caused
this<00:03:09.230> issue<00:03:09.470> I<00:03:09.770> think<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.070> biggest<00:03:10.370> one<00:03:10.640> we've

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
this issue I think the biggest one we've

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.120 
this issue I think the biggest one we've
had<00:03:10.820> is<00:03:11.120> here<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.690> doesn't<00:03:11.900> permit<00:03:12.800> all<00:03:13.010> the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
had is here that doesn't permit all the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.860 
had is here that doesn't permit all the
way<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:13.850> stalled<00:03:14.180> fermentation

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.479 

sometimes<00:03:19.870> Belgians<00:03:20.650> will<00:03:20.800> visit<00:03:21.099> us<00:03:21.220> and

they're growing and pelletizing hops and

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
pelletizing plant and then it makes it

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.340 
pelletizing plant and then it makes it
possible<00:04:49.640> for<00:04:49.910> a<00:04:50.150> farmer<00:04:50.540> to<00:04:50.630> get<00:04:50.750> his<00:04:50.840> hops<00:04:51.080> to

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
possible for a farmer to get his hops to

possible for a farmer to get his hops to
the<00:04:51.440> brewer<00:04:51.710> because<00:04:52.040> not<00:04:52.250> many<00:04:52.570> Brewers<00:04:53.570> use

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
the brewer because not many Brewers use

from everybody jason has ideas I have
ideas<00:05:19.460> the<00:05:19.730> Brewers<00:05:20.090> have<00:05:20.300> ideas<00:05:20.720> and<00:05:20.750> we've

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
ideas the Brewers have ideas and we've

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.170 
ideas the Brewers have ideas and we've
developed<00:05:21.470> some<00:05:21.680> of<00:05:21.770> those<00:05:21.890> beers<00:05:22.190> into<00:05:22.700> beers

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
developed some of those beers into beers

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.970 
developed some of those beers into beers
that<00:05:23.330> would<00:05:23.510> sell<00:05:23.810> and<00:05:24.080> Jason<00:05:24.590> is<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.740> guy

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
that would sell and Jason is the guy

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.460 
that would sell and Jason is the guy
that<00:05:25.250> really<00:05:25.450> executes<00:05:26.450> all<00:05:26.660> that<00:05:26.990> as<00:05:27.200> we<00:05:27.350> get

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
that really executes all that as we get

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.270 
that really executes all that as we get
more<00:05:27.680> space<00:05:28.190> more<00:05:28.580> real<00:05:28.850> estate<00:05:29.210> in<00:05:29.420> here<00:05:29.780> I

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
more space more real estate in here I

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.320 
more space more real estate in here I
think<00:05:31.280> we're<00:05:31.460> going<00:05:31.580> to<00:05:31.640> start<00:05:31.880> to<00:05:32.000> experiment

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
think we're going to start to experiment

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:42.450 
think we're going to start to experiment
with<00:05:32.690> some<00:05:32.870> different
