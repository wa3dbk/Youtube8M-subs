00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
course we've been doing a series on it

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.590 
course we've been doing a series on it
but<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.280> best<00:01:55.550> thing<00:01:55.760> about<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:56.180> regular

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
but the best thing about the regular

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.810 
but the best thing about the regular
ones<00:01:56.780> is<00:01:57.020> that<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:57.350> can<00:01:57.530> customize<00:01:58.400> them<00:01:58.640> and

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
ones is that you can customize them and

and of course the camera so for the

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.460 
and of course the camera so for the
first<00:02:05.150> one<00:02:05.420> for<00:02:05.630> this<00:02:05.780> one<00:02:05.990> I'm<00:02:06.110> gonna<00:02:06.229> kind<00:02:06.440> of

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
first one for this one I'm gonna kind of

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.199 
first one for this one I'm gonna kind of
go<00:02:06.530> over<00:02:06.710> what<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.070> can<00:02:07.220> do<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.520> it<00:02:07.670> when<00:02:08.090> you

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
go over what you can do to it when you

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.940 
go over what you can do to it when you
change<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.539> barrel<00:02:08.989> it<00:02:09.200> allows<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.739> put<00:02:09.920> a

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
change the barrel it allows you to put a

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.880 
change the barrel it allows you to put a
sound<00:02:10.280> suppressor<00:02:10.459> on<00:02:10.940> which<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:11.659> did<00:02:11.930> do<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.470> I

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
sound suppressor on which I did do and I

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.559 
sound suppressor on which I did do and I
would<00:02:13.250> suggest<00:02:13.400> doing<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.940> too<00:02:14.090> because<00:02:14.420> it's

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
would suggest doing it too because it's

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.420 
would suggest doing it too because it's
still<00:02:14.810> one<00:02:15.049> shot<00:02:15.290> everything<00:02:15.590> all<00:02:15.980> the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
still one shot everything all the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.890 
still one shot everything all the
gameplay<00:02:16.609> I<00:02:16.819> got<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.239> everything<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.629> did<00:02:17.689> with

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
gameplay I got and everything I did with

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.509 
gameplay I got and everything I did with
it<00:02:18.019> so<00:02:18.170> far<00:02:18.379> is<00:02:18.560> with<00:02:18.799> this<00:02:18.950> on<00:02:19.159> it<00:02:19.189> so<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.489> can

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
it so far is with this on it so I can

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:19.930 
it so far is with this on it so I can
only

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
only

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.490 
only
imagine<00:02:20.270> that's<00:02:20.420> more<00:02:20.600> powerful<00:02:20.900> without<00:02:21.290> it

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
imagine that's more powerful without it

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.920 
imagine that's more powerful without it
but<00:02:22.070> if<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.880> one-shots<00:02:23.270> everything<00:02:23.750> why

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
but if it one-shots everything why

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.000 
but if it one-shots everything why
wouldn't<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.260> want<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.470> suppress<00:02:24.740> it<00:02:24.890> only

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
wouldn't you want to suppress it only

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.050 
wouldn't you want to suppress it only
because<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.310> can<00:02:25.430> go<00:02:25.550> around<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.910> shoot

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
because you can go around and shoot

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.280 
because you can go around and shoot
nobody<00:02:26.270> knows<00:02:26.600> where<00:02:26.780> you're<00:02:26.900> at

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
nobody knows where you're at

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.830 
nobody knows where you're at
moving<00:02:28.070> on<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.460> have<00:02:28.880> two<00:02:29.120> different<00:02:29.360> scopes

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
moving on you have two different scopes

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.090 
moving on you have two different scopes
you<00:02:29.930> can<00:02:30.110> choose<00:02:30.290> from<00:02:30.500> apart<00:02:30.860> from<00:02:30.950> the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
you can choose from apart from the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.890 
you can choose from apart from the
default<00:02:31.490> so<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.700> really<00:02:31.970> have<00:02:32.090> three<00:02:32.390> you

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
default so you really have three you

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.630 
default so you really have three you
have<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.320> high-power<00:02:33.860> scope<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.520> the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
have the high-power scope and the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.490 
have the high-power scope and the
advanced<00:02:35.030> coat<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:35.630> can<00:02:35.780> change<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.290> and

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
advanced coat that you can change to and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.380 
advanced coat that you can change to and
then<00:02:37.040> finally<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:37.610> have<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.910> extended

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
then finally you have the extended

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.480 
then finally you have the extended
magazine<00:02:38.690> which<00:02:39.170> again<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.710> no-brainer<00:02:39.980> it

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
magazine which again is a no-brainer it

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.820 
magazine which again is a no-brainer it
bumps<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:40.910> up<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.060> 12<00:02:41.480> shots<00:02:41.750> per<00:02:42.050> magazine<00:02:42.590> and

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
bumps it up to 12 shots per magazine and

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.740 
bumps it up to 12 shots per magazine and
