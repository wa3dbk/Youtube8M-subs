you know built around sort of strength

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.120 
you know built around sort of strength
and<00:01:15.079> anyway<00:01:16.079> we<00:01:16.259> pick<00:01:16.469> one<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.679> those<00:01:16.799> and

and anyway we pick one of those and

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.370 
and anyway we pick one of those and
stick<00:01:17.280> with<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.880> consistent<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:19.259> will

stick with it be consistent and you will

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.539 
stick with it be consistent and you will
make<00:01:19.530> gains<00:01:21.200> you<00:01:22.200> know<00:01:22.319> be<00:01:22.649> determined<00:01:23.399> be

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
make gains you know be determined be

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.660 
make gains you know be determined be
consistent<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:25.530> expect<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.130> do<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.310> routine

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
consistent and expect to do that routine

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.649

to<00:02:06.479> start<00:02:06.689> with<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.439> will<00:02:07.619> vary<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.889> lot

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
to start with this will vary a lot

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.630 
to start with this will vary a lot
depending<00:02:08.100> on<00:02:09.140> your<00:02:10.140> age<00:02:10.520> your<00:02:11.520> experience

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
depending on your age your experience

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.620 
depending on your age your experience
your<00:02:14.640> physique<00:02:15.030> some<00:02:15.300> people<00:02:15.510> are<00:02:15.600> just

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
your physique some people are just

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.260 
your physique some people are just
naturally<00:02:15.840> stronger<00:02:16.350> than<00:02:16.500> others<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.270> so

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
naturally stronger than others and so

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.850 
naturally stronger than others and so
it's<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.450> little<00:02:18.690> bit<00:02:18.780> tricky<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.170> say<00:02:19.740> where

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
it's a little bit tricky to say where

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.960 
it's a little bit tricky to say where
you<00:02:19.950> need<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.100> start<00:02:20.130> but<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:20.640> good<00:02:20.790> rule<00:02:20.940> of

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
you need to start but a good rule of

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.050 
you need to start but a good rule of
thumb<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.300> can<00:02:21.480> take<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.630> bar<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.340> do<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.460> do

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
thumb is you can take a bar and do it do

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.970 
thumb is you can take a bar and do it do
5<00:02:24.420> sets<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.810> whatever<00:02:25.050> exercise<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.860> you're

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
5 sets of whatever exercise that you're

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.310 
5 sets of whatever exercise that you're
starting<00:02:26.130> with<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.580> keep<00:02:27.570> adding<00:02:27.810> 20<00:02:28.020> pounds

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
starting with and keep adding 20 pounds

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.510 
starting with and keep adding 20 pounds
so<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.560> start<00:02:28.800> finding<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.250> little<00:02:29.370> bit

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
so you start finding it a little bit

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.580 
so you start finding it a little bit
more<00:02:29.640> difficult<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.720> that's<00:02:30.870> where<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.440> can

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
more difficult and that's where you can

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.290 
more difficult and that's where you can
kind<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.830> set<00:02:32.040> your<00:02:32.640> your<00:02:32.910> starting<00:02:33.270> weight

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
kind of set your your starting weight

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.480 
kind of set your your starting weight
for<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.170> exercise<00:02:36.800> and<00:02:37.800> just<00:02:38.250> use<00:02:38.370> your

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
for that exercise and just use your

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.860 
for that exercise and just use your
discretion<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:39.060> know<00:02:39.150> better<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.510> start<00:02:39.720> low

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
discretion you know better to start low

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.560 
discretion you know better to start low
than<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.740> try<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.310> start<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.640> high<00:02:41.790> risk<00:02:42.240> injury

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
than to try to start to high risk injury

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.180 
than to try to start to high risk injury
or<00:02:42.840> or<00:02:43.490> failure<00:02:44.490> or<00:02:44.640> whatever<00:02:45.680> or<00:02:46.680> five<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.160> a
