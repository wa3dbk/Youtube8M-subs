very careful as there's a spring located

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.589 
very careful as there's a spring located
inside<00:02:34.950> there<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.340> spring<00:02:36.120> needs<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.450> be

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
inside there that spring needs to be

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.390 
inside there that spring needs to be
removed<00:02:37.049> if<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.530> drop<00:02:37.769> it<00:02:37.799> you<00:02:38.130> know<00:02:38.250> you'll

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
removed if you drop it you know you'll

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.850 
removed if you drop it you know you'll
never<00:02:38.519> find<00:02:38.849> it

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
1100 S or R 1200 C then it has a lever

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.100 
1100 S or R 1200 C then it has a lever
that<00:04:41.670> looks<00:04:41.970> like<00:04:42.150> this<00:04:42.390> and<00:04:42.600> it's<00:04:42.750> even

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
that looks like this and it's even

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.710 
that looks like this and it's even
easier<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.530> install<00:04:44.000> you<00:04:45.000> just<00:04:45.270> simply<00:04:45.570> remove

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
easier to install you just simply remove

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.580 
easier to install you just simply remove
this<00:04:46.110> screw<00:04:46.290> that's<00:04:46.680> there<00:04:47.900> now<00:04:48.900> very

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
this screw that's there now very

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.140 
this screw that's there now very
important<00:04:50.040> is<00:04:50.190> when<00:04:50.370> you<00:04:50.460> remove<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:50.940> left

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
important is when you remove the left

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.230 
important is when you remove the left
after<00:04:51.960> removing<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.410> screw<00:04:52.730> they<00:04:53.730> loop<00:04:53.970> the
