00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.389 
hopefully it has a quad HD display that
will<00:01:49.799> be<00:01:49.860> pretty<00:01:50.189> sick<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.909> snap<00:01:51.600> like<00:01:51.720> an<00:01:51.810> 805

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
will be pretty sick and snap like an 805

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.149 
will be pretty sick and snap like an 805
or<00:01:53.399> maybe<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.850> won't<00:01:54.030> have<00:01:54.210> those<00:01:54.450> things<00:01:54.720> but

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
or maybe you won't have those things but

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.010 
or maybe you won't have those things but
an<00:01:56.159> August<00:01:56.640> launch<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.390> something<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.899> we

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
an August launch is something that we

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.899 
an August launch is something that we
almost<00:01:58.229> heard<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.799> might<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.579> they<00:01:59.700> launched

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
almost heard so might that they launched

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.030 
almost heard so might that they launched
it<00:02:00.090> before<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.570> iPhone<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.890> would

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
it before the iPhone that would

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.850 
it before the iPhone that would
definitely<00:02:02.460> be<00:02:02.579> something<00:02:03.079> that<00:02:04.079> would<00:02:04.799> be

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
definitely be something that would be

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.210 
definitely be something that would be
pretty<00:02:05.430> cool<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.939> mean<00:02:06.530> that<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.710> would<00:02:07.890> come<00:02:08.190> a

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
pretty cool I mean that it would come a

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.479 
pretty cool I mean that it would come a
little<00:02:08.580> bit<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.970> earlier<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.310> could

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
little bit like earlier so this could

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.220 
little bit like earlier so this could
definitely<00:02:11.580> be<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:12.000> nice<00:02:12.239> little<00:02:12.480> product<00:02:12.930> so

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
definitely be a nice little product so

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.490 
definitely be a nice little product so
