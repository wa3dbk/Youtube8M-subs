they<00:03:02.120> have<00:03:02.209> those<00:03:02.329> ritualistic<00:03:02.750> veins<00:03:03.379> so<00:03:04.069> I

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
they have those ritualistic veins so I

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.740 
they have those ritualistic veins so I
think<00:03:04.909> they're<00:03:05.030> gonna<00:03:05.090> have<00:03:05.299> like<00:03:05.450> kind<00:03:05.659> of

think they're gonna have like kind of

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.520 
think they're gonna have like kind of
like<00:03:05.810> a<00:03:05.900> last<00:03:06.079> exorcism<00:03:06.560> ending<00:03:06.980> so<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:09.290> looked

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
like a last exorcism ending so it looked

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.129 
like a last exorcism ending so it looked
pretty<00:03:09.799> cool<00:03:10.099> and<00:03:10.430> then<00:03:10.639> I<00:03:10.909> can't<00:03:11.209> really<00:03:11.329> say
