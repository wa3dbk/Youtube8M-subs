00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
like this this is pretty cool check this

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.460 
like this this is pretty cool check this
out<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.550> new<00:00:23.910> Jabra<00:00:24.570> SP<00:00:24.930> 700

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
out this is the new Jabra SP 700

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.290 
out this is the new Jabra SP 700
speakerphone<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.550> pretty<00:00:26.939> much<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.240> a

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
speakerphone so pretty much it's a

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.640 
speakerphone so pretty much it's a
speakerphone<00:00:27.599> bluetooth<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.289> enabled<00:00:28.439> for

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
speakerphone bluetooth is enabled for

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.500 
speakerphone bluetooth is enabled for
your<00:00:28.980> car<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.179> little<00:00:30.390> different

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
your car but it's a little different

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.370 
your car but it's a little different
than<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.779> ones<00:00:30.929> you're<00:00:30.990> going<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.230> see

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
than the ones you're going to see

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.860 
than the ones you're going to see
elsewhere<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.790> several<00:00:33.120> reasons<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.540> first

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
elsewhere for several reasons the first

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.620 
elsewhere for several reasons the first
one<00:00:34.469> being<00:00:34.680> its<00:00:35.070> noise<00:00:35.280> cancelling<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.059> echo

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
one being its noise cancelling and echo

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.030 
one being its noise cancelling and echo
canceling<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.350> kills<00:00:37.500> all<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.710> background

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
canceling so it kills all the background

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.979 
canceling so it kills all the background
noise<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.489> kills<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.989> speakerphone

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
noise and it kills that speakerphone

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.299 
noise and it kills that speakerphone
echo<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.620> won't<00:00:40.770> get<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:40.950> trouble<00:00:41.190> when

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
echo so you won't get in trouble when

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.410 
echo so you won't get in trouble when
people<00:00:41.399> know<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.850> you're<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.030> they're<00:00:42.329> on

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
people know that you're on they're on

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.180 
people know that you're on they're on
speakerphone<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.680> other<00:00:43.829> thing<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.040> it

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
speakerphone the other thing that it

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.889 
speakerphone the other thing that it
does<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.489> has<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> built-in<00:00:45.059> FM<00:00:45.360> transmitter

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
does is it has a built-in FM transmitter

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.490 
does is it has a built-in FM transmitter
so<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.789> have<00:00:48.090> let's<00:00:48.719> say<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.930> Bluetooth

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
so if you have let's say a Bluetooth

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.150 
so if you have let's say a Bluetooth
phone<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.039> if<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.969> a2dp<00:00:51.719> enabled<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.920> can

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
phone and if it's a a2dp enabled you can

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.430 
phone and if it's a a2dp enabled you can
take<00:00:54.090> your<00:00:54.210> music<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.660> blast<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.170> over<00:00:55.320> your

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
spirit speakers on in the car through

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.540 
spirit speakers on in the car through
this<00:00:57.449> or<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.620> also<00:00:58.739> talk<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.250> speaker

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
this or you can also talk on speaker

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.220 
this or you can also talk on speaker
phone<00:00:59.670> through<00:00:59.910> bluetooth<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> phone<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
phone through bluetooth to the phone and

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.740 
phone through bluetooth to the phone and
output<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.550> know<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> speaker<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.629> your

pretty cool
so<00:01:09.930> what<00:01:10.770> else<00:01:10.890> do<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.100> get<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.460> well

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
so what else do you get on this well

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.219 
so what else do you get on this well
let's<00:01:12.240> see<00:01:12.330> what<00:01:12.450> comes<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> box<00:01:13.020> that's

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
let's see what comes in the box that's

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.750 
let's see what comes in the box that's
always<00:01:13.350> pretty<00:01:13.590> important<00:01:14.040> now<00:01:14.400> there's<00:01:14.640> two

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
always pretty important now there's two

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.280 
always pretty important now there's two
ways<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.939> charge<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.390> thing<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.140> gives

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
ways to charge this thing and it gives

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.980 
ways to charge this thing and it gives
you<00:01:16.409> both<00:01:16.560> methods<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.850> USB<00:01:18.330> cable

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
you both methods one is with a USB cable

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.170 
you both methods one is with a USB cable
very<00:01:19.560> simple<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.100> then<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> other<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.030> is

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
very simple and then the other one is

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.969 
very simple and then the other one is
the<00:01:21.330> power<00:01:21.540> adapter<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.290> case<00:01:22.409> your<00:01:22.560> never

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the power adapter so in case your never

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.140 
the power adapter so in case your never
leaves<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> car<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.610> don't<00:01:23.700> never<00:01:23.880> take<00:01:24.090> it

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
leaves the car you don't never take it

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.880 
leaves the car you don't never take it
out<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.930> your<00:01:25.020> power<00:01:25.229> adapter<00:01:25.409> which<00:01:25.740> is

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
out this is your power adapter which is

it but let's say if somebody calls
there's<00:03:18.420> no<00:03:18.510> display<00:03:18.900> on<00:03:19.050> here<00:03:19.200> so<00:03:19.290> you're<00:03:19.410> not

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
there's no display on here so you're not

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.960 
there's no display on here so you're not
going<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.709> know<00:03:19.770> who's<00:03:19.920> calling<00:03:20.130> if<00:03:20.490> without

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.050 
pulling your phone on your pocket that's
dumb<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:22.800> what<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.100> does<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.400> tells<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:23.820> it
