00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.980 
another form properiy video today I'm
going<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.000> talk<00:00:12.179> about<00:00:12.210> silver<00:00:13.200> wood<00:00:13.380> and

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
going to talk about silver wood and

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.310 
going to talk about silver wood and
firstly<00:00:15.990> silver<00:00:16.710> saplings<00:00:17.390> so<00:00:18.390> if<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.779> plant<00:00:19.050> a

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
firstly silver saplings so if I plant a

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.509 
firstly silver saplings so if I plant a
silver<00:00:19.619> wood<00:00:19.770> sapling<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.449> will<00:00:21.449> need<00:00:21.630> a

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
silver wood sapling it will need a

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.859 
silver wood sapling it will need a
minimum<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.840> 7<00:00:24.840> blocks<00:00:25.310> straight<00:00:26.310> up<00:00:26.779> for<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
minimum of 7 blocks straight up for the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.500 
minimum of 7 blocks straight up for the
grow<00:00:28.080> but<00:00:29.090> it<00:00:30.090> will<00:00:30.900> grow<00:00:31.619> 10<00:00:32.009> blocks<00:00:32.250> tall<00:00:32.550> so

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
grow but it will grow 10 blocks tall so

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.470 
grow but it will grow 10 blocks tall so
if<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.050> put<00:00:34.530> enough<00:00:34.860> place<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:35.640> 7<00:00:36.270> block

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
if you put enough place with 7 block

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.880 
if you put enough place with 7 block
high<00:00:37.219> it<00:00:38.219> will<00:00:38.850> destroy<00:00:39.540> your<00:00:39.719> roof<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.320> little

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
high it will destroy your roof a little

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.810 
high it will destroy your roof a little
bit<00:00:42.320> but<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.469> goodness<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.300> but<00:00:45.300> believes

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
bit but the goodness is but believes

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.139 
bit but the goodness is but believes
will<00:00:47.820> not<00:00:48.030> destroy<00:00:48.450> any<00:00:48.660> blocks<00:00:49.820> so<00:00:50.820> let's<00:00:51.030> go

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
will not destroy any blocks so let's go

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:05.000 
will not destroy any blocks so let's go
into<00:00:51.360> creative<00:00:51.780> as<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.500> see<00:00:52.829> here

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.960 

so<00:01:05.580> that's<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.030> minimum<00:01:06.420> height<00:01:07.040> ten<00:01:08.040> blocks

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.200 

so<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.300> might<00:01:12.870> wonder<00:01:13.140> how<00:01:13.790> to<00:01:14.790> get<00:01:15.060> these

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
so you might wonder how to get these

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.050 
so you might wonder how to get these
saplings<00:01:16.430> because<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:18.330> might<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.750> tried

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
saplings because you might have tried

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.730 
saplings because you might have tried
smashing<00:01:21.060> relates<00:01:21.480> or<00:01:22.080> something

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
smashing relates or something

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.110 
smashing relates or something
and<00:01:24.920> what<00:01:25.920> happened<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.250> say<00:01:26.490> about<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.850> is

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
and what happened to say about that is

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.150 
and what happened to say about that is
you<00:01:28.070> only<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.340> destroy<00:01:29.730> beliefs<00:01:30.740> but<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
you only have to destroy beliefs but the

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.990 
you only have to destroy beliefs but the
drop<00:01:32.400> chance<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.880> very<00:01:33.330> low<00:01:34.730> let's<00:01:35.730> do<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
drop chance is very low let's do a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.090 
drop chance is very low let's do a
little<00:01:36.120> experiment<00:01:39.410> first<00:01:40.410> I'm<00:01:40.710> cutting<00:01:41.070> down

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
little experiment first I'm cutting down

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.000 
little experiment first I'm cutting down
route<00:01:41.790> here<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.620> letting<00:01:44.900> it<00:01:45.900> drop<00:01:46.290> all<00:01:46.560> of

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
route here and letting it drop all of

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.250 
route here and letting it drop all of
the<00:01:49.460> saplings<00:01:50.460> itself<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.840> one<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.200> will

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
the saplings itself and this one I will

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.470 
the saplings itself and this one I will
destroy<00:01:52.830> with<00:01:53.400> a<00:01:53.720> diamond<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.990> shares<00:01:55.620> and<00:01:56.480> I

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
destroy with a diamond the shares and I

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.860 
destroy with a diamond the shares and I
should<00:01:57.720> leave<00:01:57.930> creative<00:02:02.360> this<00:02:03.360> will<00:02:03.540> not<00:02:03.690> be

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
should leave creative this will not be

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.210 
should leave creative this will not be
an<00:02:03.930> exact<00:02:04.470> test<00:02:06.410> because<00:02:07.410> I<00:02:07.560> would<00:02:07.740> need<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.920> lot

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
an exact test because I would need a lot

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.980 
an exact test because I would need a lot
more<00:02:08.250> crease<00:02:09.800> but<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.860> think<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:12.450> get<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.780> same

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
more crease but I think you get the same

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.390 
more crease but I think you get the same
chance<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.940> this<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> item<00:02:15.600> from<00:02:16.220> red<00:02:17.220> power

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
chance and this is a item from red power

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.250 
chance and this is a item from red power
makes<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.550> lot<00:02:20.730> faster<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:21.450> destroy<00:02:22.140> the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
makes it a lot faster to destroy the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:38.240 
makes it a lot faster to destroy the
leaves<00:02:24.230> quite<00:02:25.230> useful<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:25.920> actually

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.690 

but<00:02:38.850> as<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.240> see<00:02:39.470> right<00:02:40.470> now<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.890> haven't

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
but as you see right now I haven't

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.370 
but as you see right now I haven't
gotten<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.510> single<00:02:43.170> sapling<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:47.390> think<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:49.050> drop

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
gotten a single sapling I think you drop

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.590 
gotten a single sapling I think you drop
right<00:02:49.790> at<00:02:50.790> least<00:02:50.940> for<00:02:51.360> me<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:52.910> once<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.210> plane

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
right at least for me is once a plane

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.890 
right at least for me is once a plane
for<00:02:55.500> two<00:02:55.890> trees<00:02:57.950> around<00:02:58.950> or<00:02:59.130> somewhere<00:02:59.630> but<00:03:00.630> I

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
for two trees around or somewhere but I

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.350 
for two trees around or somewhere but I
didn't<00:03:01.470> get<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.620> sapling<00:03:01.890> from<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:02.370> one<00:03:02.520> but<00:03:03.300> I

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
didn't get a sapling from this one but I

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.320 
didn't get a sapling from this one but I
did<00:03:03.600> get<00:03:03.870> one<00:03:04.320> from<00:03:04.970> this<00:03:05.970> one

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
did get one from this one

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.130 
did get one from this one
I<00:03:07.730> think<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.820> drop<00:03:09.000> rate<00:03:09.209> is<00:03:09.390> same<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.050> you

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
I think the drop rate is same and you

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.160 
I think the drop rate is same and you
can<00:03:10.170> get<00:03:10.590> saplings<00:03:11.010> both<00:03:11.550> ways<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:12.930> might

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
can get saplings both ways so you might

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.680 
can get saplings both ways so you might
wonder<00:03:13.410> why<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:16.380> would<00:03:16.530> need<00:03:16.709> such<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.310> tree

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
wonder why you would need such a tree

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.080 
wonder why you would need such a tree
the<00:03:18.690> reason<00:03:19.170> is<00:03:19.640> but<00:03:20.640> we<00:03:20.820> create<00:03:21.150> pure<00:03:21.570> nodes

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
the reason is but we create pure nodes

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.150 
the reason is but we create pure nodes
as<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.330> see<00:03:24.660> here<00:03:24.989> it's<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.440> little<00:03:25.560> node<00:03:25.920> and

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
as you see here it's a little node and

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.320 
as you see here it's a little node and
it<00:03:27.060> has<00:03:27.300> a<00:03:27.720> spinning<00:03:28.560> star<00:03:28.950> in<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.370> it<00:03:30.090> means

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
it has a spinning star in it it means

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.650 
it has a spinning star in it it means
that<00:03:30.510> it's<00:03:30.870> pure<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.620> will<00:03:32.400> reduce<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.150> flux

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
that it's pure and will reduce the flux

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:44.040 
that it's pure and will reduce the flux
levels

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.970 

as<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:44.740> see<00:03:44.920> here<00:03:45.100> I<00:03:45.310> created<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.150> new<00:03:46.180> node<00:03:46.980> you

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
as you see here I created a new node you

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.720 
as you see here I created a new node you
can<00:03:48.160> also<00:03:48.340> merge<00:03:48.820> these<00:03:49.150> nodes<00:03:50.220> by<00:03:51.220> placing

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
can also merge these nodes by placing

00:03:51.730 --> 00:04:02.030 
can also merge these nodes by placing
them<00:03:51.880> on<00:03:52.330> top<00:03:52.510> of<00:03:52.570> each<00:03:52.780> other<00:03:53.050> or<00:03:53.610> close

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.610 

let's<00:04:02.670> see<00:04:02.909> here<00:04:05.900> that<00:04:06.900> might<00:04:07.140> have<00:04:07.260> been<00:04:07.379> too

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
let's see here that might have been too

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.720 
let's see here that might have been too
close<00:04:09.140> but<00:04:10.140> you<00:04:10.290> can<00:04:10.439> merge<00:04:10.680> these<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.610> get

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
close but you can merge these to get

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.589 
close but you can merge these to get
huge<00:04:12.540> nodes<00:04:13.760> but<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:14.879> will<00:04:14.970> take<00:04:15.299> a<00:04:15.329> lot<00:04:15.569> of

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
huge nodes but it will take a lot of
