you<00:00:32.520> know<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> rabbit<00:00:33.090> will<00:00:33.239> eat<00:00:33.420> some<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
you know the rabbit will eat some of the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.720 
you know the rabbit will eat some of the
fescue<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> edge<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:35.100> that's<00:00:35.309> not<00:00:35.489> good

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
fescue on the edge but that's not good

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.310 
fescue on the edge but that's not good
food<00:00:35.970> but<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:36.300> think<00:00:36.690> if<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.079> were<00:00:37.199> out

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
food but just think if you were out

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.259 
food but just think if you were out
there<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.710> were<00:00:37.890> him<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.910> Hulk<00:00:39.120> would

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
there and you were him the Hulk would

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:40.610 
there and you were him the Hulk would
get<00:00:39.449> you<00:00:39.600> during<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> day<00:00:39.929> and<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> Hulk

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
get you during the day and if the Hulk

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.610 
get you during the day and if the Hulk
didn't<00:00:40.890> get<00:00:41.039> you<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> owl<00:00:41.429> would<00:00:41.670> at<00:00:41.820> night

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
didn't get you the owl would at night

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.509 
didn't get you the owl would at night
this<00:00:43.620> might<00:00:43.859> be<00:00:44.039> good<00:00:44.250> for<00:00:44.280> cattle<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.879> horses

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
this might be good for cattle and horses

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.950 
this might be good for cattle and horses
but<00:00:47.519> as<00:00:47.609> far<00:00:47.879> as<00:00:48.059> for<00:00:48.239> rabbits<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.719> quail

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
but as far as for rabbits and quail

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.040 
but as far as for rabbits and quail
forget<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:50.449> subdivisions<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.839> one

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
forget it subdivisions like this one

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.419 
forget it subdivisions like this one
this<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:52.350> probably<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.769> have<00:00:52.890> quail<00:00:53.129> at<00:00:53.309> one

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
this one probably just have quail at one

this one probably just have quail at one
time<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.420> land<00:00:54.660> did<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.550> 90<00:00:56.550> roll<00:00:57.559> we're<00:00:58.559> not

burning<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.070> woods<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.609> used<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.059> so

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
burning the woods like we used to and so

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.389 
burning the woods like we used to and so
we've<00:01:00.629> got<00:01:00.809> stands<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
we've got stands like this this is a

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.160 
we've got stands like this this is a
Virginia<00:01:02.850> pine<00:01:03.059> stand<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.629> came<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.929> to<00:01:04.050> an

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
Virginia pine stand that came in to an

you<00:01:50.850> own<00:01:50.939> land<00:01:50.969> and<00:01:51.509> want<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.719> provide<00:01:52.229> form

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
you own land and want to provide form

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.139 
you own land and want to provide form
this<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.259> what<00:01:55.289> they're<00:01:55.590> after

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.870 

good<00:02:00.149> looking<00:02:00.890> habitat<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.700> rough

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
good looking habitat like this the rough

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.969 
good looking habitat like this the rough
stuff<00:02:03.149> lots<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.079> times<00:02:04.289> you<00:02:04.469> find<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.890> on

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
stuff lots of times you find it on

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.160 
stuff lots of times you find it on
powerline<00:02:05.549> right<00:02:05.820> ways

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.440 

my<00:02:09.170> ologists<00:02:09.649> call<00:02:09.830> this<00:02:10.009> kind<00:02:10.190> of<00:02:10.340> land<00:02:10.550> early

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
my ologists call this kind of land early

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.870 
my ologists call this kind of land early
successional<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.520> what<00:02:13.520> they're<00:02:13.670> talking

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
successional and what they're talking

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.580 
successional and what they're talking
about<00:02:13.970> is<00:02:14.150> that<00:02:14.180> succession<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.080> process

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
about is that succession is a process

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.130 
about is that succession is a process
it's<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:15.920> aging<00:02:16.280> process

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
it's the aging process

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.170 
it's the aging process
by<00:02:18.140> what<00:02:18.349> your<00:02:18.500> field<00:02:18.709> changes<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.700> forest

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
by what your field changes to a forest

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.559 
by what your field changes to a forest
and<00:02:21.020> so<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.290> go<00:02:21.500> from<00:02:21.709> grasses<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.459> weeds<00:02:22.640> to

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
and so to go from grasses and weeds to

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.570 
and so to go from grasses and weeds to
small<00:02:23.810> trees<00:02:24.110> like<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:24.620> Virginia<00:02:24.980> pine<00:02:25.250> and

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
small trees like that Virginia pine and

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.880 
small trees like that Virginia pine and
then<00:02:26.420> gradually<00:02:26.900> over<00:02:26.930> time<00:02:27.110> it'll<00:02:27.560> be<00:02:27.620> big

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
then gradually over time it'll be big

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.300 
then gradually over time it'll be big
trees<00:02:28.190> it'll<00:02:28.610> convert<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.300> a<00:02:29.330> forest<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.310> so

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
trees it'll convert to a forest and so

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.040 
trees it'll convert to a forest and so
what<00:02:31.580> they<00:02:31.700> mean<00:02:31.850> by<00:02:32.000> early<00:02:32.330> succession<00:02:32.900> is

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
what they mean by early succession is

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.960 
what they mean by early succession is
that<00:02:33.260> early<00:02:33.530> in<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.769> aging<00:02:34.100> process<00:02:34.580> as<00:02:34.850> the

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
that early in that aging process as the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.059 
that early in that aging process as the
field<00:02:35.260> grows<00:02:36.260> up<00:02:36.500> into<00:02:36.769> a<00:02:36.800> forest<00:02:37.330> early<00:02:38.330> on<00:02:38.510> is

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
field grows up into a forest early on is

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.559 
field grows up into a forest early on is
when<00:02:40.069> it's<00:02:40.190> best<00:02:40.430> for<00:02:40.580> quail<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:40.940> rabbits<00:02:41.360> and

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
when it's best for quail and rabbits and

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.509 
when it's best for quail and rabbits and
that's<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.350> early<00:02:42.680> early<00:02:43.130> part<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.430> that

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
that's that early early part of that

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.180 
that's that early early part of that
early<00:02:43.760> successional<00:02:44.269> term<00:02:44.540> so<00:02:45.380> a<00:02:45.709> biologist

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
early successional term so a biologist

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.259 
early successional term so a biologist
would<00:02:46.310> look<00:02:46.430> at<00:02:46.519> this<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:46.790> call<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.000> early

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
would look at this and call it early

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.170 
would look at this and call it early
successional<00:02:47.870> habitat<00:02:48.850> this<00:02:49.850> sort<00:02:50.120> of

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
successional habitat this sort of

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.020 
successional habitat this sort of
in-between<00:02:50.530> growth<00:02:51.530> that's<00:02:51.890> not<00:02:52.069> filled

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
in-between growth that's not filled

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.020 
in-between growth that's not filled
anymore<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.950> it's<00:02:55.160> not<00:02:55.280> woods<00:02:55.549> it's<00:02:55.880> in

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
anymore and it's not woods it's in

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.630 
anymore and it's not woods it's in
between<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:57.560> this<00:02:57.830> is<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.100> problem<00:02:58.340> with

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
between and this is the problem with

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.580 
between and this is the problem with
quail<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:59.090> rabbits<00:02:59.480> that<00:02:59.690> they're<00:03:00.260> just<00:03:00.470> not

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
quail and rabbits that they're just not

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.479 
quail and rabbits that they're just not
much<00:03:00.769> of<00:03:00.830> this<00:03:01.040> anymore

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
much of this anymore

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.220 
much of this anymore
and<00:03:01.940> often<00:03:02.299> when<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:02.540> find<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:02.959> it's<00:03:03.110> in

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
and often when you find that it's in

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.870 
and often when you find that it's in
little<00:03:03.470> tiny<00:03:03.620> patches<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.400> there's<00:03:04.549> just<00:03:04.760> not

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
little tiny patches and there's just not

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.289 
little tiny patches and there's just not
enough<00:03:05.269> here's<00:03:06.110> another<00:03:06.260> grown<00:03:06.620> up<00:03:06.830> field

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
enough here's another grown up field

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.550 
enough here's another grown up field
provides<00:03:08.299> food<00:03:08.569> and<00:03:08.720> cover<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.200> kind<00:03:09.350> we're

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
provides food and cover the kind we're

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.520 
provides food and cover the kind we're
after<00:03:09.709> but<00:03:10.549> this<00:03:10.700> is<00:03:10.880> just<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.180> patch<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:11.900> I

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
after but this is just a patch and I

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.250 
after but this is just a patch and I
mean<00:03:12.890> look<00:03:13.040> what's<00:03:13.250> right<00:03:13.459> there<00:03:13.989> dang<00:03:14.989> mac

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
dollars here's a gigantic agricultural

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.729 
dollars here's a gigantic agricultural
field<00:03:19.100> it<00:03:19.280> was<00:03:19.340> corn<00:03:19.609> last<00:03:19.880> summer<00:03:20.440> mode<00:03:21.440> clean

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
field it was corn last summer mode clean

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.979 
field it was corn last summer mode clean
for<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.070> winter<00:03:22.390> it<00:03:23.390> got<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:23.570> little<00:03:23.780> bit<00:03:23.870> of

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
for the winter it got a little bit of

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.770 
for the winter it got a little bit of
rough<00:03:24.140> but<00:03:24.170> it's<00:03:24.530> just<00:03:24.620> along<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.040> ditch

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
rough but it's just along the ditch

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.340 
rough but it's just along the ditch
that's<00:03:26.780> not<00:03:27.019> enough<00:03:28.900> here's<00:03:29.900> another<00:03:30.140> good

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
that's not enough here's another good

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.770 
that's not enough here's another good
little<00:03:30.620> patch<00:03:30.799> for<00:03:31.040> rabbits<00:03:31.459> but<00:03:32.390> it's<00:03:32.570> just

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
little patch for rabbits but it's just

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.190 
little patch for rabbits but it's just
that<00:03:32.989> it's<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.320> patch<00:03:34.120> see<00:03:35.120> it's<00:03:35.780> in<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:35.989> mode

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
that it's a patch see it's in a mode

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.370 
that it's a patch see it's in a mode
feschi<00:03:36.739> pasture<00:03:37.780> houses<00:03:38.780> on<00:03:38.930> one<00:03:39.140> side

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
feschi pasture houses on one side

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.620 
feschi pasture houses on one side
businesses<00:03:42.380> on<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.680> other<00:03:43.390> apartments<00:03:44.390> just

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.910 

not<00:03:47.630> enough<00:03:47.870> habitat<00:03:48.049> for<00:03:48.530> these<00:03:48.680> animals

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
not enough habitat for these animals

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.199 
not enough habitat for these animals
that's<00:03:49.579> the<00:03:49.730> problem

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
that's the problem

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.960 
that's the problem
and<00:03:50.569> so<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.590> solution<00:03:52.069> is<00:03:52.190> to<00:03:52.250> provide<00:03:52.730> more

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
and so the solution is to provide more

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.660 
and so the solution is to provide more
habitat<00:03:53.120> for<00:03:53.630> and<00:03:54.530> if<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:54.709> own<00:03:54.859> land<00:03:54.890> and<00:03:55.489> want

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
habitat for and if you own land and want

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.550 
habitat for and if you own land and want
to<00:03:55.730> manage<00:03:56.030> for<00:03:56.150> these<00:03:56.299> animals<00:03:56.540> there's<00:03:57.380> all

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
to manage for these animals there's all

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.340 
to manage for these animals there's all
kinds<00:03:57.920> of<00:03:57.980> things<00:03:58.040> you<00:03:58.370> can<00:03:58.519> do<00:03:58.700> to<00:03:58.850> help<00:03:58.970> them

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
kinds of things you can do to help them

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.900 
kinds of things you can do to help them
the<00:04:00.350> way<00:04:00.500> I<00:04:00.530> look<00:04:00.859> at<00:04:01.040> it<00:04:01.069> what<00:04:01.400> happened<00:04:01.790> to

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
the way I look at it what happened to

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.289 
the way I look at it what happened to
quail<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:03.160> rabbits<00:04:04.160> is<00:04:04.730> that<00:04:04.970> there's<00:04:05.150> not

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
quail and rabbits is that there's not

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:06.890 
quail and rabbits is that there's not
enough<00:04:05.630> of<00:04:05.780> this<00:04:05.840> rough<00:04:06.109> land

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
enough of this rough land

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.630 
enough of this rough land
I<00:04:06.959> don't<00:04:07.349> blame<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:07.560> on<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.920> predator<00:04:08.280> some

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
I don't blame it on the predator some

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.530 
I don't blame it on the predator some
people<00:04:08.849> blame<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.150> on<00:04:09.209> coyotes<00:04:09.810> on<00:04:10.019> hauls<00:04:11.540> but

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
people blame it on coyotes on hauls but

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.750 
people blame it on coyotes on hauls but
when<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.709> animals<00:04:14.010> have<00:04:14.159> land<00:04:14.459> that<00:04:14.610> looks

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
when the animals have land that looks

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.380 
when the animals have land that looks
like<00:04:14.909> this

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
like this

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.090 
like this
they<00:04:15.480> got<00:04:15.689> the<00:04:15.840> ability<00:04:16.259> natural<00:04:16.410> ability<00:04:16.709> to

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
they got the ability natural ability to

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.300 
they got the ability natural ability to
hide<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:17.930> get<00:04:18.930> away<00:04:19.019> at<00:04:19.709> least<00:04:19.979> in<00:04:20.100> enough

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
hide and get away at least in enough

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.370 
hide and get away at least in enough
numbers<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.880> keep<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.209> population<00:04:21.630> going<00:04:22.199> and

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
numbers to keep the population going and

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.640 
numbers to keep the population going and
so<00:04:23.009> if<00:04:23.340> we<00:04:23.550> want<00:04:23.759> more<00:04:23.789> coiling<00:04:24.300> rabbits<00:04:24.750> the

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
so if we want more coiling rabbits the

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.230 
so if we want more coiling rabbits the
answer<00:04:25.979> is<00:04:26.130> to<00:04:26.250> have<00:04:26.400> more<00:04:26.550> habitat<00:04:27.030> like<00:04:27.180> this

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
answer is to have more habitat like this

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.360 
answer is to have more habitat like this
this<00:04:27.600> rough<00:04:27.840> looking<00:04:28.139> stuff<00:04:28.440> it's<00:04:29.070> what<00:04:29.220> they

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
this rough looking stuff it's what they

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.820 
this rough looking stuff it's what they
need<00:04:29.960> one<00:04:30.960> of<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.080> really<00:04:31.320> good<00:04:31.440> things<00:04:31.500> about

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
need one of the really good things about

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.920 
need one of the really good things about
managing<00:04:32.520> for<00:04:32.789> early<00:04:33.120> successional<00:04:33.690> species

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
managing for early successional species

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.779 
managing for early successional species
is<00:04:34.380> that<00:04:34.560> they're<00:04:34.740> first<00:04:34.979> responders<00:04:35.610> when

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
is that they're first responders when

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.580 
is that they're first responders when
the<00:04:35.880> conditions<00:04:36.360> are<00:04:36.449> right<00:04:36.509> they<00:04:37.259> come<00:04:37.470> in

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
the conditions are right they come in

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.529 
the conditions are right they come in
fast<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:38.759> you<00:04:38.820> don't<00:04:39.000> have<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.180> wait<00:04:39.330> 80

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
fast and so you don't have to wait 80

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.270 
fast and so you don't have to wait 80
years<00:04:39.870> for<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.110> response<00:04:40.560> you<00:04:40.740> can<00:04:40.860> get<00:04:41.010> in<00:04:41.160> just

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
years for a response you can get in just

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.370 
years for a response you can get in just
a<00:04:41.430> few<00:04:41.610> years<00:04:41.690> this<00:04:42.690> what<00:04:42.960> we're<00:04:43.110> looking<00:04:43.289> at

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
a few years this what we're looking at

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.260 
a few years this what we're looking at
now<00:04:43.590> has<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:44.010> right<00:04:44.070> plant<00:04:44.460> conditions<00:04:44.970> and

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
now has the right plant conditions and

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.120 
now has the right plant conditions and
this<00:04:45.389> was<00:04:45.600> a<00:04:46.580> Cove<00:04:47.580> last<00:04:48.210> year<00:04:48.449> part<00:04:48.750> of<00:04:48.840> a<00:04:48.900> lake

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
this was a Cove last year part of a lake

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.500 
this was a Cove last year part of a lake
they<00:04:50.130> drained<00:04:50.430> it<00:04:50.639> and<00:04:50.669> these<00:04:50.789> plants<00:04:51.090> came<00:04:51.360> in

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
they drained it and these plants came in

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.750 
they drained it and these plants came in
they<00:04:51.660> just<00:04:51.840> jumped<00:04:52.199> on<00:04:52.320> it<00:04:52.560> and<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:53.310> animals

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
they just jumped on it and the animals

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.420 
they just jumped on it and the animals
will<00:04:53.970> be<00:04:54.060> following<00:04:54.479> shortly<00:04:55.130> of<00:04:56.130> course<00:04:56.310> this

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
will be following shortly of course this

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.439 
will be following shortly of course this
ain't<00:04:56.580> gonna<00:04:56.729> last<00:04:56.820> very<00:04:57.000> long<00:04:57.300> because

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
ain't gonna last very long because

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.150 
ain't gonna last very long because
they're<00:04:57.630> gonna<00:04:57.750> tree<00:04:57.900> flood<00:04:58.199> it<00:04:58.380> but<00:04:58.620> the

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
they're gonna tree flood it but the

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.510 
they're gonna tree flood it but the
point<00:04:59.400> is<00:04:59.580> that<00:04:59.910> results<00:05:00.479> are<00:05:00.570> quick<00:05:01.520> this

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
point is that results are quick this

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.689 
point is that results are quick this
just<00:05:03.240> to<00:05:03.330> show<00:05:03.360> you<00:05:03.539> those<00:05:03.810> are<00:05:03.990> fish<00:05:04.699> Tyler

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
just to show you those are fish Tyler

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.159 
just to show you those are fish Tyler
with<00:05:05.849> those<00:05:05.970> tires<00:05:06.180> were<00:05:06.360> put<00:05:06.630> there<00:05:06.660> for<00:05:06.960> fish

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
with those tires were put there for fish

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.420 
with those tires were put there for fish
to<00:05:07.740> add<00:05:07.889> some<00:05:08.070> structure<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.639> the<00:05:08.789> lake<00:05:09.479> bottom

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
to add some structure to the lake bottom

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.370 
to add some structure to the lake bottom
and<00:05:11.430> then<00:05:11.610> we<00:05:11.699> look<00:05:11.849> out<00:05:12.060> just<00:05:12.539> just<00:05:12.900> to<00:05:13.020> see<00:05:13.199> it

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
and then we look out just just to see it

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.000 
and then we look out just just to see it
but<00:05:13.770> that's<00:05:13.889> the<00:05:14.070> lake<00:05:14.960> and<00:05:15.960> so<00:05:16.560> the<00:05:16.620> habitats

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
but that's the lake and so the habitats

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.830 
but that's the lake and so the habitats
now<00:05:17.220> for<00:05:17.430> fish<00:05:17.610> is<00:05:17.789> out<00:05:17.940> there<00:05:18.180> it<00:05:18.330> wasn't<00:05:18.510> here

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
now for fish is out there it wasn't here

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.779 
now for fish is out there it wasn't here
it's<00:05:18.930> gone<00:05:19.110> now<00:05:19.470> habitats<00:05:20.250> just<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:20.639> right

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
it's gone now habitats just the right

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.550 
it's gone now habitats just the right
conditions<00:05:21.300> for<00:05:21.389> the<00:05:21.570> animals<00:05:21.930> to<00:05:22.050> live<00:05:22.199> so

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
conditions for the animals to live so

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.580 
conditions for the animals to live so
fish<00:05:23.280> gotta<00:05:23.520> have<00:05:23.669> water<00:05:24.110> small<00:05:25.110> game<00:05:25.380> like

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
fish gotta have water small game like

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.320 
fish gotta have water small game like
rabbits<00:05:25.979> and<00:05:26.130> quail<00:05:26.340> they've<00:05:26.940> got<00:05:27.120> to<00:05:27.210> have

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
rabbits and quail they've got to have

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.909 
rabbits and quail they've got to have
this<00:05:27.570> early<00:05:27.840> successional<00:05:28.409> habitat

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
this early successional habitat

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.080 
this early successional habitat
if<00:05:29.130> this<00:05:29.310> vegetation<00:05:30.139> they<00:05:31.139> go<00:05:31.289> hand<00:05:31.530> in<00:05:31.620> hand

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
if this vegetation they go hand in hand

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.170 
if this vegetation they go hand in hand
this<00:05:33.090> right<00:05:33.360> here<00:05:33.659> is<00:05:33.840> like<00:05:34.050> water<00:05:34.530> to<00:05:34.740> a<00:05:34.770> fish

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
this right here is like water to a fish

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.100 
this right here is like water to a fish
when<00:05:36.180> you're<00:05:36.330> thinking<00:05:36.479> about<00:05:36.599> the<00:05:36.870> small

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
when you're thinking about the small

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.610 
when you're thinking about the small
game<00:05:38.449> some<00:05:39.449> people<00:05:39.720> worry<00:05:39.960> about<00:05:40.080> this<00:05:40.380> rough

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
game some people worry about this rough

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.379 
game some people worry about this rough
land<00:05:40.889> like<00:05:41.280> this<00:05:42.860> brushy

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
land like this brushy

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:47.029 
land like this brushy
