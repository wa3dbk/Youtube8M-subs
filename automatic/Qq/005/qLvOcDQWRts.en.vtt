00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:07.750
 ok let's start this brief review 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:11.650
 of the tv 5200 tow that comes with 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.929
 operating system windows 8.1 we are going to 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.450
 talk the outside has a display 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:22.970
 8 inches with a resolution of 1280 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:26.320
 x 800 pixels 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.930
 this here we can see the ports 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.920
 external we have here the solid we have 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.769
 the mini jack for usb port 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:41.600
 micro hdmi adapter that connects to 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:45.650
 any tv that has hdmi port comes 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.790
 for micro sd memory supports up to 64 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:53.420
 gb comes with microphone volume up 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.739
 below and a key for windows we are going to 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.739
 see the ignition of it 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.420
 and reviewing the technical characteristics 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.970
 comes with a gig of ram memory a 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:14.950
 Intel core 4-core processor at 1.3 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:19.830
 gigahertz the model is the zeta 370 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.830
 sorry z 37 35 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.100
 notice that it is quite fast 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.000
 although the characteristics 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.430
 they have 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.130
 that performance is quite modest 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.130
 it's not good enough it comes with a 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.370
 2 megapixel front camera and one 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.390
 rear camera in the same way with 2 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.600
 megapixels for the support of 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.900
 video calls this is not a very 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.080
 basically the good tablet basically 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.530
 no tablet but at least it brings 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.810
 camera for everything that is the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.869
 use by skype for example let's 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.710
 to the main menu here we see 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.170
 applications in the metro interface 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.329
 notice that pretty fluid we return 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.060
 here we have all the applications 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:13.840
 you can perfectly install a 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.840
 microsoft office 2013 as seen here 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:22.040
 and the operation can be said that 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.930
 quite correct to say it of some 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.879
 one of the shortcomings that it has is 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.219
 that comes with an internal memory of 16 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.499
 gigas and used nothing else 9 with 64 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:33.489
 gigas therefore it is practically 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:38.829
 mandatory the installation of a micro 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.829
 sd in this case 64 gigs 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.620
 and the facilities are made in the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.470
 same let's see it for example the 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.470
 obviously using skype 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.640
 is going to ask for an account and I do not have it 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.320
 installed but it's really the 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.340
 operation let's see now the the 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.340
 internet its power 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.150
 here we notice that is within the 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.020
 that is pretty fast 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.020
 functioning 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.659
 this will depend on 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.659
 of how internet speed is 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.439
 here the interface between screen and 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:34.110
 screens also allow changes of 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:34.110
 applications is pretty fluid 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.170
 and he shares there are networks 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.030
 social 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:50.000
 let's try a moment is what it is 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.000
 the part of the microsoft office 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.380
 for example the word application 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.599
 i 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.599
 and we have it open 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.070
 they closed us 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.329
 ah 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.810
 and now let's try the application of 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.810
 cel 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.990
 we already have here to the right 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.020
 let's select what we have outside 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.370
 and here we have the third note that it is 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.380
 pretty fluid despite the fact that only 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.410
 has a gig of ram and how it is 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.510
 can install full applications 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.510
 as in this case is the google chrome 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.099
 How are we doing? 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.729
 and is already open google chrome 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.860
 well then it was the review to see a 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:26.560
 little what is the behavior of the 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.920
 tablet will be where v 5200 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.700
 and we proceed 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.700
 on off
