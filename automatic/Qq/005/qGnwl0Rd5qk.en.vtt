00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 or the betty series I bring her a new role in 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.649
 which we will achieve the achievement of 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.580
 ballista the third of the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.650
 snipers 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.719
 and with which already 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.930
 the third of the fourth and we would stay 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:19.689
 then one more for the diamond not those of 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.689
 the camouflages are the same as with 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:26.259
 the previous ones that are in case they do not 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:30.550
 you know some 250 shots for karate 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:33.489
 zafón with a single shot is enough and 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.360
 Once that is done, we allied ourselves with 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.360
 special 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.150
 what good then if they are mine but 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.450
 come on if I do not then say what they are when 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.500
 we arrived 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:51.710
 what are we going to say about the list worth 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.710
 this is my opinion more than anything is just 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.610
 my opinion I see it a bit as if it was 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:04.420
 a mixture between the language if he 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.420
 and lsr because it's pretty fast 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.290
 but at the same time 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.240
 does not have that power that lsr for this 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.800
 why also young extreme is worth 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.680
 why not 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.460
 do not kill practice you can kill with a shot 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.380
 but the percentage of hits markers is 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.380
 You're almost always going to make a hit 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.719
 market although you can kill a shot 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.950
 and then of course it comes much better is in 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:35.700
 extreme and then on the subject of doing 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:39.299
 quick weeks code with this weapon 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.790
 well, it's pretty decent enough 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.220
 pretty good no 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.350
 ones like others that is even weird with 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.040
 try the joker or not will not be very 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.920
 strange to try is with the swap and then 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.860
 that on the part of that ere does not have a 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.650
 little bit as well as more power not 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.860
 average power of the quick as you can 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.860
 see here 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.550
 and nobody and then for the part of them 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.440
 valls it is that it is very fast 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.370
 it's not like they were saying was that what 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.599
 of the submachine gun 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.319
 but let's give you a quick recharge 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:22.380
 quite pretty fast not quite 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:27.260
 effective then I see it in the end I 'll 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.260
 I have seen as a kind of mixture of 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.520
 I'm still staying with that of ere is worth 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.050
 but after that for the moment 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.360
 I do not know what the x will be like to remember the 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.120
 moment after I would be 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.320
 with the ballista and because it is a norm 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.410
 quite comfortable not good that's there 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.720
 we open in alcalá tesei font vale and what 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.220
 what we have to do is good here is 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.510
 that went straight to the skulls 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.430
 but what should we do? 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.140
 directly as they are 10 shots far 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:06.730
 as above applies to this as 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.590
 and like us because if it's one time 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.210
 fuck what our videos said 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.970
 where I make distant shots in the 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.850
 screens, I do not know if you're worth 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.310
 some places in the three far away that 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.960
 I do then look general for that they are 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.960
 these videos not to serve as something 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.909
 then it would be 50 casualties in the csd 50 casualties 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.400
 no advantages 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:34.609
 well here I would do much last shot 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.349
 far and good as I directly do 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.329
 also the double lowered as we would pass 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.920
 to the low double 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.620
 here is severe carbon ideas and 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.049
 low double organs and to do it from 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.769
 the 50 casualties are made to be the nor advantages 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.389
 directly because we get to before 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.010
 to start with everything and we created the 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.470
 classes without without anything to 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.680
 so they can tell us all and give us 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.239
 the camouflages as soon as possible do not look 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.890
 here you see the theme is that the theme of 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.950
 quick is not going anything wrong you know 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:12.110
 this would be the last double low with here 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:14.450
 would give us in the running it's worth as a post 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.850
 before low but good here gives us the 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.139
 suffering and also in the art of 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.930
 war' 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.750
 and nothing because we would touch the days 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.470
 bloodthirsty 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.470
 I have put you 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:34.510
 56 I think I do not know how many but we're going 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.850
 not going to put them all is that we 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.660
 they make the videos very long but let's go 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.940
 that with the theme of the bloodthirsty and 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.200
 you see what can be done by moving around 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.110
 the screen that does not need to stay 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.970
 that in fact they do better by moving 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.000
 by the screens that staying one on 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.070
 a place in a corner or the name 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.540
 out to camp but problem was left here 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.290
 until it happens to someone you know why 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:02.170
 like you throw your life in making a 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.030
 bloodthirsty and as he does not want to show 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.730
 our life we want to get more 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.190
 camouflage more weapons because the best is 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.689
 move move what happens is that if it is 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:18.709
 true that fuck if you take four casualties 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:18.709
 the last one goes down as intelligent languages 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:26.650
 you cover yourself better than a low we go 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:31.500
 to good here also doing the 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.500
 bloodthirsty encounters but good 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.550
 there's not much more to say about nerva 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:41.969
 list to me in general I liked not 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:46.770
 it is a bad weapon worth 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:48.840
 it's for me and I feel quite comfortable 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:53.310
 and nothing 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.849
 On the other hand, I already want to finish 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.099
 with the snipers because 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:00.379
 I want to try more weapons as I said 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:02.509
 previous the video because it ends up tiring a 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:05.479
 little to get so many stories 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:07.729
 with the sniper because yes that 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:12.420
 you can do quick that you can go by 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:15.640
 there on the screen killing but it tires 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:18.040
 the gusts with frank or shooter that I 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.140
 you can do with an assault rifle with 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:25.540
 a submachine gun and that is also fun 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:27.520
 it is in plan kill for killing there pulled in 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.370
 the game was not only the theme of the 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.300
 with flowers and for having the diamond 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.300
 I also want to finish 

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:39.199
 and I have decided after this I threw myself 

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:42.019
 to the shotgun 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:44.689
 I do not know why we started 

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:49.039
 groups of four the specials that were 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:52.219
 four the good thing the last one did 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:56.009
 bloodthirsty the heavy east of the shield 

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:59.460
 of the time in writing 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:03.040
 and good here we would have the east 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.540
 now he did not say look at the kites because 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.610
 since they are also in paintings poets 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:10.660
 to make groups of four I do not know 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:14.260
 so with a single shot they spend 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.600
 nothing that thanks to those who are 

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:21.580
 Subscribe to the ones you like them 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:23.510
 to which good everything is appreciated and good 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.820
 what 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:29.510
 and we will continue uploading videos I have 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:31.490
 I also thought to make more videos inside 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:35.320
 shortly from some videos about 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:37.150
 Campaign mode and provided 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.610
 of where the information is from 

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.950
 enemy and the challenges that need to be done 

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.720
 and things like that and for the moment nothing here 

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:47.320
 I leave the previous road to call the 

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:51.120
 Previous broken and diamond and good that we 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.120
 we see in the next see you later
