00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
say the JPEG for the product if you

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.010 
say the JPEG for the product if you
double<00:00:37.710> click<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.820> shape<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.329> will<00:00:39.480> open<00:00:39.809> the

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
would start creating a line diagram line

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.110 
would start creating a line diagram line
diagrams<00:02:45.470> are<00:02:45.650> very<00:02:45.799> nice<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.730> use<00:02:46.880> in<00:02:47.060> the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
diagrams are very nice to use in the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.569 
diagrams are very nice to use in the
sales<00:02:47.390> process<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:49.220> I'll<00:02:49.310> show<00:02:49.430> you<00:02:49.459> a

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
sales process and I'll show you a

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.670 
sales process and I'll show you a
finished<00:02:50.000> version<00:02:50.900> of<00:02:51.140> one<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.350> these<00:02:51.470> right

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
finished version of one of these right

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.160 
finished version of one of these right
now<00:02:51.829> pull<00:02:52.549> up<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.820> sample<00:02:53.299> project<00:02:53.780> file<00:02:53.930> here

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
now pull up a sample project file here

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.590 
now pull up a sample project file here
and<00:02:54.350> you<00:02:54.650> can<00:02:54.769> see<00:02:54.950> how<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.209> finished<00:02:56.209> line

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
and you can see how a finished line

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.530 
and you can see how a finished line
diagram<00:02:57.019> can<00:02:57.320> look
