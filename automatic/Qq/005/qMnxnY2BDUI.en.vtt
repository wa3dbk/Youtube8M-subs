00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.060 

now<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> saddle<00:00:19.320> pad<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.619> one<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.890> most

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
now a saddle pad is one of the most

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.890 
now a saddle pad is one of the most
important<00:00:20.550> pieces<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.880> tack<00:00:21.179> that<00:00:21.210> can<00:00:21.630> affect

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
your horses comfort obviously the idea

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.569 
your horses comfort obviously the idea
of<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.630> pad<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.590> protect<00:00:25.949> your<00:00:26.099> horse<00:00:26.250> from

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
of a pad is to protect your horse from

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.249 
of a pad is to protect your horse from
pressure<00:00:26.789> points<00:00:27.239> and<00:00:27.359> soreness<00:00:27.689> coming<00:00:28.109> from

the<00:00:28.349> saddle<00:00:28.970> what<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> folks<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.449> CSI<00:00:30.960> have

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
the saddle what the folks that CSI have

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.439 
the saddle what the folks that CSI have
done<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.619> create<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> saddle<00:00:32.340> pad<00:00:32.519> it<00:00:33.030> becomes<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
done is create a saddle pad it becomes a

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.140 
done is create a saddle pad it becomes a
