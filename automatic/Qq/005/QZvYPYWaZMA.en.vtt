00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:22.490
 8:00 part stick of you But to 8 back 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:27.230
 So heartwarming But to strike 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.330
 Please put your feet to match the box to use a friend 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.800
 eh 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:35.120
 At first we added motion 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.370
 If this is up then this is a distraction 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.480
 Upline 4 is 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:45.050
 One that was not part was missing leg thinking just went here 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.050
 The unevenness of the entrance decreases when going from the up line 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.750
 So please think about it yourself 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.620
 And 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.710
 After all we enter in place Kawamura 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:59.240
 When I take my weight, I put these props in three places. 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.420
 It becomes hard 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:11.189
 Both the sheet and the item are hard to slip 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.189
 Please try various devises The easy strongest set in Aichi store is this 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.160
 Picnic sheet 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.870
 2 items 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.290
 there 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.180
 A good block 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.180
 Tiny for out 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:35.530
 I think that the seat to do is good not in 5.4 which belongs to Tourism League West 2.7 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.929
 Can relay from here 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.189
 I'm supposed to take a ride on the house of the virus movement without having got it , so please do my best at the place where you climb 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.540
 From us down the 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.340
 So distance is out 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.750
 Up to this point, and easy since 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.080
 It is possible only by swinging 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.990
 I think it can be done for children 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.929
 Gudo 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.460
 I am 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.460
 me 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.460
 bea 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.740
 ana 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.569
 Naa
