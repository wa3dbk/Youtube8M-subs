line of cymbals the rock line of symbols
is<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.290> little<00:00:13.679> different<00:00:14.130> than<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.940> s-series

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
is a little different than the s-series

cymbals that they have these are much

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.279 
cymbals that they have these are much
heavier<00:00:19.430> designed<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.580> cut<00:00:20.880> through

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
heavier designed to cut through

hand hammered and hand laid these are

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.900 
hand hammered and hand laid these are
just<00:00:28.140> not<00:00:28.349> worked<00:00:28.769> as<00:00:29.039> much<00:00:29.580> with<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
just not worked as much with the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.569 
just not worked as much with the
hammering<00:00:30.599> as<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.470> s-series<00:00:32.070> if<00:00:32.430> you're

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
hammering as the s-series if you're

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.870 
hammering as the s-series if you're
familiar<00:00:32.820> with<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.800> this<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:35.040> turn<00:00:35.070> produces<00:00:35.820> a

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
familiar with it this in turn produces a

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.880 
familiar with it this in turn produces a
cymbal<00:00:36.360> that's<00:00:36.510> brighter<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.380> like<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.829> said

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
cymbal that's brighter and like I said

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.310 
cymbal that's brighter and like I said
earlier<00:00:38.610> we'll<00:00:39.239> cut<00:00:39.540> through<00:00:39.690> amplified

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
earlier we'll cut through amplified

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.979 
earlier we'll cut through amplified
music<00:00:40.800> better<00:00:41.129> than<00:00:41.280> like<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.030> s-series

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
music better than like the s-series

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:58.650 
music better than like the s-series
let's<00:00:43.620> give<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.010> listen

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660

the<00:00:59.530> Bell<00:00:59.769> is<00:00:59.800> huge<00:01:00.370> and<00:01:00.699> it's<00:01:01.000> really<00:01:01.329> kind<00:01:01.690> I

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
the Bell is huge and it's really kind I

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.469 
the Bell is huge and it's really kind I
can't<00:01:02.500> emphasize<00:01:02.980> enough<00:01:03.640> to<00:01:03.820> you<00:01:03.940> guys<00:01:04.150> how

can't emphasize enough to you guys how
heavy<00:01:04.809> these<00:01:05.080> symbols<00:01:05.530> are<00:01:05.710> these<00:01:05.979> are

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
heavy these symbols are these are

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.990 
heavy these symbols are these are
rough-and-tumble<00:01:07.780> symbols

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.030 

most<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.020> guys<00:01:13.200> were<00:01:13.500> familiar<00:01:13.740> with

most of you guys were familiar with
seven<00:01:14.700> teenage<00:01:15.000> crashes<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.870> up<00:01:16.050> know<00:01:16.980> that

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
seven teenage crashes and up know that

seven teenage crashes and up know that
they<00:01:17.400> are<00:01:17.550> a<00:01:17.580> heavier<00:01:18.000> symbol<00:01:18.510> they<00:01:18.810> resonate

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
they are a heavier symbol they resonate

they are a heavier symbol they resonate
a<00:01:19.620> lot<00:01:20.070> longer<00:01:20.610> than<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.600> thinner<00:01:21.900> weights
