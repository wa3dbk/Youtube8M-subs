could actually turn on my comp at that

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.530 
could actually turn on my comp at that
point<00:04:22.390> but<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:23.590> other<00:04:23.740> reason<00:04:23.860> why<00:04:24.070> this<00:04:24.130> vid

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540

it's getting the center part of the last

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.760 
it's getting the center part of the last
video<00:04:28.570> was<00:04:28.780> actually<00:04:28.990> really<00:04:29.410> short<00:04:29.650> is

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
video was actually really short is

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.340 
video was actually really short is

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
because only had like less than a minute

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.770 
because only had like less than a minute
of<00:04:32.830> record<00:04:33.250> time<00:04:33.430> left<00:04:33.700> because<00:04:34.330> of<00:04:34.450> Harry<00:04:34.630> was

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780

about<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:35.020> die<00:04:35.170> I<00:04:35.410> guess<00:04:36.070> xle<00:04:36.550> like<00:04:36.730> left<00:04:36.940> this

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
about to die I guess xle like left this

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.570 
about to die I guess xle like left this
camera<00:04:37.390> at<00:04:37.660> some<00:04:37.810> point<00:04:38.050> but<00:04:38.740> anyways<00:04:38.980> that's
