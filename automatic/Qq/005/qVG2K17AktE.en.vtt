00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
take that yardstick and you're going to

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.149 
take that yardstick and you're going to
want<00:01:05.170> to<00:01:05.260> align<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:05.830> to<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:06.790> body<00:01:07.560> now<00:01:08.560> if<00:01:08.890> your

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
want to align it to the body now if your

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
yardstick is coming out more on the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.280 
yardstick is coming out more on the
bottom<00:01:23.440> and<00:01:23.710> you<00:01:24.220> have<00:01:24.370> a<00:01:24.400> broader<00:01:24.700> hip<00:01:25.000> line

bottom and you have a broader hip line

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.980 
bottom and you have a broader hip line
then<00:01:26.290> most<00:01:26.560> likely<00:01:26.920> you're<00:01:27.100> a<00:01:27.130> sapphire<00:01:27.990> if

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
then most likely you're a sapphire if

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.710 
then most likely you're a sapphire if
the<00:01:29.860> yardstick<00:01:30.370> goes<00:01:30.760> straight<00:01:31.210> up<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:31.600> down

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
the yardstick goes straight up and down

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.010 
the yardstick goes straight up and down
vertically<00:01:32.640> then<00:01:33.640> you're<00:01:33.850> either<00:01:34.060> a<00:01:34.420> diamond

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
vertically then you're either a diamond

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.180 
vertically then you're either a diamond
or<00:01:35.140> an<00:01:35.620> emerald<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:38.170> looking<00:01:38.530> at<00:01:38.650> Lisa's<00:01:39.040> body

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
or an emerald so looking at Lisa's body

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.880 
or an emerald so looking at Lisa's body
shape<00:01:39.580> here<00:01:39.909> we<00:01:40.600> have<00:01:40.870> we<00:01:41.170> noticed<00:01:41.500> that<00:01:41.530> she

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
shape here we have we noticed that she

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.000 
shape here we have we noticed that she
is<00:01:42.100> perfectly<00:01:42.640> vertical<00:01:43.530> from<00:01:44.530> her<00:01:44.680> shoulder

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
is perfectly vertical from her shoulder

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.480 
is perfectly vertical from her shoulder
to<00:01:45.040> her<00:01:45.520> hip<00:01:46.440> now<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.500> next<00:01:47.830> step<00:01:48.010> is<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.310> look

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
to her hip now the next step is to look

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.280 
to her hip now the next step is to look
at<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.909> distance<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.780> waist<00:01:49.960> comes

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
at the distance that the waist comes

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.430 
at the distance that the waist comes
from<00:01:50.770> from<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.670> ruler<00:01:52.030> here<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:52.930> here<00:01:53.320> we

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
from from the ruler here so you here we

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.580 
from from the ruler here so you here we
have<00:01:53.650> one<00:01:54.040> inch<00:01:54.280> difference<00:01:54.970> if<00:01:55.510> your<00:01:56.200> waist

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
have one inch difference if your waist

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.860 
have one inch difference if your waist
is<00:01:56.890> less<00:01:57.370> than<00:01:58.060> two<00:01:58.360> inches

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
is less than two inches

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.290 
is less than two inches
you're<00:01:59.409> an<00:01:59.500> emerald<00:01:59.920> so<00:02:00.520> Lisa's<00:02:00.850> body<00:02:01.000> shape

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
you're an emerald so Lisa's body shape

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.620 
you're an emerald so Lisa's body shape
is<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.930> precious<00:02:02.290> emerald<00:02:02.590> if<00:02:03.150> her<00:02:04.150> body<00:02:04.390> shape

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
is a precious emerald if her body shape

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.930 
is a precious emerald if her body shape
had<00:02:04.900> at<00:02:05.049> least<00:02:05.229> two<00:02:05.710> inches<00:02:06.220> at<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.460> waist

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
had at least two inches at the waist

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.640 
had at least two inches at the waist
then<00:02:07.720> she<00:02:08.049> would<00:02:08.200> be<00:02:08.379> a<00:02:08.590> diamond<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:10.509> that<00:02:11.470> is

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
then she would be a diamond and that is

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.090 
then she would be a diamond and that is
how<00:02:11.769> you<00:02:11.830> determine<00:02:12.099> your<00:02:12.790> body<00:02:12.940> shape<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.890> for

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
how you determine your body shape so for

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.940 
how you determine your body shape so for
those<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.430> who<00:02:15.640> don't<00:02:15.850> know<00:02:16.290> last<00:02:17.290> March

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
those of you who don't know last March

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.700 
those of you who don't know last March
of<00:02:18.190> 2013

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
of 2013

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.490 
of 2013
I<00:02:19.770> designed<00:02:20.520> some<00:02:20.880> clothing<00:02:21.810> specifically

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
I designed some clothing specifically

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.130 
I designed some clothing specifically
for<00:02:22.830> these<00:02:23.130> four<00:02:23.370> body<00:02:23.580> shapes<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.300> it's

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
for these four body shapes and it's

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.920 
for these four body shapes and it's
called<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.830> dress<00:02:26.100> dresses<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:27.570> this<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.840> an

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
called the dress dresses so this is an

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.690 
called the dress dresses so this is an
example<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.500> one<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.830> dress<00:02:29.040> dresses

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700
