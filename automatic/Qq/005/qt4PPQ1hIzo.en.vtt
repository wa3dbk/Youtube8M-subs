00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
hi I'm AJ I'm 39 years old and I suffer

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.299 
hi I'm AJ I'm 39 years old and I suffer
from<00:00:05.580> Parkinson's<00:00:05.879> disease<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:06.870> was<00:00:07.859> diagnosed

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
from Parkinson's disease I was diagnosed

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.709 
from Parkinson's disease I was diagnosed
four<00:00:08.580> years<00:00:08.820> ago<00:00:08.940> when<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.690> was<00:00:09.900> thin<00:00:10.349> five<00:00:10.590> and

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
four years ago when I was thin five and

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.450 
four years ago when I was thin five and
I've<00:00:12.719> since<00:00:13.290> undergone<00:00:13.710> deep<00:00:14.250> brain

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
I've since undergone deep brain

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.779 
I've since undergone deep brain
stimulation<00:00:15.000> surgery<00:00:16.220> this<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.400> procedure

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
stimulation surgery this is a procedure

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.109 
stimulation surgery this is a procedure
whereby<00:00:18.439> two<00:00:19.439> probes<00:00:19.710> dropped<00:00:20.130> deep<00:00:20.730> into<00:00:21.000> my

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
whereby two probes dropped deep into my

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.650 
whereby two probes dropped deep into my
brain<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.660> hooked<00:00:22.320> up<00:00:22.500> by<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.789> wire<00:00:24.210> down<00:00:24.420> money

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
brain and hooked up by a wire down money

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.830 
brain and hooked up by a wire down money
to<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> pacemaker<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:26.039> my<00:00:26.220> chest<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:27.390> provides

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
to a pacemaker in my chest this provides

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.470 
to a pacemaker in my chest this provides
a<00:00:28.230> steady<00:00:28.470> stream<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.859> electricity<00:00:29.330> to<00:00:30.330> my

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
a steady stream of electricity to my

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.410 
a steady stream of electricity to my
brain<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.880> per<00:00:32.880> second<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.430> there's<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.880> major

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
brain and per second so there's a major

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.310 
brain and per second so there's a major
effect<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:36.899> my<00:00:37.079> life<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.879> and<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.450> major<00:00:39.719> effect

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
effect on my life and and a major effect

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.110 
effect on my life and and a major effect
on<00:00:40.410> my<00:00:40.559> family's<00:00:40.950> life<00:00:41.129> which<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.940> main

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
on my family's life which is the main

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.590 
on my family's life which is the main
thing<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:44.000> today<00:00:45.000> I'd<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.420> show<00:00:45.570> you

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
thing and today I'd like to show you

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.430 
thing and today I'd like to show you
what<00:00:45.750> happens<00:00:46.020> when<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.230> tell<00:00:46.410> my

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
what happens when I tell my

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.869 
what happens when I tell my
neurostimulator<00:00:47.250> off<00:00:48.050> now<00:00:49.489> it's<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.760> after

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
neurostimulator off now it's just after

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.770 
neurostimulator off now it's just after
11:00<00:00:51.239> a.m.<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:53.059> time<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.420> hit<00:00:54.600> my

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
11:00 a.m. so it's time that I hit my

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.299 
11:00 a.m. so it's time that I hit my
second<00:00:55.350> dose<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.620> medication<00:00:55.829> for<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
second dose of medication for the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.430 
second dose of medication for the
morning<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.329> my<00:00:57.480> first<00:00:57.629> dose<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.079> pretty

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
morning and so my first dose is pretty

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.010 
morning and so my first dose is pretty
much<00:00:58.590> all<00:00:58.739> got<00:00:58.920> worn<00:00:59.160> off<00:00:59.280> so<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> good

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
much all got worn off so this is a good

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.869 
much all got worn off so this is a good
example<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.590> what<00:01:01.770> I'd<00:01:01.890> be<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.219> when<00:01:02.550> I'd<00:01:02.670> be

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
example of what I'd be like when I'd be

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.840 
example of what I'd be like when I'd be
sort<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.239> off<00:01:03.539> off<00:01:03.920> with<00:01:04.920> no<00:01:05.100> medication<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.729> my

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
sort of off off with no medication in my

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.460 
sort of off off with no medication in my
system<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.770> no<00:01:07.770> power<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:09.600> show<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
system and no power to show you the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.630 
system and no power to show you the
dramatic<00:01:11.010> effect<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.689> I<00:01:12.689> will<00:01:13.680> demonstrate

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
dramatic effect and I will demonstrate

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:24.230 
dramatic effect and I will demonstrate
this<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.540> me<00:01:15.750> with<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.890> power<00:01:17.100> on

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.880 

I'm<00:01:24.690> not<00:01:24.930> making<00:01:26.270> happy<00:01:27.270> little<00:01:27.450> faces<00:01:28.050> for

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
I'm not making happy little faces for

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.130 
I'm not making happy little faces for
the<00:01:28.950> video<00:01:29.160> these<00:01:29.580> are<00:01:29.810> tests<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
the video these are tests that the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.300 
the video these are tests that the
neurologists<00:01:31.860> make<00:01:32.220> us<00:01:32.370> do<00:01:33.860> to<00:01:34.860> test<00:01:35.100> our

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
neurologists make us do to test our

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.230 
neurologists make us do to test our
reflexes<00:01:35.940> as<00:01:36.510> you<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:36.900> see<00:01:37.110> they're<00:01:37.350> wiggling

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
reflexes as you can see they're wiggling

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.680 
reflexes as you can see they're wiggling
moving<00:01:39.240> fine<00:01:40.370> and<00:01:41.370> I've<00:01:41.490> got<00:01:41.820> very<00:01:42.450> good

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
moving fine and I've got very good

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:50.350 
moving fine and I've got very good
movement<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:45.410> this<00:01:46.410> is<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:48.080> remote<00:01:49.080> control

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
movement and this is the remote control

00:01:50.360 --> 00:02:01.990 
movement and this is the remote control
and<00:01:53.060> this<00:01:54.060> chicks<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.660> I<00:01:54.750> want<00:01:57.770> on<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.130> okay

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.199 

and<00:02:03.830> this<00:02:04.830> is<00:02:04.890> me<00:02:05.899> let<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.050> turn<00:02:07.170> off<00:02:07.320> oh<00:02:11.209> you

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
and this is me let you turn off oh you

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.900 
and this is me let you turn off oh you
won't<00:02:12.360> really<00:02:12.570> read<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:12.959> checking<00:02:13.530> too<00:02:13.680> much

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
won't really read that checking too much

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.940 
won't really read that checking too much
so<00:02:14.910> it's<00:02:15.030> almost<00:02:15.300> an<00:02:15.600> instantaneous<00:02:16.110> reaction

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
so it's almost an instantaneous reaction

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:25.770 
so it's almost an instantaneous reaction
I<00:02:18.290> can't<00:02:19.290> control<00:02:20.250> this

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.020 

it<00:02:26.320> shook<00:02:26.650> some<00:02:26.860> quality<00:02:27.250> cocktails<00:02:27.700> with<00:02:27.910> the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
it shook some quality cocktails with the

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.800 
it shook some quality cocktails with the
right<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:29.380> left<00:02:29.590> just<00:02:30.220> looks<00:02:31.000> like<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.480> royal

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
right the left just looks like the royal

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:40.740 
right the left just looks like the royal
wave<00:02:34.380> my<00:02:35.380> voice<00:02:35.650> is<00:02:37.710> gone<00:02:38.710> it's<00:02:39.450> harder<00:02:40.450> for<00:02:40.480> me

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
wave my voice is gone it's harder for me

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.850 
wave my voice is gone it's harder for me
to<00:02:40.870> keep<00:02:41.050> key<00:02:41.680> get<00:02:41.920> words<00:02:42.280> out<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:42.910> speak<00:02:43.860> I'm

completely rigid and if I try to stand

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.060 
completely rigid and if I try to stand
up<00:02:49.060> I'd<00:02:49.240> fall<00:02:51.450> if<00:02:52.450> anyone<00:02:52.900> thinks<00:02:53.620> I'm<00:02:53.830> faking

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
up I'd fall if anyone thinks I'm faking

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:00.840

this<00:02:54.480> I'm<00:02:55.480> not<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:57.100> can't<00:02:58.650> control<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.980> tremors

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
this I'm not I can't control the tremors

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.600 
this I'm not I can't control the tremors
in<00:03:01.320> just<00:03:02.320> kinesia<00:03:02.620> of<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:02.890> twisting<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.489> when
