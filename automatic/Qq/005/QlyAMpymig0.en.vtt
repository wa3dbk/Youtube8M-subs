playing<00:00:30.599> acre<00:00:30.719> and<00:00:31.619> echo<00:00:31.950> reads<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.969> when<00:00:33.630> you

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
playing acre and echo reads so when you

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.900 
playing acre and echo reads so when you
d<00:00:33.960> cloak<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.410> must<00:00:34.559> use<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.920> curved<00:00:35.339> to<00:00:35.699> or

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
d cloak you must use the curved to or

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.759 
d cloak you must use the curved to or
other<00:00:36.359> curve<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.929> template<00:00:37.320> instead<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
other curve to template instead of the

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:39.410 
other curve to template instead of the
two<00:00:37.890> straight<00:00:38.160> template<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.179> means

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
two straight template so that means

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.029 
two straight template so that means
usually<00:00:40.140> when<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.320> decloaking<00:00:40.679> i'll<00:00:40.890> grab

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 
usually when you decloaking i'll grab

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:43.610 
usually when you decloaking i'll grab
one<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.160> these<00:00:42.079> you<00:00:43.079> get<00:00:43.199> one<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.379> these<00:00:43.440> tokens

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
one of these you get one of these tokens

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.970 
one of these you get one of these tokens
UD<00:00:44.249> cloak<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.999> remove<00:00:45.179> this<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.660> go<00:00:45.980> you

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
UD cloak you remove this and you go you

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.380 
UD cloak you remove this and you go you
do<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> sieve<00:00:47.399> barrel<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.969> essentially<00:00:48.210> just

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
do a sieve barrel you essentially just

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.360 
do a sieve barrel you essentially just
move<00:00:48.570> quite<00:00:49.379> far<00:00:49.589> away<00:00:49.739> that's<00:00:50.010> that's<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
move quite far away that's that's a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.939 
move quite far away that's that's a
large<00:00:50.550> bowel<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.480> other<00:00:51.600> way<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.620> sencha

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
large bowel the other way so you sencha

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.329 
large bowel the other way so you sencha
lee<00:00:53.039> get<00:00:53.159> around<00:00:53.909> about<00:00:54.120> three<00:00:55.339> options

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
lee get around about three options

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.809 
lee get around about three options
before<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.120> move<00:00:57.300> which<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.710> insane<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> if

00:00:59.809 --> 00:00:59.819 
before you move which is insane so if

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:01.880 
before you move which is insane so if
you're<00:00:59.909> doing<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.089> tube<00:01:00.239> angle<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.319> get<00:01:01.769> an

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
you're doing a tube angle you can get an

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.670 
you're doing a tube angle you can get an
echo<00:01:02.460> however<00:01:02.789> does<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:04.110> same<00:01:04.290> thing<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:04.589> on

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
echo however does the same thing but on

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.430 
echo however does the same thing but on
this<00:01:05.550> jelly<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.690> we<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.020> instead<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.290> just

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
this jelly so we can do instead of just

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.470 
this jelly so we can do instead of just
going<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:08.040> three<00:01:08.370> spade<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.670> go<00:01:08.760> six<00:01:09.210> spaces

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
going to three spade you go six spaces

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.840 
going to three spade you go six spaces
relatively<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.620> can<00:01:10.740> go<00:01:10.860> up<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.760> this

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
relatively so you can go up on this

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.290 
relatively so you can go up on this
angle<00:01:12.180> or<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.690> come<00:01:12.900> back<00:01:13.500> down<00:01:13.740> here

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
angle or you can come back down here

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.360 
angle or you can come back down here
yeah<00:01:15.300> right<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.260> you<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.280> do

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
yeah right it's so you can you can do

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.770 
yeah right it's so you can you can do
basically<00:01:17.610> decide<00:01:17.970> where<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.450> want<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.690> be

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
basically decide where you want to be

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.280 
basically decide where you want to be
after<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.200> program<00:01:19.500> your<00:01:19.530> dial<00:01:19.770> wait<00:01:21.290> it's

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
after you program your dial wait it's

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.780 
after you program your dial wait it's
it's<00:01:22.560> actually<00:01:22.950> really<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.280> lot<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.520> option

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
it's actually really a lot of option

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.860 
it's actually really a lot of option
comes<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.150> front<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.450> well<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.720> if<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
comes on the front as well so if you

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.030 
comes on the front as well so if you
want<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.170> nip<00:01:25.350> around<00:01:25.590> an<00:01:25.650> asteroid<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
want to just nip around an asteroid you

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.710 
want to just nip around an asteroid you
can<00:01:26.160> do<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.730> then<00:01:26.790> fall<00:01:27.330> around<00:01:27.540> with

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
can do that and then fall around with

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.590 
can do that and then fall around with
another<00:01:27.840> turn<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.760> interdict<00:01:29.760> field<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.330> to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
another turn it's interdict field so to

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.600 
another turn it's interdict field so to
make<00:01:31.080> this<00:01:31.200> possible<00:01:31.440> I've<00:01:32.040> taken<00:01:32.250> advanced

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
make this possible I've taken advanced

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.520 
make this possible I've taken advanced
cloaking<00:01:32.700> device<00:01:33.060> which<00:01:34.020> lets<00:01:34.260> you<00:01:34.350> take<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
cloaking device which lets you take a

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.190 
cloaking device which lets you take a
cloak<00:01:34.770> after<00:01:35.190> you<00:01:35.280> shoot<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.850> free<00:01:36.200> seems

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
cloak after you shoot for free seems

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.100 
cloak after you shoot for free seems
good<00:01:37.380> which<00:01:37.830> is<00:01:37.860> very<00:01:38.160> good<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.110> veterans

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
good which is very good and veterans

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.930 
good which is very good and veterans
think<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.680> make<00:01:40.800> sure<00:01:40.980> he<00:01:41.310> shoots<00:01:41.520> quite

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
think so to make sure he shoots quite

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.270 
think so to make sure he shoots quite
high<00:01:42.120> up<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.420> list<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.190> remind<00:01:44.190> me<00:01:44.220> again

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
high up on the list so remind me again

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
yeah right and the I think this list

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.820 
yeah right and the I think this list
used<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.060> have<00:02:42.210> used<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.080> have<00:02:43.200> Vader<00:02:43.410> in<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.740> is

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
used to have used to have Vader in it is

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.700 
used to have used to have Vader in it is
plain<00:02:44.040> Vader<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:44.460> played<00:02:45.080> turf<00:02:46.080> or<00:02:46.320> near<00:02:46.500> to

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
plain Vader it's played turf or near to

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.510 
plain Vader it's played turf or near to
play<00:02:46.830> tetran<00:02:47.280> cow<00:02:47.490> but<00:02:48.210> there's<00:02:48.810> also<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:49.520> slave

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
play tetran cow but there's also a slave

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.240 
play tetran cow but there's also a slave
at<00:02:50.670> one<00:02:50.790> point<00:02:50.940> yeah<00:02:51.330> but<00:02:52.050> I<00:02:52.260> think<00:02:52.530> echo<00:02:53.100> is

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
at one point yeah but I think echo is

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.590 
at one point yeah but I think echo is
the<00:02:53.340> best<00:02:53.520> fit<00:02:53.670> because<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:54.000> co<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.300> just<00:02:54.510> as

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
the best fit because I co is just as

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.630 
the best fit because I co is just as
maneuverable<00:02:55.070> doesn't<00:02:56.070> get<00:02:56.160> stress<00:02:56.400> very

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
maneuverable doesn't get stress very

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.850 
maneuverable doesn't get stress very
often<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.150> his<00:02:57.420> for<00:02:57.750> attack<00:02:58.020> that's<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.530> yeah

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
often and his for attack that's a yeah

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.430 
often and his for attack that's a yeah
that's<00:02:59.070> huge<00:02:59.400> that's<00:03:00.030> 500<00:03:00.570> zone-read<00:03:01.080> number

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
that's huge that's 500 zone-read number

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.650 
that's huge that's 500 zone-read number
for<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.070> insane<00:03:02.700> private<00:03:03.270> range<00:03:03.420> 1<00:03:03.570> as

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
for that is insane private range 1 as

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.500 
for that is insane private range 1 as
well<00:03:03.720> which<00:03:03.960> is<00:03:03.990> huge<00:03:04.380> actually<00:03:04.980> ridiculous

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
well which is huge actually ridiculous

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.150 
well which is huge actually ridiculous
so<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:07.080> idea<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.440> just<00:03:07.650> shoot<00:03:08.010> them

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
so the idea is to just shoot them

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.470 
so the idea is to just shoot them
without<00:03:08.370> getting<00:03:08.580> shot<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.910> stealth<00:03:09.090> devices

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
without getting shot the stealth devices

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.700 
without getting shot the stealth devices
are<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.630> little<00:03:09.780> bit<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:09.990> a<00:03:10.050> contingency<00:03:10.440> plans

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
are a little bit of a contingency plans

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.140 
are a little bit of a contingency plans
if<00:03:10.950> in<00:03:11.070> case<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.310> do<00:03:11.430> want<00:03:11.820> to<00:03:11.850> do<00:03:12.000> some

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
if in case you do want to do some
