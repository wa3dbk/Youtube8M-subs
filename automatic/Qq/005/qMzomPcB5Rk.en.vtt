00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 from everyone this is a video 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:08.540
 hairstyle i will show you a kind 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.440
 of mykeul co2 actually but a lot more 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.110
 sophisticated where a lot more worked 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.940
 that a half-tail stupid hello 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.220
 honking people so here I have 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.570
 kept that side that was already done and 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.560
 we will do the same thing on the other 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.390
 side I show you how we do and 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.470
 after we assemble the two so one 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.460
 little bit more pretty 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.330
 so it's an African braid if you 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.710
 do not know how to make braids 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.019
 african I put you the link in the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.430
 info bar of a video where I explain 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.660
 really very very very clearly 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.070
 how to make an African braid 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.200
 as it is a little long I prefer 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.940
 send you to the video I explain 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.719
 everything is at the limit if you do not have 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.280
 make it go see the video 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.649
 practice and come back to that one 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.969
 if you know how to do it and very rock'n very 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:51.960
 well we'll start right away 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:53.850
 be careful so we have six they would have 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.010
 do not we split the hair to the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.300
 half you can shift the skate to 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.320
 middle me I 'm going in the middle for 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.430
 that it's about equal to both 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.949
 sides but you can shifted it where 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.739
 you want it's you who see if you 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.049
 want to keep front locks isolated 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.549
 bath simply you take them off at 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.990
 start me as she began to say 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.670
 a bit long I preferred to include them 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.350
 in and like that I'm quiet 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.140
 all day I have not thought of my 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.530
 hair that's what I first have 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.270
 start by taking three wicks as 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.920
 any African braids 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.810
 finally from 13 anyway besides so 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.189
 there I take them along the face and 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.549
 not in depth in relation to the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.229
 skull 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.600
 so I take one in the middle and 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.840
 one who takes the hair that is just 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.100
 above the ear like that all the 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.750
 all the side and finally all the everything 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.460
 along the front and what what if I wanted 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.320
 so we have 1 2 and 3 and actually at each 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.310
 time we will add hair but 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.960
 only they come from above 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.460
 so it's actually a semi that that 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.610
 that's what I do not find my 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.469
 words 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.969
 it's only a semi braid 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.380
 African that is to say that the braid 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.119
 african we add hair to 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.020
 right and left every time and there 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.060
 we will add only 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.069
 from one of the two sides you will see I 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.540
 starts with the one from above that I 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.580
 pass between the other two from below 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.590
 is actually that of the place is found in 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.819
 top and I add her hair so 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.819
 that until now it's normal 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.379
 then that from above that of 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.379
 below goes in the middle europe 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.950
 and when I pick up whenever 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.140
 I have an image that arrives at the top 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.510
 take back hair by 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:44.090
 underneath I do not pick up up I 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:50.000
 take some hair but underneath 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:53.510
 do not add it seems to me like we 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.739
 call that it's a name I wonder if 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:01.130
 it's not the lie that trade in English 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:07.760
 I have more we add only once on 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:09.290
 two so I add and down I 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.690
 do not add when we arrive 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.549
 well it depends where you want in 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.920
 can it be very soon after two or 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.810
 three only me I'm going so far 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.160
 behind the ear so does when 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.480
 I arrive behind the ear I stop 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.049
 add the hair and there I do a 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.049
 normal braid 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.980
 I attach rubber 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.920
 and the purpose is to see if we 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.720
 did not take any other hair 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.330
 is now possibly from the 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.709
 braid so once we have this I have the 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.300
 same thing on the other side I'm 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:53.549
 so I had this and that and there the goal 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.930
 basil you if you have laziness or do not 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.670
 do not want you can do that all 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.200
 simply there in fact I'm going to them 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.610
 sprains she is one around 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:05.220
 the other 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:07.620
 so I just closed and I serve and 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.510
 this one I'll try to drag it 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:15.360
 below a few steps spoil it 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.220
 and this one here so it's easier 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.630
 here because we did not take any 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.820
 heads from underneath the bottom rises 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:26.070
 super easy so that's fastoche 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.680
 and that of tufa before 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.510
 last hair and we stick it in and 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.770
 then we take painted silk pliers 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.120
 splat like this is tweezers 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:39.289
 bun as you prefer and fixed 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.289
 should hide in fact 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.310
 so here I do not know if it's very 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.530
 very well done since as you 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.760
 know I want it without a mirror and I'm going 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.420
 check right at the end to make 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.270
 readjustments 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.310
 but you see the idea that I mean 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.750
 so it's up to me to train and you 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.630
 you train once you have the 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.700
 basic principle is then low for the 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.340
 in front of you can put tongs if 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.080
 you prefer to flatten a little too 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.210
 a little more volume you can pull 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.710
 like that on the wicks you shoot a 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.750
 little forward and it will do a little more 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.060
 of volume and for the tsuba you can 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.100
 leave like that you can do a 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.600
 braid that comes to the side you can 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.670
 to make a fair ponytail you 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.020
 can make a bun 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:32.060
 if you want to crowd like that 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.320
 quickly make a bun that puffs a 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.680
 little bit on the side it's a little 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.750
 Marianne Robin Hood 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.970
 I'm not super inspired I 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.020
 will leave like this for now 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.800
 I hope you like it I do 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.670
 big big kisses so then yes I wanted 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.800
 start a new thing because I have 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.330
 seen someone do it I found that 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.400
 it was a great idea if you 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.540
 make them at home instead of 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.950
 send me emails what I'm saying 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.140
 said before and suddenly there is me 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.940
 who see them if you have an account 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.610
 instagram do not hesitate to post them on 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.550
 instagram and to me tag is my 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.409
 pseudo cb as bluffing everything attached 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.580
 sailing where I make you big video 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:08.659
 I hope everything is fine that you 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.460
 take good care of yourself and your 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:13.030
 hair so to do and I tell you to
