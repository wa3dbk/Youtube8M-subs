00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.610
 a better start to the duel as against the Augsburger Panther on the occasion 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.239
 The ESVK could not have wished for the first round of the dfb cup 

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:11.799
 After only four minutes the joggers went into the lead 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:14.399
 but the joy did not last long 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:18.220
 because afterwards the BGL Klub from Augsburg turned it on properly 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.730
 just a minute later, Reile's drive is after Torsten Fendt's pass 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.970
 in excess of the compensation 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.119
 Shortly thereafter, there was again a penalty for the ESVK 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.070
 and this opportunity was not missed by the Panthers 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.860
 Jay Henderson lowered the puck after preliminary work from the war and Yanick 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.300
 Dubé in the Kaufbeurer Tor 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.710
 it continued in the twelfth minute 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.990
 Goalkeeper Kristian Bader was stunned by ESVK goals 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.210
 Shane Joseph used and increased the one to three 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.460
 Shortly before the end of third Kontny yogurt but again shorten to two to 3 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.440
 at a shot from Erik Pipp just behind the blue line Christ 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.000
 panther keeper Mannheim in the next and the puck landed in the gate 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.970
 the second third clearly dominated the guests from Augsburg 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.040
 Barely three minutes were played lost the first no neutral zone 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.660
 the washer and Yanick Dubé Whyte with a two-stroke goal often four to four 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.390
 shortly afterwards, the Kaufbeur goalkeeper had to grab behind him again 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.720
 the hosts could not free themselves from their own third 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.880
 and were punished by Shell Henderson with the 2 2 5 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.670
 The highlight of Augsburg's superiority was the second 6 by Yanick Dubé 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.660
 with a trick most probably only know from internet videos 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.760
 he hurled the disc into the short corner in front of the Kaufbeurer defense 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.719
 After that, the Panthers played well as a sure winner 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:12.859
 because in the meantime she slowed down a bit 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.959
 but after the one-third break, the derby was once again really explosive 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:20.419
 the favorites afford some unnecessary penalties 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.419
 under catching the home side again 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.939
 Within just three minutes, the Jorker came up to 5 to 6 at the Augsburg 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.569
 zoom 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.439
 Now the mood almost boiled over at the 4,500 spectators 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.510
 loudly demanded the Kaufbeurer fans equalizer 15 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.259
 However, no team could pull the game on their side first 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.209
 it went in the hitherto relatively heavy games 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.429
 harder to the point 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:49.619
 the climax of this heated phase 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:53.569
 formed a fight between Kaufhold into fresh cross and the Augsburger 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.279
 remind Kofler 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:57.859
 this argument already seemed clear 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.819
 But then sat down with active support more players almost up 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.819
 in the cabin 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.399
 but the advantage of the joggers there 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:11.019
 the decision of the game for 27 seconds before the end 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.070
 Mark Murphy wins with an empty-net-goal the 15 7 final score 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.969
 for the Panthers from Augsburg 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.239
 because Kaufbeuren coach Peter Ustorf 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.730
 had taken his goalkeeper out in favor of a sixth fielder 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:27.089
 despite this defeat and the associated retirement in the dfb cup 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.109
 when to be satisfied with the showgirl 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.789
 more over long distances say indisputable 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:36.929
 yes victims are a phase in the second third occupied and satisfied with the 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:38.589
 Performance of the team 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:42.279
 Breuninger did not give up on her back is celebrated in the last 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:43.259
 one-third 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:46.639
 and even be able to create an open game 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.369
 Similarly, Captain Torsten Rohde saw his team's performance too 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:51.469
 first double 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:52.309
 know once 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:54.849
 It will put him in four penalty men's rooms quickly in arrears 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:55.719
 devices 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.989
 and then get to 3 2 again 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.929
 around two places 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:03.239
 There they are then very fast way to 5 2 out of 6 2 

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:07.079
 You are literally run over but below you become moral in the last quarter 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.079
 shown and even on 36 of us always requested 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:13.669
 with the Augsburger Panthern against Braumann at the end is 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.009
 but still to have won 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:18.909
 well, first of all very happy that we have won 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:22.939
 they would like to play heavy games but it was the same 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:24.840
 looking for yourself or giving everything 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.840
 Thomas Mann was under pressure there, but they hold things 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.300
 Round have meant ripper samples are playfully presented to Porsche 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.509
 to have 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:35.949
 but had learned how to fight and will last again 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.229
 returned 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.180
 It was very difficult for the players and his men we are already happy 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.039
 that we have won and closer underweight the 11th 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.490
 a similar opinion also represents Augsburg sports manager Turin Münster 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.919
 We want to continue with many topics, we are very satisfied 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.169
 for such a harder only Anistons should always be in danger 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.039
 so he was second to team percent the mother game damage too 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:00.889
 play 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.889
 We did not but we have jumped all week 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.500
 around and they were already shown today their performance and in it Melissa 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:14.110
 Do you have a wrong picture so concentration is just unis intensity 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.999
 lost 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:17.680
 for the TSV department stores 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.469
 the derby will be even longer despite being eliminated in the cup 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:24.919
 So at the start of the season in two weeks the gamblers probably will 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.919
 Striker Frazier Claire has to give up 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.039
 after his fight by referee Hascher with a 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:31.719
 Match penalty was sent to the Finnish
