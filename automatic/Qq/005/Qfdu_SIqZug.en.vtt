00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.819
 barrios is to record this video here for 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.830
 try to help people who try to 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.610
 have some kind of problem with this lava 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.340
 and dries from the lg nec some common mistakes that 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.500
 Happens, it happened here with me. 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.869
 I would like to share with you the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.029
 try to help to use a machine because the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.910
 maintenance cost is very high 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.720
 and I'm going to turn on the machine that 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.880
 ego that appears has a display and 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:39.090
 how did I get to the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:43.640
 problem you can see here. 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:48.690
 after starting the machine for each connection 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.210
 shows that this error is an error in the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.809
 truth of what a sensor has in the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.539
 machine is the term I'm with sensor 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.010
 temperature of the machine when the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.960
 sensor to run the machine 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.600
 shows this error, right? 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.090
 after great research on the internet and 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.100
 also find the reason for the error and 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.890
 then to your Lord is that 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.049
 You have access to the sensor, right? 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.360
 You have to remove this top cover 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.299
 machine that is secured with two screws 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.850
 on the back of the machine 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.680
 after the withdrawal of those two 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.290
 Just bolts you just press it 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.380
 back and undock without a dog 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.270
 you will have access to everywhere 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.270
 of the electronic machine control 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.910
 here on the inside of the machine is the 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.380
 sensor that referred to this error 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.390
 have you seen here previously in 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.090
 display this sensor here 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.870
 it picks up the part near the front 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.630
 here where it has the resistance that 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:01.070
 makes the clothes dry, if you can see it is 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.130
 whip that you have here on the side and 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.750
 one if I'm going to pull here so that you 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:19.190
 better understand summer sensor points 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:20.930
 Here harness that connects with the withdrawal that 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.280
 enter here at the bottom 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.280
 of this other piece here 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.510
 that is, that such a villain who sold the 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.490
 problem that you have seen in this 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.100
 machine is the temperature sensor is 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.330
 there ice cold of dry eight kilos and 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.340
 to find out what sensor I was in 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.290
 check the essence of the problem 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.870
 and discover through a measurement of 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.640
 continuity of wires that only fit is 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.390
 broke in the middle do not know if he was 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.490
 with a problem just like you can 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.460
 see here I just made a splicing on the wire 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:05.780
 replacing lash wire until one of the 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.360
 sensor ends and you have returned 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.280
 to operate normally and the machine now 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.700
 operates normally 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.470
 done that I returned the machine sensor and 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.110
 the error was corrected 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:23.420
 It's very simple, said the girl here. 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.800
 again it is necessary to say here in the bar 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.660
 side here 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.670
 He has an entrance that I 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.380
 end of the sensor is engaged 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.950
 press to see the same thing here 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.950
 down 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.630
 Here, the one who sends the mail is tight. 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.630
 here a little bit 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.540
 I fit here again the whip 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.300
 whip dog 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:11.080
 do not forget to always turn off the hefty 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:13.840
 because it can shock and ready to 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.850
 machine is ready for use again. 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.799
 to function 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.870
 It is also important to note that if you 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.050
 begin in this census and you will open the 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.940
 machine approaches here again is 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.770
 It is important for you to open this 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.560
 cover here by removing the screws that 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.720
 she has on the side and from that part also 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.540
 here back here and do a cleaning in 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.680
 the whole system that accumulates a lot of dirt 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.420
 in here too 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.390
 which causes the same error there in 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.990
 machine with staff that's what I hope to have 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.990
 helped and
