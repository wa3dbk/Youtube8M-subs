00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
long one here on Monday Valentine's Day

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.350 
long one here on Monday Valentine's Day
and<00:00:09.960> at<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.769> time<00:00:11.330> the<00:00:12.330> Islam<00:00:13.670> had<00:00:14.670> wigglers

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
and at the time the Islam had wigglers

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.560 
and at the time the Islam had wigglers
and<00:00:15.890> at<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.039> point<00:00:17.369> they<00:00:18.029> become<00:00:18.330> free

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570

swimming<00:00:18.840> fry<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:20.609> thought<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:22.050> was

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
swimming fry and I thought it was

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.960 
swimming fry and I thought it was
probably<00:00:22.439> worth<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:23.010> quick<00:00:23.250> little<00:00:23.550> video<00:00:23.670> I'm

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
probably worth a quick little video I'm

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.250 
probably worth a quick little video I'm
not<00:00:24.000> going<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.300> do<00:00:24.359> anything<00:00:24.600> like<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.960> 20

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
not going to do anything like the 20

not going to do anything like the 20
minutes<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.650> did<00:00:25.830> last<00:00:26.070> time<00:00:26.240> but<00:00:27.240> these<00:00:27.420> fish

protecting<00:00:38.190> them<00:00:39.050> again<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> 270

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
protecting them again this is a 270

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.380 
protecting them again this is a 270
gallon<00:00:41.520> tank<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.950> will<00:00:43.950> allow<00:00:44.730> these<00:00:44.969> fry

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390

color variants of this Lana I've had
both<00:04:07.769> color<00:04:08.280> variants<00:04:08.850> this<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.209> first<00:04:09.420> time

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
both color variants this the first time

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.650 
both color variants this the first time
I've<00:04:09.750> spawned<00:04:10.140> this<00:04:11.130> version<00:04:11.480> several<00:04:12.480> years

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
I've spawned this version several years

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.360 
I've spawned this version several years
ago<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:12.930> had<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.230> blue<00:04:13.440> version<00:04:13.680> which<00:04:14.070> in<00:04:14.310> a

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
ago I had the blue version which in a

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.650 
ago I had the blue version which in a
lot<00:04:14.400> of<00:04:14.549> ways<00:04:14.760> looks<00:04:14.970> like<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.209> looks<00:04:15.420> like<00:04:15.510> a

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
lot of ways looks like it looks like a

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.980 
lot of ways looks like it looks like a
mini<00:04:16.340> zombie<00:04:17.479> when<00:04:18.479> they're<00:04:18.659> very<00:04:18.840> small

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:19.990 
mini zombie when they're very small

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.170 
mini zombie when they're very small
this<00:04:20.990> I<00:04:21.410> think<00:04:21.470> is<00:04:21.770> a<00:04:21.830> more<00:04:22.280> spectacularly

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
this I think is a more spectacularly

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.440 
this I think is a more spectacularly
colored<00:04:23.830> version<00:04:24.830> as<00:04:25.610> far<00:04:25.790> as<00:04:25.910> behavioral

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
colored version as far as behavioral

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.990 
colored version as far as behavioral
they're<00:04:26.690> about<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:27.080> same<00:04:27.350> although<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.850> think

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
they're about the same although I think

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.680 
they're about the same although I think
this<00:04:29.510> version<00:04:29.980> at<00:04:30.980> least<00:04:31.190> in<00:04:31.340> my<00:04:31.460> experience

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
this version at least in my experience

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.050 
this version at least in my experience
doesn't<00:04:32.690> tend<00:04:32.870> to<00:04:32.990> get<00:04:33.080> quite<00:04:33.350> as<00:04:33.500> big<00:04:33.800> as<00:04:34.100> the

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
doesn't tend to get quite as big as the

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.670 
doesn't tend to get quite as big as the
blue<00:04:35.270> version<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.780> blue<00:04:35.930> version<00:04:36.110> I<00:04:36.410> had

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
blue version the blue version I had

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.170 
blue version the blue version I had
which<00:04:37.310> spun<00:04:37.550> quite<00:04:37.910> regularly

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
which spun quite regularly

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.390 
which spun quite regularly
maybe<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.360> mail<00:04:41.540> was<00:04:41.810> up<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:42.080> me<00:04:42.230> maybe<00:04:42.860> 13<00:04:43.370> 14

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
maybe the mail was up to me maybe 13 14

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.270 
maybe the mail was up to me maybe 13 14
inches<00:04:44.090> and<00:04:44.300> I<00:04:44.360> don't<00:04:44.420> think<00:04:44.840> that<00:04:45.320> this<00:04:45.530> I've

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
inches and I don't think that this I've

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.510 
inches and I don't think that this I've
never<00:04:46.520> seen<00:04:47.380> this<00:04:48.380> particular<00:04:48.620> color<00:04:49.130> bearing

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
never seen this particular color bearing

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.670 
never seen this particular color bearing
approaching<00:04:50.000> that<00:04:50.150> size<00:04:50.420> maybe<00:04:50.810> 10<00:04:51.200> inches<00:04:51.530> is

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
approaching that size maybe 10 inches is

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.350 
approaching that size maybe 10 inches is
probably<00:04:52.040> the<00:04:52.160> max<00:04:52.430> I'm<00:04:52.670> thinking<00:04:53.090> for<00:04:53.300> the

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
probably the max I'm thinking for the

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.740 
probably the max I'm thinking for the
mail<00:04:54.130> anyhow<00:04:55.160> again<00:04:55.850> I<00:04:55.880> didn't<00:04:56.330> want<00:04:56.480> to<00:04:56.600> make

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
mail anyhow again I didn't want to make

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.950 
mail anyhow again I didn't want to make
this<00:04:56.960> a<00:04:57.170> giant<00:04:57.530> video<00:04:57.980> but<00:04:58.430> I<00:04:58.790> thought<00:04:59.720> that

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
this a giant video but I thought that

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.170 
this a giant video but I thought that
these<00:05:00.110> guys<00:05:00.170> were<00:05:00.620> so<00:05:00.940> beautiful<00:05:01.940> that<00:05:01.970> you

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
these guys were so beautiful that you

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.450 
these guys were so beautiful that you
guys<00:05:02.330> might<00:05:02.600> enjoy<00:05:03.010> looking<00:05:04.010> at<00:05:04.280> them

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
guys might enjoy looking at them

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.970 
guys might enjoy looking at them
protecting<00:05:05.060> their<00:05:05.210> cloud<00:05:05.540> of<00:05:05.720> Frey<00:05:05.960> and<00:05:06.410> I

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
protecting their cloud of Frey and I

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.180 
protecting their cloud of Frey and I
guess<00:05:07.490> that's<00:05:07.730> it<00:05:07.880> for<00:05:08.090> now
