00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.389
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.450
 video of me my museum ripa and that 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.080
 here are the gaming news from 10 04 20 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.029
 14 10 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.580
 or what I would call rain 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.609
 together about the shameless insolence 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.460
 of hot dogs and middle bordeaux 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.000
 shadow on hot stocks now has one 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.370
 season pass soon given 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.769
 cool thing not shared 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.559
 Of course, this passport is posted 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.630
 should cost a total of 20 dollars so 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.739
 You can assume that again 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.960
 15 or if they were complete they 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.260
 have not become 20 euros cost 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.670
 and should have several missions weapons 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.460
 packs and so on and so forth 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.300
 the interesting thing is and the reason 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.070
 why I'm upset about it 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.619
 this time the following game became 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.780
 shifted by 8 whole months 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.180
 but that 's ok he has the people 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.180
 Resigned to it and it's cool it is 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.410
 everything ok but two months now 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.180
 to be before the release 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.920
 hey guys you know what a cool the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.290
 strip we are already a pass 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.880
 Do you know what it looks like? 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.710
 the eight months or maybe 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.979
 not all pay eight months he 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.479
 maybe just now the last ones 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.200
 two weeks and now the coming ones 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.869
 two months 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.650
 Price on content screwed for the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.380
 to aim 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.979
 that means we get a game that the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.110
 Completely to the markets bones 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.509
 have cut down so nicely in one 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.329
 small package diced according to motto here 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.100
 you have the game and there are still missing 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.400
 very many things and sell 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.140
 by extra in the season pass for her 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.810
 Buy values ​​anyway and we like 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.360
 so a cool idea yes me 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.680
 also like money but ge times thinks it is 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.130
 Of course they are a company 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.549
 company has money for the ten now 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.149
 do 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.719
 the extremely naughty I find it extreme 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.970
 outrageous and cheeky 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.610
 because the only thing that looks to me is 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.010
 Well that's already a content 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.900
 work one hundred percent and if you are 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.340
 at the time or play still in 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.560
 Development is one could last 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.110
 it should hurt 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.630
 especially with me yes to be delivered 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.700
 Mine is not like one 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.349
 in this world of hot stocks the 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.780
 has endless possibilities 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:35.430
 Sometime ideas go out for dlc 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.870
 you can also sell dlc after that 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.099
 play a little bit longer is yes 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.420
 You can also go after seven months 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.250
 for sale 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.040
 other players have succeeded 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.870
 you do not necessarily have to prove all 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.739
 three weeks after release immediately man 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.910
 could deliver 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:53.760
 especially if the games like the hot 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.060
 stocks that promise you 100 hours 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.380
 playing time does not matter, I find it very much 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.560
 cheeky and ridiculous 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.200
 the funniest thing is that though 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.930
 makes hot stocks and of course something 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.569
 even with noise eight months that the 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.340
 recommended pc settings 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.640
 teeny tiny tiny 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.720
 tiny bit over port small 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.450
 Pieces too high 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.099
 Let's just look at times which is 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.769
 requirement of middle earth motto 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.620
 Shadow called the recommended that 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.630
 is the recommended clear windows 7 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.410
 windows 8 no problem remains on 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.230
 processor of the i7 730 70 of the in 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:40.079
 My pc at home is eight gigabytes of RAM 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:42.560
 not bad graphics card gtx 670 48 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.470
 to save gigabytes 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.650
 The game looks ugly to puke 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:52.260
 I do not know if I my middle earth he 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:56.160
 months the game looks like call of 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:59.670
 duty kos and that was not very good 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.810
 from 40 gigabytes of free space with which 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.730
 program were bitteschön the textures 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.980
 Compressed with paint I feel like that 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.510
 as if the current games were the 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.989
 for this super great a princely 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.760
 come out next-gen console just like that 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.829
 modestly ported on the pc 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.090
 one does himself no trouble making 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.580
 to import anything at all or 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.630
 something he topteam you have to motto 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.200
 her come play a game with it 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.080
 satisfied 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.840
 the pc market and we are pc players 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.350
 not like dogs where you have the remains 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.030
 down 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.440
 We can not hope so 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.980
 pig the pigs afterwards 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.680
 eat away 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.900
 maybe we want a whole 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.490
 normal pretty game have that 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.970
 reasonably optimized it is too much 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.680
 requires 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.720
 my word stocks go something 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.540
 graphics cards were there then you are 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.690
 fritter further back so the full 560 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:55.170
 ti that is roman are okay but also 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:58.620
 here a ii 7 7 370 of even around 100 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.000
 mhz clocked is the normal 37 70th 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.090
 has 34 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.690
 and they want to respect 35 opponents here 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.560
 to the eggs of those with bad things 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.330
 want you next 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.620
 some 12 kerne or what leon thing 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.600
 I do not really understand it 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.520
 i do not understand this topic of mine 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.520
 it seems so as if the two 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:24.680
 first reason to artificially create the 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:28.260
 Power from a station and a yellow one 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.750
 I wanted to push 720 to push up 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:34.200
 Look for mother when you are on the 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.780
 pc builds such components 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.120
 the same performance the same picture 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.060
 on the console for a third of the 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.820
 prices of your hardware jo after the 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.620
 Motto she is through on the nonsense 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.780
 And it would have the purpose at the same time 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.050
 to pay as little money as possible 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.480
 just a port to motor we 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.550
 Get the pc playing one way or the other 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.160
 the money thrown the jaws the buy 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.110
 either way, I also think of this 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.990
 So free against news in 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.180
 this issue unfortunately full of black 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.920
 pitch black news what do you say 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.200
 you can find the fair you will find that 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.180
 eligible for a game like medium 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.950
 What really shadows what? 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.470
 awful from something looks worth it 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.450
 Can come out in 2008 such 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.310
 exaggerated requirements 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:24.180
 especially with the 40 gb free 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:26.160
 memory space and the gtx 670 and the 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.200
 processor just over the top and everything 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.730
 to the game hot stocks also the 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.680
 to demand overclocking processes 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.860
 or do you think that's justified 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.770
 and what do you say to the season pass of hot 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.740
 constantly stocks of that too 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:42.690
 cheeky all links to the articles 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.160
 are of course in the description and 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.720
 otherwise many thanks for watching until 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
 for the next time people discussed 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.699
 happy with the comments 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.699
 ciao
