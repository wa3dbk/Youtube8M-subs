00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
gotten a single joint out so if he

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.949 
gotten a single joint out so if he
hasn't<00:02:08.200> gotten<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.560> drawn<00:02:08.709> out<00:02:08.830> then<00:02:09.160> I<00:02:09.429> i<00:02:10.420> don't

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
hasn't gotten a drawn out then I i don't

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.150 
hasn't gotten a drawn out then I i don't
know<00:02:11.049> i<00:02:11.080> don't<00:02:11.349> see<00:02:11.590> him<00:02:11.680> winning<00:02:11.860> this<00:02:12.010> game

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
know i don't see him winning this game

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.470 
know i don't see him winning this game
because<00:02:12.340> he<00:02:12.730> could<00:02:12.910> push<00:02:13.090> tell<00:02:13.299> it<00:02:13.450> like

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
because he could push tell it like

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.910 
because he could push tell it like
honestly<00:02:13.930> if<00:02:14.049> you<00:02:14.140> use<00:02:14.260> all<00:02:14.440> those<00:02:14.560> mirrorless

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
honestly if you use all those mirrorless

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.800 
honestly if you use all those mirrorless
with<00:02:15.280> zerglings<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.849> broke<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:16.299> front<00:02:16.629> I

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
with zerglings and broke this front I

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.550 
with zerglings and broke this front I
think<00:02:17.530> he<00:02:17.590> could<00:02:17.709> have<00:02:17.860> made<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.280> um<00:02:19.560> like

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
think he could have made it and um like

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.500 
think he could have made it and um like
I<00:02:20.830> don't<00:02:21.010> know<00:02:21.129> like<00:02:21.730> on<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.060> sea<00:02:22.180> has<00:02:22.269> dropped

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
or dropping outside and expanding and

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.780 
or dropping outside and expanding and
this<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.799> this<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.819> some<00:02:27.970> hot<00:02:28.290> all<00:02:29.290> right<00:02:29.500> um

at<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.390> window<00:04:43.690> so<00:04:43.930> it<00:04:44.200> was<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:44.890> good<00:04:44.950> idea<00:04:45.040> i

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
at the window so it was a good idea i

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.620 
at the window so it was a good idea i
just<00:04:45.400> didn't<00:04:45.760> go<00:04:46.150> well<00:04:46.180> and<00:04:46.720> now<00:04:48.330> he's<00:04:49.330> a<00:04:49.360> lot

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
just didn't go well and now he's a lot

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.880 
just didn't go well and now he's a lot
of<00:04:49.720> needless<00:04:49.900> because<00:04:50.260> he's<00:04:50.380> one<00:04:50.560> hitting<00:04:50.770> all

are<00:05:54.120> designed<00:05:54.440> five<00:05:55.440> quarters<00:05:55.889> does<00:05:56.699> a<00:05:56.729> lot

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
are designed five quarters does a lot

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.909 
are designed five quarters does a lot
more<00:05:56.970> damage<00:05:57.180> than<00:05:57.389> four<00:05:57.570> quarters<00:05:57.960> um<00:05:58.199> in

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
more damage than four quarters um in

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.469 
more damage than four quarters um in
reality<00:05:59.340> it's<00:05:59.460> only<00:05:59.610> one<00:05:59.729> extra<00:05:59.940> quarter<00:06:00.240> but

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
reality it's only one extra quarter but

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.330 
reality it's only one extra quarter but
like<00:06:00.990> I<00:06:01.169> don't<00:06:01.229> know<00:06:01.320> why<00:06:01.500> like<00:06:01.830> five<00:06:01.979> quarters

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
like I don't know why like five quarters

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.700 
like I don't know why like five quarters
can<00:06:02.490> kill<00:06:02.639> mirrorless<00:06:02.970> more<00:06:03.210> courses<00:06:03.419> can

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
can kill mirrorless more courses can

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.980 
can kill mirrorless more courses can
it's<00:06:04.710> odd<00:06:05.150> but<00:06:06.150> you<00:06:06.479> know<00:06:06.570> I<00:06:06.600> works<00:06:06.810> like<00:06:06.960> that

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
it's odd but you know I works like that

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.560 
it's odd but you know I works like that
so<00:06:07.290> you<00:06:07.380> got<00:06:07.500> to<00:06:07.560> deal<00:06:07.650> with<00:06:07.680> it<00:06:07.800> and<00:06:08.070> now<00:06:08.570> just

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
so you got to deal with it and now just

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.420 
so you got to deal with it and now just
picking<00:06:09.900> off<00:06:10.020> overs<00:06:10.380> I'm<00:06:10.650> slowly<00:06:10.949> starting<00:06:11.130> to

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
picking off overs I'm slowly starting to

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.000 
picking off overs I'm slowly starting to
get<00:06:11.639> your<00:06:11.820> air<00:06:12.000> superiority<00:06:12.360> and<00:06:12.870> once<00:06:13.770> once

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
get your air superiority and once once

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.680 
get your air superiority and once once
once<00:06:14.070> I<00:06:14.460> guy<00:06:14.610> all<00:06:14.820> these<00:06:14.970> Templars<00:06:15.330> out<00:06:15.479> then

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
once I guy all these Templars out then

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.330 
once I guy all these Templars out then
I'll<00:06:15.840> confirm<00:06:16.229> the<00:06:16.350> air<00:06:16.470> superiority<00:06:16.800> what

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
I'll confirm the air superiority what

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.000 
I'll confirm the air superiority what
this<00:06:17.460> is<00:06:17.580> support<00:06:18.030> of<00:06:18.210> our<00:06:18.479> cons<00:06:18.720> and<00:06:19.010> just

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
this is support of our cons and just

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.590 
this is support of our cons and just
getting<00:06:20.190> all<00:06:20.280> my<00:06:20.400> technology<00:06:20.669> upgrades<00:06:21.419> down

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
getting all my technology upgrades down

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.570 
getting all my technology upgrades down
and<00:06:21.870> now<00:06:22.169> since<00:06:22.680> I<00:06:22.770> have<00:06:22.800> courses<00:06:23.160> over<00:06:23.430> here

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
and now since I have courses over here

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.000 
and now since I have courses over here
i'm<00:06:23.760> just<00:06:23.789> going<00:06:24.060> to<00:06:24.090> scott<00:06:24.300> as<00:06:24.389> days<00:06:24.570> and<00:06:25.010> see

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
i'm just going to scott as days and see

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.340 
i'm just going to scott as days and see
what<00:06:26.160> he's<00:06:26.280> doing<00:06:26.690> he's<00:06:27.690> got<00:06:27.870> scourge<00:06:28.110> is<00:06:28.260> oh

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
what he's doing he's got scourge is oh

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.930 
what he's doing he's got scourge is oh
that's<00:06:28.530> the<00:06:28.590> one<00:06:28.710> way<00:06:28.830> to<00:06:28.889> that's<00:06:29.520> pretty<00:06:29.789> good

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
that's the one way to that's pretty good

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.960 
that's the one way to that's pretty good
but<00:06:30.380> i<00:06:31.380> don't<00:06:31.770> think<00:06:31.830> his<00:06:32.010> prone<00:06:32.220> exactly<00:06:32.699> to

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
but i don't think his prone exactly to

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.000 
but i don't think his prone exactly to
kill<00:06:33.330> each<00:06:33.510> quarter<00:06:33.930> with<00:06:34.169> each<00:06:34.410> scourge<00:06:34.740> and

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
kill each quarter with each scourge and

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.450 
kill each quarter with each scourge and
so<00:06:35.550> um<00:06:36.510> six<00:06:37.289> quarters<00:06:37.650> in<00:06:37.800> total<00:06:38.070> of<00:06:38.130> seven<00:06:38.370> or

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
so um six quarters in total of seven or

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.010 
so um six quarters in total of seven or
six<00:06:38.610> and<00:06:40.070> yeah<00:06:41.070> he<00:06:41.430> like<00:06:41.669> really<00:06:41.910> now<00:06:42.690> is<00:06:42.900> the

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
six and yeah he like really now is the

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.420 
six and yeah he like really now is the
point<00:06:43.200> where<00:06:43.349> you<00:06:43.440> should<00:06:43.620> just<00:06:43.770> GG<00:06:44.099> because

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
point where you should just GG because

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.129 
point where you should just GG because
even<00:06:44.729> if<00:06:44.820> he<00:06:44.940> somehow<00:06:45.210> managed<00:06:45.599> to<00:06:45.660> break<00:06:45.930> out

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139 
even if he somehow managed to break out

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:47.540 
even if he somehow managed to break out
somehow<00:06:46.410> managed<00:06:46.710> to<00:06:46.740> kill<00:06:46.950> all<00:06:47.039> my<00:06:47.160> quarters

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
somehow managed to kill all my quarters

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.820 
somehow managed to kill all my quarters
I<00:06:47.760> still<00:06:48.539> have<00:06:48.660> a<00:06:48.690> base<00:06:48.900> over<00:06:49.110> him<00:06:49.320> and<00:06:49.470> all<00:06:49.680> my

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
I still have a base over him and all my

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.409 
I still have a base over him and all my
economic<00:06:50.280> advantage<00:06:50.669> is<00:06:50.789> kicking<00:06:51.120> in<00:06:51.240> too

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 
economic advantage is kicking in too

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.550 
economic advantage is kicking in too
much<00:06:51.630> and<00:06:52.099> now<00:06:53.099> yeah<00:06:53.460> I<00:06:54.180> think<00:06:54.960> he's<00:06:55.110> going<00:06:55.320> for

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 
much and now yeah I think he's going for

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.300 
much and now yeah I think he's going for
drop<00:06:55.860> right<00:06:56.099> now<00:06:56.280> and<00:06:57.560> yeah<00:06:58.560> I'm<00:06:58.889> pretty<00:06:59.070> sure

00:06:59.300 --> 00:06:59.310 
drop right now and yeah I'm pretty sure

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.750 
drop right now and yeah I'm pretty sure
he<00:06:59.430> is<00:06:59.520> and<00:06:59.820> now<00:07:00.180> yeah<00:07:00.510> six<00:07:00.840> coursers<00:07:01.760> okay

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:02.760 
he is and now yeah six coursers okay

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.129 
he is and now yeah six coursers okay
this<00:07:02.970> what<00:07:03.090> I<00:07:03.120> mean<00:07:03.300> by<00:07:03.450> not<00:07:03.660> having<00:07:03.900> good

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 
this what I mean by not having good

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:06.440 
this what I mean by not having good
cloning<00:07:04.500> by<00:07:05.250> pretty<00:07:05.700> much<00:07:05.789> failing<00:07:06.210> at<00:07:06.300> that

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:06.450 
cloning by pretty much failing at that

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:07.700 
cloning by pretty much failing at that
and<00:07:06.690> now<00:07:06.780> yeah<00:07:06.990> all<00:07:07.139> these<00:07:07.289> overlord<00:07:07.620> two

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:07.710 
and now yeah all these overlord two

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.250 
and now yeah all these overlord two
loaded<00:07:07.889> because<00:07:08.070> he<00:07:08.580> calls<00:07:08.820> GT<00:07:09.150> and<00:07:09.449> that's

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.260 
loaded because he calls GT and that's

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.420 
loaded because he calls GT and that's
game<00:07:10.440> hope<00:07:10.650> you<00:07:10.740> guys<00:07:10.830> enjoyed<00:07:11.070> this<00:07:11.190> look
