but those like tiny little what has been

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.899 
but those like tiny little what has been
like<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:19.830> 7<00:01:20.310> months<00:01:20.460> since<00:01:20.759> I

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
like that for like 7 months since I

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.359 
like that for like 7 months since I
started<00:01:20.970> using<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.170> don't<00:01:22.710> really<00:01:23.009> think

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
started using it so I don't really think

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.450 
started using it so I don't really think
there's<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:23.880> much<00:01:24.180> more<00:01:25.189> regrowth<00:01:26.189> I

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
there's going to be much more regrowth I

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.160 
there's going to be much more regrowth I
just<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:26.939> right<00:01:27.150> now<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.689> helping<00:01:28.020> to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
just think right now it's helping to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.580 
just think right now it's helping to
prevent<00:01:28.560> any<00:01:29.009> further<00:01:29.640> hair<00:01:30.299> loss

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
prevent any further hair loss

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.300 
prevent any further hair loss

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.880 
helped to prove up to regrow any new
hair<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.840> for<00:02:06.990> those<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.530> don't<00:02:07.740> know

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.150 
hair so for those of you that don't know
about<00:02:07.979> regain<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:09.330> looks<00:02:09.569> like<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.920> think

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
about regain it looks like this I think

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.120 
about regain it looks like this I think
in<00:02:11.400> America<00:02:11.849> it's

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
in America it's

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.790 
in America it's
something<00:02:12.520> like<00:02:12.640> Rogaine<00:02:13.350> but<00:02:14.350> it's<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.620> same

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
something like Rogaine but it's the same

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.690 
something like Rogaine but it's the same
kind<00:02:15.160> of<00:02:15.390> ingredients<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:16.600> used<00:02:16.630> I<00:02:16.990> think

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
kind of ingredients that I used I think

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.220 
kind of ingredients that I used I think
basically<00:02:18.700> what<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.000> do<00:02:19.210> you<00:02:19.840> should<00:02:20.020> pull

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
basically what you do you should pull

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.510 
basically what you do you should pull
off<00:02:20.350> this<00:02:20.560> cap<00:02:24.090> there<00:02:25.090> if<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.560> applicator

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
off this cap there if the applicator

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.430 
off this cap there if the applicator
looks<00:02:27.790> like<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.270> it's<00:02:28.510> like<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.720> squirt<00:02:29.110> then

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
looks like that it's like a squirt then

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.500 
looks like that it's like a squirt then
you<00:02:29.530> squeeze<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:30.100> into<00:02:30.700> here<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.450> basically

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
you squeeze this into here and basically

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.020 
you squeeze this into here and basically
like<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.170> foam<00:02:32.560> comes<00:02:32.920> out<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.790> you're

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
like a foam comes out and you're

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.400 
like a foam comes out and you're
supposed<00:02:34.210> to<00:02:34.390> fill<00:02:34.570> this<00:02:34.690> up<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.990> like<00:02:35.140> halfway

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
supposed to fill this up to like halfway

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.250 
supposed to fill this up to like halfway
and<00:02:36.040> then<00:02:36.720> you're<00:02:37.720> supposed<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:37.960> put<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.200> in

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
and then you're supposed to put it in

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.050 
and then you're supposed to put it in
your<00:02:38.350> hand<00:02:38.530> really<00:02:38.800> but<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.220> find<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.700> melts

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
your hand really but I find it melts

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.850 
your hand really but I find it melts
into<00:02:40.210> my<00:02:40.420> on<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.780> phone<00:02:40.990> and<00:02:41.290> then<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.740> goes

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
into my on the phone and then it goes

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.440 
into my on the phone and then it goes
runny<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.430> makes<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.760> hard<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.000> apply

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
runny and it makes it hard to apply

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.940 
runny and it makes it hard to apply
because<00:02:43.660> of<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.990> heat<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.440> comes<00:02:44.500> off<00:02:44.770> your

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
because of the heat that comes off your

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.550 
because of the heat that comes off your
hands<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.450> find<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.870> easier<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.230> put<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:47.470> in

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
hands so I find it easier to put it in

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.900 
hands so I find it easier to put it in
this<00:02:47.650> two<00:02:47.800> up<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.040> then<00:02:48.160> I<00:02:48.250> kind<00:02:48.490> of<00:02:48.520> put<00:02:48.820> my

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
this two up and then I kind of put my

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.850 
this two up and then I kind of put my
finger<00:02:49.240> in<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:49.450> just<00:02:49.600> like<00:02:49.720> rub<00:02:50.380> it<00:02:50.500> into<00:02:50.620> my

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
finger in it just like rub it into my

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.760 
finger in it just like rub it into my
scalp<00:02:51.100> like<00:02:51.310> that<00:02:51.550> I<00:02:52.260> think<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.410> can<00:02:53.560> buy<00:02:53.710> it

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
scalp like that I think you can buy it

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.890 
scalp like that I think you can buy it
from<00:02:54.010> places<00:02:54.460> like<00:02:54.490> Asda<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.480> Boots<00:02:57.720> any<00:02:58.720> I

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
from places like Asda and Boots any I

from places like Asda and Boots any I
think<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.350> can<00:02:59.440> avoid<00:02:59.500> from<00:02:59.800> stuff<00:03:00.040> like

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
think you can avoid from stuff like

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.340 
think you can avoid from stuff like
Lloyd's<00:03:00.940> pharmacy<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.570> stuff<00:03:01.750> like<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:02.080> any

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
can buy it from I think it retails at

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.540 
can buy it from I think it retails at
around<00:03:07.630> about<00:03:07.840> twenty<00:03:08.410> five<00:03:08.590> pound<00:03:08.950> for<00:03:09.340> a

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
around about twenty five pound for a

boots asked are Lloyd's pharmacy places

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.990 
boots asked are Lloyd's pharmacy places
like<00:05:05.960> that<00:05:09.039> would<00:05:10.039> I<00:05:10.190> say<00:05:10.400> it's<00:05:10.580> worth<00:05:10.759> the

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
like that would I say it's worth the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.580 
like that would I say it's worth the
money

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
money

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.529 
money
mm<00:05:12.590> I'm<00:05:12.830> kind<00:05:13.220> of<00:05:13.310> in-between<00:05:13.490> because<00:05:14.030> like<00:05:14.389> I

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
mm I'm kind of in-between because like I

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.510 
mm I'm kind of in-between because like I
say<00:05:14.750> it's<00:05:15.020> stopped<00:05:15.530> any<00:05:15.830> further<00:05:16.159> hair<00:05:16.490> loss

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
say it's stopped any further hair loss

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.120 
say it's stopped any further hair loss
so<00:05:16.909> that's<00:05:17.120> a<00:05:17.240> bonus<00:05:17.389> but<00:05:17.900> in<00:05:18.560> terms<00:05:18.949> of

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
so that's a bonus but in terms of

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.670 
so that's a bonus but in terms of
regrowing<00:05:19.550> hair<00:05:19.729> I<00:05:20.180> think<00:05:20.389> that's<00:05:20.810> just<00:05:21.530> a

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
regrowing hair I think that's just a

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.290 
regrowing hair I think that's just a
marketing<00:05:22.250> term<00:05:22.460> that<00:05:22.669> they<00:05:22.819> use<00:05:23.030> I<00:05:23.060> don't

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
marketing term that they use I don't

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.350 
marketing term that they use I don't
think<00:05:23.690> it<00:05:23.840> does<00:05:24.050> that<00:05:24.849> it<00:05:25.849> hasn't<00:05:26.060> done<00:05:26.330> that

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
think it does that it hasn't done that

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.330 
think it does that it hasn't done that
for<00:05:26.479> me<00:05:26.840> anyway<00:05:27.349> I<00:05:27.379> would<00:05:27.560> do<00:05:27.770> let<00:05:27.949> me<00:05:28.069> know<00:05:28.219> if
