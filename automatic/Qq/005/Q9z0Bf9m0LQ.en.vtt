 in the season contest but 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.460
 Well, the truth always remains first 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.530

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.470
 especially to the stem it will be seen with 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.670

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.670

 you are tired yes no 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.430
 is that we have very little of your level of 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.190
 fixed because we saw each other recently and think 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.710
 now in epic and that the trip how much 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.600
 you have loaded then we loaded two days in 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.590
 a scale first in madrid and then 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.049
 we make madrid 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.299
 to the south of Bordeaux and the south to return to 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.070
 third trip and it's three days and nothing 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.200
 we work here a little bit and today we have 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.679
 done the test well very well pleased 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.950
 very well very well seen very well how 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:32.709
 you've felt more but more than ever or 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.709
 the first of the season always 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.850
 the first contest of the off season 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.710
 a little to the slope a little bit of what 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.410
 It was a windy day 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.540
 warmed the covered track already enters a 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.460
 little clueless 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.690
 and good but it has felt good 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.400
 true the sense well and I have had 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.370
 good feelings inside 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.510
 I'm happy now 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:00.909
 great is that it is not for less 374 and 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.490
 something that is very good 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.070
 and what was better in the test of some 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.020
 moment of the site here 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.590
 do not 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.760
 after the long gallop diagonally the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.710
 horse 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.630
 with the help of the right leg to 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.980
 the change to the left and late a 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.600
 little bit more I made the change a little bit 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.570
 later but for the rest 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.300
 I felt good you know a little bit more 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.580
 a little bit slower a little bit more 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.640
 behind the leg but good in 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.640
 general 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.660
 and us from here the time we have 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.140
 seen that there was a super contact 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.630
 that makes fire is always with a 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.850
 hand-made or just sevilla yes yes no se 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.280
 will feel says nothing my level of the day is not 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.070
 depends on the day but not just the locals 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.720
 Spanish the subject of contact one of the 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.820
 difficulties not then working 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.130
 a lot about contact and use 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.010
 of superior reality but today it is 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.519
 presents pretty well 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.100
 and good now to root for the special 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.280
 what 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.200
 it competes last Saturday morning 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.440
 this morning this special and good model 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.440
 we'll see 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.709
 the new special grand prize and then 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.909
 well a little bit shorter and I think that 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.680
 comes maybe taking away a little bit 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.840
 because the great old profession was a 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.590
 little bit long and sometimes weighs heavily on 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.030
 horses then I think that 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.819
 on fire maybe there may be a little 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.680
 better the special grand prize of 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.660
 Olympic 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.890
 yes also that is much shorter but 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.840
 good little more but maybe the best is not 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.319
 I remember it but you already did it the year 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.319
 past 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.140
 after this new year 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.940
 the year before the normal the long 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.370
 that is huge and endless 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.070
 it is endless 12 times you need in 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.820
 the horse very ahead and many 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.460
 trot transitions for long trot 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.780
 much passed transitions one part goes 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.480
 well because the horse is kept 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.580
 always a little bit connected but 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.080
 in a tough test perhaps the hardest one of 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.000
 all not because the grand prize maybe a 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.440
 a bit more technical and more short but 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.450
 the effective one of the programs 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.170
 hard of a horse 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:23.620
 Well yes because it 's when it counts 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.150
 then imagine that because 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.370
 heating conveyor you have to 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.190
 enter the center of long transitions 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.410
 passed are the two whole short of 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.120
 pass of passed transition within 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.610
 long of all the last water 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.500
 jog support and after all the part 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.000
 gallop is very very complicated and in the 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.740
 last central line that is a pirouette 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.139
 has nine changes towards the franc but 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.880
 is on the other side and then you need 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.430
 make the change very much with you and far below 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.500
 of you to try to omit that guy 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.180
 of exercises is not easy 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.130
 but at the same time a test that is very 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.350
 pretty because it keeps the horse 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:03.090
 always in front of the leg and 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:06.120
 and always aware of you not me to me 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:10.380
 personally I am usually given more 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.380
 mistakes the special big prize 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.710
 so 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.710
 and thanks for everything 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:24.019
 as a first obstacle summer pretty 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.669
 cool and I lived for everything for everything here 

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:27.649
 is where you have to get to first 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.169
 london the first one is the goal is 

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:32.299
 get in good physical shape and try 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.069
 do a good paper here what you have to 

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:36.349
 keep a little calm and focus 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:38.209
 good test tries to correct yourself 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:40.429
 same a little bit where you think 

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:41.749
 you're going to fail where there's some kind of 

00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:44.329
 problem but I think that these 

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:46.999
 contests have to serve us a little 

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:50.709
 of preparation for the good Olympiad 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:50.709
 Of course we are 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:59.350
 well thank you very much we wish 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.270
 all luck for Saturday and we're going to 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.180
 see if the comrades that Spain are 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.470
 in general today it has been very good that 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.470
 let's find them
