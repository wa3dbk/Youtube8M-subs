and then alright so if we go listening

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.639 
and then alright so if we go listening
now<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:02.420> think<00:01:03.420> from<00:01:03.570> time<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.080> time<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:04.470> might

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
now I think from time to time we might

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.920 
now I think from time to time we might
need<00:01:04.800> to<00:01:04.860> put<00:01:05.039> a<00:01:05.070> little<00:01:05.190> bit<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.369> water<00:01:05.930> omc
