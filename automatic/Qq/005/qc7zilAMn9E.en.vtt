with<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.100> watched<00:00:38.430> them<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.969> they

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149

shrunk<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.570> little<00:00:39.840> more<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.320> found<00:00:40.530> some

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
shrunk a little more I found some

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.650 
shrunk a little more I found some
leftover<00:00:41.430> hems<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.030> cut<00:00:42.239> off<00:00:42.270> another

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
leftover hems that I cut off another

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.139 
leftover hems that I cut off another
pair<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.050> jeans<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.460> think<00:00:44.730> I'm<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
pair of jeans and I think I'm going to

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.600 
pair of jeans and I think I'm going to
attach<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> bottom<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.530> make<00:00:47.129> my<00:00:47.309> jeans

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
attach it to the bottom to make my jeans

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.920 
attach it to the bottom to make my jeans
extend<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.149> little<00:00:48.270> bit<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.840> know

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
extend a little bit and that you know

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.840 
extend a little bit and that you know
the<00:00:49.050> color<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.440> pretty<00:00:49.649> close<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.399> think<00:00:50.730> I

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the color is pretty close so I think I

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.400 
the color is pretty close so I think I
can<00:00:51.030> get<00:00:51.180> away<00:00:51.300> with<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> little<00:00:52.199> bit

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
can get away with this it's a little bit

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.709 
can get away with this it's a little bit
darker<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> think<00:00:53.250> at<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> bottom<00:00:53.789> it's

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
darker but I think at the bottom it's

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.779 
darker but I think at the bottom it's
not<00:00:54.930> going<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.170> really<00:00:55.320> matter<00:00:55.559> I'm<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.640> to

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
not going to really matter I'm going to

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.299 
not going to really matter I'm going to
use<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.539> my<00:00:57.590> finished<00:00:58.590> hem<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.100> as<00:00:59.190> you

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
because I felt these jeans were too wide

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.840 
because I felt these jeans were too wide
on<00:02:18.720> me<00:02:18.810> anyway<00:02:19.200> at<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.350> bottom<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:20.580> what<00:02:20.730> I'm

because<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:44.250> know<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:44.430> can<00:03:44.760> kind<00:03:44.940> of<00:03:44.970> make<00:03:45.120> it

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
because you know you can kind of make it

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.020 
because you know you can kind of make it
blend<00:03:45.740> but<00:03:46.740> I'm<00:03:46.860> going<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.160> take<00:03:47.430> this<00:03:47.700> side

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
blend but I'm going to take this side

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.350 
blend but I'm going to take this side
and<00:03:48.270> pin<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.660> in<00:03:48.750> place<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:49.260> as<00:03:49.350> you<00:03:49.500> see<00:03:50.360> my

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
scene here is matching up with my seam

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.670 
scene here is matching up with my seam
here<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.660> I'm<00:03:55.080> going<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.410> pin<00:03:55.830> here<00:03:56.340> as<00:03:56.520> well

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
here and I'm going to pin here as well

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.020 
here and I'm going to pin here as well
now<00:03:58.680> I'm<00:03:58.770> going<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:58.980> do<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.190> same<00:03:59.370> thing<00:03:59.730> for

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
now I'm going to do the same thing for

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.460 
now I'm going to do the same thing for
the<00:04:00.180> other<00:04:00.360> leg<00:04:00.540> where<00:04:01.440> I've<00:04:01.920> attached<00:04:02.490> the

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
the other leg where I've attached the

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.590

him<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:04.950> bottom<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.370> Jean<00:04:05.610> and<00:04:05.850> when<00:04:06.570> I

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
him to the bottom of the Jean and when I

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.400 
him to the bottom of the Jean and when I
finished<00:04:07.230> I<00:04:07.530> did<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.459> search<00:04:08.940> edge<00:04:09.390> so<00:04:10.260> they

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
finished I did a search edge so they

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.370 
finished I did a search edge so they
wouldn't<00:04:10.680> unravel<00:04:11.490> so<00:04:12.480> now<00:04:12.690> I'm<00:04:13.020> going<00:04:13.170> to<00:04:13.260> go

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
wouldn't unravel so now I'm going to go

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.870 
wouldn't unravel so now I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:13.650> turn<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:14.010> other<00:04:14.160> side<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.790> the

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
ahead and turn the other side of the

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:22.390 
ahead and turn the other side of the
jeans

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.940 

okay<00:04:23.400> as<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:24.270> see<00:04:24.540> you've<00:04:25.410> got<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.740> bottom

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
okay as you see you've got the bottom

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.180 
okay as you see you've got the bottom
half<00:04:26.400> of<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:27.120> gene<00:04:27.360> on<00:04:27.600> there<00:04:27.870> if<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.830> wanted

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
half of the gene on there if you wanted

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.630 
half of the gene on there if you wanted
to<00:04:29.460> you<00:04:30.150> could<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:30.720> this<00:04:30.990> right<00:04:31.920> to<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.160> bottom

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
to you could so this right to the bottom

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.150 
to you could so this right to the bottom
of<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:32.970> edge<00:04:33.150> there<00:04:33.750> so<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.470> don't<00:04:34.680> have<00:04:34.890> this

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
of the edge there so you don't have this

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.010 
of the edge there so you don't have this
extra<00:04:35.670> but<00:04:35.850> see<00:04:35.970> I<00:04:36.000> want<00:04:36.360> as<00:04:36.450> much<00:04:36.630> him<00:04:36.900> as

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
decorative stitch to continue on down so

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.340 
decorative stitch to continue on down so
it<00:05:17.730> looks<00:05:17.940> like<00:05:18.000> it's<00:05:18.300> part<00:05:18.570> of<00:05:18.630> my<00:05:18.810> pant<00:05:19.110> leg

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350

on down to the bottom of the hill now

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.800 
on down to the bottom of the hill now
you<00:05:22.260> notice<00:05:22.830> that<00:05:22.880> what<00:05:23.880> I've<00:05:24.030> added<00:05:24.390> is<00:05:24.780> a

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
solid color and what I have is a stone

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.710 
solid color and what I have is a stone
wash<00:05:28.650> where<00:05:29.040> and<00:05:29.400> what<00:05:29.880> we<00:05:30.000> mean<00:05:30.150> by<00:05:30.210> stone

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
wash where and what we mean by stone

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.400 
wash where and what we mean by stone
wash<00:05:31.050> is<00:05:31.380> where<00:05:31.890> they've<00:05:32.100> taken<00:05:33.140> stones<00:05:34.140> and

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
wash is where they've taken stones and

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.170 
wash is where they've taken stones and
they<00:05:34.500> actually<00:05:34.710> wash<00:05:35.130> these<00:05:35.430> jeans<00:05:35.730> in<00:05:35.910> stone

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
they actually wash these jeans in stone

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.200 
they actually wash these jeans in stone
or<00:05:36.630> in<00:05:36.990> some<00:05:37.230> cases<00:05:37.530> as<00:05:37.830> in<00:05:38.010> this<00:05:38.190> pair<00:05:38.580> they

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
or in some cases as in this pair they

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.480 
or in some cases as in this pair they
take<00:05:39.450> the<00:05:39.630> stones<00:05:39.960> and<00:05:40.290> they<00:05:40.410> strip<00:05:40.890> the<00:05:41.160> jeans

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
take the stones and they strip the jeans

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.080 
take the stones and they strip the jeans
so<00:05:41.820> they<00:05:42.300> get<00:05:42.540> this<00:05:42.750> worn<00:05:43.410> look<00:05:43.880> so<00:05:44.880> what<00:05:45.060> I

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
so they get this worn look so what I
