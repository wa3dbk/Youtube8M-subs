 we continue a series of stories about 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.880
 interior decoration past 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.580
 time we talked about how 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.150
 lighting affects the color in our 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.280
 the interior 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.310
 and today we will talk about such important 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.740
 the details of how i am tinting colors 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.170
 for decorative coatings and here we are not 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.539
 do without special equipment and 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.970
 so step by step how is the process 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.160
 Color selection and application 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.009
 see first of all we take 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.890
 special fan which of the big 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.260
 the number of colors we choose exactly 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.000
 the color that suits us further we 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.910
 look at this color in different lighting 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.100
 because as we found out in the past 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.620
 plot affects the texture and 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.989
 lighting after we decided 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.879
 with material type and light begins 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.680
 polishing process polisher takes 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.309
 necessary product specifically 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.680
 intended computer tinting and 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:03.920
 program selects the selected anal 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.990
 color indicate the name of the color and 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.950
 the program knocks us recipe 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.060
 tinting the next stage after 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.350
 equipment was picking up the necessary 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.110
 amount of pigments are 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.990
 mixing paint this we take 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.490
 close the bucket tightly take it 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.689
 special strip which 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.020
 allows the mixer to clamp the bucket more tightly 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.210
 and put it 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.100
 the mixer here she talks can choose 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.900
 one two three minutes principle depends on 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.080
 client than saturated overall more of it 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.140
 knows here the tinting process is complete 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.000
 in just three minutes you called 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.660
 paint in the desired color get it out 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.870
 mixer glue the sticker color in which 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:53.220
 We zakolerovali on visor do vykrasku 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.220
 really know the encoder 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.700
 pay attention if you are not sure 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:01.070
 choosing a color is not worth calling right away 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.240
 experiment on a big jar 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.789
 small volumes 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.250
 finally a little design board 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.280
 it is not necessary to paint all volume at once 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.500
 premises first make sure your 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.000
