okay<00:00:01.170> hello<00:00:01.410> people<00:00:01.829> so<00:00:02.100> I<00:00:02.429> got<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.760> make<00:00:02.820> this

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
okay hello people so I got to make this

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.910 
okay hello people so I got to make this
relatively<00:00:03.659> quick<00:00:04.020> first<00:00:04.319> off<00:00:04.500> I<00:00:04.650> don't<00:00:04.710> have

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
relatively quick first off I don't have

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.559 
relatively quick first off I don't have
much<00:00:05.160> room<00:00:05.400> in<00:00:05.549> my<00:00:05.700> ipod<00:00:06.120> left

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
much room in my ipod left

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.179 
much room in my ipod left
so<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:07.080> vidi<00:00:07.230> has<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.560> be<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.680> little<00:00:07.890> bit<00:00:07.980> short

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
so the vidi has to be a little bit short

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.900 
so the vidi has to be a little bit short
but<00:00:08.970> I've<00:00:09.389> made<00:00:09.690> major<00:00:09.900> changes<00:00:10.519> to<00:00:11.519> my<00:00:11.670> car

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
but I've made major changes to my car

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.370

changes<00:00:19.350> first<00:00:19.920> off<00:00:20.160> under<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.150> doors<00:00:21.390> I

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
changes first off under the doors I

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.269 
changes first off under the doors I
switched<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.900> six<00:00:22.260> hundreds<00:00:22.650> instead<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
switched to six hundreds instead of the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.279 
switched to six hundreds instead of the
three<00:00:23.519> hundred<00:00:23.820> strips<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.269> LEDs<00:00:24.660> six

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
three hundred strips of LEDs six

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.099 
three hundred strips of LEDs six
hundreds<00:00:25.619> have<00:00:25.859> exactly<00:00:26.849> twice<00:00:27.119> as<00:00:27.359> much<00:00:27.510> LEDs

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
hundreds have exactly twice as much LEDs

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.650 
hundreds have exactly twice as much LEDs
per<00:00:28.500> strip<00:00:29.279> at<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> surface<00:00:30.150> five<00:00:30.359> meters

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
per strip at the surface five meters

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.410 
per strip at the surface five meters
long<00:00:30.779> as<00:00:31.140> Sol<00:00:31.430> so<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.610> means<00:00:32.820> six<00:00:33.149> hundred

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
long as Sol so that means six hundred

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.119 
long as Sol so that means six hundred
lights<00:00:33.630> per<00:00:34.260> 500<00:00:34.559> meters<00:00:35.870> yeah<00:00:36.870> oh<00:00:37.200> my<00:00:37.950> god

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
lights per 500 meters yeah oh my god

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.220 
lights per 500 meters yeah oh my god
cheese<00:00:38.520> if<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.149> see<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.480> spacing<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.079> those

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
cheese if you see the spacing on those

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.280 
cheese if you see the spacing on those
lights<00:00:40.500> there<00:00:41.000> those<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.270> normal<00:00:42.719> 300s

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
lights there those are the normal 300s

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.900 
lights there those are the normal 300s
there's<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.530> larger<00:00:43.950> gap<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.430> between<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
there's a larger gap in between the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.279 
there's a larger gap in between the
lights<00:00:45.320> as<00:00:46.320> well<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.920> as<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.250> ones<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.579> there

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
lights as well and as the ones in there

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.130 
lights as well and as the ones in there
now<00:00:49.289> 600<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:49.980> virtually<00:00:50.520> no<00:00:50.700> gap<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.480> again

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
now 600 is virtually no gap that again

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.619 
now 600 is virtually no gap that again
six<00:00:52.530> hundreds<00:00:52.829> under<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> door<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.520> switch<00:00:54.360> to

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
six hundreds under the door I switch to

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.689 
six hundreds under the door I switch to
a<00:00:54.660> 600<00:00:55.199> strip<00:00:55.440> all<00:00:55.890> across<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> chrome

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
nametag kinda lights up just like in a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.899 
nametag kinda lights up just like in a
black<00:01:24.210> light<00:01:24.799> biggest<00:01:25.799> change<00:01:26.070> I'm<00:01:26.610> gonna<00:01:26.790> go

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
black light biggest change I'm gonna go

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.700 
black light biggest change I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.119> cut<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.600> off<00:01:27.780> as<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.259> shouldn't<00:01:28.590> here

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
ahead and cut it off as I shouldn't here

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.760 
ahead and cut it off as I shouldn't here
in<00:01:29.100> my<00:01:29.220> last<00:01:29.430> video<00:01:29.869> I'm<00:01:30.869> going<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.439> cut<00:01:31.650> off

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
in my last video I'm going to cut off

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.770 
in my last video I'm going to cut off
the<00:01:32.250> dash<00:01:32.430> lights<00:01:32.729> because<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.360> think<00:01:33.570> they

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the dash lights because I think they

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.420 
the dash lights because I think they
clash<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> little<00:01:34.320> bit<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> new<00:01:34.890> colors

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
clash a little bit with the new colors

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.880 
clash a little bit with the new colors
until<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.360> convert<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.869> blue<00:01:37.380> lights<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
until I convert the blue lights and the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.770 
until I convert the blue lights and the
dash<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.400> purple<00:01:38.820> as<00:01:38.939> well<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.659> did

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
dash to purple as well just like it did

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.300 
dash to purple as well just like it did
in<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.930> doors

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
in the doors

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.760 
in the doors
I'm<00:01:41.310> gonna<00:01:41.520> run<00:01:41.729> without<00:01:41.880> dash<00:01:42.210> lights<00:01:45.770> but

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
I'm gonna run without dash lights but

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.639 
I'm gonna run without dash lights but
the<00:01:46.979> biggest<00:01:47.130> change<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:48.170> new<00:01:49.170> headliner<00:01:49.500> I

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the biggest change is new headliner I

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.480
