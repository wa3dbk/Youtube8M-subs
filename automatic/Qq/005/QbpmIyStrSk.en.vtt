00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
a powerup probably a little that clock

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.660 
a powerup probably a little that clock
will<00:02:11.150> do<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:11.270> have<00:02:11.360> an<00:02:11.420> opening<00:02:11.660> band<00:02:11.840> um

probably I think so yeah the problem is

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.710 
probably I think so yeah the problem is
we<00:02:16.489> don't<00:02:16.520> know<00:02:16.700> cuz<00:02:16.940> we<00:02:17.030> literally<00:02:17.300> show<00:02:17.480> up
