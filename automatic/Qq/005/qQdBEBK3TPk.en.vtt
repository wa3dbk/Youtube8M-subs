cannot be too far off by five minutes so

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.250 
cannot be too far off by five minutes so
here<00:02:37.800> we<00:02:37.920> have<00:02:38.100> 1042<00:02:38.940> supposed<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.660> serve<00:02:39.900> 10

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
here we have 1042 supposed to serve 10

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.990 
here we have 1042 supposed to serve 10
for<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:40.980> should<00:02:41.130> be<00:02:41.250> sufficient<00:02:41.460> but

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
for you so that should be sufficient but

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000 
for you so that should be sufficient but
again<00:02:42.420> ideally<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.930> want<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.650> have<00:02:43.740> those

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
again ideally you want to have those

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.360 
again ideally you want to have those
time<00:02:44.310> synchronized<00:02:45.590> so<00:02:46.590> once<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:46.890> verify<00:02:47.070> the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
time synchronized so once you verify the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.180 
time synchronized so once you verify the
dns<00:02:47.670> resolution<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.390> time<00:02:48.510> synchronization

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
dns resolution and time synchronization

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.620 
dns resolution and time synchronization
so<00:02:50.190> we<00:02:50.280> can<00:02:50.400> go<00:02:50.520> here<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:50.910> try<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.270> join<00:02:51.600> our

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
so we can go here and try to join our

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.020 
so we can go here and try to join our
ACS<00:02:52.230> server<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.860> domain<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.550> here<00:02:53.790> we<00:02:53.910> have

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
ACS server to the domain so here we have

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.990 
ACS server to the domain so here we have
to<00:02:54.150> specify<00:02:55.100> domain<00:02:56.100> name<00:02:56.280> which<00:02:56.459> is<00:02:56.670> lab

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
to specify domain name which is lab

going to use the user that we just

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.890

before we go ahead and join we can
always<00:03:08.850> do<00:03:09.030> test<00:03:09.300> connection<00:03:09.630> just<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.170> make

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
always do test connection just to make

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.650 
always do test connection just to make
sure<00:03:10.500> everything<00:03:10.890> looks<00:03:11.040> good<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.580> as<00:03:12.420> long

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
sure everything looks good and as long

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.620 
sure everything looks good and as long
as<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.990> have<00:03:13.110> all<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.410> green<00:03:13.620> checks<00:03:14.630> you

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
as you have all the green checks you

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.540 
as you have all the green checks you
should<00:03:15.870> be<00:03:15.990> okay<00:03:16.350> so<00:03:16.620> close<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.490> go

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
should be okay so close that and go

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.540 
should be okay so close that and go
ahead<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.180> click<00:03:18.330> join<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:20.280> now<00:03:20.400> we're<00:03:20.519> just

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
ahead and click join and now we're just

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.650 
ahead and click join and now we're just
going<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.850> have<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.410> monitor<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.590> status<00:03:23.660> so

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
going to have to monitor the status so

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.020 
going to have to monitor the status so
right<00:03:24.750> now<00:03:24.870> I<00:03:24.900> say<00:03:25.110> join<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.890> connecting<00:03:26.880> and

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
right now I say join and connecting and

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.080 
right now I say join and connecting and
now<00:03:27.570> just<00:03:27.900> turn<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.410> join<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.220> connected<00:03:29.760> so

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
now just turn to join and connected so

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.420 
now just turn to join and connected so
that<00:03:30.360> means<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:31.050> has<00:03:31.200> successfully<00:03:31.620> joined<00:03:32.070> to

that<00:06:16.080> gets<00:06:16.469> referenced<00:06:17.240> I'm<00:06:18.240> just<00:06:18.419> going<00:06:18.539> to

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:18.569 
that gets referenced I'm just going to

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:21.680 
that gets referenced I'm just going to
pick<00:06:18.779> one<00:06:18.930> of<00:06:19.050> these<00:06:19.190> access<00:06:20.479> services<00:06:21.479> this

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
pick one of these access services this

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.510 
pick one of these access services this
has<00:06:21.930> already<00:06:22.050> been<00:06:22.229> created<00:06:22.500> by<00:06:22.740> default<00:06:23.009> so

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
has already been created by default so

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.339 
has already been created by default so
here<00:06:23.699> if<00:06:23.789> you<00:06:23.849> click<00:06:24.330> other<00:06:24.569> identity<00:06:25.199> and

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:25.349 
here if you click other identity and

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:27.170 
here if you click other identity and
this<00:06:25.409> is<00:06:25.589> where<00:06:25.800> you<00:06:25.919> specify<00:06:26.250> identity

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
this is where you specify identity

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.079 
this is where you specify identity
source<00:06:27.449> that<00:06:27.870> you<00:06:27.990> want<00:06:28.020> the<00:06:28.289> EECS<00:06:28.680> to<00:06:29.069> look<00:06:29.909> up

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:30.089 
source that you want the EECS to look up

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.909 
source that you want the EECS to look up
so<00:06:30.449> if<00:06:30.539> we<00:06:30.629> click<00:06:30.750> select<00:06:31.199> you<00:06:31.349> can<00:06:31.379> see<00:06:31.710> right

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
so if we click select you can see right

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.670 
so if we click select you can see right
here<00:06:32.400> both<00:06:32.759> ad<00:06:33.120> 1<00:06:33.479> which<00:06:33.659> is<00:06:33.839> just<00:06:34.139> the<00:06:34.319> Active
