00:00:06.817 --> 00:00:09.451
Okay, I hate the dentist, you hate the dentist

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.866
Everybody hates the fuckin' dentist

00:00:10.914 --> 00:00:14.566
A few weeks ago every time I woke up
my mouth just killed me

00:00:14.591 --> 00:00:16.048
It drove me crazy

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:17.517
It felt like Shawn Michaels

00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:19.453
It felt like Shawn Michaels
would just dance his way into my room

00:00:19.478 --> 00:00:22.668
And just Sweet Chin Music me
right in the face, every morning

00:00:22.724 --> 00:00:24.025
So I go to the dentist

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:27.001
This place is right between a pawn shop

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:28.995
And, like.. a strip club

00:00:29.052 --> 00:00:30.874
The assistant comes in, she's like:

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:34.287
"Okaaay, I'm gonna put my fingers in your mouth.."

00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:38.020
"Aand then I'm gonna scrape them
with this big metal sickle"

00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:39.671
"Aaaannd then you're gonna pay off"

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:43.372
So I'm laying there, while she's scraping me
with these Freddy Krueger claws and she's like:

00:00:43.448 --> 00:00:46.202
"Okay, let's get some x-rays"

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.539
They throw this heavy-ass vest,
that's completely made out of lead, and I'm like:

00:00:50.596 --> 00:00:51.755
'What the hell is this for?'

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.691
And she's like:
"Oh, it's to protect your body from the x-rays"

00:00:55.738 --> 00:01:00.420
So I'm sitting there, looking like
I'm in a Jason Statham movie with my bulletproof vest on

00:01:00.488 --> 00:01:04.337
And all I can think about is the shit ton of cancer
that I'm getting with every picture she's taking

00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:05.866
She comes back into the room, she's like:

00:01:05.938 --> 00:01:10.231
"Awkay, let's take a look at those pictures
of your cance.. I mean your teeth!"

00:01:10.263 --> 00:01:13.882
She tells me
my one wisdom tooth is coming in sideways

00:01:13.922 --> 00:01:17.025
It's practically doing
a somersault in my goddamn head

00:01:17.064 --> 00:01:19.025
Basically, it looks like this

00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:20.349
All my teeth look great

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:23.446
They're all hanging out, you know
they're watching scrubs

00:01:23.503 --> 00:01:26.289
And they're fuckin.. eating nachos

00:01:26.365 --> 00:01:28.159
All of a sudden this guy, right here

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:28.870
He's all like:

00:01:28.917 --> 00:01:32.901
"Hey guys, do you mind if I'm.. you know..
try to act like an asshole?"

00:01:32.937 --> 00:01:35.080
"Uh.. I don't know, that doesn't really sound like.."

00:01:35.105 --> 00:01:36.686
"Yeah, I'm gonna be an asshole anyways!"

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.522
So I schedule an appointment
and get them taken out the next week

00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:41.639
So for a whole week I'm Courtney loving it

00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:46.285
On ibuprofen, while the Heartbreak Kid
whoops my ass every single day

00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:48.206
When I finally get to the dentist, I'm like:

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:49.122
"GET

00:01:49.147 --> 00:01:50.019
"GET IT

00:01:50.044 --> 00:01:51.172
"GET IT OUT OF ME!"

00:01:51.216 --> 00:01:52.247
'Cause I was about to be

00:01:52.272 --> 00:01:53.196
'Cause I was about to be Tom Hanks

00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:54.506
'Cause I was about to be Tom Hanks in Cast Away

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:56.181
And take it out with a goddamn ice skate

00:01:56.225 --> 00:01:59.043
So the plan was not to put me under

00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:04.005
But to dope me up enough so I that couldn't
really remember what the hell happened to me

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:07.155
So I start falling asleep, which is good

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.464
That's what happens to most people

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.173
They fall asleep and they take 'em out
and they never even know what happened

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:12.720
They don't even remember anything

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.887
But I wake up right when they start

00:02:15.924 --> 00:02:16.863
And I

00:02:16.888 --> 00:02:17.647
And I remember

00:02:17.672 --> 00:02:19.469
And I remember everything they did!

00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:21.177
I remember the sound of my tooth

00:02:21.232 --> 00:02:22.669
I remember the sound of my tooth
just crunching

00:02:22.694 --> 00:02:25.219
I can remember the drill, I can remember the blood

00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:27.867
His foot was on my head for leverage!

00:02:27.917 --> 00:02:30.012
And I felt like my head was gonna explode

00:02:30.053 --> 00:02:34.005
At one point he looked directly
at my eyes and saw them open

00:02:34.047 --> 00:02:36.745
And he didn't say a damn thing.

00:02:36.795 --> 00:02:38.406
And the ironic thing is..

00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:40.850
Is I don't remember anything after that

00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:42.422
I don't remember the car ride home

00:02:42.466 --> 00:02:45.966
The last thing I remember
is them wheeling me out in a wheelchair

00:02:46.022 --> 00:02:47.966
With a prescription of Vicodin

00:02:47.996 --> 00:02:49.035
And I'm just like..

00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:54.056
"Duuuu ai look.. hhheavy naaauuu?"

00:02:54.366 --> 00:02:56.120
So $800 later

00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:58.199
I'm left with a bloody mouth

00:02:58.635 --> 00:03:00.413
And a traumatic experience

00:03:00.453 --> 00:03:01.825
At least they gave me the Vicodin

00:03:02.032 --> 00:03:07.095
Because I can probably sell it
to a lady at Kmart for half my money back

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.810
