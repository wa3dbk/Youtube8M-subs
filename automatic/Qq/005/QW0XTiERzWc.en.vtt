middle I and the only way to hit it is

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.859

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
has two different attacks in this phase

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.800 
has two different attacks in this phase
one<00:01:12.750> he<00:01:13.170> will<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> tail<00:01:13.799> swipe<00:01:14.600> you<00:01:15.600> can

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
one he will do a tail swipe you can

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.660 
one he will do a tail swipe you can
easily<00:01:15.930> back<00:01:16.229> away<00:01:16.470> from<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
easily back away from that and the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.179 
easily back away from that and the
second<00:01:18.000> attack<00:01:18.270> will<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:18.950> he'll<00:01:19.950> charge

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
second attack will be he'll charge

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.190 
second attack will be he'll charge
forward<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.939> try<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.540> crush<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.049> his

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
forward and try to crush you with his

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.399 
forward and try to crush you with his
body<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:23.009> find<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.030> strafing<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.229> side

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
body so I find that strafing to the side

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.109 
body so I find that strafing to the side
is<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> pretty<00:01:26.100> good<00:01:26.280> way<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.490> avoid<00:01:26.729> that

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
is a pretty good way to avoid that

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.660 
is a pretty good way to avoid that
attack<00:01:27.500> once<00:01:28.500> he<00:01:28.619> hit<00:01:28.799> his<00:01:28.920> eye<00:01:29.040> he<00:01:29.400> will

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
attack once he hit his eye he will

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.420 
attack once he hit his eye he will
burrow<00:01:30.299> back<00:01:30.570> into<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.960> sand<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.470> repeat

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
burrow back into the sand just repeat

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.340 
burrow back into the sand just repeat
that<00:01:32.460> strategy<00:01:33.060> by<00:01:33.420> using<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.990> gas<00:01:34.110> pedal

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
that strategy by using the gas pedal

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.999 
that strategy by using the gas pedal
item<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.100> he<00:01:35.460> should<00:01:35.670> go<00:01:35.850> down<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.299> few<00:01:36.479> hits

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009
