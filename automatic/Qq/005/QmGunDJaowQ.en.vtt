00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.479 
maybe to get you to sit down and play
more<00:00:57.960> often<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.469> beat<00:00:58.680> your<00:00:58.829> stuff<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.250> long<00:00:59.370> as

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
more often to beat your stuff as long as

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.130 
more often to beat your stuff as long as
it<00:00:59.609> remembers<00:01:00.000> your<00:01:00.090> stats<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.780> your<00:01:00.870> code

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
it remembers your stats and your code

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.650 
it remembers your stats and your code
and<00:01:01.379> I'm<00:01:02.190> wondering<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.910> connects<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.390> some

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
and I'm wondering if it connects to some

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.479 
and I'm wondering if it connects to some
central<00:01:04.080> database<00:01:04.409> or<00:01:04.769> if<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.339> this

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
central database or if it's just on this

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.000 
central database or if it's just on this
machine<00:01:05.700> again<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.200> didn't<00:01:07.200> really<00:01:07.409> waste<00:01:07.860> a

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.670 
machine again I didn't really waste a
lot<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.189> time<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.820> place<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.500> let's<00:01:10.500> take

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
lot of time in this place but let's take
