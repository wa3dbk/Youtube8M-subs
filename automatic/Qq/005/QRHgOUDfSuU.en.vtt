 quite unique such device is it 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.240
 positioned as a children's phone 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.160
 machine and call the formula 1 of 1 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.000
 comes in such a box 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.630
 principle without any identifying 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.029
 signs other than the inscription and see how 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.980
 always phone equipment here we have 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.859

 boy food and some 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.550
 instructions in Chinese are unlikely 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.079
 we will need them sometime well 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.280
 now what's really interesting is 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.210
 The look of this phone is ferrari f1 by 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.379
 ford his background factors this is a clamshell 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.120
 we will probably start from the top 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.010
 caps obzorchik here we have 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.899

 this is made under the metal inscription it is not 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.659

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.130
 cars 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.560

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.240
 imitation wheels here even have 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.130
 such a skirt we have it if we talk 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.320

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.659
 cameras do with it even 2 3 2 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.360

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.140
 the back cover is metal 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.090
 it speaks very well of quality 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.759
 build phone as you can see inside too 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.469
 metal and again good factory 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.920
 phone models highlight the fact that all 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.899

 pick up without problems on a thousand 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.489
 milliamps and will find that in principle very 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.069
 not bad for such a child 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:44.150
 Phone number will be stable for 3-4 days 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.400
 keep metal cover close 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.030
 her and now again another interesting 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.810
 moment 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.609

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.290
 keyboard 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.519
 if I hold it in my right hand I think 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.530
 left and the same is convenient to reach out 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.269
 to any buttons think even if the pen 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.049
 there will be a small disk and it will still 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.299
 convenient buttons are big they have here if 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.669
 look so sideways they are not even 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.030
 attack has a small bulge now 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:22.129
 You can see well such a small 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.629
 We have a small embossing Russian 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.849
 font here and english font 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.180

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.290
 two calls central selection button 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.760

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.579
 and have us behind a metal grill here 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.870

 gone download 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.380
 Well, apparently so according to the Chinese 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.870
 developers machine ferrari sounds and 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.160
 Now if you look closely see our headlights 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.650
 immediately starts to wink 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.079
 people it is well such chips for children are not 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.609

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.520
 phone as a means of communication he is 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.650

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:32.810
 even boast please closed 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:34.610
 condition probably should immediately discuss 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.210
 that's such a closed state to win 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.140
 telephone and as you see here there is a 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.180
 windshield inserted hidden display 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.130
 display externally which informs us about 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.290
 incoming calls and time that is it 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:57.470
 interesting enough thing too 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:58.910
 time let's show you perfectly this one 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.800

 you can close it from the phone 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.520
 disconnect without problems that is it 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.050
 maybe annoying will be started but his 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.050
 you can disable without such 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:16.750
 So we go to the section of the game of multimedia 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:19.750
 tools and profiles choose a profile 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.750
 silently 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.930
 that's so that the sound did not interfere and so from 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.550
 sections that we have means there is 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.500
 the Internet is 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.260
 Leisure then this calculate 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.870
 ebook reader calculator

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.680
 extended phonebook 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.990
 then we have a message and we can 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.000
 so here navigate by 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.650
 incoming and outgoing drafts poisoned 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.570
 messages can even make a pattern and a 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.150
 that is, again the message here is good 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.630
 everything translated to a good level 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.490
 call log 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.070
 and actually incoming and outgoing 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.050
 our calls that were dialed 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.090
 who we missed or your child 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.400

 phone settings can be switched 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.350
 between two sim cards 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.450
 can automatically solve the phone through 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.020
 which sim card to call and you can 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.190
 manually select when dialing 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.360
 settings strongly timing phone 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.040
 connection management ie 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.750
 Settings too much you can for yourself 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.120
 phone so to speak again 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.130
 to readjust 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.140
 There are two indicators on the phone screen 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.480
 sim cards chichas we are not they are not inserted 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.040
 but you can choose to put an important 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.960
 detail besides from the cool exterior 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.510
 display again chicky boom 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.240
 well cool metal keyboards 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.620
 the hull is important and the slide mechanism is because 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.690
 that the child will often open it 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.510
 close it is still a toy and want 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.800
 to tell you that it is very good here 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.440
 quality mechanism due to the fact that 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.930
 from this part it goes inside 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.940
 metal parts are here themselves 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.040
 responsible for opening the closing of the phone 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.510
 made of metal and as for 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.980
 display when you close here 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.470
 Firstly the protective film is tight and 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.270
 glass and if you look closely there is 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.760
 These are the rubber inserts 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.650
 which prevent our display from evolving 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:19.190
 so you can safely close it there 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:22.100
 here and all this without problems doing also 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.890
 for lovers of different colors we have 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:27.169

 that is, you can choose the color 

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.419
 the number of these phones is enough 

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.580
 I want to say limited to you in Ukraine 

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:53.419
 because they are just a little do not carry 

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.750
 This is enough 

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:59.240
