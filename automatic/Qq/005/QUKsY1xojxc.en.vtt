or anything but there is one thing
special<00:00:44.820> about<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.950> fact

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
special about this and that is the fact

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.910 
special about this and that is the fact
that<00:00:47.280> i'm<00:00:47.460> using<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:48.000> dynamic<00:00:48.180> height<00:00:48.719> mod<00:00:48.960> so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
that i'm using the dynamic height mod so

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.810 
that i'm using the dynamic height mod so
this<00:00:50.430> elevator<00:00:51.360> goes<00:00:51.690> from<00:00:52.559> bedrock<00:00:53.340> which<00:00:53.579> is

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
this elevator goes from bedrock which is

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.470 
this elevator goes from bedrock which is
down<00:00:54.719> here<00:00:55.170> all<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.370> way<00:00:56.399> up<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.610> level<00:00:57.559> 256

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
down here all the way up to level 256

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.939 
down here all the way up to level 256
twice<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.690> height<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.260> regular<00:01:01.410> elevator

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
twice the height of a regular elevator

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.719 
twice the height of a regular elevator
and<00:01:02.420> it's<00:01:03.420> pretty<00:01:04.019> cool<00:01:04.229> now<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.159> hope<00:01:05.580> this

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
and it's pretty cool now I hope this

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.969 
and it's pretty cool now I hope this
this<00:01:06.330> will<00:01:06.479> work<00:01:06.630> sometimes<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.530> glitches<00:01:07.740> out

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
this will work sometimes it glitches out

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.440 
this will work sometimes it glitches out
at<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.250> very<00:01:08.460> top<00:01:09.350> sometimes<00:01:10.350> not<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:11.450> anyway

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
at the very top sometimes not but anyway

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.560 
at the very top sometimes not but anyway
I<00:01:12.659> will<00:01:12.930> include<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.950> download<00:01:14.490> link<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.970> this

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
I will include a download link for this

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.679 
I will include a download link for this

take<00:01:18.869> note<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.560> must<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.280> dynamic

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
take note that you must have dynamic

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.730 
take note that you must have dynamic
height<00:01:21.210> mod<00:01:21.420> installed<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.380> use<00:01:22.560> this

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
height mod installed to use this

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.830 
height mod installed to use this
elevator<00:01:23.159> because<00:01:23.909> if<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.240> load<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.479> when<00:01:24.720> you

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
elevator because if you load it when you

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.080 
elevator because if you load it when you
don't<00:01:24.990> have<00:01:25.170> dynamic<00:01:25.409> height<00:01:25.860> mod<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.850> world

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
don't have dynamic height mod the world

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.569 
don't have dynamic height mod the world
looks<00:01:27.299> insane<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.770> they're<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> little<00:01:29.250> I

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
looks insane like they're a little I

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.090 
looks insane like they're a little I
don't<00:01:30.390> know<00:01:30.630> how<00:01:30.869> you'd<00:01:31.049> say<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.439> crossed<00:01:31.860> eyes

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
don't know how you'd say it crossed eyes

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.700 
don't know how you'd say it crossed eyes
of<00:01:32.400> sections<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.939> are<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.240> missing<00:01:33.710> just

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
of sections that are just missing just

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.840 
of sections that are just missing just
completely<00:01:35.189> gone<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:37.040> insane<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.640> fact

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
completely gone it is insane and in fact

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.340 
completely gone it is insane and in fact
you<00:01:39.180> know<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.600> look<00:01:39.750> at<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.900> if<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.170> want

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
you know you can look at it if you want

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.350 
you know you can look at it if you want
to<00:01:40.470> without<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.920> dynamic<00:01:41.670> height<00:01:41.820> mod<00:01:42.030> first

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
to without the dynamic height mod first

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.710 
to without the dynamic height mod first
and<00:01:42.689> then<00:01:43.350> if<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.560> load<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.040> dime<00:01:44.880> or<00:01:45.149> after

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
and then if you load it in dime or after

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.960 
and then if you load it in dime or after
you<00:01:45.930> installed<00:01:46.259> dynamic<00:01:46.680> climb<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.399> should

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
you installed dynamic climb on it should

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.370 
you installed dynamic climb on it should
work<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.630> probably<00:01:48.899> will<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.229> to

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
work you just probably will have to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.170 
work you just probably will have to
replace<00:01:49.619> tons<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.220> redstone<00:01:50.490> torches<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:51.060> I

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
replace tons of redstone torches like I

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.580 
replace tons of redstone torches like I
did<00:01:51.500> so<00:01:52.500> that's<00:01:53.280> up<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.869> it<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.930> think<00:01:55.350> it

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
did so that's up to you it I think it

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.260 
did so that's up to you it I think it
looks<00:01:55.740> pretty<00:01:55.799> cool<00:01:55.979> or<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.369> can<00:01:56.579> see<00:01:57.180> it

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
looks pretty cool or you can see it

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.910 
looks pretty cool or you can see it

fact let me press f3 and you can see my

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.150 
fact let me press f3 and you can see my
why<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.239> 256<00:02:13.080> right<00:02:13.379> there

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
why is 256 right there

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.130 
why is 256 right there
so<00:02:15.160> if<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.120> can't<00:02:16.330> tell<00:02:16.510> just<00:02:16.540> by<00:02:16.810> how

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
so if you can't tell just by how

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.949 
so if you can't tell just by how
everything<00:02:17.680> looks<00:02:17.709> up<00:02:18.130> here<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.660> me<00:02:19.660> jumping

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
everything looks up here and me jumping

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.110 
everything looks up here and me jumping
down<00:02:20.290> right<00:02:20.500> here<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:20.980> seeing<00:02:21.850> all<00:02:22.060> of

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
down right here and you seeing all of

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.449 
down right here and you seeing all of
this<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:25.660> is<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.840> big<00:02:26.260> elevator<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.160> there's

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
this that is a big elevator and there's

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.979 
this that is a big elevator and there's
your<00:02:27.520> proof<00:02:27.850> that<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:29.319> will<00:02:29.560> work<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:30.989> it

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
your proof that this will work and it

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.740 
your proof that this will work and it
can<00:02:32.290> be<00:02:32.380> as<00:02:32.530> high<00:02:33.190> as<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.580> want<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:33.910> this

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
can be as high as you want it to this

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.540 
can be as high as you want it to this
could<00:02:34.989> have<00:02:35.080> gone<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.560> lot<00:02:35.890> higher<00:02:36.100> than<00:02:36.160> this

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
could have gone a lot higher than this

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.670 
could have gone a lot higher than this
if<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:36.880> would<00:02:37.030> have<00:02:37.090> made<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.270> higher<00:02:37.810> Matt<00:02:38.110> but<00:02:38.440> I

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
if I would have made a higher Matt but I

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.080 
if I would have made a higher Matt but I
kept<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.520> at<00:02:39.640> 256<00:02:40.120> because<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:41.819> took<00:02:42.819> long

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
kept it at 256 because this took long

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.850 
kept it at 256 because this took long
enough<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.510> make<00:02:43.690> as<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:45.660> but<00:02:46.660> that's<00:02:47.530> really

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
enough to make as is but that's really

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.160 
enough to make as is but that's really
all<00:02:48.130> there<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.580> this<00:02:48.760> video<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.450> just<00:02:49.900> wanted

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
all there is to this video I just wanted

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.520 
all there is to this video I just wanted
to<00:02:50.260> show<00:02:50.709> this<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.959> just<00:02:52.959> let<00:02:53.170> people<00:02:53.290> know

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
to show this and just let people know

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.880 
to show this and just let people know
that<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.860> works<00:02:54.220> now<00:02:55.050> one<00:02:56.050> one<00:02:56.410> thing<00:02:56.590> i<00:02:56.709> should

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
that it works now one one thing i should

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.640 
that it works now one one thing i should
add<00:02:57.010> though<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.750> if<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.870> do<00:02:59.019> this<00:02:59.140> on<00:02:59.319> a<00:02:59.350> server

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
add though is if you do this on a server

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.949 
add though is if you do this on a server
it<00:02:59.950> most<00:03:00.250> likely<00:03:00.340> won't<00:03:00.790> work<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.510> if<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:01.870> do

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
it most likely won't work and if you do

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.330 
it most likely won't work and if you do
it<00:03:02.080> on<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.200> server<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.590> have<00:03:02.739> to<00:03:02.830> look<00:03:02.980> straight

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
it on a server you have to look straight

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.309 
it on a server you have to look straight
up<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.850> prayed<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.690> you'll<00:03:04.840> make<00:03:04.989> it<00:03:05.140> and

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
up and prayed that you'll make it and

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.160 
up and prayed that you'll make it and
that's<00:03:06.040> even<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.430> short<00:03:06.730> one<00:03:06.880> i<00:03:07.170> haven't

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
that's even on a short one i haven't

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.840 
that's even on a short one i haven't
found<00:03:08.290> a<00:03:08.440> server<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.769> can<00:03:09.040> run<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.340> very<00:03:09.519> tall

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
found a server that can run a very tall

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.250 
found a server that can run a very tall
one<00:03:10.170> at<00:03:11.170> all<00:03:11.590> so<00:03:12.310> I<00:03:12.640> mean<00:03:13.540> I'm<00:03:13.660> sure<00:03:13.690> there's

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
one at all so I mean I'm sure there's

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.290 
one at all so I mean I'm sure there's
probably<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.860> few<00:03:15.340> out<00:03:15.489> there<00:03:15.519> but<00:03:15.940> they'd<00:03:16.150> have

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
probably a few out there but they'd have

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.580 
probably a few out there but they'd have
to<00:03:16.420> be<00:03:16.450> very<00:03:16.810> top<00:03:17.140> end<00:03:17.170> servers<00:03:17.769> so<00:03:19.110> if<00:03:20.110> you

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
to be very top end servers so if you

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.380 
to be very top end servers so if you
want<00:03:20.769> this<00:03:20.950> I'd<00:03:21.310> recommend<00:03:21.760> just<00:03:22.030> building<00:03:22.329> it

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
want this I'd recommend just building it

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.470 
want this I'd recommend just building it
on<00:03:22.570> single<00:03:23.140> player<00:03:23.579> anyway<00:03:24.579> that's<00:03:24.910> all<00:03:25.329> there

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
on single player anyway that's all there

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.810 
on single player anyway that's all there
is<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.600> this<00:03:25.900> video<00:03:26.230> so<00:03:26.590> thanks<00:03:27.430> for<00:03:27.489> watching
