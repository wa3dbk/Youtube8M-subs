00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.780
 over a year ago that was over Games is coming in 2010 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.250
 As an electronics engineer and Erich drive on sound developers come their new 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.669
 Project announced the Secret World 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:13.599
 and it is just as long ago that silver main picture which information to the 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.829
 ambitious online roleplaying game 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:19.059
 because since its revelation, this has largely become silent around numbered 

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:23.529
 whether the one world is deliberately kept secret or not 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.529
 We do not judge, but we want to tell you by means of recent 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.979
 published in the scenes a rather short insight into that 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.979
 new took place from 4 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.900
 Rheinfelden do not science fiction already my scenario takes that 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.670
 Secret World unfamiliar ways because in the online role-playing game, we are on our 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.670
 Earth in here and now on the road as in a modern realistic game world 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.300
 March at least a bit of their end is patience, everything was what the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.900
 famous the countless legends and outraged the Illuminati and AndrÃ© 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.340
 The secret societies are told in a similar way, however, the clubs are doing the same 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.170
 should add two and according to faction are available 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.910
 There are three in the beginning, the Queens Asian revolutionaries make them in 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.040
 The South Korean capital is both home and brute 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.430
 Put firepower 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.640
 then there's the London based Guttempler's on tradition 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.190
 and set the strength of the community So solo players are more likely here 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.750
 poorly repealed 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.480
 different because the Illuminati individual fighters focus on both weapons and 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.480
 also understand magic and by the way are in New York at home 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.170
 Anything individual is a good cue for what belongs to it 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.720
 refrains from much what makes usual online role-playing games so if 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.490
 There are not any ascents either 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.280
 instead each character has access to all the talents we are together 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.320
 lose the quest points according to his preferences and from Bonndorf 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.080
 there should be a whopping 500 skills subdivided into new weapon classes and 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.480
 at some schools 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.990
 exciting as much goes where we are allowed to have as many talents 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.760
 Bernd Haber played a part in the battle and becomes visible 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.180
 the screen 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.320
 again quite unusual for a euro 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.650
 the type of clothes worn depends on their own style of play speak 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.670
 the wavy talents of not what one feels so far away 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.920
 or which flights get hold of 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.420
 So already weakened hoods get covered in the 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.489
 Playboy, however, led ammunition belt and mass crash 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.659
 however, it remains questionable whether this design decision at all 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.939
 enough optical diversity arises or whether after the start of the game Ali Koc 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.719
 Wildlife revive the same look 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.989
 Exciting meanwhile already indicate mission by scripts specially and 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.049
 Telling cutscenes in game graphics 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.530
 the one shown here can play with current ego-shooters or on a role 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:30.639
 Although not keep up 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.680
 in mm per gate is something but quite a highlight feature 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.860
 but at least a phantom to tell a gripping story but knows the 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.059
 is good if it also be different also a big secret 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.929
