00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
with eights i guess oh yeah he was a he

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.679 
with eights i guess oh yeah he was a he
I<00:01:25.770> moved<00:01:26.070> there<00:01:26.250> near<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.640> end<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> day<00:01:27.240> so

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
I moved there near the end of the day so

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.899 
I moved there near the end of the day so
he<00:01:27.810> wasn't<00:01:28.020> there<00:01:28.259> very<00:01:28.470> much<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.220> played

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
he wasn't there very much I played

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.170 
he wasn't there very much I played
pretty<00:01:30.509> tight<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.759> probably<00:01:32.759> shouldn't<00:01:33.150> have

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
pretty tight I probably shouldn't have

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.359 
pretty tight I probably shouldn't have
called<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:33.600> eight<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.900> i<00:01:33.930> guess<00:01:34.140> because<00:01:35.130> he

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
called with eight so i guess because he

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.480 
called with eight so i guess because he
had<00:01:35.460> kings<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.150> um<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.229> mean<00:01:37.829> he<00:01:37.950> played<00:01:38.189> okay<00:01:38.460> I

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
had kings but um I mean he played okay I

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.109 
had kings but um I mean he played okay I
didn't<00:01:39.119> really<00:01:39.240> get<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.540> see<00:01:39.750> much<00:01:40.460> he<00:01:41.460> was

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
didn't really get to see much he was

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.550 
didn't really get to see much he was
playing<00:01:42.420> pretty<00:01:42.600> tight<00:01:42.899> probably<00:01:43.259> because<00:01:43.439> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
playing pretty tight probably because I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.030 
playing pretty tight probably because I
was<00:01:43.740> flying<00:01:44.340> pretty<00:01:44.670> loose<00:01:45.380> yeah<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.740> little
