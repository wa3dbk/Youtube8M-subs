00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
happens at the end of origin so I will

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.880 
happens at the end of origin so I will
be<00:00:43.250> taking<00:00:43.399> on<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:44.180> origins<00:00:44.540> ending<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.320> to

these<00:01:17.420> us<00:01:17.930> must<00:01:18.590> be<00:01:18.860> R<00:01:19.130> spirals<00:01:19.850> I<00:01:20.060> can't<00:01:20.390> think

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
these us must be R spirals I can't think

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.880 
these us must be R spirals I can't think
of<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.659> name<00:01:20.720> of<00:01:20.960> them<00:01:21.049> right<00:01:21.200> now<00:01:21.350> but

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
of the name of them right now but

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.230 
of the name of them right now but
essentially<00:01:22.250> what<00:01:22.340> they<00:01:22.460> do<00:01:22.520> is<00:01:22.759> they<00:01:22.909> control

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
essentially what they do is they control

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.510

reason<00:01:27.979> for<00:01:28.009> this<00:01:28.220> is<00:01:28.280> they<00:01:28.490> have<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.729> kind<00:01:28.939> of

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
reason for this is they have to kind of

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.270 
reason for this is they have to kind of
control<00:01:29.479> that<00:01:29.509> to<00:01:30.170> get<00:01:30.409> onto<00:01:30.770> aside<00:01:31.100> these

as<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:31.920> here<00:03:32.130> do<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.460> alarm<00:03:32.760> but<00:03:33.300> what's

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
as you here do the alarm but what's

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.510 
as you here do the alarm but what's
going<00:03:33.720> on<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:33.960> max's<00:03:34.380> her<00:03:34.530> father<00:03:34.800> is<00:03:35.130> trying

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
those characters from their game to real

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.990 
those characters from their game to real
life<00:03:40.230> how<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.130> why<00:03:41.280> they're<00:03:41.490> doing<00:03:41.550> it<00:03:41.850> we

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
life how and why they're doing it we

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.790 
life how and why they're doing it we
don't<00:03:42.120> really<00:03:42.300> know<00:03:42.600> but<00:03:42.840> Maxis<00:03:43.650> is

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
don't really know but Maxis is

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.870 
don't really know but Maxis is
essentially<00:03:44.220> trying<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:45.350> save<00:03:46.350> ah<00:03:46.770> the<00:03:47.580> world

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
essentially trying to save ah the world

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.820 
essentially trying to save ah the world
I'm<00:03:48.180> guessing<00:03:48.600> but<00:03:48.870> whether<00:03:49.290> or<00:03:49.470> not<00:03:49.590> it's

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
I'm guessing but whether or not it's

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.560 
I'm guessing but whether or not it's
actually<00:03:49.950> group<00:03:50.310> 935<00:03:50.580> we<00:03:51.030> don't<00:03:51.210> really<00:03:51.330> know

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
actually group 935 we don't really know

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.970 
actually group 935 we don't really know
there's<00:03:52.050> a<00:03:52.110> bunch<00:03:52.320> of<00:03:52.380> different<00:03:52.680> entities

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
there's a bunch of different entities

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.830 
there's a bunch of different entities
obviously<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.520> can<00:03:53.670> consider<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.510> origins

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
obviously you can consider the origins

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.810 
obviously you can consider the origins
any<00:03:54.960> being<00:03:55.140> just<00:03:55.350> a<00:03:55.440> game<00:03:55.680> ah<00:03:55.950> but<00:03:56.730> that's

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
any being just a game ah but that's

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.310 
any being just a game ah but that's
obviously<00:03:57.000> not<00:03:57.270> the<00:03:57.390> real<00:03:57.600> ending<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.020> reason

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
obviously not the real ending the reason

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.900 
obviously not the real ending the reason
they<00:03:58.440> put<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:58.770> in<00:03:58.860> there<00:03:59.040> was<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.370> kind<00:03:59.580> of<00:03:59.640> show

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
they put it in there was to kind of show

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.880 
they put it in there was to kind of show
in<00:04:00.180> us<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.930> collision<00:04:01.350> of<00:04:01.440> multiple

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
in us the collision of multiple

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.170 
in us the collision of multiple
timelines<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.520> show<00:04:02.700> us<00:04:02.850> that<00:04:02.940> many

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
timelines and show us that many

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.430 
timelines and show us that many
universes<00:04:03.780> almost<00:04:04.110> exists<00:04:04.530> at<00:04:04.950> this<00:04:05.010> time

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
universes almost exists at this time

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.840 
universes almost exists at this time
with<00:04:07.440> bringing<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:08.040> game<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.520> children

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
with bringing the game of the children

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.340 
with bringing the game of the children
to<00:04:08.940> life<00:04:09.120> would<00:04:09.300> be<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.420> whole<00:04:09.510> kind<00:04:10.020> of<00:04:10.140> like

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
to life would be a whole kind of like

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.350 
to life would be a whole kind of like
Maxis<00:04:10.890> as<00:04:11.040> an<00:04:11.130> overlord<00:04:11.490> God<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.970> his<00:04:12.090> children

whether<00:04:12.840> or<00:04:13.020> not<00:04:13.140> he<00:04:13.320> actually<00:04:13.440> is<00:04:13.890> like<00:04:14.190> the

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
whether or not he actually is like the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.670 
whether or not he actually is like the
brain<00:04:14.700> form<00:04:14.970> things<00:04:15.300> like<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:15.660> we<00:04:16.560> don't

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
brain form things like that we don't

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.470 
brain form things like that we don't
really<00:04:16.890> know<00:04:17.220> but<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.580> black<00:04:17.730> ops<00:04:17.940> 2<00:04:18.120> easter

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
really know but the black ops 2 easter

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.910 
really know but the black ops 2 easter
eggs<00:04:18.630> essentially<00:04:19.049> what<00:04:19.230> it<00:04:19.260> does<00:04:19.440> is<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.620> sets

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
eggs essentially what it does is it sets

going to break loose and everything is

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.280 
going to break loose and everything is
going<00:04:23.640> to<00:04:23.670> come<00:04:23.850> to<00:04:24.000> a<00:04:24.030> close<00:04:24.330> you're<00:04:24.870> going<00:04:25.200> to

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
going to come to a close you're going to

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.860 
going to come to a close you're going to
have<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.710> origins<00:04:26.250> timeline<00:04:27.240> colliding<00:04:27.810> with

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
have the origins timeline colliding with

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.450 
have the origins timeline colliding with
the<00:04:27.930> first<00:04:28.200> time<00:04:28.410> line<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.740> set<00:04:29.100> that<00:04:29.280> on<00:04:29.310> a

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
the first time line to set that on a

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.680 
the first time line to set that on a
course<00:04:29.730> then<00:04:29.940> you<00:04:30.060> can<00:04:30.180> have<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.390> mob<00:04:30.570> of<00:04:30.660> the

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
course then you can have the mob of the

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.200 
course then you can have the mob of the
dead<00:04:30.780> timeline<00:04:31.410> bringing<00:04:32.280> include<00:04:32.670> colliding

with shadows people bringing that to a

with shadows people bringing that to a
close<00:04:34.980> and<00:04:35.820> then<00:04:35.970> you're<00:04:36.090> going<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.240> have

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
close and then you're going to have

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.850 
close and then you're going to have
against<00:04:36.780> i'm<00:04:36.900> guessing<00:04:37.230> towards<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:37.650> end<00:04:37.770> of

against i'm guessing towards the end of
it<00:04:37.950> a<00:04:37.980> whole<00:04:38.490> encompass<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:39.000> map<00:04:39.180> where

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
it a whole encompass a map where

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.120 
it a whole encompass a map where
everything<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.169> everything<00:04:40.590> comes<00:04:40.890> to<00:04:41.040> an

everything and everything comes to an

everything and everything comes to an

you're going to have all of your

everything we're tracking flushes is out

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:49.260 
everything we're tracking flushes is out
because<00:04:48.219> it<00:04:48.430> makes<00:04:48.550> sense<00:04:48.729> around<00:04:48.879> this<00:04:49.089> time

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
because it makes sense around this time

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.549 
because it makes sense around this time

for three as you see in the giant you

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.950 
for three as you see in the giant you

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
have our origins characters so we're

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.719
