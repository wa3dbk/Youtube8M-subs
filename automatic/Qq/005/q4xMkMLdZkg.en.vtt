00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 how about friends how are mexican here 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 I hope you are very well because 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.410
 you know the video that I bring you is a video 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.570
 tutorial hoping you like it this time 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.710
 the video that I bring to you is how we can 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.529
 multiply emerald diamond or 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.109
 any other block of ore here in 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.900
 what is being minecraft for xbox 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.880
 360 that is also compatible with xbox 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.480
 one playstation 3 and playstation 4 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.579
 It should be noted that we are on TV 19 he 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.800
 seen people who try to cheat 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.890
 your subs but here is the evidence of 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.360
 that we are on TV 19 because I already 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.059
 comes out what is being the armors 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.920
 for iron horse and also here 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.190
 we have a chest containing a disk of 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.940
 cat music and also an armor for 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.640
 golden horse so let's explain 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.280
 what are the ingredients or objects 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.110
 we need the first and most 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:07.090
 important is a portal to the underworld 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:11.500
 they are normal tracks of rails 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.810
 we're going to need a car with a chest that 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.319
 this one we can create on this side is 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.409
 this trolley with chest here says what 

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:22.329
 we need and finally the block of 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.700
 mineral that we want to multiply in this 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:28.209
 case is a diamond block in what 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.420
 this cliché consists of the objective is 

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:33.670
 push what this wagon is being 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.619
 with chest and that inside the chest 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.229
 contains the block that you think we want 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.799
 multiply will come what in what 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.630
 it's been the rails and before 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.969
 transport to what has been the 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.780
 underworld I'm going to get into what is the 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.849
 menu of the trolley I'm going to check out what 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.560
 it's been the diamond block 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:57.069
 I'm going to be left with this blockade that's going to 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.409
 be created or be making the fault 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.780
 in the system I'm going to press what 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.629
 it's been x I'm going to decorations and 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.320
 I'm going to disintegrate it to have 9 

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:09.050
 diamonds 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.900
 On the other hand, this car will be in 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.750
 the underworld with the original block or 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.770
 whatever we are going to be trying to 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.200
 search is to remove this this block before 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.450
 from teleportation or transport 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.959
 what is being the underworld is a 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.610
 cliché not so hard you have to grab a 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.930
 little practice at the beginning if 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.359
 it costs but later as what 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.849
 it will be easy and good for us 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:39.370
 goes the demonstration so that they see that 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:42.640
 Really follow this click to me if it came out if 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.159
 I get it out so do not despair and good 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.549
 let's see how we get this super 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.920
 glitch 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.260
 I repeat the objective more than 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.239
 nothing is pushing the trolley before 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.859
 is transported to the underworld 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.019
 I'm going to take out the content that in this 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:58.030
 case the block I'm going to press what 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.469
 it's been x I'm going to decorations and 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.610
 I'm going to say to see what the block is 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:05.820
 of diamond to have the 9 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.580
 diamonds separately and what comes 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.500
 being this wagon with the complete block 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.830
 is going to be in the underworld I'm going to 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.620
 I'll break it and I'll do it again 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.170
 the glitch to have more diamonds I'm going to 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.730
 remove this in fact I can also 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.370
 remove the peak because that does not 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.040
 I need to push very 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.430
 carefully what has been the the 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.430
 chest 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.129
 in fact there we are going to wait for 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.819
 advance a little open the menu and I'll 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:40.849
 try there is I kept what I 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:44.140
 the diamond block has been 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:46.730
 so to say this is the desired block 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.190
 here the important thing is that you should 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.049
 to press what they are being x 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.519
 apart I'm in survival mode even if it's 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.010
 in peaceful but I'm in survival mode 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:58.900
 our creative in i'm going to press the 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:02.030
 button x I'm going to decorations and I'm going to 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.260
 disintegrate what are being the 9 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.660
 diamonds in this case come see I already have 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.760
 the 9 diamonds I also have the 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.940
 night division to see a little bit already 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.780
 I have 9 diamonds now I just need to go to 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.940
 underworld to see what's west there 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.850
 the trolley with the chest and apart the 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.870
 diamond block we want to follow 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.720
 multiplying see the time that there is of 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.210
 night division 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.410
 so they can see that there is no way out or is 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:36.820
 modified the video and there it is still ok 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:39.010
 we have the same time and we will see 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.289
 what does the mantel block still contain 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.139
 original view 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:47.349
 so to speak gentlemen this cliché of 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.419
 19 is real atheist I'm telling you is as 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.339
 youtuber that I am did not try to cheat 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.949
 no one actually liked the structure 

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:55.300
 but hey let's go to mediapart I'm alone 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.779
 it's worth it 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.719
 chatel this mother let's break this 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:05.199
 I want my block see I have the 9 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:07.210
 disintegrating diamonds and from this side 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.800
 we have what is being the block 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.620
 original diamond 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.509
 I will treat gentlemen I will try to 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.150
 do again what is being the 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:19.039
 cliché in this case if it works for me not 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.530
 it always comes out to me just like I'm 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.659
 grabbing the wave but you do not know 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.400
 despair let's create what's coming 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.229
 being this 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.100
 by sucking while I'm going to leave 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.760
 these 9 diamonds here 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.650
 let's put what is being this 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:39.250
 this trolley with chest we are going to put what 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.960
 what is this original being like 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.990
 they saw the goal is to push what 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.520
 It is the the wagon with a chest 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.630
 before you are treated before you 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.540
 teleports what is being the 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.930
 underworld I'm going to take out the block and what 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.310
 I'm going to disintegrate so, gentlemen, I wish 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.990
 let me come out again so they can see that 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.990
 if it actually works if the 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.590
 balance nothing else is thing to grab him 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.240
 the wave 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.190
 but well let's see if we can 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.710
 push carefully 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.210
 there it is already we push it I come from this 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.390
 side I open the menu I will try to 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.400
 remove it before it teleports 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:20.850
 here I already have what is being the 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.260
 milk block I'm going to press x me 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.240
 I go to decorations and I'm going to 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.180
 disintegrate 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.710
 and here I already have 9 diamonds know which 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.130
 is the problem has in fact taken another 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.130
 formula 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:36.849
 here I already have 9 diamonds made 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:41.080
 I also have them from here we have 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:44.229
 18 diamonds only need to verify 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.750
 go to the underworld to see if 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:50.870
 It does this cliché or is it 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.180
 It's a bit complicated at first but 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.510
 After that they will be able to do it 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.850
 easy way 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:00.190
 you can see that here is the other cube 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.720
 which is the original diamond block and 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.330
 Well, good sir, we're going to 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.160
 remove here is the original block and 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.220
 that's what material we can 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.220
 get easily is the portal is a 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:15.160
 trolley and a chest but good gentlemen 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:17.770
 this glitch works I tell you 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.540
 they demand or do not try to cheat them and we go 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.580
 gentlemen leave it and subscribe separate more 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.370
 videos like this take care of us 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.290
 we see later goodbye go here is the 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:29.490
 original and here are the glitches as well 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.490
 Take care gentlemen
