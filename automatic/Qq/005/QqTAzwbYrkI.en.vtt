00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:13.839
 Hello! In this video tutorial I will teach how to knit 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.460
 one of the basic points of the crochet fabric. 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.460
 This is the low point also called half a point. 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:28.419
 It is very easy to weave 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.279
 and it's the point 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.960
 more closed of the basic points 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.960
 has no right or setback. 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.610
 We are going to make the sample 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.880
 weaving a row 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.650
 of chain points 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.950
 I have already woven it 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.840
 and we're going to start knitting the low 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.100
 we're going to skip the first string and in the second one we sting 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.630
 and we took 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.510
 the loop 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.340
 and we had it 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.640
 for the chain 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.560
 thus 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.540
 now we have 2 points left we are going to make a loop on the needle 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.530
 and we slide 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.660
 the needle 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.800
 between the two points 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.440
 to close it 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.700
 let's repeat 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.010
 in the next chain we introduce the needle 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.150
 we take 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.000
 the loop 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.070
 we take it out on that chain 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.960
 what we eat 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.510
 and we have 2 points left 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.320
 now with a new loop 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.220
 we close the points 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.270
 introducing the needle enter them 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.139
 thus 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:14.589
 let's repent 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:19.329
 we introduce the needle 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.560
 over the next chain 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.560
 we take the loop 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:37.369
 we take it out 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:38.769
 we take 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.299
 a loop 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.719
 and we close 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:51.469
 the 2 points 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:53.080
 we introduce the needle 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:58.829
 we take the loop 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.079
 we take it out 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.089
 and we have 2 points left now with a 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:08.159
 new loop on the needle 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.189
 we close the points 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.589
 introducing the needle between them 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:21.999
 here 1 and in the seguendo 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:26.939
 is all you have to do to knit the low 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.369
 this we are going to repeat 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:34.809
 throughout the row 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:41.809
 thus 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:49.959
 when we reach the end of the row 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.099
 let's turn 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:04:00.099
 and always in each new row we are going to weave a chain 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.629
 and then we're going to nibble on each of the 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.699
 points 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.539
 and we are going to repeat 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:12.879
 we take the loop 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:13.620
 we take it out 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:20.620
 and close the 2 points with a loop 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:26.419
 we sting in the next 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.610
 we take the loop 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.080
 we remove it and with a new loop on the needle 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:43.080
 we close the points 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:53.240
 too easy 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.830
 they have to practice 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.999
 with a semi-thick wool 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:04.749
 and a thick aluminum needle 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:08.870
 as in this case that I use the number 4 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.629
 or 5 too 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:15.499
 the thicker the needle 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:20.479
 they will be able to practice it better, then 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.740
 when they get the point they can 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:30.740
 use needles and thinner yarn or yarn 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.850
 is all that needs to be done to weave this low that is also used 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.309
 a lot to make edges on garments 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:55.309
 ideal for beginner weavers 

00:05:55.559 --> 00:06:00.889
 so that the works are neat 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:04.960
 remember that when you start a new row 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.419
 they must start it first with 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.039
 a chain and then yes 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:16.289
 weaving the low point as 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.860
 I am teaching it 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.080
 at this time 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.069
 let's repeat for the last time we introduce the needle 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:29.559
 we take thrown 

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:31.759
 we take it out 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:36.039
 and with a new release on the needle we close 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:43.039
 points. 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:48.309
 This is the low point also called half a point in crochet fabric.
