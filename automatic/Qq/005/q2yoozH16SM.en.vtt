Hello! Welcome to Archana's Kitchen.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Today I shall teach you to make Clam Masala.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.500
This is based on your request hence
we are making this recipe today.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Clams are available in large quantities
these days. So let's make Clam masala.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.800
Where is this possible?
Only in Archana's Kitchen.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.100
These are the ingredients needed to make
Clam Masala.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.600
2 bowls of clams. Half of them have the meat
and the other half is without the meat.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.600
We have a home-made masala here. It has
half a cup of fresh coconut.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.100
5 to 6 red chillies.
2 teaspoons of coriander seeds.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.600
3 Kokam. Half teaspoon each of cinnamon,
cloves and black pepper.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.500
Half a teaspoon of poppy seeds.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
All these ingredients have been ground
to this paste.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.500
Onions and grated coconut. The masala
has to be roasted in oil before grinding.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.400
2 finely chopped onions.
Salt to taste.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.900
Oil.
Water.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.400
Shall we start cooking?

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.600
The first step is to heat some oil.
We need just about 1 tablespoon or so.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.300
Once the oil heats up a bit we shall put
in the onions and cook them a bit.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.800
One or one and a half onions are needed. If 
they are small then take 2 onions.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.500
We need to add some salt to it.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.400
Add less of salt as while cooking clams
amount of salt needed is less.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The onions have turned soft. Let's add this
masala to it.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.100
Add some water as well.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.000
Mix properly.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.800
Let's now put in the clams too.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.100
Now let it boil and cook for about
10 minutes.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.600
The clams will get cooked well in this
duration. Let's wait for about 10 minutes.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.300
10 minutes have passed by.
Let's check if the clams are cooked.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800
It's cooked.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.400
Now is the best part. Let's transfer it
into a serving bowl.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.900
The aroma is fantastic.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.100
Hot and fresh Clam masala is ready.
The aroma is just fabulous.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
