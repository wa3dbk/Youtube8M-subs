00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
you'd be running from all taking them on

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.000 
you'd be running from all taking them on
with<00:00:46.710> your<00:00:46.829> dumb<00:00:47.010> sword<00:00:47.930> noise<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.680> they<00:00:49.829> seem

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
with your dumb sword noise so they seem

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.760 
with your dumb sword noise so they seem
to<00:00:50.100> drop<00:00:50.250> these<00:00:50.460> things<00:00:50.600> yeah<00:00:51.710> these<00:00:52.710> things

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
to drop these things yeah these things

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.310 
to drop these things yeah these things
here<00:00:53.550> if<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:56.000> right-click<00:00:57.000> it'll<00:00:57.899> spawn<00:00:58.260> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
here if you right-click it'll spawn a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.139 
here if you right-click it'll spawn a
baby<00:00:58.710> creeper<00:00:59.539> and<00:01:00.539> yet<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.760> think<00:01:02.969> there's

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
baby creeper and yet and I think there's

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.969 
baby creeper and yet and I think there's
like<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.329> one<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:03.690> two<00:01:03.809> chance<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.379> these<00:01:04.500> baby

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
like a one or two chance of these baby

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.590 
like a one or two chance of these baby
creepers<00:01:05.489> dropping<00:01:05.970> another<00:01:06.180> one<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.479> those

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
creepers dropping another one of those

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.590 
creepers dropping another one of those
little<00:01:07.020> face<00:01:07.320> things<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:09.140> it's<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.380> Crouch<00:01:11.250> yet

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
little face things so it's a Crouch yet

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.289 
little face things so it's a Crouch yet
they<00:01:12.600> look<00:01:13.369> pretty<00:01:14.369> similar<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.030> creeper

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
they look pretty similar to a creeper

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.469 
they look pretty similar to a creeper
just<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.840> little<00:01:16.170> bit<00:01:16.259> smaller<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.299> so<00:01:18.299> let's

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
just a little bit smaller and so let's

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.999 
just a little bit smaller and so let's
