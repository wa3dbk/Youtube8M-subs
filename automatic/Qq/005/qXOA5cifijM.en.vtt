actually some people call it's like a

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.270 
actually some people call it's like a
rice<00:02:01.860> paper<00:02:02.930> salad<00:02:03.930> which<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.469> really<00:02:04.920> crazy

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
and this like I know it seems a little

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.800 
and this like I know it seems a little
bit<00:02:07.049> odd<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.680> when<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.250> soaks<00:02:08.670> up<00:02:08.879> all<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
bit odd but when it soaks up all of the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.059 
bit odd but when it soaks up all of the
juices<00:02:10.259> from

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
juices from

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.410 
juices from
Marren<00:02:11.579> a<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.849> you're<00:02:11.939> making<00:02:12.090> like<00:02:12.329> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
Marren a that you're making like the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.330 
Marren a that you're making like the
dressing<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:13.049> makes<00:02:13.379> you<00:02:13.499> great<00:02:13.739> noodles<00:02:14.099> and

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
dressing it makes you great noodles and

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.459 
dressing it makes you great noodles and
then<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.549> take<00:02:14.760> your<00:02:14.939> fresh<00:02:15.120> herbs<00:02:15.389> if<00:02:16.290> you

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 
then you take your fresh herbs if you

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:17.899 
then you take your fresh herbs if you
can<00:02:16.620> get<00:02:16.769> Thai<00:02:16.980> basil<00:02:17.219> that<00:02:17.579> would<00:02:17.730> be<00:02:17.819> the

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
can get Thai basil that would be the

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.369 
can get Thai basil that would be the
best<00:02:18.150> they<00:02:18.359> usually<00:02:18.719> actually<00:02:18.840> use<00:02:19.170> like<00:02:19.349> a

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
best they usually actually use like a
