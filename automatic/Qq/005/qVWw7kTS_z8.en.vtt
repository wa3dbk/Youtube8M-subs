rolls-royce<00:01:42.990> Merlin<00:01:43.770> engine<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.220> powered

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
rolls-royce Merlin engine that powered

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.850 
rolls-royce Merlin engine that powered
the<00:01:44.610> Spitfire<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:46.020> meant<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.470> pilots

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
the Spitfire this meant that the pilots

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.200 
the Spitfire this meant that the pilots
didn't<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> leisure<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.700> various

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
didn't have the leisure of various

didn't have the leisure of various
high-tech<00:01:48.720> computer<00:01:49.170> systems<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.829> would

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
high-tech computer systems that would

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.410 
high-tech computer systems that would
highlight<00:01:50.250> problems<00:01:50.729> with<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.060> aircraft

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
highlight problems with the aircraft

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.090 
highlight problems with the aircraft
like<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.810> with<00:01:51.930> modern-day<00:01:52.409> jet<00:01:52.619> fighters

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
like we do with modern-day jet fighters

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.039 
like we do with modern-day jet fighters
so<00:01:53.909> let's<00:01:54.060> keep<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.329> aircraft<00:01:54.479> running

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
so let's keep the aircraft running

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.510 
so let's keep the aircraft running
they'd<00:01:55.229> need<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.409> team<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.710> engineers<00:01:55.979> to

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
they'd need a team of engineers to

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.160 
they'd need a team of engineers to
maintain<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.210> aircraft<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.659> make<00:01:57.689> sure<00:01:58.020> that

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
maintain the aircraft to make sure that

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.950 
maintain the aircraft to make sure that

battlefield 3 for the first upgrade will

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.520 
battlefield 3 for the first upgrade will
go<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:03.360> maintenance<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:04.020> relate<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.290> this

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
go with maintenance to relate to this

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.429 
go with maintenance to relate to this
and<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.460> benefit<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.360> provides<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.960> game<00:02:07.200> is

I<00:04:18.609> think<00:04:19.120> there's<00:04:19.269> something<00:04:19.419> about<00:04:19.569> not

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
I think there's something about not

I think there's something about not

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609

that makes you fly that a little bit

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.350 
that makes you fly that a little bit
more<00:04:23.680> skillfully<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.430> try<00:04:24.669> and<00:04:24.819> evade<00:04:25.060> those
