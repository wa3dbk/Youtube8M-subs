or with real-world signals so typically

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.920 
or with real-world signals so typically
you'd<00:00:38.430> be<00:00:38.579> thinking<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.000> video<00:00:39.329> signal<00:00:39.540> or

you'd be thinking a video signal or

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.340

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
glasses or helmets like this basically

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.170 
glasses or helmets like this basically
looking<00:00:46.710> at<00:00:46.860> reality<00:00:47.039> but<00:00:47.730> you'd<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:48.059> an

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
looking at reality but you'd have an

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.680 
looking at reality but you'd have an
overlay<00:00:48.570> from<00:00:49.350> from<00:00:50.309> data<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.270> bring<00:00:51.539> in

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
overlay from from data that you bring in

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.360 
overlay from from data that you bring in
and<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.079> could<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.260> any<00:00:52.469> kind<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.800> data<00:00:53.010> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
and that could be any kind of data to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.600 
and that could be any kind of data to
basically<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.989> text<00:00:54.989> data<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:55.710> visual<00:00:56.160> data<00:00:56.370> or

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
basically be text data or visual data or

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.910 
basically be text data or visual data or
model<00:00:57.030> data<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.629> CAD<00:00:58.140> models<00:00:58.559> or<00:00:58.680> things

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
model data like CAD models or things

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.130 
model data like CAD models or things
like<00:00:59.010> that<00:01:02.239> well<00:01:03.239> we've<00:01:03.480> seen<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> lot<00:01:03.930> of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
like that well we've seen a lot of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.990 
like that well we've seen a lot of
benefits<00:01:04.589> from<00:01:04.799> virtual<00:01:05.309> reality<00:01:05.700> already

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the next step to be specific we've

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.460 
the next step to be specific we've
thought<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.270> lot<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.450> different<00:01:12.600> scenarios

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
thought of a lot of different scenarios

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.190 
thought of a lot of different scenarios
like<00:01:13.979> using<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.119> for<00:01:15.299> service<00:01:15.659> work<00:01:15.900> where<00:01:16.170> you

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
like using it for service work where you

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.320 
like using it for service work where you
have<00:01:16.710> instant<00:01:17.130> feedback<00:01:17.490> from<00:01:18.030> from

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
have instant feedback from from

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
you're sitting at the office and you

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.569 
you're sitting at the office and you

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
need to do conceptual sketches so this

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.670 
need to do conceptual sketches so this

can get a good perception of how big

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.070 
can get a good perception of how big
something<00:02:07.520> is<00:02:07.909> or<00:02:08.149> how<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.509> interacts<00:02:08.959> with

something is or how it interacts with
other<00:02:09.229> parts<00:02:09.769> but<00:02:10.519> this<00:02:10.610> is<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:10.819> slightly

other parts but this is a slightly

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.580 
other parts but this is a slightly
different<00:02:11.480> way<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.780> doing<00:02:11.900> it<00:02:12.230> this<00:02:12.349> is<00:02:12.500> what

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
different way of doing it this is what

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.670 
different way of doing it this is what
we<00:02:12.739> call<00:02:12.940> augmented<00:02:13.940> reality<00:02:14.510> if<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.260> add<00:02:15.440> to

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
we call augmented reality if I add to

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.860 
we call augmented reality if I add to
that<00:02:15.709> this<00:02:16.549> device<00:02:16.910> which<00:02:17.390> is<00:02:17.540> called<00:02:17.720> a

that this device which is called a

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.039 
that this device which is called a
fiducial<00:02:18.489> this<00:02:19.489> has<00:02:19.730> like<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.150> barcode<00:02:20.480> on<00:02:20.750> it

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
fiducial this has like a barcode on it

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.890 
fiducial this has like a barcode on it
if<00:02:21.349> I<00:02:21.470> put<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.250> my<00:02:22.310> field<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:22.819> view<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.299> can

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
if I put it in my field of view I can

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.890 
if I put it in my field of view I can
see<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.739> turn<00:02:25.220> around<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.640> product<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.239> put

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
see and turn around the product I put

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.650 
see and turn around the product I put
that<00:02:26.930> down<00:02:27.349> I<00:02:27.680> actually<00:02:28.519> have<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:29.090> sensor<00:02:29.630> in

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
that down I actually have a sensor in

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.479 
that down I actually have a sensor in
the<00:02:29.720> glasses<00:02:30.260> that's<00:02:30.470> tracking<00:02:30.769> my<00:02:31.010> position

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
the glasses that's tracking my position

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.759 
the glasses that's tracking my position
as<00:02:31.580> well<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.480> can<00:02:32.750> actually<00:02:33.079> look<00:02:33.380> around

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
as well so I can actually look around

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.180 
as well so I can actually look around
the<00:02:33.920> product<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.840> that's<00:02:36.019> a<00:02:36.470> low-cost

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
the product so that's a low-cost

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.220 
the product so that's a low-cost

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
actually go inside but how long will it

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.030 
actually go inside but how long will it
take<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.600> bridge<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.109> gap<00:02:51.140> between<00:02:51.290> science

ways and we're not quite there yet but

ways and we're not quite there yet but
they're<00:03:19.639> very<00:03:19.670> we're<00:03:20.269> very<00:03:20.510> close<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:20.989> that's

they're very we're very close and that's

they're very we're very close and that's
why<00:03:21.319> we<00:03:21.500> also<00:03:21.650> have<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.160> create<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.489> break<00:03:22.760> we're

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
why we also have to create a break we're

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.240 
why we also have to create a break we're
