i'm jonathan lopez and in my last

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.360 
i'm jonathan lopez and in my last
claymation<00:00:03.449> i<00:00:03.929> pulled<00:00:04.560> off<00:00:04.680> an<00:00:04.799> effect<00:00:05.100> with

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
claymation i pulled off an effect with

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.410 
claymation i pulled off an effect with
one<00:00:05.879> light<00:00:06.180> but<00:00:07.170> i<00:00:07.200> was<00:00:07.379> able<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:08.240> create<00:00:09.240> the

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
one light but i was able to create the

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.629 
one light but i was able to create the
illusion<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:09.900> i<00:00:10.050> had<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.590> ton<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.040> different

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
illusion that i had a ton of different

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.180 
illusion that i had a ton of different
light<00:00:12.120> bulbs<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:13.170> were<00:00:13.559> giving<00:00:14.009> off

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
light bulbs that were giving off

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.700 
light bulbs that were giving off
different<00:00:14.730> colors<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.590> different<00:00:16.590> qualities

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
different colors and different qualities

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.660 
different colors and different qualities
and<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.930> basis<00:00:19.439> for<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.070> effect<00:00:20.369> was

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
and the the basis for that effect was

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.750 
and the the basis for that effect was
using<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:21.900> table<00:00:22.230> lamp<00:00:22.619> here<00:00:22.890> which<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.460> you

colored construction paper that you can

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.030 
colored construction paper that you can
get<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.949> know<00:00:31.980> for<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> few<00:00:32.520> cents<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:34.040> what

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
get you know for a few cents and what

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.700 
get you know for a few cents and what
you<00:00:35.250> have<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.210> order<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.840> create<00:00:37.380> this

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
you have to do in order to create this

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.900 
you have to do in order to create this
effect<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:39.390> get<00:00:39.690> your<00:00:39.960> light<00:00:40.200> source

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
effect is to get your light source

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.020 
effect is to get your light source
pointed<00:00:41.910> elsewhere<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.020> as<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:43.950> see<00:00:44.030> you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
pointed elsewhere and as you can see you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.990 
pointed elsewhere and as you can see you
actually<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:46.140> reflecting<00:00:46.829> off<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.950> me<00:00:47.190> just

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
actually it's reflecting off of me just

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.459 
actually it's reflecting off of me just
check<00:00:48.180> how<00:00:48.329> much<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.110> that's

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
check how much that is and that's

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.680 
check how much that is and that's
actually<00:00:49.649> how<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.920> discovered<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.640> was<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:51.030> was

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
actually how I discovered it was I was

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.680 
actually how I discovered it was I was
standing<00:00:52.469> too<00:00:52.649> close<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:53.190> my<00:00:53.340> clay<00:00:54.030> sculptures

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
standing too close to my clay sculptures

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.590 
standing too close to my clay sculptures
and<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.860> was<00:00:56.039> affecting<00:00:56.850> my<00:00:56.969> shot<00:00:57.210> but<00:00:57.420> then<00:00:57.510> I

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
and it was affecting my shot but then I

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.270 
and it was affecting my shot but then I
thought<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.840> myself<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.440> were<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.829> actually

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
thought to myself if I were to actually

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.110 
thought to myself if I were to actually
reflect<00:00:59.820> light<00:01:00.649> into<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.859> set<00:01:02.160> rather<00:01:02.820> than

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
reflect light into the set rather than

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.719 
reflect light into the set rather than
projecting<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.899> directly<00:01:04.320> into<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.799> set<00:01:05.040> I

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
projecting it directly into the set I

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.850 
projecting it directly into the set I
would<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.659> able<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.840> put<00:01:06.960> any<00:01:07.320> color<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.710> I

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
would be able to put any color that I

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.070 
would be able to put any color that I
want<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.520> see<00:01:08.700> from<00:01:09.240> my<00:01:09.270> white<00:01:09.810> shirt

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
want and you can see from my white shirt

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.270 
want and you can see from my white shirt
to<00:01:10.470> my<00:01:10.860> hands<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.430> warms<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.939> up<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.689> there's<00:01:13.350> so

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
to my hands it warms it up so there's so

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.100 
to my hands it warms it up so there's so
many<00:01:14.460> different<00:01:15.000> aspects<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.600> animation

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
many different aspects to animation

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.050 
many different aspects to animation
mainly<00:01:16.500> lighting<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.130> very<00:01:17.400> critical<00:01:17.759> like

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
mainly lighting is very critical like

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.969 
mainly lighting is very critical like
you<00:01:18.210> want<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.630> make<00:01:18.750> sure<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
you want to make sure that you get the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.410 
you want to make sure that you get the
lighting<00:01:20.159> right<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.330> those

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
lighting right and this is one of those

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.330 
lighting right and this is one of those
things<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.720> only<00:01:21.960> cost<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.290> few<00:01:22.320> cents<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.070> it

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
things that only cost a few cents and it

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.429 
things that only cost a few cents and it
can<00:01:23.460> improve<00:01:23.549> your<00:01:23.790> animation<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.570> much<00:01:24.780> so

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
can improve your animation so much so

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.440 
can improve your animation so much so
anyways<00:01:25.710> we're<00:01:26.640> gonna<00:01:26.729> come<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:27.299> with

anyways we're gonna come in here with

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.780 
anyways we're gonna come in here with
our<00:01:27.630> light<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.110> I'm<00:01:28.829> gonna<00:01:28.950> get<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.640> as<00:01:29.759> much

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
our light and I'm gonna get it as much

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.880 
our light and I'm gonna get it as much
away<00:01:30.329> from<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.750> back<00:01:30.990> wall<00:01:31.290> here<00:01:31.740> as

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
away from this back wall here as

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.390 
away from this back wall here as
possible<00:01:32.460> because<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.540> back<00:01:33.780> wall<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.189> had

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
possible because this back wall if I had

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.859 
possible because this back wall if I had
no<00:01:35.520> other<00:01:35.640> choice<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.150> would<00:01:36.299> come<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.659> here

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.719 
but this this black paper like see how
how<00:01:46.470> much<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.770> difference<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:47.640> you

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
how much of a difference like if you

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.760 
how much of a difference like if you
were<00:01:47.909> working<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.299> confined<00:01:48.689> space<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.229> you

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
were working a confined space and you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.940 
were working a confined space and you
can<00:01:49.890> see<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.130> my<00:01:50.250> lights<00:01:50.490> slipping<00:01:50.970> but<00:01:51.950> if

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
can see that my lights slipping but if

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.649 
can see that my lights slipping but if
you're<00:01:53.159> working<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.430> confined<00:01:53.790> space<00:01:53.880> that's<00:01:54.540> a

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
you're working a confined space that's a

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.260 
you're working a confined space that's a
huge<00:01:55.079> difference<00:01:55.590> but<00:01:56.460> anyways<00:01:56.790> we're<00:01:57.000> just

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
huge difference but anyways we're just

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.039 
huge difference but anyways we're just
going<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.630> use<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.680> an<00:01:58.860> example<00:01:59.280> and<00:02:00.049> here's

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
going to use this an example and here's

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.490 
going to use this an example and here's
a<00:02:01.110> yellow

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.330 

Ballu<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:08.500> nice<00:02:08.679> thing<00:02:08.830> is<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:08.950> can<00:02:09.160> pull

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
Ballu and the nice thing is you can pull

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.979 
Ballu and the nice thing is you can pull
back<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:09.640> saturation<00:02:10.149> quite<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.509> bit<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:10.929> you

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
back the saturation quite a bit and you

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.220 
back the saturation quite a bit and you
can<00:02:11.530> angle<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:12.269> you<00:02:13.269> know<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.080> it's

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
can angle it you know so that it's

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.229 
can angle it you know so that it's
coming<00:02:14.500> more<00:02:14.680> direct<00:02:15.069> if<00:02:15.610> it's<00:02:15.790> gonna<00:02:15.970> cover

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
coming more direct if it's gonna cover

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.830 
coming more direct if it's gonna cover
everything<00:02:17.489> here's<00:02:18.489> like<00:02:18.640> an<00:02:18.760> orange<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.450> you

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
everything here's like an orange and you

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.360 
everything here's like an orange and you
can<00:02:19.959> do<00:02:20.050> this<00:02:20.170> with<00:02:20.319> any<00:02:20.560> color<00:02:20.860> with<00:02:21.129> any

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
can do this with any color with any

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.059 
can do this with any color with any
surface<00:02:22.440> matter<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.560> fact<00:02:25.230> what<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.260> like<00:02:26.709> to<00:02:26.890> do

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
surface matter of fact what I like to do

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.699 
surface matter of fact what I like to do
is<00:02:28.019> let's<00:02:29.019> see<00:02:29.230> do<00:02:29.440> we<00:02:29.470> have<00:02:29.590> some<00:02:29.890> yeah

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
is let's see do we have some yeah

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.170 
is let's see do we have some yeah
it's<00:02:32.709> all<00:02:32.950> actually<00:02:33.280> coming<00:02:33.670> here<00:02:33.700> with<00:02:34.000> some

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
it's all actually coming here with some

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.569 
it's all actually coming here with some
tin<00:02:34.420> foil<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.049> you<00:02:35.890> don't<00:02:36.040> want<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.280> do<00:02:36.400> this

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
tin foil and you don't want to do this

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.640 
tin foil and you don't want to do this
with<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.819> traditional<00:02:37.750> light<00:02:37.930> bulb<00:02:38.170> because<00:02:38.349> it

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
with a traditional light bulb because it

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.830 
with a traditional light bulb because it
will<00:02:39.190> get<00:02:40.180> hot<00:02:41.130> but<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:43.120> can't<00:02:43.420> come<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:43.810> here

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
will get hot but you can't come in here

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.470 
will get hot but you can't come in here
and<00:02:44.290> oh<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:45.730> was<00:02:45.819> actually<00:02:46.060> for<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.209> smaller

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
and oh that was actually for a smaller

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.809 
and oh that was actually for a smaller
one<00:02:46.599> but<00:02:47.049> you<00:02:47.170> can<00:02:47.349> actually<00:02:47.799> make<00:02:48.670> this

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
one but you can actually make this

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.600 
one but you can actually make this
basically<00:02:49.420> into<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.750> snoot<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.799> you<00:02:51.280> can<00:02:51.400> see

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
basically into a snoot and you can see

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.250 
basically into a snoot and you can see
how<00:02:51.790> much<00:02:51.970> less<00:02:52.209> that<00:02:52.420> projects<00:02:52.959> onto<00:02:53.049> the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
how much less that projects onto the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.770 
how much less that projects onto the
walls<00:02:53.470> you<00:02:53.890> can<00:02:54.280> use<00:02:54.700> this<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.629> in

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
walls you can use this and in

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.449 
walls you can use this and in
combination<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.530> can<00:02:56.650> reflect<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.280> light

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
combination you can reflect the light

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.000 
combination you can reflect the light
back<00:02:57.489> way<00:02:58.390> more<00:02:58.750> accurately<00:02:59.410> so<00:02:59.709> that<00:02:59.739> you

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
back way more accurately so that you

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.809 
back way more accurately so that you
aren't<00:03:00.129> getting<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:00.459> much<00:03:01.110> light<00:03:02.110> bleeding

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
aren't getting so much light bleeding

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.170 
aren't getting so much light bleeding
and<00:03:03.819> that's<00:03:04.269> just<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.750> quick<00:03:05.530> little<00:03:05.890> tip<00:03:06.180> just

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
and that's just a quick little tip just

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.150 
and that's just a quick little tip just
experiment<00:03:07.870> with<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:08.109> I<00:03:08.170> would<00:03:08.680> love<00:03:08.829> to<00:03:08.980> see

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
experiment with that I would love to see

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.710 
experiment with that I would love to see
what<00:03:09.340> other<00:03:09.519> people<00:03:09.549> come<00:03:09.940> up<00:03:10.090> with<00:03:10.269> using

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
what other people come up with using

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.110 
what other people come up with using
this<00:03:11.109> very<00:03:11.380> simple<00:03:11.829> technique<00:03:11.889> you<00:03:12.819> can<00:03:12.940> go

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
this very simple technique you can go

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.670 
this very simple technique you can go
out<00:03:13.239> run<00:03:13.600> to<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.810> dollar<00:03:14.139> store<00:03:14.290> grab

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
out run to the dollar store grab

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.670 
out run to the dollar store grab
yourself<00:03:15.010> like<00:03:15.190> a<00:03:15.220> 10<00:03:15.519> pack<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.560> let's<00:03:17.560> see

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
yourself like a 10 pack and let's see

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.220 
yourself like a 10 pack and let's see
what<00:03:17.799> you<00:03:17.859> guys<00:03:17.980> get<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:18.850> anyways<00:03:19.599> post<00:03:20.019> any
