00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.209
 and seeing the year this as you have had 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.240
 next year it's going to be again 

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:11.130
 is going to plant again is going to pick up the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.720
 rate that clear man stretched it and 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.170
 also that depends on reason 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.880
 I have thrown them 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.440
 he holds them back he could not sell them 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.990
 depends the reason I did not expect it 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.850
 because I can not sell them because it pays 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.400
 very cheap 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.470
 maybe very vast very fat is in 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.340
 the legs 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.330
 that some policy 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.590
 and in this kind of this own type 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.210
 exact 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.900
 for which in which we entered with 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.290
 fire spase yes 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:49.840
 You already see clear this year in general with 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.840
 all and all but it does not matter 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.659
 and why why is more done? 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.800
 short of normal with rain dependent 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:03.350
 the weather the heat the cold of this year 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.790
 when they were curdling they came a couple 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.530
 of days of west another and threw the flower 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.350
 and the little orange making the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.320
 and this is already second and third 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.909
 flowering of this tree blooms second 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.610
 and third and it's done if it had not been 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.090
 first on the small ones has been 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.899
 a small one but how do I follow it to earth 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.760
 in the field you have there 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.680
 near here 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.290
 is not the land that had 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.620
 and five or six or seven waterlogged cabbages 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.159
 of cabbages 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:47.289
 cauliflower is essential 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:51.979
 when I was already cauliflower almost good 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:54.649
 It rained a lot of rain and a fungus came in. 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.140
 made above all black is black 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.579
 black again but we wanted as I said 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.990
 as with a good habit and then 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.350
 it turns out that for the market 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.350
 Brazilian 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.719
 and it has already happened to us all to portray 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:13.030
 that everything after planting the work and 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:17.129
 the whole field has this field you have 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.970
 now and one thing if it works a bit 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.970
 Well, there are many people 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.090
 well 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.810
 and that was satisfied with a harvest that 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.480
 is going to make all the sun goes more 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.890
 working on tools that everything 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.890
 I had to hire people 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.769
 but I let him lose because if that's the way 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.090
 it costs pocket money and over 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.090
 I have pay we can not I can 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.910
 so he only loses what is the foot 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:03:00.090
 left and the ball that you throw left 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.470
 the published ones that you are soccer player not 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.150
 But what is it that tells you not to 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.790
 you have to pay labor the hand of 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.069
 I make it clear to me, break it is like 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.019
 throw it to orange for this now not 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.340
 I have a lot of work because pulling 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.160
 they did leaving and left it in 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.810
 conditions for when you now come the 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.040
 spring and the month of March that begins 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.430
 to bloom 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.129
 give him some joy to see if the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.319
 harvest comes as a little luck 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.849
 stronger 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.849
 well, you know
