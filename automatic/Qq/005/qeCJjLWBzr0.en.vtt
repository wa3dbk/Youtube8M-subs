00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.910
 what to do list today especially for 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.150
 the news news download which you 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.550
 speak actually about pes 2016 I 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.080
 will also talk about fifa 16 just a bar 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.570
 of comment avoid committing yourself 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.680
 between these two games since it remains 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.609
 still a football game and then must 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.900
 not too much to take the head 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.070
 finally here I play maybe I 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.630
 would do comparative photos that's 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.369
 important there is more in each 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.700
 side one must stop breaking the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.920
 head 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.380
 ah here is to want to defend his game and 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.870
 both are pretty good even 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.410
 here we find maybe a little 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.500
 more we will say bonus in one side 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.410
 but the other side that is little s2000 2015 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.949
 we can really find that we can 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.469
 to tell the players who we are going to say 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.789
 world and they have a lot of techniques 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.410
 and that's something pretty 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.719
 surprising and I really like the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.270
 picture quality on pes since it's 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.400
 really a fifa football simulator 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.570
 but also less in fact it is less 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.549
 worried yeah that got complicated 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.710
 explained finally brief I gave you some 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.750
 small information for pau 2 ps 2016 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.540
 had a lot of rumors and or huawei 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.460
 will have no pes 2016 says everything because 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.080
 it does not work well it will be dead I want 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.170
 just so you get home a little one 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.479
 little screen actually on the screen that 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.189
 proves how bad no actually 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.729
 konami they are well in the process of 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.990
 develop 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.360
 they broke my first the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.330
 development of pes 2016 and it will be 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:38.050
 announced it was confirmed at the 2015 e3 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.210
 a video game parlor often the big ones 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.240
 video games are going to be presented there 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.740
 to unveil either gameplay of 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.330
 little demonstration of the game of 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.220
 additional information that 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.140
 often positive feedback from the information 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.630
 positive for that after finally the 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.960
 people they envied to get the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.780
 the game so the 3 2015 you will tell me 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.560
 but when is it costing? 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.330
 exactly the 16th to the 18th of June it's for 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.040
 that's actually this month there unfortunately 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.060
 has no information about pes 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.950
 2016 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.410
 but it will be the next month so the 16 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.880
 to June 18 we should force we will have to 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.010
 necessarily actually end up with 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.250
 some little information see I 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.250
 thought 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.970
 a little maybe a little match that 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.830
 will be in demonstration with the news 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.390
 the new animations there will be 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.920
 a lot of work that will have been given to 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.330
 the tooth and especially me I'm a 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.780
 little dazzled anyway by this quality 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.430
 Image 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.870
 unfortunately not a lot of 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.000
 people around me play this game 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.380
 there and inevitably I am a little obliged I 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.770
 am forced to play fifa 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.450
 but that after that still have an opinion 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.180
 chose this game for certain reasons and 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.620
 then after me I respect all opinions 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.440
 with also another little information 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.360
 is that they also confirmed that there 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.330
 will have many more club licenses 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.040
 and championship ie 1 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.200
 ad should end up because 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.730
 it's true that it's a big enough 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.410
 defect with tevez is that they had 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.970
 not really a lot of licenses and there 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.930
 they are rebuilding it's 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.190
 where they are finally 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.830
 deliver licenses and where they 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.770
 put a lot of things in and that 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.160
 can really finally compete 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:15.820
 fifa even though we all know that fifa that's 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.980
 a little the game of football a bar one in 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.510
 terms of sales and everything but maybe 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.600
 that that year it can be the 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.870
 difference to depend on how are going there 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.830
 an almost change the game even if there 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.600
 they will bring a lot of 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.670
 modifications I think and then that little 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.380
 near all for now with this 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.510
 little image that I am really very 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.709
 well launched on twitter for good 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.830
 confirm that there will be good 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.720
 the existence is well pes 2016 is it 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.850
 that these are not rumors but for 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.200
 now it's official appointment here 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.520
 you so in a month to have more 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.790
 information 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.790
 without
