something very simplistic the display is
in<00:00:55.899> focus<00:00:56.140> so<00:00:56.829> it<00:00:56.949> has<00:00:56.980> this<00:00:57.309> almost<00:00:57.730> floating

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
in focus so it has this almost floating

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.020

display<00:00:58.989> from<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.410> side<00:00:59.620> but<00:01:00.010> then<00:01:00.190> giving<00:01:00.910> a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
display from the side but then giving a

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.910 
display from the side but then giving a
very<00:01:01.359> nice<00:01:01.600> contrast<00:01:02.199> to<00:01:02.379> the<00:01:02.500> back<00:01:02.649> side

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
very nice contrast to the back side

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.200 
very nice contrast to the back side
which<00:01:03.219> is<00:01:03.250> aluminum<00:01:05.549> what<00:01:06.549> we<00:01:06.670> want<00:01:06.850> people<00:01:07.119> to

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.520 
which is aluminum what we want people to
feel<00:01:07.420> when<00:01:07.689> they<00:01:07.780> use<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.140> user<00:01:08.290> interface

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
feel when they use the user interface

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.679 
feel when they use the user interface
part<00:01:09.189> of<00:01:09.310> it<00:01:09.400> is<00:01:09.580> it<00:01:10.090> should<00:01:10.330> be<00:01:10.450> invisible

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
part of it is it should be invisible

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.210 
part of it is it should be invisible
they<00:01:11.110> should<00:01:11.290> just<00:01:11.320> be<00:01:11.590> doing<00:01:11.770> what<00:01:12.070> it<00:01:12.159> is

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
they should just be doing what it is

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.160 
they should just be doing what it is
they<00:01:12.430> need<00:01:12.580> to<00:01:12.670> be<00:01:12.790> doing<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:13.270> then<00:01:13.990> there<00:01:14.140> are

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
they need to be doing and then there are

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.100 
they need to be doing and then there are
moments<00:01:14.470> when<00:01:14.860> I<00:01:14.890> want<00:01:15.130> people<00:01:15.400> to<00:01:15.549> feel

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
moments when I want people to feel

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.899
