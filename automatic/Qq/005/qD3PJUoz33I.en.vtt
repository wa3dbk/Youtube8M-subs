captured what i was trying to say and

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.250 
captured what i was trying to say and
basically<00:00:13.320> all<00:00:13.769> I'm<00:00:13.920> doing<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.519> I'm<00:00:15.260> running

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
to nades getting hammer going to their

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.090 
to nades getting hammer going to their
needs<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.630> that's<00:00:18.900> going<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.680> be<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> round

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
needs and that's going to be the round

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.840 
needs and that's going to be the round
put<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.150> most<00:00:21.330> basic<00:00:21.869> way<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.769> can<00:00:23.010> say<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
put in the most basic way I can say the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.759 
put in the most basic way I can say the
way<00:00:23.970> TDM<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.570> its<00:00:24.750> kind<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.080> cheap<00:00:25.320> because<00:00:25.529> if

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
way TDM is its kind of cheap because if

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.170 
way TDM is its kind of cheap because if
you<00:00:25.859> get<00:00:26.010> your<00:00:26.039> initial<00:00:26.400> rush<00:00:26.580> down<00:00:26.820> right

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
you get your initial rush down right

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.660 
you get your initial rush down right
like<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.840> am<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.500> will<00:00:28.710> literally<00:00:28.980> pave<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
like I am it will literally pave the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.299 
like I am it will literally pave the
whole<00:00:29.820> round<00:00:30.029> for<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.449> as<00:00:31.380> well<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.130> long<00:00:32.250> as

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
whole round for you as well so long as

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.459 
whole round for you as well so long as
you<00:00:32.489> don't<00:00:32.640> make<00:00:32.759> any<00:00:32.899> minor<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.110> mistakes

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
you don't make any minor of mistakes

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.370 
you don't make any minor of mistakes
which<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.860> didn't<00:00:35.100> make<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.489> round<00:00:35.820> and

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
which I didn't make this round and

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.020 
which I didn't make this round and
that's<00:00:37.380> why<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.590> don't<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.800> TDM<00:00:38.280> because<00:00:38.910> of

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
that's why I don't like TDM because of

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.479 
that's why I don't like TDM because of
for<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> spawn<00:00:39.870> spawning<00:00:40.559> reasons<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.219> think

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
for the spawn spawning reasons I think

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.979 
for the spawn spawning reasons I think
there<00:00:41.640> should<00:00:41.790> be<00:00:41.820> more<00:00:42.030> spawns<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.780> king

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
there should be more spawns like in king

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.139 
there should be more spawns like in king
of<00:00:43.079> hill<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.469> because<00:00:43.770> spawn<00:00:44.520> trapping<00:00:44.850> is

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
of hill just because spawn trapping is

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.470 
of hill just because spawn trapping is
becoming<00:00:45.750> such<00:00:46.170> an<00:00:47.160> essential<00:00:47.670> skill<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.390> a

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
becoming such an essential skill in a

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.110 
becoming such an essential skill in a
sense<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:49.110> play<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> game<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.789> what<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.000> just

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
sense to play the game so what you just

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.139 
sense to play the game so what you just
saw<00:00:51.329> as<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.750> took<00:00:51.809> over<00:00:52.640> hammer<00:00:53.640> gone<00:00:53.969> no

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
then I'm gonna run up to Nate it's tough

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.210

for<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.570> other<00:01:16.110> team<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.530> make<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> comeback<00:01:16.920> at

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
for the other team to make a comeback at

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.800 
for the other team to make a comeback at
this<00:01:17.340> point<00:01:17.549> because<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.180> ways<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.659> they

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
this point because the ways that they

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.350 
this point because the ways that they
have<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.320> going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.920> are<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.610> ways<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.330> lead

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
have of going to are just ways that lead

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.950 
have of going to are just ways that lead
into<00:01:21.659> us<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.290> then<00:01:22.979> going<00:01:23.220> high<00:01:23.400> side<00:01:23.700> here

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
into us and then going high side here

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.300 
into us and then going high side here
they<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.170> deal<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.350> hammer<00:01:25.619> otherwise

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
they have to deal with hammer otherwise

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.740 
they have to deal with hammer otherwise
they<00:01:26.520> deal<00:01:26.700> with<00:01:26.729> digger<00:01:27.030> with<00:01:27.270> my<00:01:27.390> teammates

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
they deal with digger with my teammates

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.179 
they deal with digger with my teammates
there's<00:01:27.990> not<00:01:28.140> very<00:01:28.170> many<00:01:28.790> good<00:01:29.790> options<00:01:30.479> for

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
there's not very many good options for

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.580 
there's not very many good options for
the<00:01:32.189> other<00:01:32.310> team<00:01:33.110> here's<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.320> mean<00:01:34.470> about

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the other team here's what I mean about

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.620 
the other team here's what I mean about
little<00:01:35.189> mistakes<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:36.060> wasn't<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.509> mistake

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
little mistakes this wasn't a mistake

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.300 
little mistakes this wasn't a mistake
backing<00:01:37.290> off<00:01:37.409> was<00:01:37.560> probably<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.009> good<00:01:38.070> thing

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
backing off was probably a good thing

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.700 
backing off was probably a good thing
because<00:01:38.490> if<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.900> had<00:01:39.900> died<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.170> would<00:01:40.409> have<00:01:40.590> gave

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
because if I had died I would have gave

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.770 
because if I had died I would have gave
me<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.860> chance<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.310> recuperate<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.630> can

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
me a chance to recuperate and you can

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.880 
me a chance to recuperate and you can
see<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:42.990> they're<00:01:43.350> all<00:01:43.380> kind<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.740> just

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
see that they're all kind of just

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.490 
see that they're all kind of just
scattered<00:01:44.520> down<00:01:44.700> there<00:01:44.939> if<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.899> showed<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
scattered down there if I showed you the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.630 
scattered down there if I showed you the
whole<00:01:46.680> match<00:01:46.890> you'd<00:01:47.100> realize<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.549> these

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
whole match you'd realize that these

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.760 
whole match you'd realize that these
guys<00:01:47.820> aren't<00:01:48.119> as<00:01:48.299> bad<00:01:48.450> as<00:01:48.659> they<00:01:49.229> might<00:01:49.409> seem<00:01:49.649> to

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
guys aren't as bad as they might seem to

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.200 
guys aren't as bad as they might seem to
be<00:01:49.890> they<00:01:50.070> actually<00:01:50.189> came<00:01:50.520> really<00:01:50.790> close<00:01:50.970> to

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
be they actually came really close to

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.710 
be they actually came really close to
winning<00:01:51.420> but<00:01:51.780> around<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:53.189> just

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
winning but around like this it's just

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.550 
winning but around like this it's just
near<00:01:54.720> impossible<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.380> make

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
near impossible to make

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.130 
near impossible to make
back<00:01:56.710> at<00:01:56.890> this<00:01:57.070> point<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:57.579> think<00:01:58.180> I'm<00:01:58.899> gonna

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
back at this point I think I'm gonna

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.260 
back at this point I think I'm gonna
make<00:01:59.409> this<00:01:59.439> into<00:01:59.920> a<00:01:59.950> little<00:02:00.220> series<00:02:00.610> because

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
make this into a little series because

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.050 
make this into a little series because
these<00:02:01.899> are<00:02:02.110> very<00:02:02.680> specific<00:02:02.979> routes<00:02:03.579> I<00:02:03.759> like<00:02:03.909> to

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
these are very specific routes I like to

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.779 
these are very specific routes I like to
run<00:02:04.210> this<00:02:04.420> isn't<00:02:04.780> random<00:02:05.110> I<00:02:05.470> try<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:05.829> run<00:02:06.070> this

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
run this isn't random I try to run this

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.059 
run this isn't random I try to run this
pathway<00:02:07.390> most<00:02:07.990> of<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.349> time<00:02:08.560> I'm<00:02:08.800> playing

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
pathway most of the time I'm playing

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.780 
pathway most of the time I'm playing
unless<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.910> feel<00:02:10.630> like<00:02:11.050> some<00:02:11.319> unconventional

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
unless I feel like some unconventional

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.880 
unless I feel like some unconventional
play<00:02:12.790> style<00:02:13.120> here's<00:02:13.750> terrible<00:02:14.170> aim<00:02:14.319> but

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
play style here's terrible aim but

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.500 
play style here's terrible aim but
managed<00:02:15.489> to<00:02:15.519> get<00:02:15.730> them<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.060> at<00:02:16.150> this<00:02:16.269> point

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
managed to get them and at this point

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.320 
managed to get them and at this point
we're<00:02:16.750> just<00:02:16.780> kind<00:02:17.140> of<00:02:17.290> picking<00:02:17.560> off<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.489> mangy

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
we're just kind of picking off the mangy

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.380 
we're just kind of picking off the mangy
remaining<00:02:19.989> guys<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.700> think<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.000> last<00:02:22.150> guys

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
remaining guys and I think the last guys

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.059 
remaining guys and I think the last guys
around<00:02:22.630> corner<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:23.349> hopefully<00:02:23.560> you<00:02:23.800> like<00:02:23.950> this

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
around corner so hopefully you like this

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.670 
around corner so hopefully you like this
little<00:02:24.220> video<00:02:24.489> if<00:02:25.269> you<00:02:25.569> did<00:02:25.599> I<00:02:26.050> can<00:02:26.290> try<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.470> put

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
little video if you did I can try to put

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.710 
little video if you did I can try to put
up<00:02:26.769> some<00:02:26.980> more<00:02:27.040> initial<00:02:27.730> rush<00:02:27.910> clips<00:02:28.209> from

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
up some more initial rush clips from

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.410 
up some more initial rush clips from
from<00:02:29.260> other<00:02:29.410> maps<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.940> will<00:02:31.150> see<00:02:31.299> you<00:02:31.330> guys

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
from other maps and I will see you guys

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.780 
from other maps and I will see you guys
later
