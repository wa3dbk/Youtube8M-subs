00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.250
 today 18 days ago that would be a seconds 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.920
 I could not find a better place to 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.779
 tell me stories from third parties 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.210
 and do it from the heart of the park 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.010
 national of aigÃ¼estortes place that I 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.330
 remember my childhood that transports me 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.890
 my adolescence 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.690
 in the era of the camera gave more and 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.380
 sailors who could understand other 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.380
 properties 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.440
 after seeing a fact that nothing ever 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.619
 pass me your bottle we left is already very 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.420
 soon early in vienna 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:12.200
 and we also have to look alone 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.030
 4 understanding 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.780
 but margin 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.780
 I hope we are very season 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.780
 already 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.910
 practically all the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.710
 arriving 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.280
 just at dawn he started doing a lot 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.659
 wind in the mountain was covered with clouds 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.549
 wait 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.060
 on the other side of the edge is a little 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.060
 of shelter 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.750
 little time but waiting for 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.409
 What's up 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.700
 one 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.700
 well to this 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.629
 and here not 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.220
 plus 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.510
 plus 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:37.050
 grant 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.050
 from here to be able to leave the ship like this 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.920
 for good 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.520
 finally because about one and a half 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.520
 the afternoon we decided 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.000
 still good the forecast 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.610
 of the forecast 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.610
 and so happened half rises 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.690
 wind 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.190
 the most beautiful moment without place 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.190
 the arrival at the major edge is first 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.200
 yes 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.760
 and over there is the last 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.129
 and a year that was not 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.990
 I just reached the summit are the 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.960
 four in the afternoon it cost a lot 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.260
 very much is a matter of much 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.260
 perseverance 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.100
 and this time it is also expressed 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.510
 very difficult 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.510
 against zero 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.040
 situation and finally power and every two 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.040
 weeks 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.240
 two
