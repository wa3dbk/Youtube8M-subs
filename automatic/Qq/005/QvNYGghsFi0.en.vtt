00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.840 
playing with it I actually got a couple
of<00:00:33.840> kills<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.410> then<00:00:34.620> eventually<00:00:35.010> when<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.489> just

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
of kills and then eventually when I just

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.940 
of kills and then eventually when I just
unlock<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.210> for<00:00:36.360> myself<00:00:36.649> play<00:00:37.649> with<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.829> a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
unlock it for myself play with it a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.060

couple of times I really liked it and I

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.600 
couple of times I really liked it and I
think<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> best<00:00:42.480> sniper<00:00:42.780> still<00:00:43.140> for

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
think this is the best sniper still for

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.139 
think this is the best sniper still for
except<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> m40a3<00:00:45.450> from<00:00:46.050> quality<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.149> so

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
except the m40a3 from quality for and so

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.520 
except the m40a3 from quality for and so
that<00:00:48.300> one<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.539> place<00:00:48.809> number<00:00:49.079> one<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.469> me

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
that one is a place number one for me

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.720 
that one is a place number one for me
and<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.219> MSR<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.760> right<00:00:51.090> underneath<00:00:51.539> that

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
and the MSR is right underneath that

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.130 
and the MSR is right underneath that
that's<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:53.879> because<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.300> nice<00:00:54.660> director

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
that's just because of the nice director

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.420 
that's just because of the nice director

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.770 
sure they go right into the windows and
actually<00:05:21.400> kill<00:05:21.580> people<00:05:21.850> who<00:05:21.940> are<00:05:22.030> inside<00:05:22.360> so

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
actually kill people who are inside so

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.780 
actually kill people who are inside so
and<00:05:23.050> you<00:05:23.650> can<00:05:23.800> shoot<00:05:23.950> them<00:05:24.130> way<00:05:24.310> quicker<00:05:24.580> after

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
and you can shoot them way quicker after

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.719 
and you can shoot them way quicker after
each<00:05:25.030> other<00:05:25.210> than<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:26.050> ac-130<00:05:26.620> so<00:05:27.370> that's

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
each other than the ac-130 so that's

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:31.140 
each other than the ac-130 so that's
just<00:05:27.940> my<00:05:28.270> opinion<00:05:28.300> about<00:05:28.810> this<00:05:29.110> I<00:05:30.030> hope<00:05:31.030> you
