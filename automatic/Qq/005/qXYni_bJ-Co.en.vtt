00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 today we are going to make a bad line of 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.770
 chocolate and a damon cake for it 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.690
 we're going to need a glass and with that glass 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.750
 let's have the measurements 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.580
 we are going to need 4 eggs a glass of 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.099
 milk a glass of virgin olive oil 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.070
 extra of gentle salt once cinch by 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.640
 example all sugar or three glasses of 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.160
 flour a yeast envelope royal type 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.689
 lemon zest and field, nothing 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.340
 first thing we do is we beat the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.619
 eggs what else is fought now what 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.620
 We can do by hand as we want 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.370
 we add the glass of oil we add 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.370
 the sugar 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.740
 and we add the yeast 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.260
 we add the flour from posterÃ­a 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.000
 sifted 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.430
 we are linking 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.970
 we can do it with milk rod with 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.120
 blender with the hand does not matter 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.370
 result is going to be the same we add it 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.670
 the lemon zest and we tie it all 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.750
 well and now with that mass I what I did 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.590
 was fill in a small edge that I have 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:19.460
 in a circular way of this that has the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:22.490
 hollow in the center in crown plan and 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.190
 I'm dominating there , fill in the mold 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.340
 that I put a little oil so that 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.409
 I would stick the cake and with the dough 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.710
 that I had left over I added the cocoa 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.490
 powder 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.490
 and it goes well 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.250
 to use the rod blender so that 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.110
 there will be the chocolate of the liver and 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.110
 fill the cupcake capsules 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.680
 and my muffin capsules and my mold 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.750
 of cake I put everything in the tray 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.670
 of the solar oven that is the one who does not have or 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.909
 not only can you do it perfectly in 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.130
 the normal oven and I took it off 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.820
 out for the not only her what 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.930
 I had oriented to the sun catching heat 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.500
 preheating the oven as we usually 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.350
 tell 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.630
 and there he is already covered with his cover 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.500
 glass closed the cupcakes in a 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.500
 side and the cake 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.379
 it's been cooking temperature and it's going 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.269
 raising the muffins the crystal will 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.829
 tarnishes and cleaning it from time to time 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.230
 in the cupcake when I was born that 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:25.209
 they were ready take out the cupcakes 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.799
 they are made before the sponge cake and 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.840
 sponge cake I left it inside as you are 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.799
 watching followed inside his cooking followed 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.799
 inside climbing 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.590
 and when the cake was ready then 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.170
 we take it out 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.629
 and then when the molds cooled 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.010
 there they have a cut of the cake for 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.920
 you can see how it is inside you 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.950
 sprinkle a little sugar on top 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.110
 there you have the cake is cut 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.420
 they make the dough superbly 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.990
 super fluffy 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.110
 and a recipe very similar to the recipe of 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.930
 yogurt cake that is made with a 23 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.819
 but in this case we use milk and we use 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.160
 a glass the same glass that we use 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.430
 for some measurements we use for all 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.470
 others have had a picture of the cake and there 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.000
 you have a picture of the muffins from 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.360
 chocolate that can also be made 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.280
 white without adding chocolate and 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.690
 nothing the wonderful result as 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.690
 always in a solar oven
