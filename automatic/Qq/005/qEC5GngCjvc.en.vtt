00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
game will start to generate the small

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:01.279 
game will start to generate the small
world<00:00:54.860> because<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:58.160> how<00:00:59.160> much<00:00:59.609> there<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.420> more

in<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.530> game<00:01:01.649> as<00:01:02.100> compared<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.699> Minecraft<00:01:03.329> it

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
in this game as compared to Minecraft it

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.429 
in this game as compared to Minecraft it
takes<00:01:04.500> quite<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.100> bit<00:01:05.220> longer<00:01:05.869> to<00:01:06.869> generate<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
takes quite a bit longer to generate the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.740 
takes quite a bit longer to generate the
world<00:01:07.619> than<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.979> does<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.280> Minecraft<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.570> only

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
world than it does in Minecraft the only

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.950 
world than it does in Minecraft the only
reason<00:01:10.080> why<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.229> took<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.680> short<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.280> video

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
reason why I took so short in this video

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.499 
reason why I took so short in this video
or<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.560> world<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.280> because<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.360> was<00:01:15.479> a
