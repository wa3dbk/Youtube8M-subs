00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.040
 ok hi to all you are with planet 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.000
 gt and feline today we try the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.740
 peugeot 908 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.599
 we will try to give you one 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.650
 maximum information in boss time 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.849
 because we are a bit late 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.190
 the peugeot 208 is replacing the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.140
 107 and all with modernity and 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.970
 a much more pronounced feline character 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.410
 but is that enough to make it 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.269
 a good city is the question 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.160
 that we will try to answer 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.170
 and this through several points of 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.970
 first points aesthetically brakes 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.529
 tell me what you think it 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.840
 so I'm pretty fan of design 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.480
 outside anyway without really that 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.620
 it is true that joe outside 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.649
 the back is cute enough to be visited 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.649
 yesterday 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.440
 good car overall 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.820
 aesthetically and I have the same opinion 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.040
 that aesthetically drags it's true that 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.990
 the day when the shot managed to score 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.160
 very strongly his identity in the 108 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.960
 whereas it is recalled that it is a basis 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.150
 common with Toyota and Citroen 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.370
 find the Peugeot claws on the 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.690
 headlights we have the ceret lights in the front 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.920
 and frankly it's very successful 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.810
 it's a car that will please 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.010
 certainly on the aesthetic corner more 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.350
 to women and it's moreover 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.480
 she that the Peugeot aims first is 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.680
 clearly aesthetically the car has 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.690
 a very good idea 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.620
 Okay 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.110
 b 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.820
 in terms of livability there without him 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.710
 managed a pretty interesting thing it's 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.150
 true that it is very compact and 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.130
 the front we are really good 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.690
 installed we may be able to put 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.460
 in question the seats that for 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.630
 some people can is by 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.060
 maybe a bit too hard but 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.310
 overall comfort and shame ran 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.660
 will you say that compared to the 107 we 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.040
 is a true evolution lets 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.920
 a much better hold of the seats 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.640
 everything is really well evolve in the 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.320
 good sense of the term 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.150
 all the little flaws we could 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.550
 blame the 107 we were completely 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.230
 erased on the stage fast so overall 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.000
 this is a good thing 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.410
 the cabin of the 108 is not crazy but 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.970
 it has the merit of offering more than the 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.830
 minimum in a small space 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.840
 the dashboard of notes can be 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.280
 a little too much of the outside standing but 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.260
 note the arrival of a screen 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.330
 touch and automatic air conditioning not too much 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.650
 poorly integrated rear seats are 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.160
 rather limited for large 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.230
 people 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.180
 but in a general way the 108 manages 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.440
 very well his little space in you 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.630
 even offering a back seat 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.210
 split to increase the space of 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.640
 needs chest and actually the 108 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.140
 improves compared to the 107 setra 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.490
 we who say it we always have 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.770
 hard plastics in the fast smell but 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.700
 we feel that there is a job to do 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.709
 on it 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.480
 the finishes are much better levis 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.460
 we had apparent defects on the 107 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.490
 we do not have today anymore so he 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.950
 a nice effort of fact what is 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.900
 interesting with this version 708 it's 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.550
 we have two versions a version with 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.770
 a hard roof and we also have the 108 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.150
 top that we have here and that allows you if 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.580
 you want to know how to make noise by 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.170
 against having the right opens it's a 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.760
 very interesting option is pleasant and 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.010
 which allows you to have a very big 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.330
 eight light in the cockpit and 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.280
 frankly it's a very point 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.630
 interesting so actually the 108 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.400
 top is something that will 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.780
 to please the basic idea is that since 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.760
 you have a tendency to a lot 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.100
 used our smartphones today at 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.830
 instead of putting a gps directly into 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.540
 the tactical screen of the car 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.370
 the brands have made the choice of you 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.810
 allow to replicate the screen of your 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.880
 smartphone on the touch screen 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.230
 the problem we could see in 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.110
 the use is that we have a time of 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.840
 important latency in addition to that the 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.850
 system uses the gps of your 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.650
 phone the 3g of your phone and 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.600
 so as soon as you are in an area 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.260
 skin but you are no longer connected and 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.820
 right away you lose all 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.620
 the information you were getting 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.450
 to use ideally it would have been necessary 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.370
 that the GPS is directly integrated into 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.690
 the touch screen of the 108 which has the 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.610
 deserves to be very responsive 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.560
 the opposite of mirror technology 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.350
 screen is hoped that updates 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.090
 will improve everything and yes we have 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.520
 certainly a reversing camera but on a 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.740
 if little car the gps is much more 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.630
 important 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.460
 in terms of road behavior I must 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.620
 to say that the car suit jacket 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.690
 dell is made for ie rolling 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.180
 in town and she does it very well 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.920
 it's true that actually it stays 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.870
 a city dweller as soon as one starts to 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.090
 solicit a little more 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.280
 aggressive and we will go to try 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.700
 to have fun on small roads 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.950
 campaign 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.900
 for example we have a car that is 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.460
 a lot more floating and we feel that 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.900
 to have the car was not thought 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.700
 for that but in general no 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.230
 car that is doing very well and I 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.239
 tell me that this little one that our 108 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.760
 is a very nice surprise we have a 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.720
 appreciable comfort on all 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.710
 roads elsewhere that's what is very 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.910
 appreciable is that it is not 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.870
 only a car with which you 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.090
 can drive in town 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.100
 if you can also ride in the countryside 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.280
 or lessors and the car will do its 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.280
 job 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.880
 we come to the end of the test of the 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.740
 108 and overall it's a car that 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.530
 is interesting 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.150
 fran if you advise me to give a 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.740
 advice an opinion on the car that this 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.759
 that you would tend to say to 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.039
 people who are trying to get you 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.440
 burst then a council really me this 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:53.530
 what would I do if I were to defend one 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.160
 of both vti 82 simply because 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.920
 than 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.660
 the 68 I find a little fair if we get 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.340
 really sticks to the city or to the 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.290
 near periphery for example as 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.940
 around Paris it's okay but if you 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.740
 really want to have a car a 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.340
 docu versatile and we hear 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.550
 go out 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.980
 2 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.600
 of agglomeration well I advise 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.130
 really to take the 82 which has a lot 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.990
 more fishing that respond a lot 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.880
 better 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.250
 I have a lot more local and got 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.770
 violence to if it really is a car 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.570
 that you want to use in a way 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.760
 versatile and not just in the 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.030
 city go to the motor 82 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.600
 horses 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.680
 after globally the successful 108 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.970
 its goals in the sense that it comes to 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.130
 follow the upscaling of peugeot on 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.320
 cleans turkey concretely am 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.640
 the same peugeot identity be it 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.440
 especially outside actually 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.730
 since we see in his design we have 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.100
 an interior that offers 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.240
 technologies that are what they are 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.350
 that is to say that for example as I 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.940
 you said mirroring it's not 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.350
 necessarily that next to 100 da air conditioning 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.890
 automatic 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.570
 we have denoted helpers as we have a 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.190
 reversing camera on to the back camera 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.350
 she in the image of thomas of the same if 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.480
 personally we would have preferred a GPS 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.710
 to the backup camera but overall 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.960
 it's a car that's interesting 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.390
 which offers novelties that are 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.520
 attractive and that serves could be 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.950
 much more evolved but frankly 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.020
 weary 8 as a whole remains a 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:18.380
 convincing car that has a very 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:21.020
 good a very good comfort in driving and 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.810
 who in addition to that will do with his roof 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.460
 opening in version 108 ap a very good 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.900
 car to have fun 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.900
 when the weather and the party 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.300
 this test we liked open to them in 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.180
 believe of you can follow me on 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.100
 facebook twitter and full in style 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.990
 social networks I make you plenty of 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.990
 little kisses and I say goodbye 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:47.300
 Jan 10 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.310
 knee father design 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.990
