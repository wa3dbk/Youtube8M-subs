right<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.240> what<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.750> trick<00:00:15.900> basically<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.410> is

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
right so what the trick basically is is

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.800 
right so what the trick basically is is
you<00:00:17.039> pop<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.670> flick<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.000> then<00:00:18.539> you're<00:00:18.720> like

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
you pop it you flick it then you're like

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.390 
you pop it you flick it then you're like
oh<00:00:18.990> that's<00:00:19.260> not<00:00:19.439> good<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.830> click<00:00:19.980> back<00:00:20.100> I

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.769 

so<00:00:26.400> basically<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.970> trick<00:00:27.150> probably<00:00:27.420> waste

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
so basically this trick probably waste

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.660 
so basically this trick probably waste
your<00:00:27.960> time<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.980> know<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.099> learned<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.519> you

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
your time you you know I learned it you

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.189 
your time you you know I learned it you
know<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> did<00:00:30.000> kickflip<00:00:30.359> figured<00:00:30.689> back<00:00:30.990> foots

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
know I did kickflip figured back foots

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.780 
know I did kickflip figured back foots
there<00:00:31.380> might<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> little<00:00:31.859> do<00:00:32.340> something<00:00:32.640> with

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
there might a little do something with

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.389 
there might a little do something with
it<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:36.469> know<00:00:37.469> like<00:00:37.590> when<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.800> pop<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> kickflip

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
it you know like when you pop a kickflip

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.819 
it you know like when you pop a kickflip
even<00:00:38.610> pop<00:00:38.760> high<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.480> do<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.440> try<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.649> pop

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
even pop high you do that you try to pop

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.680 
even pop high you do that you try to pop
it<00:00:40.950> high<00:00:41.070> but<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.430> flick<00:00:41.700> like<00:00:42.120> softly<00:00:42.629> you

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
it high but you flick like softly you

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.479 
it high but you flick like softly you
don't<00:00:42.840> put<00:00:42.960> all<00:00:43.079> your<00:00:43.140> energy<00:00:43.649> into<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.460> you

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
don't put all your energy into it so you

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.950 
don't put all your energy into it so you
put<00:00:44.670> all<00:00:44.760> your<00:00:44.789> energy<00:00:44.969> into<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.600> then<00:00:45.809> it's

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
put all your energy into it then it's

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.779 
put all your energy into it then it's
just<00:00:46.140> going<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.350> go<00:00:46.410> fast<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.039> might<00:00:47.640> hit

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
just going to go fast and you might hit

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.970 
just going to go fast and you might hit
your<00:00:47.910> truck<00:00:48.149> or<00:00:48.719> something<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.260> then<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.770> will

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
your truck or something and then it will

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.650 
your truck or something and then it will
do<00:00:50.129> some<00:00:50.280> stupid<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.390> don't<00:00:51.539> want

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
do some stupid that you don't want

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.950 
do some stupid that you don't want
it<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.840> do<00:00:53.000> one<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.180> flick<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.449> softly<00:00:54.780> so

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
it to do one of the flick of softly so

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.810 
it to do one of the flick of softly so
it<00:00:55.020> flips<00:00:55.260> slow<00:00:55.530> because<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.460> more<00:00:56.640> time

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
it flips slow because you have more time

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.430 
it flips slow because you have more time
for<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.329> be<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.510> halfway<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.079> kick<00:00:58.320> it

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
for it to be like halfway if you kick it

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.680 
for it to be like halfway if you kick it
with<00:00:58.530> your<00:00:58.620> back<00:00:58.710> foot<00:00:58.920> so<00:01:02.390> put<00:01:03.390> your<00:01:03.480> foot

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
with your back foot so put your foot

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
like more more in than normal because if

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.280 
like more more in than normal because if
you<00:01:06.270> put<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.450> out<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.869> just<00:01:06.900> gonna<00:01:07.080> flick

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.580 
board on the way back after you flick it
slope<00:02:12.890> is<00:02:13.850> right<00:02:14.060> here<00:02:14.300> because<00:02:15.260> as<00:02:15.380> you<00:02:15.500> can

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
slope is right here because as you can

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.670 
slope is right here because as you can
see<00:02:15.830> it'll<00:02:16.730> flip<00:02:16.910> right<00:02:17.060> back<00:02:17.239> over<00:02:17.590> what<00:02:18.590> if

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
see it'll flip right back over what if

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.670 
see it'll flip right back over what if
you<00:02:18.739> hit<00:02:18.860> it<00:02:18.980> here<00:02:19.420> see<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.510> turned<00:02:20.750> so<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:21.380> like

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
you hit it here see it turned so it like

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.400 
you hit it here see it turned so it like
when<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:21.920> hit<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.130> like<00:02:22.160> that<00:02:22.459> it'll<00:02:22.790> turn<00:02:22.940> and

when you hit it like that it'll turn and

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.660 
when you hit it like that it'll turn and
sometimes<00:02:24.410> you'll<00:02:24.620> be<00:02:24.739> asking<00:02:25.250> for<00:02:25.550> some

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
sometimes you'll be asking for some

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:34.630 
sometimes you'll be asking for some
primo<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:27.140> you'll<00:02:27.260> land<00:02:27.350> like<00:02:27.590> this<00:02:33.640> you

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
primo and you'll land like this you

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.370 
primo and you'll land like this you
flick<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:34.940> half<00:02:35.660> as<00:02:35.840> hard<00:02:36.050> as<00:02:36.140> you'd<00:02:36.260> normally

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
flick it half as hard as you'd normally

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.020 
flick it half as hard as you'd normally
flick<00:02:36.769> it<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.100> looks<00:02:37.310> slow<00:02:37.519> and<00:02:37.820> then<00:02:37.910> you

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
flick it so it looks slow and then you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.080 
flick it so it looks slow and then you
kick<00:02:38.300> it<00:02:38.480> like<00:02:39.130> basically<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.489> same<00:02:40.700> amount

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
kick it like basically the same amount

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.580 
kick it like basically the same amount
of<00:02:41.239> momentum<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:41.900> have<00:02:42.110> on<00:02:42.230> your<00:02:42.350> flick

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
of momentum that you have on your flick

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.190 
of momentum that you have on your flick
so<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.040> goes<00:02:43.190> like<00:02:43.430> half<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.090> half<00:02:44.120> makes<00:02:45.080> a

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
so it goes like half and half makes a

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:53.560 
so it goes like half and half makes a
100%<00:02:46.299> land<00:02:51.580> alright<00:02:52.580> so<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:52.850> trick<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.180> you

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570
