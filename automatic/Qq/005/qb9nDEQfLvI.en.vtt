you end up having to play them a lot
heavier<00:00:29.220> than<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.460> really<00:00:29.699> want<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.119> because

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
heavier than you really want to because

they try and get onto the wooden stage
and<00:00:31.920> playing<00:00:32.489> them<00:00:32.669> from<00:00:33.380> never<00:00:34.380> useful

hopefuls or anything else so the rods
probably<00:00:39.300> one<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> most<00:00:39.600> versatile<00:00:40.020> rods

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
probably one of the most versatile rods

probably one of the most versatile rods
in<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.469> range<00:00:40.649> soft<00:00:41.370> enough<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.640> form<00:00:42.059> of

the fish powerfully enough to cast the

the fish powerfully enough to cast the
reason<00:00:45.329> why<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.450> liked<00:00:45.629> me<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.870> start<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.230> I

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
reason why I liked me to start is I

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.470 
reason why I liked me to start is I
couldn't<00:00:46.559> break<00:00:46.680> them<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.760> was<00:00:47.879> simple<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.360> was

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
couldn't break them it was simple I was

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.240 
couldn't break them it was simple I was
one<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> first<00:00:49.350> companies<00:00:49.649> I've<00:00:50.100> actually

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
one of the first companies I've actually

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.340 
one of the first companies I've actually
picked<00:00:50.550> up<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.940> played<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.270> rods<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:52.079> not

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
picked up and played the rods and not

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.510 
picked up and played the rods and not
broken<00:00:52.590> any<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:52.980> rods<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.309> still

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
broken any of the rods and I still

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.880 
broken any of the rods and I still
haven't<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.910> date<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.469> trust<00:00:55.469> me<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.710> have

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
haven't to date and trust me I have

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.319 
haven't to date and trust me I have
tried<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.160> break<00:00:56.430> them<00:00:56.579> that's<00:00:56.760> not<00:00:56.850> only<00:00:57.149> just

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
tried to break them that's not only just

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.450 
tried to break them that's not only just
the<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.199> highest<00:00:58.559> at<00:00:58.739> some<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.160> S<00:00:59.250> range

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the the highest at some of the S range

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.090 
the the highest at some of the S range
and<00:01:00.109> some<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> lower<00:01:01.379> ended<00:01:01.620> as<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.800> put<00:01:01.980> it

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
and some the lower ended as you put it

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.340 
and some the lower ended as you put it
out<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.579> range<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.000> I've<00:01:03.870> gone<00:01:03.989> up<00:01:04.140> my<00:01:04.229> way

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
out of the range and I've gone up my way

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.350 
out of the range and I've gone up my way
to<00:01:04.409> breaking<00:01:04.830> with<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.150> obviously<00:01:06.150> from<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
to breaking with can obviously from the

to breaking with can obviously from the
highest<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.810> hundreds<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:08.040> reason<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.310> got
