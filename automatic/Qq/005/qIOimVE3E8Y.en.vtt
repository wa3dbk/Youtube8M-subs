hello<00:00:02.690> this<00:00:03.199> is<00:00:03.230> Rs<00:00:03.770> CKY<00:00:04.400> the<00:00:05.029> android<00:00:05.450> guy<00:00:05.660> I'm

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
hello this is Rs CKY the android guy I'm

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:08.680 
hello this is Rs CKY the android guy I'm
going<00:00:06.919> to<00:00:07.009> be<00:00:07.100> going<00:00:07.249> over<00:00:07.640> the<00:00:08.029> benchmark

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690 
going to be going over the benchmark

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.310 
going to be going over the benchmark
test<00:00:08.990> for<00:00:09.350> the<00:00:09.560> samsung<00:00:10.100> galaxy<00:00:10.520> tab<00:00:10.730> 2<00:00:11.320> 10.1

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
test for the samsung galaxy tab 2 10.1

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.860 
test for the samsung galaxy tab 2 10.1
and<00:00:13.240> we're<00:00:14.240> going<00:00:14.360> to<00:00:14.390> be<00:00:14.480> going<00:00:14.570> over<00:00:14.690> the

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
and we're going to be going over the

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.159 
and we're going to be going over the
basics<00:00:15.020> which<00:00:15.380> is<00:00:15.560> a<00:00:15.590> quadrant<00:00:16.430> end<00:00:16.550> in<00:00:16.699> 22<00:00:17.169> so

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:18.169 
basics which is a quadrant end in 22 so

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.710 
basics which is a quadrant end in 22 so
first<00:00:18.499> let's<00:00:18.769> go<00:00:18.949> with<00:00:19.130> quadrant<00:00:19.789> see<00:00:20.390> how<00:00:20.570> it

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
first let's go with quadrant see how it

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.339 
first let's go with quadrant see how it
runs<00:00:24.970> and<00:00:25.970> of<00:00:26.329> course<00:00:26.359> it<00:00:26.960> always<00:00:27.079> has<00:00:27.320> to

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
runs and of course it always has to

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.269 
runs and of course it always has to
change<00:00:27.859> so<00:00:28.759> fun<00:00:29.570> to<00:00:29.599> go<00:00:29.839> through<00:00:30.140> now<00:00:30.890> remember

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
change so fun to go through now remember

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.150 
change so fun to go through now remember
this<00:00:31.640> is<00:00:31.880> a<00:00:32.680> dual-core<00:00:35.920> processor<00:00:36.920> not<00:00:37.100> a

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
this is a dual-core processor not a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.069 
this is a dual-core processor not a
quad-core<00:00:37.609> so<00:00:38.210> it's<00:00:38.329> like<00:00:38.449> very<00:00:38.480> important

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
quad-core so it's like very important

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.439 
quad-core so it's like very important
note<00:00:39.289> it<00:00:39.890> should<00:00:40.190> not<00:00:40.370> be<00:00:40.430> anywhere<00:00:40.879> near<00:00:41.090> like

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
note it should not be anywhere near like

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.400 
note it should not be anywhere near like
the<00:00:41.750> asus<00:00:42.590> prime<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:43.960> which<00:00:44.960> is<00:00:45.140> kind<00:00:45.350> of

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
the asus prime and which is kind of

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.799 
the asus prime and which is kind of
disappointing<00:00:45.850> just<00:00:46.850> because<00:00:47.210> we<00:00:47.660> work

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
disappointing just because we work

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.709 
disappointing just because we work
splitting<00:00:48.199> a<00:00:48.260> quad-core<00:00:49.300> but<00:00:50.300> it<00:00:50.449> didn't

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
splitting a quad-core but it didn't

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.470 
splitting a quad-core but it didn't
happen<00:00:50.899> this<00:00:51.800> is<00:00:51.949> a<00:00:51.980> dual-core<00:00:52.519> unfortunate

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
happen this is a dual-core unfortunate

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.090 
happen this is a dual-core unfortunate
it's<00:00:53.570> not<00:00:53.660> even<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:53.960> Exynos<00:00:54.469> dual<00:00:54.679> core<00:00:54.949> which

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
it's not even the Exynos dual core which

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.270 
it's not even the Exynos dual core which
would<00:00:55.250> have<00:00:55.339> been<00:00:55.429> nice<00:00:55.579> it's<00:00:55.879> a<00:00:56.030> TI<00:00:56.269> OMAP<00:00:57.280> dual

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
would have been nice it's a TI OMAP dual

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.880 
would have been nice it's a TI OMAP dual
core<00:00:58.550> which<00:00:58.940> if<00:00:59.420> just<00:01:00.140> to<00:01:00.260> explain<00:01:00.559> what<00:01:00.859> that

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
core which if just to explain what that

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.119 
core which if just to explain what that
means<00:01:01.329> XO<00:01:02.329> knows<00:01:02.510> is<00:01:02.780> Samsung's<00:01:03.230> own<00:01:03.379> personal

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
means XO knows is Samsung's own personal

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.080 
means XO knows is Samsung's own personal
processor<00:01:04.879> and<00:01:05.119> it<00:01:05.960> beats<00:01:06.710> everything<00:01:07.220> it's

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
processor and it beats everything it's

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.399 
processor and it beats everything it's
dual<00:01:08.329> core<00:01:08.630> is<00:01:08.750> faster<00:01:09.079> than<00:01:09.110> every<00:01:09.380> other

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
dual core is faster than every other

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.660 
dual core is faster than every other
dual-core<00:01:10.009> from<00:01:10.970> last<00:01:11.210> year<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:11.979> it's<00:01:12.979> a<00:01:13.340> new

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
dual-core from last year and it's a new

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.700 
dual-core from last year and it's a new
quad-core<00:01:14.030> beats<00:01:14.659> every<00:01:14.990> processor<00:01:15.590> on<00:01:15.680> the

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
quad-core beats every processor on the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.889 
quad-core beats every processor on the
market<00:01:16.220> right<00:01:16.250> now<00:01:16.430> it's<00:01:17.329> what's<00:01:17.570> going<00:01:17.720> to<00:01:17.780> be

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
market right now it's what's going to be

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.090 
market right now it's what's going to be
in<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.020> international<00:01:18.649> version<00:01:18.680> of<00:01:19.009> the

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
in the international version of the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.690 
in the international version of the
galaxy<00:01:19.250> s3<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.390> it's<00:01:20.960> just<00:01:21.170> really<00:01:21.700> something

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
galaxy s3 so it's just really something

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.510 
galaxy s3 so it's just really something
to<00:01:22.939> see<00:01:22.970> in<00:01:23.210> person<00:01:23.450> just<00:01:23.899> because<00:01:24.049> it's<00:01:24.520> it's

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
to see in person just because it's it's

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.580 
to see in person just because it's it's
just<00:01:25.610> that<00:01:25.909> good<00:01:27.250> now<00:01:28.250> in<00:01:29.240> terms<00:01:29.990> of<00:01:30.200> this<00:01:30.380> one

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
just that good now in terms of this one

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.649 
just that good now in terms of this one
though<00:01:30.770> it's<00:01:31.009> a<00:01:31.130> TI<00:01:31.430> OMAP<00:01:31.880> which<00:01:32.149> is<00:01:32.509> what

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
though it's a TI OMAP which is what

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.800 
though it's a TI OMAP which is what
Samsung<00:01:33.079> used<00:01:33.320> for<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.710> couple<00:01:34.189> of<00:01:34.250> their<00:01:34.810> other

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
Samsung used for a couple of their other

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.980 
Samsung used for a couple of their other
devices<00:01:36.320> like<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.860> Samsung<00:01:37.340> Galaxy<00:01:37.369> Nexus

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
devices like the Samsung Galaxy Nexus

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.910 
devices like the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
although<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.200> one<00:01:39.320> was<00:01:39.469> a<00:01:39.500> little<00:01:39.590> bit

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
although that one was a little bit

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.090 
although that one was a little bit
faster<00:01:40.100> in<00:01:40.490> comparison<00:01:41.409> but<00:01:42.409> one<00:01:42.710> important

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
faster in comparison but one important

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.069 
faster in comparison but one important
thing<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.219> note<00:01:43.280> Samsung<00:01:44.270> is<00:01:44.299> not<00:01:44.689> longer

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
thing to note Samsung is not longer

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.440 
thing to note Samsung is not longer
using<00:01:45.560> nvidia<00:01:46.039> i'm<00:01:46.340> wondering<00:01:47.060> if<00:01:47.180> it<00:01:47.329> was

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
using nvidia i'm wondering if it was

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.499 
using nvidia i'm wondering if it was
something<00:01:47.719> that<00:01:48.130> was<00:01:49.130> troubling<00:01:49.909> with<00:01:50.299> them

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
something that was troubling with them

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.279 
something that was troubling with them
but<00:01:51.140> i'm<00:01:51.710> not<00:01:51.890> sure<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:52.899> anyway<00:01:53.899> in<00:01:54.110> the

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
but i'm not sure so anyway in the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.499 
but i'm not sure so anyway in the
meantime<00:01:54.469> our<00:01:54.860> quadrant<00:01:55.579> has<00:01:55.820> finished<00:01:56.119> and

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
meantime our quadrant has finished and

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.740 
meantime our quadrant has finished and
it<00:01:56.899> looks<00:01:56.930> like<00:01:57.289> it<00:01:57.859> is<00:01:58.130> definitely<00:01:59.060> ahead<00:01:59.359> of

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
it looks like it is definitely ahead of

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.649 
it looks like it is definitely ahead of
the<00:01:59.869> original<00:02:00.200> samsung<00:02:01.100> galaxy<00:02:01.490> tab<00:02:01.700> in<00:02:02.539> the

galaxy nexus in comparison again the
processor<00:02:06.799> you<00:02:06.890> can<00:02:06.920> see<00:02:07.219> which<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:07.909> should<00:02:08.180> be

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
processor you can see which it should be

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.970 
processor you can see which it should be

the cpu is not as good as the guy
Nexus<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:13.239> memory<00:02:13.739> does<00:02:14.739> do<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:14.980> little<00:02:15.190> bit

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
Nexus the memory does do a little bit

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.330 
Nexus the memory does do a little bit
better<00:02:15.489> than<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:16.290> but<00:02:17.290> definitely<00:02:17.769> the<00:02:17.830> i/o<00:02:18.010> is

better than it but definitely the i/o is
what's<00:02:18.690> keeping<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.959> ahead<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.260> anything<00:02:20.530> else

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
what's keeping it ahead of anything else

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.119 
what's keeping it ahead of anything else
so<00:02:21.700> uh<00:02:21.970> going<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.840> be<00:02:22.959> good<00:02:23.200> score<00:02:23.500> overall<00:02:23.769> and

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
so uh going to be good score overall and

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.199 
so uh going to be good score overall and
the<00:02:24.280> score<00:02:24.549> is<00:02:25.110> 2599<00:02:26.190> alright<00:02:27.190> guys<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:27.970> let's

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
the score is 2599 alright guys so let's

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:38.130 
the score is 2599 alright guys so let's
look<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.569> other<00:02:28.629> one<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:36.900> want<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.989> see<00:02:38.079> how

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
look the other one I want to see how

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.830 
look the other one I want to see how
this<00:02:38.290> one<00:02:38.610> stacks<00:02:39.610> up<00:02:39.879> which<00:02:40.540> should<00:02:40.720> be

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
this one stacks up which should be

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.970 
this one stacks up which should be
interesting<00:02:41.140> because<00:02:41.200> this<00:02:41.379> one<00:02:41.560> we<00:02:41.650> do<00:02:41.769> have

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
interesting because this one we do have

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.059 
interesting because this one we do have
this<00:02:42.819> one<00:02:43.000> does<00:02:43.150> store<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:44.590> asus<00:02:45.420> Prime<00:02:46.420> in

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
this one does store the asus Prime in

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.140 
this one does store the asus Prime in
comparison<00:02:48.069> to<00:02:48.190> it<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:48.459> we'll<00:02:48.640> be<00:02:48.819> able<00:02:48.849> to<00:02:49.000> see

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
comparison to it so we'll be able to see

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.369 
comparison to it so we'll be able to see
how<00:02:49.299> it<00:02:49.420> stacks<00:02:49.690> up<00:02:49.840> against<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.790> now<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:53.140> as<00:02:53.260> I

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
how it stacks up against it now so as I

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.410 
how it stacks up against it now so as I
was<00:02:53.410> saying<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:54.160> Exynos<00:02:54.579> quad<00:02:54.849> core<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.390> a

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
was saying the Exynos quad core is a

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.770 
was saying the Exynos quad core is a
Miss<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:56.019> here<00:02:57.150> which<00:02:58.150> would<00:02:58.359> be<00:02:58.540> nice<00:02:58.750> but

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
Miss on here which would be nice but

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.559 
Miss on here which would be nice but
that<00:02:59.410> is<00:02:59.620> what's<00:02:59.920> going<00:03:00.069> to<00:03:00.129> be<00:03:00.310> on<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.879> galaxy

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
that is what's going to be on the galaxy

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.240 
that is what's going to be on the galaxy
note<00:03:02.099> 10.1<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:04.829> this<00:03:05.829> one<00:03:06.010> is<00:03:06.129> definitely

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
note 10.1 so this one is definitely

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.770 
note 10.1 so this one is definitely
gonna<00:03:06.549> be<00:03:06.609> more<00:03:06.910> of<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.299> know<00:03:07.420> if<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.629> just

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
gonna be more of you know if you just

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.360 
gonna be more of you know if you just
want<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:07.989> upgrade<00:03:08.170> from<00:03:08.470> your<00:03:08.620> old<00:03:08.739> tablet<00:03:09.010> and

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
want to upgrade from your old tablet and

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.360 
want to upgrade from your old tablet and
great<00:03:09.609> tablet<00:03:09.819> for<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.150> price<00:03:10.390> of<00:03:10.420> 399<00:03:11.370> the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
great tablet for the price of 399 the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.270 
great tablet for the price of 399 the
galaxy<00:03:13.030> note<00:03:13.420> 10.1<00:03:13.870> will<00:03:14.560> have<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.890> Exynos

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
galaxy note 10.1 will have the Exynos

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.520 
galaxy note 10.1 will have the Exynos
quad-core<00:03:15.879> most<00:03:16.810> likely<00:03:17.139> have<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.290> better

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
quad-core most likely have a better

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.839 
quad-core most likely have a better
resolution<00:03:17.739> as<00:03:18.370> well<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:20.200> course<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.590> pen

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
resolution as well and of course the pen

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.699 
resolution as well and of course the pen
so<00:03:21.849> definitely<00:03:22.810> something<00:03:23.169> to<00:03:23.230> keep<00:03:23.319> out<00:03:23.500> for

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
so definitely something to keep out for

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.030 
so definitely something to keep out for
will<00:03:24.669> it<00:03:24.849> be<00:03:25.109> worth<00:03:26.109> the<00:03:26.290> price<00:03:26.440> difference<00:03:26.680> of

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
will it be worth the price difference of

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.440 
will it be worth the price difference of
probably<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.400> hundred<00:03:27.459> dollars<00:03:27.880> well<00:03:28.120> we'll

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
probably a hundred dollars well we'll

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.930 
probably a hundred dollars well we'll
wait<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:28.930> see<00:03:29.019> that<00:03:29.290> i<00:03:29.530> would<00:03:30.099> love<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.730> just

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
wait and see that i would love it just

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.699 
wait and see that i would love it just
for<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.090> quad<00:03:31.359> core<00:03:31.630> processor<00:03:32.290> or<00:03:32.319> something

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
for the quad core processor or something

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.069 
for the quad core processor or something
i'm<00:03:32.799> definitely<00:03:33.220> looking<00:03:33.280> forward<00:03:33.639> to<00:03:33.930> but<00:03:34.930> in

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
i'm definitely looking forward to but in

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.470 
i'm definitely looking forward to but in

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
of go with their own chip instead of

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.430 
of go with their own chip instead of
using<00:03:44.130> invidious<00:03:45.130> anymore<00:03:45.989> but<00:03:46.989> definitely

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
using invidious anymore but definitely

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.940 
using invidious anymore but definitely
something<00:03:47.709> interesting<00:03:48.069> to<00:03:48.160> note

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
how do they compare to other processors

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.680 
how do they compare to other processors
Samsung<00:04:19.930> does<00:04:20.320> make<00:04:20.820> most<00:04:21.820> of<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.120> processors

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
Samsung does make most of the processors

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.960 
Samsung does make most of the processors
out<00:04:22.860> even<00:04:23.860> though<00:04:23.979> we<00:04:24.100> hear<00:04:24.280> about<00:04:24.310> companies

them to make the majority of the quad
core<00:04:39.220> processors<00:04:39.760> out<00:04:39.880> in<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.030> market<00:04:40.419> so<00:04:41.490> I

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
core processors out in the market so I

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.760 
core processors out in the market so I
remember<00:04:43.449> reading<00:04:43.600> an<00:04:43.750> article<00:04:43.810> that<00:04:44.440> I<00:04:44.500> think

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
remember reading an article that I think

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.840 
remember reading an article that I think
out<00:04:45.010> of<00:04:45.070> in<00:04:45.820> q1<00:04:46.740> Samsung<00:04:47.740> produced<00:04:48.190> about<00:04:48.490> I

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
out of in q1 Samsung produced about I

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.000 
out of in q1 Samsung produced about I
think<00:04:49.389> it<00:04:49.479> was<00:04:49.570> sixty<00:04:50.050> to<00:04:50.199> eighty<00:04:50.350> percent<00:04:50.620> of

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
think it was sixty to eighty percent of

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.890 
think it was sixty to eighty percent of
the<00:04:51.340> dual-core<00:04:51.910> processors<00:04:52.570> out<00:04:52.690> of<00:04:52.840> the

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
the dual-core processors out of the

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.140 
the dual-core processors out of the
market<00:04:53.169> which<00:04:54.160> was<00:04:54.310> really<00:04:54.520> impressive<00:04:54.789> but

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
market which was really impressive but

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.670 
market which was really impressive but
you<00:04:55.240> have<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.419> remember<00:04:55.510> they<00:04:55.870> make<00:04:56.110> the

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
you have to remember they make the

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.950 
you have to remember they make the
processor<00:04:57.310> for<00:04:57.669> not<00:04:58.180> only<00:04:58.330> all<00:04:58.539> their<00:04:58.840> own

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
processor for not only all their own

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.260 
processor for not only all their own
devices<00:04:59.199> but<00:05:00.160> they<00:05:00.250> also<00:05:00.400> make<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.699> processor

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
devices but they also make the processor

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.210 
devices but they also make the processor
for<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:02.320> iPad<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:03.250> iPhones<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:04.210> ipods<00:05:04.630> so<00:05:05.220> in

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
for the iPad the iPhones the ipods so in

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.340 
for the iPad the iPhones the ipods so in
terms<00:05:06.430> of<00:05:06.610> processors<00:05:07.330> they<00:05:07.720> really<00:05:08.110> are<00:05:08.229> the

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
terms of processors they really are the

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.529 
terms of processors they really are the
top<00:05:08.530> seller<00:05:08.800> no<00:05:09.280> one<00:05:09.460> really<00:05:09.789> can<00:05:10.120> touch<00:05:10.330> them

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
top seller no one really can touch them

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.350 
top seller no one really can touch them
on<00:05:10.750> a<00:05:10.990> product<00:05:11.830> production<00:05:12.160> which<00:05:13.120> is<00:05:13.240> one

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
on a product production which is one

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.939 
on a product production which is one
reason<00:05:13.389> actually<00:05:13.750> why<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.080> iPhone<00:05:14.289> will<00:05:14.800> not

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
reason actually why the iPhone will not

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:16.469 
reason actually why the iPhone will not
come<00:05:15.099> out<00:05:15.160> till<00:05:15.220> October<00:05:15.820> is<00:05:15.910> because<00:05:16.180> Samsung

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
come out till October is because Samsung

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.629 
come out till October is because Samsung
isn't<00:05:17.110> making<00:05:17.289> an<00:05:17.560> apples<00:05:17.860> processing<00:05:18.460> chip

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
isn't making an apples processing chip

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.370 
isn't making an apples processing chip
till<00:05:18.849> July<00:05:19.349> so<00:05:20.729> kind<00:05:21.729> of<00:05:22.139> interesting<00:05:23.139> their

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
till July so kind of interesting their

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.050 
till July so kind of interesting their
relationship<00:05:23.949> always<00:05:24.160> how<00:05:24.430> it<00:05:24.460> is<00:05:25.470> yeah<00:05:27.060> and

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
relationship always how it is yeah and

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.460 
relationship always how it is yeah and
we're<00:05:28.389> almost<00:05:28.510> done<00:05:28.810> right<00:05:28.990> now<00:05:29.139> and

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
we're almost done right now and

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.540 
we're almost done right now and
ninety-two<00:05:29.919> percent<00:05:32.160> and<00:05:33.160> there<00:05:33.460> we<00:05:33.520> go

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
ninety-two percent and there we go

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.450 
ninety-two percent and there we go
alright<00:05:34.300> guys<00:05:34.539> so<00:05:35.289> this<00:05:35.560> one<00:05:35.770> got<00:05:35.979> a<00:05:36.010> much

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
alright guys so this one got a much

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.589 
alright guys so this one got a much
higher<00:05:37.169> score<00:05:38.169> and<00:05:39.060> not<00:05:40.060> sure<00:05:40.210> if<00:05:40.270> just

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
higher score and not sure if just

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:42.779 
higher score and not sure if just
quadrants<00:05:41.050> falling<00:05:41.349> behind<00:05:41.500> in<00:05:42.130> comparison

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
quadrants falling behind in comparison

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.089 
quadrants falling behind in comparison
to<00:05:42.940> it<00:05:43.090> but<00:05:43.410> just<00:05:44.410> definitely<00:05:44.710> a<00:05:44.800> much<00:05:44.949> higher

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
to it but just definitely a much higher

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.060 
to it but just definitely a much higher
score<00:05:45.520> in<00:05:45.729> comparison<00:05:46.419> now<00:05:47.260> again<00:05:47.470> this<00:05:47.830> is<00:05:48.039> a

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
score in comparison now again this is a

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.189 
score in comparison now again this is a
dual<00:05:48.580> core<00:05:48.820> 1<00:05:49.650> gigahertz<00:05:50.650> processor<00:05:52.050> i'm<00:05:53.050> in

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
dual core 1 gigahertz processor i'm in

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.250 
dual core 1 gigahertz processor i'm in
terms<00:05:53.470> of<00:05:53.680> everything<00:05:54.280> else<00:05:54.520> we<00:05:55.449> see<00:05:55.659> kind<00:05:56.080> of

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
terms of everything else we see kind of

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.870 
terms of everything else we see kind of
average<00:05:56.770> cpu<00:05:57.729> scores<00:05:58.889> graphics<00:05:59.889> is<00:06:00.070> not<00:06:00.490> too

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
average cpu scores graphics is not too

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.670 
average cpu scores graphics is not too
impressive<00:06:01.389> but<00:06:02.169> let's<00:06:02.349> see<00:06:02.470> how<00:06:02.530> they<00:06:02.650> stack

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
impressive but let's see how they stack

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:12.950 
impressive but let's see how they stack
up<00:06:02.979> against<00:06:03.340> everything<00:06:03.550> else

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.520 

and<00:06:13.590> Sigma<00:06:14.160> low<00:06:14.430> that<00:06:14.870> all<00:06:15.870> right<00:06:16.080> and<00:06:16.380> we'll

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
and Sigma low that all right and we'll

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:25.300 
and Sigma low that all right and we'll
see<00:06:16.680> how<00:06:16.889> it<00:06:17.009> compares<00:06:20.210> so<00:06:21.210> this<00:06:21.630> is<00:06:21.840> a<00:06:22.940> 47<00:06:23.940> 53

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
see how it compares so this is a 47 53

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.490 
see how it compares so this is a 47 53
so<00:06:26.310> in<00:06:26.490> terms<00:06:26.729> of<00:06:27.050> benchmarks<00:06:28.050> it's<00:06:28.199> actually

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
so in terms of benchmarks it's actually

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.719 
so in terms of benchmarks it's actually
really<00:06:29.130> not<00:06:29.610> that<00:06:29.880> impressive<00:06:31.310> it<00:06:32.310> actually

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
really not that impressive it actually

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:35.150 
really not that impressive it actually
had<00:06:33.210> it's<00:06:33.569> actually<00:06:33.870> less<00:06:34.380> than<00:06:34.620> the<00:06:34.710> galaxy

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160

definitely<00:07:07.830> using<00:07:08.430> it<00:07:08.550> it<00:07:08.909> hasn't<00:07:09.240> had<00:07:09.840> too

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:10.139 
definitely using it it hasn't had too

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:12.999 
definitely using it it hasn't had too
much<00:07:10.289> of<00:07:10.530> any<00:07:10.740> kind<00:07:10.949> of<00:07:11.069> like<00:07:11.340> um<00:07:12.030> in

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:13.009 
much of any kind of like um in

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:19.070 
much of any kind of like um in
comparison<00:07:14.009> to<00:07:14.159> it<00:07:16.970> but<00:07:17.970> so<00:07:18.449> far<00:07:18.750> from<00:07:18.990> what

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 
comparison to it but so far from what

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.920 
comparison to it but so far from what
I've<00:07:19.199> seen<00:07:19.400> it<00:07:20.400> looks<00:07:20.759> like<00:07:21.090> it<00:07:21.270> moves<00:07:21.509> fast

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930 
I've seen it looks like it moves fast

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.620 
I've seen it looks like it moves fast
once<00:07:22.470> you're<00:07:22.680> kind<00:07:22.830> of<00:07:22.949> using<00:07:23.370> it<00:07:23.550> so<00:07:24.449> for

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:24.630 
once you're kind of using it so for

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.960 
once you're kind of using it so for
day-to-day<00:07:24.750> usage<00:07:25.340> it<00:07:26.340> looks<00:07:26.460> pretty<00:07:26.580> solid

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970 
day-to-day usage it looks pretty solid

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.180 
day-to-day usage it looks pretty solid
but<00:07:27.419> in<00:07:27.509> terms<00:07:27.659> of<00:07:27.810> benchmarks<00:07:28.409> it's<00:07:28.590> not<00:07:28.919> that

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:29.190 
but in terms of benchmarks it's not that

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.100 
but in terms of benchmarks it's not that
impressive<00:07:29.430> which<00:07:30.330> is<00:07:30.479> I<00:07:30.570> meant<00:07:30.810> to<00:07:30.930> be<00:07:31.080> a

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:31.110 
impressive which is I meant to be a

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.779 
impressive which is I meant to be a
benchmark<00:07:31.770> holder<00:07:32.190> I<00:07:32.219> just<00:07:32.520> like<00:07:32.669> to

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:32.789 
benchmark holder I just like to

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:34.879 
benchmark holder I just like to
reiterate<00:07:33.169> obviously<00:07:34.169> it's<00:07:34.320> not<00:07:34.349> supposed<00:07:34.800> to

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:34.889 
reiterate obviously it's not supposed to

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:36.830 
reiterate obviously it's not supposed to
be<00:07:34.949> the<00:07:35.159> top<00:07:35.370> of<00:07:35.550> line<00:07:35.789> it's<00:07:36.449> supposed<00:07:36.599> to<00:07:36.750> be

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 
be the top of line it's supposed to be

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.260 
be the top of line it's supposed to be
good<00:07:37.020> for<00:07:37.169> the<00:07:37.259> money<00:07:37.380> so<00:07:38.190> those<00:07:39.000> were<00:07:39.180> the

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:39.270 
good for the money so those were the

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.580 
good for the money so those were the
benchmark<00:07:39.659> results<00:07:40.080> if<00:07:40.229> you<00:07:40.349> have<00:07:40.440> any
