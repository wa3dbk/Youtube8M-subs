00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
fret of the third string so this a

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.160 
fret of the third string so this a
pull-off

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
pull-off

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.730

another mistake beginners make they lift
that<00:03:02.230> first<00:03:02.560> finger<00:03:02.950> up<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.370> play<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:03.790> hammer

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
that first finger up to play that hammer

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.130 
that first finger up to play that hammer
they<00:03:04.300> do<00:03:04.360> it's<00:03:04.780> like<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:07.630> would<00:03:07.810> be<00:03:07.960> wrong

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
they do it's like so that would be wrong

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.720 
they do it's like so that would be wrong
you<00:03:08.380> want<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.590> do<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.770> correctly<00:03:08.920> by<00:03:09.310> keeping

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880
