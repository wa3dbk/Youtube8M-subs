00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
pretty bad isn't it not to mention aside

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.890 
pretty bad isn't it not to mention aside
from<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.520> fact<00:04:51.640> of<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:51.940> music<00:04:52.210> here<00:04:52.450> it<00:04:52.630> seems

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
from the fact of the music here it seems

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.530 
from the fact of the music here it seems
very<00:04:53.140> uninspired<00:04:54.040> and<00:04:54.340> does<00:04:54.610> not<00:04:54.730> really<00:04:55.210> seem

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
very uninspired and does not really seem

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.540 
very uninspired and does not really seem
to<00:04:55.570> be<00:04:55.720> attracting<00:04:56.260> all<00:04:56.440> that<00:04:56.680> much<00:04:56.950> as<00:04:57.190> the

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
to be attracting all that much as the

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.760 
to be attracting all that much as the
sales<00:04:57.880> have<00:04:58.360> not<00:04:58.570> been<00:04:58.750> anything<00:04:59.320> like<00:04:59.620> the

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
sales have not been anything like the

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.650 
sales have not been anything like the
sales<00:05:00.010> of<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:00.190> fae<00:05:00.310> monster<00:05:00.670> of<00:05:00.760> the<00:05:00.820> fame<00:05:01.000> and

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
sales of the fae monster of the fame and

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.630 
sales of the fae monster of the fame and
trust<00:05:01.930> me<00:05:02.050> I<00:05:02.110> remember<00:05:02.230> it<00:05:02.650> because<00:05:02.920> I<00:05:03.130> work

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
trust me I remember it because I work

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.320 
trust me I remember it because I work
for<00:05:03.850> both<00:05:03.970> of<00:05:04.090> them<00:05:05.490> this<00:05:06.490> has<00:05:06.640> got<00:05:06.820> to<00:05:06.940> be<00:05:06.970> one

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.810 
for both of them this has got to be one
of<00:05:07.420> the<00:05:07.510> worst<00:05:07.690> album<00:05:08.050> cover<00:05:08.920> concepts<00:05:09.580> of<00:05:09.700> all

I<00:05:38.830> probably<00:05:39.430> utter<00:05:39.550> the<00:05:39.730> words<00:05:39.910> this<00:05:40.270> band<00:05:40.540> is

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
I probably utter the words this band is

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.230 
I probably utter the words this band is
really<00:05:40.870> conveying<00:05:41.560> a<00:05:41.830> lot<00:05:42.310> of<00:05:42.400> emotion<00:05:42.850> from

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
really conveying a lot of emotion from

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.620 
really conveying a lot of emotion from
this<00:05:44.230> era<00:05:44.550> but<00:05:45.550> this<00:05:45.700> is<00:05:45.850> an<00:05:45.970> album<00:05:46.150> where<00:05:46.390> that

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
this era but this is an album where that

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.150 
this era but this is an album where that
doesn't<00:05:46.960> seem<00:05:47.050> to<00:05:47.200> work<00:05:47.290> very<00:05:47.350> well<00:05:47.650> in<00:05:47.950> fact

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
doesn't seem to work very well in fact

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.560 
doesn't seem to work very well in fact
this<00:05:48.340> is<00:05:48.490> an<00:05:48.610> album<00:05:48.880> where<00:05:49.030> it<00:05:49.180> seems<00:05:49.450> to

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
this is an album where it seems to

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.460 
this is an album where it seems to
really<00:05:50.500> defeat<00:05:50.890> the<00:05:51.010> purpose<00:05:52.050> this<00:05:53.050> is<00:05:53.200> not<00:05:53.350> an

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
really defeat the purpose this is not an

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.650
