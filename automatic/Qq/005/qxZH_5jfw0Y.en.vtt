00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.689
 Today I'm going to teach you how to draw the pattern 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.399
 front base so that the video does not 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.650
 be very long what I have done is 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.230
 prepare it with the base pattern for the 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.250
 we did the other day the only thing that draws 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.980
 forward is the initial rectangle with the 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.920
 back width by the length of the 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.050
 carve from behind this rectangle after 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.390
 I have made another line that is the width 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.270
 of chest to draw the figure all 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.130
 I explained that in the previous video 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.380
 the only difference of more the same 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.730
 point that points you from where you 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.680
 they took the measures what I pointed out again 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.990
 because the height of the shoulder side 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.510
 come back here 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.000
 if you look at the shoulder 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.829
 has the same descent but I do not know if 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.199
 you remember that I told you that in the back 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.329
 we put one and a half and here is six times 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.589
 six then I have pointed it out but not what 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.589
 it's drawing so you can see it now 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.140
 then depending on what we cut in 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.120
 we will expand the neckline almost 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.250
 and sure but initially he stayed 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.490
 so I'm going to the box just in case 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.259
 blouse or anything like the armhole 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.710
 the difference with that of the back the 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.720
 the skirts I told you that here there were 4 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.299
 centimeters of difference transposes 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.520
 here and something is done in this case the 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:25.960
 front pattern you look for half 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.560
 are 16 we put 8 we point to 8 e 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.650
 we introduce 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.740
 two centimeters 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.830
 and half an inch depends on the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.260
 size 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:43.550
 we take from the shoulder and join 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.550
 with these two centimeters 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.490
 and then we continue drawing 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.700
 joining 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.070
 here to have the front piece the 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.659
 difference same as the size of the 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.450
 skirts is always shorter than the waist 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.580
 forward by the woman's chest 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.500
 back detail had 40 centimeters 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.200
 and in the front waist I have 43 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.579
 centimeters 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.270
 simply make a rectangle about 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:20.100
 this same loan pointed 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.100
 to 43 centimeters 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.060
 and the stroke a line 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.280
 as I told you this difference between size 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.780
 front and back size is what 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.950
 will give us the size of the chest clip 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.050
 the difference of three centimeters 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.130
 now a measure that agrees tomÃ¡s 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.810
 continue at chest height 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.510
 depending on whether we look for it from the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.239
 neck or from the shoulder we will have to 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.880
 catch it you can totally turn the 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:55.190
 measure of the shoulder half in this 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.190
 case they are 6 centimeters and from there 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.470
 and he told me I have 26 centimeters 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.590
 distance then I would stay here almost 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.500
 it is always measured more is a little 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.780
 more diagonally but it would be here already 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.680
 we know that at these 26 centimeters what 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.680
 I'm going to measure from here 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.459
 from above 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.770
 is where we will point 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.770
 the chest clip 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.600
 this line usually I just put him 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.170
 about 10 centimeters will depend 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.230
 logically of the width of each 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.860
 person and now these 3 centimeters the 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.860
 transfer here 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.920
 I remind you that this is a pattern 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.080
 fascinated has to do with what a 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.210
 industrial pattern 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.540
 so you can do your own 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.769
 clothing 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.769
 to 10 centimeters 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.040
 he pointed 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.860
 unlike the central clamps 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.390
 this new double clamp here but that 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:13.180
 they would go right in the middle you have to catch 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.180
 but we'll see about the fabric 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.709
 and I said that they were 14 centimeters towards 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.540
 up logically now you do not catch 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.600
 from here but from the detail line 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.300
 because once we cross this clamp 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.610
 we are going to stay the high one is 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.590
 click on the distance between here and here 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.280
 it will have to be the same as in the pattern 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.740
 of the back between here and here 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.500
 we had that blue centimeter and a half 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.970
 for each side according to 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.970
 the account that we made the other day 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:50.720
 and we're going to point 12 down 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.720
 and 14 up 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.590
 I went when you tried 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.729
 the dress the blouse what you do 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.860
 20 is too much 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.550
 it sticks to the chest and we like it you can 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.550
 rectify 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.069
 ah 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.619
 now what we have left is the hip 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:27.409
 the length of the hip is left 20 

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:29.950
 centimeters 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:33.090
 we always put it in him 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.090
 and we see it wide 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.660
 and reading cinnamon expensive environment 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:06:03.089
 we go back to drawing the same drawing that 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:03.089
 we did with the back part 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:12.379
 before let's now point to the 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.379
 waist with three centimeters 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:15.379
 dental 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.270
 Y 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:35.220
 and now I'm drawing and masters 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.220
 the hip 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:40.080
 Well, these are the only differences 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.199
 between the base pattern back and pattern 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.330
 front base the ideal is that with these 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:47.629
 two pieces only we can already cut 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.460
 a dress now that summer arrives 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:52.889
 before teaching you how to draw the pattern 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.240
 of a manga in the next video os 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:58.039
 I will show how another 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.039
 kind of brits fascisms
