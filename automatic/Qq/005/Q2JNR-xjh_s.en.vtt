you

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:05.200 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.800 

and<00:00:06.200> there<00:00:06.410> she's

he lent long a Honda back with damon
hill

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.260 

and<00:00:23.050> starts<00:00:23.589> with<00:00:23.769> a<00:00:23.800> really

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.779 

I<00:00:38.359> think<00:00:39.359> one<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.629> his<00:00:39.780> favorite<00:00:40.170> things<00:00:40.199> and

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:40.789 
I think one of his favorite things and

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.849 
I think one of his favorite things and
really<00:00:41.870> really<00:00:42.870> really<00:00:43.109> good<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.680> this

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:43.859 
really really really good is this

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.830 
really really really good is this
extension

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.290 

with<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.470> lot<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.790> elasticity<00:00:51.530> over<00:00:52.530> tracking

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
with a lot of elasticity over tracking

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:01.720 
with a lot of elasticity over tracking
lengthening<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.510> frame<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:57.350> pill<00:00:58.350> tendency

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.180 

also<00:01:02.510> it<00:01:02.660> is<00:01:03.079> left

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.310 

half<00:01:07.850> pass<00:01:08.240> here<00:01:09.040> keeping<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:10.220> energy

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
half pass here keeping the energy

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:20.190 
half pass here keeping the energy
crossing<00:01:12.320> over<00:01:12.440> a<00:01:12.740> lot<00:01:13.750> nice<00:01:14.750> bend

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.260 

yeah<00:01:21.200> he's<00:01:21.500> looking<00:01:21.829> to<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.130> judge<00:01:22.340> says<00:01:22.909> okay

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
yeah he's looking to the judge says okay

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:31.740 
yeah he's looking to the judge says okay
you<00:01:23.750> see<00:01:23.990> me

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.740 

because<00:01:32.500> here<00:01:32.680> I<00:01:32.770> am<00:01:33.210> there<00:01:34.210> is<00:01:34.330> an<00:01:34.480> extension

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
because here I am there is an extension

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.010 
because here I am there is an extension
again<00:01:35.280> really<00:01:36.280> nice<00:01:36.730> I<00:01:39.570> think<00:01:40.570> as<00:01:40.690> a<00:01:40.720> judge

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
again really nice I think as a judge

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.620 
again really nice I think as a judge
this<00:01:41.440> is<00:01:41.640> what<00:01:42.640> you<00:01:42.760> want<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.150> see<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:45.100> means

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
this is what you want to see this means

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.690 
this is what you want to see this means
extended<00:01:46.630> throttle<00:01:49.979> really<00:01:50.979> superb<00:01:51.340> Asajj

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
extended throttle really superb Asajj

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:00.300 
extended throttle really superb Asajj
super<00:01:52.690> into<00:01:53.050> the<00:01:53.170> PF

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.120 

keep<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.270> uphill<00:02:01.659> tendency<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.439> also<00:02:02.799> good

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
keep the uphill tendency and also good

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.430 
keep the uphill tendency and also good
transition<00:02:03.640> into<00:02:03.820> passaging<00:02:04.299> n<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:08.229> best

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
transition into passaging n the best

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.300 
transition into passaging n the best
till<00:02:08.679> now<00:02:08.830> we'll<00:02:09.130> see<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:10.390> looks<00:02:11.099> has<00:02:12.099> it

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
till now we'll see it looks has it

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.610 
till now we'll see it looks has it
customers<00:02:14.580> no<00:02:15.580> energy<00:02:16.319> receiving<00:02:17.319> that

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
customers no energy receiving that

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.910 
customers no energy receiving that
because<00:02:18.160> he<00:02:18.310> can<00:02:19.090> do<00:02:19.269> it<00:02:19.450> really<00:02:20.440> easy

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.280 

as<00:02:26.700> we<00:02:26.849> look<00:02:27.000> at<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.300> quality<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.080> gates

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
as we look at the quality of the gates

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.050 
as we look at the quality of the gates
this<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:29.750> also<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.930> walk<00:02:31.670> really<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.880> good

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
this is also in the walk really a good

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:48.360 
this is also in the walk really a good
quality<00:02:36.980> which<00:02:37.980> get<00:02:38.190> high<00:02:39.000> marks<00:02:39.300> for<00:02:39.660> this

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.650 

connected<00:02:49.370> walk<00:02:49.580> to<00:02:50.060> be<00:02:50.210> a<00:02:50.240> little<00:02:50.390> bit<00:02:50.480> more

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
connected walk to be a little bit more

00:02:50.660 --> 00:03:03.020 
connected walk to be a little bit more
forward

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.860

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.730 

in<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.920> poll<00:03:11.159> on

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
in the poll on

more higher in the pool but and on the

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.790 
more higher in the pool but and on the
spot<00:03:15.760> was<00:03:16.210> a<00:03:16.270> bit<00:03:16.570> more<00:03:17.020> forward<00:03:17.380> than<00:03:17.530> the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
spot was a bit more forward than the

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.250 
spot was a bit more forward than the
first<00:03:18.040> one

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.660 

good<00:03:22.069> transition<00:03:22.310> into<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.970> canter<00:03:24.670> this

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
good transition into the canter this

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.550 
good transition into the canter this
goes<00:03:25.970> really<00:03:26.329> smooth<00:03:26.989> and<00:03:27.439> fluent<00:03:28.280> with<00:03:29.170> a<00:03:30.170> lot

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
goes really smooth and fluent with a lot

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:41.890 
goes really smooth and fluent with a lot
of<00:03:30.590> energy<00:03:31.150> also<00:03:32.150> here<00:03:32.360> in<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.540> canter

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:04:05.790 

nice<00:03:42.560> for<00:03:43.040> words<00:03:43.310> written<00:03:44.799> changes

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.260 

when<00:04:06.400> this<00:04:06.840> extended<00:04:07.840> cancer<00:04:08.910> we<00:04:09.910> want<00:04:10.150> to

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
when this extended cancer we want to

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.530 
when this extended cancer we want to
have<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.480> little<00:04:10.750> bit<00:04:10.870> more<00:04:11.050> energy<00:04:15.239> and<00:04:16.239> so

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
have a little bit more energy and so

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.900 
have a little bit more energy and so
easy<00:04:17.049> since<00:04:17.650> we<00:04:17.890> are<00:04:18.010> really<00:04:18.220> easy<00:04:18.489> for<00:04:18.700> the

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
easy since we are really easy for the

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.020 
easy since we are really easy for the
horse<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.180> do<00:04:19.390> everything<00:04:19.840> but<00:04:20.610> what<00:04:21.610> a<00:04:21.640> lot<00:04:21.730> of

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.400 

oh<00:04:43.920> there's<00:04:44.940> mistakes<00:04:45.940> in<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.780> one<00:04:47.139> time

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
oh there's mistakes in the one time

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.980 
oh there's mistakes in the one time
peace<00:04:49.230> it's<00:04:50.230> a<00:04:50.410> pity<00:04:51.300> the<00:04:52.300> audience<00:04:52.720> is
