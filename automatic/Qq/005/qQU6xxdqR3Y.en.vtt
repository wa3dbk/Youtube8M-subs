00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
hello today I am going to show you about

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:22.440 
hello today I am going to show you about
my<00:00:11.480> Ironman<00:00:12.430> motorized<00:00:13.430> faceplates

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.089 

I'm<00:00:23.450> also<00:00:23.630> going<00:00:23.899> to<00:00:24.020> show<00:00:24.200> you<00:00:24.259> about<00:00:24.739> my

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
I'm also going to show you about my

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.310 
I'm also going to show you about my
light-up<00:00:25.520> eye<00:00:25.820> lenses<00:00:26.509> which<00:00:26.779> you<00:00:26.960> can<00:00:27.110> also

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
light-up eye lenses which you can also

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.530 
light-up eye lenses which you can also
see<00:00:27.619> through<00:00:27.800> but<00:00:28.610> first<00:00:28.880> of<00:00:29.029> all<00:00:29.119> here<00:00:29.390> is<00:00:29.509> a

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:29.540 
see through but first of all here is a

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.150 
see through but first of all here is a
piece<00:00:29.779> of<00:00:29.809> film<00:00:30.140> about<00:00:30.349> a<00:00:30.500> dining<00:00:31.099> room<00:00:31.130> table

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
piece of film about a dining room table

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.350 
piece of film about a dining room table
okay<00:00:34.160> here<00:00:34.430> so<00:00:34.610> here's<00:00:34.850> an<00:00:35.059> interesting

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
okay here so here's an interesting

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.919 
okay here so here's an interesting
dining<00:00:36.020> room<00:00:36.140> table<00:00:36.590> with<00:00:36.739> a<00:00:36.770> pull-out<00:00:37.130> leaf

00:00:37.919 --> 00:00:37.929 
dining room table with a pull-out leaf

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:42.369 
dining room table with a pull-out leaf
so<00:00:38.929> what<00:00:39.109> happens<00:00:39.410> is<00:00:40.600> these<00:00:41.600> pieces<00:00:41.899> pull<00:00:42.230> to

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
so what happens is these pieces pull to

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.450 
so what happens is these pieces pull to
one<00:00:42.500> size<00:00:42.769> and<00:00:43.749> there's<00:00:44.749> the<00:00:44.899> pull-out<00:00:45.109> leaf

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
one size and there's the pull-out leaf

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.840 
one size and there's the pull-out leaf
it's<00:00:46.460> got<00:00:46.579> a<00:00:46.609> very<00:00:46.850> interesting<00:00:46.910> mechanism

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
it's got a very interesting mechanism

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.569 
it's got a very interesting mechanism
which<00:00:49.850> basically<00:00:50.329> underneath<00:00:51.399> it<00:00:52.399> has<00:00:52.550> a

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
which basically underneath it has a

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.549 
which basically underneath it has a
piece<00:00:52.820> of<00:00:52.969> wood<00:00:53.149> with<00:00:53.210> a<00:00:53.449> hinge<00:00:53.780> on<00:00:54.350> each<00:00:55.339> end

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
piece of wood with a hinge on each end

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.139 
piece of wood with a hinge on each end
which<00:00:57.559> allows<00:00:57.800> it<00:00:58.010> to<00:00:58.039> fold<00:00:58.370> out<00:00:58.579> so<00:00:58.940> it<00:00:58.999> gives

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
which allows it to fold out so it gives

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.209 
which allows it to fold out so it gives
us<00:00:59.269> this<00:00:59.390> motion<00:00:59.929> which<00:01:00.469> is<00:01:00.530> kind<00:01:00.859> of<00:01:00.949> what<00:01:01.129> we

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
us this motion which is kind of what we

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.799 
us this motion which is kind of what we
need<00:01:01.370> for<00:01:01.489> Iron<00:01:01.730> Man's<00:01:01.909> faceplate<00:01:02.480> and

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
need for Iron Man's faceplate and

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.530 
need for Iron Man's faceplate and
because<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:03.890> hinge<00:01:04.100> each<00:01:04.400> end<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:05.000> top<00:01:05.300> piece

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
because the hinge each end the top piece

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.750 
because the hinge each end the top piece
can<00:01:05.870> move<00:01:06.620> at<00:01:06.770> a<00:01:06.830> different<00:01:07.130> angle<00:01:07.340> so

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
can move at a different angle so

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.420 
can move at a different angle so
eventually<00:01:08.150> this<00:01:09.040> holds<00:01:10.040> outs<00:01:10.190> are<00:01:10.340> here<00:01:11.140> and

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
eventually this holds outs are here and

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.460 
eventually this holds outs are here and
then<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.580> leaf<00:01:13.730> folds<00:01:14.180> out<00:01:14.300> we're<00:01:15.230> not<00:01:15.320> really

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
then the leaf folds out we're not really

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.140 
then the leaf folds out we're not really
interested<00:01:15.890> in<00:01:16.010> that<00:01:16.160> or<00:01:16.370> we<00:01:16.610> really<00:01:16.910> want<00:01:17.090> to

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
interested in that or we really want to

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.430 
interested in that or we really want to
know<00:01:17.240> about<00:01:17.420> is<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:18.380> mechanism<00:01:18.650> underneath

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
know about is the mechanism underneath

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.860 
know about is the mechanism underneath
which<00:01:21.440> is<00:01:21.470> basically<00:01:22.100> a<00:01:22.460> piece<00:01:23.270> of<00:01:23.420> wood<00:01:23.570> with

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
which is basically a piece of wood with

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.620 
which is basically a piece of wood with
hinges<00:01:24.560> at<00:01:24.680> each<00:01:24.830> end<00:01:25.120> which<00:01:26.120> gives<00:01:26.360> us<00:01:26.450> that

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
hinges at each end which gives us that

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.240 
hinges at each end which gives us that
motion<00:01:29.290> so<00:01:30.290> here's<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.650> helmet<00:01:31.010> and

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
motion so here's the helmet and

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.430 
motion so here's the helmet and
basically<00:01:31.700> what<00:01:32.000> I've<00:01:32.120> done<00:01:32.330> is<00:01:32.600> implemented

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
basically what I've done is implemented

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.120 
basically what I've done is implemented
the<00:01:33.740> dining<00:01:34.400> room<00:01:34.550> table<00:01:34.760> hinge<00:01:36.010> inside<00:01:37.010> the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
the dining room table hinge inside the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
the dining room table hinge inside the
helmet<00:01:37.600> so<00:01:38.600> we've<00:01:38.780> got<00:01:38.930> a<00:01:38.960> servo<00:01:40.150> something

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
helmet so we've got a servo something

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.290 
helmet so we've got a servo something
straight<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:41.840> another<00:01:42.170> server<00:01:42.500> at<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:42.890> top

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
straight and another server at the top

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.630 
straight and another server at the top
which<00:01:44.300> basically<00:01:44.720> means<00:01:45.080> as<00:01:45.950> with<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.340> dining

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
which basically means as with the dining

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.220 
which basically means as with the dining
room<00:01:46.730> table<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:47.390> faceplate<00:01:47.870> can<00:01:48.080> move

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
room table the faceplate can move

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.710 
room table the faceplate can move
independently<00:01:48.890> or<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.910> hinge<00:01:50.120> that<00:01:50.390> pulls<00:01:50.570> it

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
independently or the hinge that pulls it

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.690 
independently or the hinge that pulls it
up<00:01:50.810> which<00:01:51.080> means<00:01:51.320> we<00:01:51.440> can<00:01:51.590> get<00:01:51.710> that<00:01:51.860> nice

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
up which means we can get that nice

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.360 
up which means we can get that nice
motion<00:01:53.120> it<00:01:54.050> could<00:01:54.230> probably<00:01:54.350> move<00:01:54.650> further<00:01:55.040> as

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
motion it could probably move further as

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.510 
motion it could probably move further as
well<00:01:56.350> had<00:01:57.350> a<00:01:57.380> couple<00:01:57.770> of<00:01:57.860> issues<00:01:57.950> with<00:01:58.190> making

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
well had a couple of issues with making

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.520 
well had a couple of issues with making
the<00:01:58.760> bracket<00:01:59.150> wide<00:01:59.390> enough<00:01:59.720> to<00:01:59.930> fit<00:02:00.110> over<00:02:00.410> the

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
the bracket wide enough to fit over the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.580 
the bracket wide enough to fit over the
centerpiece<00:02:01.220> of<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.670> helmet<00:02:02.260> if<00:02:03.260> you<00:02:03.350> look<00:02:03.500> on

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
centerpiece of the helmet if you look on

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.500 
centerpiece of the helmet if you look on
my<00:02:03.620> website<00:02:04.070> which<00:02:04.310> is<00:02:04.340> X<00:02:04.730> robots<00:02:05.120> like<00:02:05.270> only

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
my website which is X robots like only

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.480 
my website which is X robots like only
UK<00:02:05.810> there's<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.260> step<00:02:06.620> by<00:02:06.800> step<00:02:07.100> of<00:02:07.190> how<00:02:07.250> this

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
UK there's a step by step of how this

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.070 
UK there's a step by step of how this
was<00:02:07.670> made<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.090> all<00:02:08.239> the<00:02:08.269> pieces<00:02:08.690> shown

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
was made and all the pieces shown

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.850 
was made and all the pieces shown
outside<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.769> helmet<00:02:10.959> these<00:02:11.959> servos<00:02:12.530> are

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
outside the helmet these servos are

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.610 
outside the helmet these servos are
basically<00:02:13.760> they<00:02:14.000> would<00:02:14.180> be<00:02:14.360> footer<00:02:14.689> bar<00:02:14.870> s3

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
basically they would be footer bar s3

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.720 
basically they would be footer bar s3
w3s

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
w3s

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.970 
w3s
and<00:02:17.239> in<00:02:17.329> fact<00:02:17.510> these<00:02:17.659> are<00:02:17.719> fake<00:02:18.079> Chinese<00:02:18.409> ones

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
and in fact these are fake Chinese ones

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.530 
and in fact these are fake Chinese ones
which<00:02:19.310> I

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
which I

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.110 
which I
for<00:02:19.810> about<00:02:19.989> two<00:02:20.260> pounds<00:02:20.829> on<00:02:20.950> eBay<00:02:21.310> they're

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
for about two pounds on eBay they're

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.149 
for about two pounds on eBay they're
probably<00:02:22.420> not<00:02:22.870> quite<00:02:23.170> up<00:02:23.409> to<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.650> job

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
probably not quite up to the job

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.830 
probably not quite up to the job
had<00:02:24.670> some<00:02:24.879> trouble<00:02:25.000> actually<00:02:25.299> getting<00:02:25.689> it<00:02:25.810> to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
had some trouble actually getting it to

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.500 
had some trouble actually getting it to
work<00:02:26.109> so<00:02:26.469> what<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.370> had<00:02:27.579> to<00:02:27.700> do<00:02:27.849> was<00:02:28.180> put<00:02:28.480> some

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
work so what I had to do was put some

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.459 
work so what I had to do was put some
Springs<00:02:29.019> in<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.290> back<00:02:29.500> here<00:02:29.799> so<00:02:31.409> there's<00:02:32.409> a

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469 
Springs in the back here so there's a

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:33.720 
Springs in the back here so there's a
couple<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.829> Springs<00:02:33.129> on<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.400> back<00:02:33.519> of<00:02:33.670> the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
couple of Springs on the back of the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.390 
couple of Springs on the back of the
faceplate<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.510> some<00:02:35.200> strings<00:02:35.680> which<00:02:36.099> when

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
faceplate and some strings which when

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.190 
faceplate and some strings which when
the<00:02:36.489> helmet<00:02:36.670> shut<00:02:38.489> push<00:02:39.489> this<00:02:39.640> down<00:02:40.200> helpfully

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
the helmet shut push this down helpfully

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.110 
the helmet shut push this down helpfully
run<00:02:41.439> into<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.859> grooves<00:02:42.159> in<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.609> helmet<00:02:42.970> there

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
run into the grooves in the helmet there

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.860 
run into the grooves in the helmet there
on<00:02:43.299> either<00:02:43.450> side<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:45.239> can<00:02:46.239> see<00:02:46.269> them<00:02:46.629> there

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
on either side you can see them there

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.679 
on either side you can see them there
and<00:02:47.590> obviously<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.250> actually<00:02:48.790> helps<00:02:49.090> helps

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
and obviously that actually helps helps

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.910 
and obviously that actually helps helps
lift<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.079> faceplate<00:02:50.590> up<00:02:52.680> pull<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.709> into

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
lift the faceplate up pull it into

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.920 
lift the faceplate up pull it into
position<00:02:54.129> otherwise<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:55.060> servos<00:02:55.450> struggle<00:02:55.870> a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
position otherwise the servos struggle a

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.210 
position otherwise the servos struggle a
bit<00:02:56.079> so<00:02:56.290> I'd<00:02:56.379> recommend<00:02:56.859> that<00:02:56.950> you<00:02:57.069> actually

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
bit so I'd recommend that you actually

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.670 
bit so I'd recommend that you actually
either<00:02:57.609> don't<00:02:58.000> use<00:02:58.180> fake<00:02:58.510> Chinese<00:02:58.810> servos<00:02:59.439> use

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
either don't use fake Chinese servos use

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.890 
either don't use fake Chinese servos use
genuine<00:03:00.069> ones<00:03:00.370> or<00:03:01.120> use<00:03:01.269> some<00:03:01.450> higher<00:03:01.659> power

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
genuine ones or use some higher power

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.580 
genuine ones or use some higher power
servos<00:03:02.560> if<00:03:03.159> you<00:03:03.669> can<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.930> that's<00:03:05.200> basically

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
servos if you can so that's basically

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.140 
servos if you can so that's basically
how<00:03:05.799> it<00:03:05.859> works<00:03:05.919> let<00:03:06.459> me<00:03:06.519> just<00:03:06.730> turn<00:03:06.849> that<00:03:07.000> back

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
how it works let me just turn that back

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:16.640 
how it works let me just turn that back
on<00:03:07.329> again<00:03:14.099> there<00:03:15.099> we<00:03:15.189> go<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:15.549> I've<00:03:15.639> actually

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
on again there we go so I've actually

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.949 
on again there we go so I've actually
program<00:03:17.650> waypoints<00:03:18.370> in<00:03:18.519> there<00:03:18.760> so<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.120> it

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
program waypoints in there so that it

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.789 
program waypoints in there so that it
lifts<00:03:20.230> up<00:03:20.349> and<00:03:21.090> goes<00:03:22.090> down<00:03:22.439> with<00:03:23.439> this<00:03:23.590> nice

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
lifts up and goes down with this nice

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.030 
lifts up and goes down with this nice
motion<00:03:25.260> sometimes<00:03:26.260> it<00:03:26.379> gets<00:03:26.500> caught<00:03:26.769> on<00:03:26.949> the

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
motion sometimes it gets caught on the

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.759 
motion sometimes it gets caught on the
foam<00:03:27.280> at<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.519> front<00:03:28.229> which<00:03:29.229> is<00:03:29.319> why<00:03:29.530> that<00:03:29.739> just

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
foam at the front which is why that just

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.789 
foam at the front which is why that just
counts<00:03:30.430> then<00:03:31.169> so<00:03:32.169> I've<00:03:32.260> got<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.470> couple<00:03:32.650> of

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
counts then so I've got a couple of

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.379 
counts then so I've got a couple of
things<00:03:32.979> still<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.430> sort<00:03:33.669> out<00:03:35.940> I'm<00:03:36.940> using<00:03:37.060> Apple

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
things still to sort out I'm using Apple

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.140 
things still to sort out I'm using Apple
ulu<00:03:38.109> mini<00:03:38.650> maestro<00:03:39.220> six<00:03:39.519> channel<00:03:39.819> servo

ulu mini maestro six channel servo

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.759 
ulu mini maestro six channel servo
controller<00:03:40.569> which<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:41.229> can<00:03:41.409> see<00:03:41.590> in<00:03:41.709> the

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
controller which you can see in the

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.369 
controller which you can see in the
front<00:03:42.010> here<00:03:42.220> which<00:03:42.370> is<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:42.549> tiny<00:03:42.879> board

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
front here which is this tiny board

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.240 
front here which is this tiny board
which<00:03:44.379> will<00:03:44.560> eventually<00:03:44.709> all<00:03:45.129> the

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
which will eventually all the

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.460 
which will eventually all the
electronics<00:03:45.760> will<00:03:45.849> be<00:03:45.940> tidied<00:03:46.359> up<00:03:46.479> and<00:03:47.319> put

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
electronics will be tidied up and put

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.920 
electronics will be tidied up and put
inside<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:47.949> helmet<00:03:48.129> so<00:03:48.639> that's<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.720> thing

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
inside the helmet so that's the thing

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.259 
inside the helmet so that's the thing
there<00:03:50.169> it's<00:03:50.739> got<00:03:50.979> six<00:03:51.250> servo<00:03:51.609> channels<00:03:52.030> and

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
there it's got six servo channels and

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.659 
there it's got six servo channels and
you<00:03:52.870> can<00:03:52.989> also<00:03:53.109> configure<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.769> spare<00:03:54.430> ones

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
you can also configure the spare ones

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.670 
you can also configure the spare ones
for<00:03:54.940> digital<00:03:55.359> in<00:03:55.510> or<00:03:55.629> out<00:03:55.810> which<00:03:56.109> means<00:03:56.290> I<00:03:56.500> can

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
for digital in or out which means I can

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.800 
for digital in or out which means I can
use<00:03:56.919> the<00:03:57.340> spare<00:03:57.970> channels<00:03:58.329> to<00:03:58.479> turn<00:03:58.690> the

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
use the spare channels to turn the

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.809 
use the spare channels to turn the
lights<00:03:59.049> on<00:03:59.260> in<00:03:59.409> the<00:03:59.500> eyes

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
lights on in the eyes

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.899 
lights on in the eyes
basically<00:04:01.540> this<00:04:01.810> board<00:04:02.169> is<00:04:02.379> controlled<00:04:02.829> by

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
basically this board is controlled by

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.059 
basically this board is controlled by
rs-232<00:04:03.909> serial<00:04:04.329> so<00:04:04.900> all<00:04:05.560> that<00:04:05.769> I've<00:04:05.889> got

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
rs-232 serial so all that I've got

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.379 
rs-232 serial so all that I've got
running<00:04:06.220> into<00:04:06.519> the<00:04:06.609> helmet<00:04:06.760> here<00:04:07.090> is<00:04:07.239> the

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:07.389 
running into the helmet here is the

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.500 
running into the helmet here is the
power<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:08.709> I've<00:04:08.859> got<00:04:09.069> one<00:04:09.280> wire<00:04:09.519> for<00:04:09.939> the<00:04:10.090> for

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
power and I've got one wire for the for

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.640 
power and I've got one wire for the for
the<00:04:10.629> basic<00:04:11.590> serial<00:04:12.069> connoisseur<00:04:12.760> so<00:04:13.409> the<00:04:14.409> plan

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
the basic serial connoisseur so the plan

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.439 
the basic serial connoisseur so the plan
is<00:04:14.799> to<00:04:14.829> have<00:04:15.069> everything<00:04:15.430> in<00:04:15.669> the<00:04:15.759> suit<00:04:16.000> being

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
is to have everything in the suit being

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.689 
is to have everything in the suit being
a<00:04:16.539> serial<00:04:17.049> device<00:04:17.349> including<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.519> hand

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
a serial device including the hand

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.490 
a serial device including the hand
repulsors<00:04:19.209> and<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.419> arc<00:04:19.570> reactor<00:04:19.840> so<00:04:20.229> I<00:04:20.259> can

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
repulsors and the arc reactor so I can

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.040 
repulsors and the arc reactor so I can
just<00:04:20.680> send<00:04:20.949> data<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.639> them<00:04:21.849> to<00:04:22.449> turn<00:04:22.659> things<00:04:22.840> on

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
just send data to them to turn things on

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.379 
just send data to them to turn things on
and<00:04:23.199> off<00:04:23.289> and<00:04:23.650> of<00:04:24.280> course<00:04:24.520> then<00:04:24.789> operate<00:04:25.240> the

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
and off and of course then operate the

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.050 
and off and of course then operate the
faceplate<00:04:26.220> so<00:04:27.220> at<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.400> moment<00:04:27.550> I'm<00:04:27.729> using<00:04:27.909> a

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
faceplate so at the moment I'm using a

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.500 
faceplate so at the moment I'm using a
pickaxe<00:04:28.419> 18<00:04:28.990> X<00:04:29.169> development<00:04:29.740> board<00:04:30.510> amongst

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
pickaxe 18 X development board amongst

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.040 
pickaxe 18 X development board amongst
other<00:04:31.630> things<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.590> rest<00:04:32.770> of<00:04:32.919> the

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
other things the rest of the

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.800 
other things the rest of the
is<00:04:33.139> just<00:04:33.909> battery<00:04:34.909> and<00:04:35.030> a<00:04:35.090> voltage<00:04:35.270> regulator

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
is just battery and a voltage regulator

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.320 
is just battery and a voltage regulator
so<00:04:36.379> I've<00:04:36.470> got<00:04:36.650> five<00:04:36.889> volts<00:04:37.310> I've<00:04:38.030> got<00:04:38.210> this

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
so I've got five volts I've got this

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.820 
so I've got five volts I've got this
switch<00:04:38.659> here<00:04:38.930> which<00:04:38.990> is<00:04:39.289> out<00:04:39.440> of<00:04:39.530> an<00:04:39.590> electric

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
switch here which is out of an electric

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.559 
switch here which is out of an electric
drill<00:04:40.280> which<00:04:40.520> is<00:04:40.669> just<00:04:40.879> temporary<00:04:41.120> at<00:04:41.479> the

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:41.569 
drill which is just temporary at the

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:45.999 
drill which is just temporary at the
moment<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:42.669> to<00:04:43.669> a<00:04:43.699> switch<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.889> operate<00:04:45.889> the

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
moment and to a switch to operate the

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.820 
moment and to a switch to operate the
faceplate<00:04:46.490> so<00:04:47.229> because<00:04:48.229> I'm<00:04:48.349> just<00:04:48.470> sending

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
faceplate so because I'm just sending

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.710 
faceplate so because I'm just sending
data<00:04:49.039> into<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.520> helmet<00:04:49.699> along<00:04:50.060> this<00:04:50.180> one<00:04:50.419> wire

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
data into the helmet along this one wire

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.540 
data into the helmet along this one wire
if<00:04:51.169> I<00:04:51.319> actually<00:04:51.440> put<00:04:51.680> batteries<00:04:52.190> in<00:04:52.370> there

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
if I actually put batteries in there

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.969 
if I actually put batteries in there
which<00:04:52.699> I<00:04:52.849> could<00:04:53.060> just<00:04:53.330> about<00:04:53.509> squeeze<00:04:53.900> in<00:04:54.139> then

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
which I could just about squeeze in then

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.529 
which I could just about squeeze in then
you<00:04:55.159> could<00:04:55.310> actually<00:04:55.460> make<00:04:55.819> it<00:04:55.970> Wireless<00:04:56.419> as

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
you could actually make it Wireless as

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:57.580 
you could actually make it Wireless as
well<00:04:56.720> which<00:04:56.900> would<00:04:57.020> make<00:04:57.199> it<00:04:57.379> much<00:04:57.560> easier

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
well which would make it much easier

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.230 
well which would make it much easier
when<00:04:58.159> you<00:04:58.340> if<00:04:58.550> you<00:04:58.639> wanted<00:04:58.819> to<00:04:58.940> take<00:04:59.090> the

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
when you if you wanted to take the

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.240 
when you if you wanted to take the
helmet<00:04:59.569> off<00:04:59.840> knots<00:05:00.349> how<00:05:00.500> to<00:05:00.560> disconnect<00:05:01.039> wires

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
helmet off knots how to disconnect wires

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.430 
helmet off knots how to disconnect wires
so<00:05:02.210> one<00:05:02.419> of<00:05:02.449> the<00:05:02.569> plans<00:05:02.810> is<00:05:03.050> to<00:05:03.169> have<00:05:03.319> an

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
so one of the plans is to have an

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.980 
so one of the plans is to have an
infrared<00:05:03.770> receiver<00:05:04.300> just<00:05:05.300> under<00:05:05.629> the<00:05:05.719> chin

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
infrared receiver just under the chin

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.230 
infrared receiver just under the chin
and<00:05:06.440> an<00:05:06.770> infrared<00:05:07.069> transmitter<00:05:07.639> in<00:05:07.849> the<00:05:07.969> chest

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
and an infrared transmitter in the chest

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.200 
and an infrared transmitter in the chest
of<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.569> helmet<00:05:08.930> chest<00:05:09.409> of<00:05:09.530> the<00:05:09.620> costume<00:05:10.210> which

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
of the helmet chest of the costume which

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.999 
of the helmet chest of the costume which
basically<00:05:11.509> sends<00:05:11.900> data<00:05:12.080> for<00:05:12.409> the<00:05:12.469> face<00:05:12.680> plate

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
basically sends data for the face plate

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:14.589 
basically sends data for the face plate
opening<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:13.580> closing<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.210> turning<00:05:14.509> the

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
opening and closing and turning the

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:17.649 
opening and closing and turning the
lights<00:05:14.810> on<00:05:14.990> and<00:05:15.110> off<00:05:15.729> so<00:05:16.729> that<00:05:16.759> the<00:05:17.479> helmet

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 
lights on and off so that the helmet

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:20.170 
lights on and off so that the helmet
could<00:05:17.870> be<00:05:17.990> completely<00:05:18.409> wireless<00:05:18.969> which<00:05:19.969> make

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
could be completely wireless which make

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.820 
could be completely wireless which make
it<00:05:20.330> much<00:05:20.479> easier<00:05:20.690> for<00:05:20.870> going<00:05:21.139> to<00:05:21.259> conventions

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
it much easier for going to conventions

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.260 
it much easier for going to conventions
and<00:05:22.009> so<00:05:22.190> on<00:05:22.280> rather<00:05:22.460> than<00:05:22.610> having<00:05:22.849> it<00:05:23.030> stuck<00:05:23.240> on

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
and so on rather than having it stuck on

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.700 
and so on rather than having it stuck on
your<00:05:23.539> head<00:05:23.690> with<00:05:23.840> a<00:05:23.870> cable<00:05:24.139> up<00:05:24.379> your<00:05:24.560> neck

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
your head with a cable up your neck

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.990 
your head with a cable up your neck
which<00:05:24.919> you<00:05:25.039> probably<00:05:25.250> can't<00:05:25.610> reach<00:05:25.819> the

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
which you probably can't reach the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.119 
which you probably can't reach the
disconnect<00:05:26.479> with<00:05:26.659> the<00:05:26.690> arms<00:05:27.139> of<00:05:27.289> the<00:05:27.710> body<00:05:27.919> of

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.129 
disconnect with the arms of the body of

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.360 
disconnect with the arms of the body of
the<00:05:28.219> suit<00:05:28.460> on<00:05:29.650> so<00:05:30.650> that's<00:05:30.889> the<00:05:31.069> basic

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
the suit on so that's the basic

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.409 
the suit on so that's the basic
principle<00:05:31.909> with<00:05:32.539> which<00:05:32.569> it<00:05:32.900> works<00:05:34.090> as<00:05:35.090> I<00:05:35.150> say

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
principle with which it works as I say

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:36.999 
principle with which it works as I say
there's<00:05:35.629> a<00:05:35.719> step<00:05:35.930> by<00:05:36.050> step<00:05:36.289> of<00:05:36.409> the<00:05:36.530> mechanics

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
there's a step by step of the mechanics

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.850 
there's a step by step of the mechanics
on<00:05:37.279> my<00:05:37.550> website<00:05:37.969> and<00:05:38.270> there's<00:05:39.080> also<00:05:39.259> an

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
on my website and there's also an

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.980 
on my website and there's also an
article<00:05:40.520> about<00:05:40.729> the<00:05:41.000> light-up<00:05:41.210> eye<00:05:41.479> lenses

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
article about the light-up eye lenses

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.330 
article about the light-up eye lenses
which<00:05:42.169> you<00:05:42.289> can<00:05:42.440> see<00:05:42.650> through<00:05:42.889> which<00:05:43.130> I'm<00:05:43.310> just

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
which you can see through which I'm just

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.559 
which you can see through which I'm just
going<00:05:43.550> to<00:05:43.729> grab<00:05:43.880> on<00:05:44.120> I'll<00:05:44.210> show<00:05:44.240> you<00:05:44.389> those

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:44.569 
going to grab on I'll show you those

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:49.659 
going to grab on I'll show you those
next<00:05:46.449> so<00:05:47.449> here<00:05:47.599> my<00:05:47.750> eye<00:05:47.779> lens<00:05:48.199> is<00:05:48.469> if<00:05:49.370> I<00:05:49.460> turn

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
next so here my eye lens is if I turn

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:54.459 
next so here my eye lens is if I turn
them<00:05:49.819> on<00:05:52.449> we<00:05:53.449> go<00:05:53.599> and<00:05:53.630> I'll<00:05:53.960> just<00:05:54.139> put<00:05:54.319> this<00:05:54.409> one

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:54.469 
them on we go and I'll just put this one

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:56.050 
them on we go and I'll just put this one
in<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:54.830> helmet<00:05:55.130> so<00:05:55.279> we<00:05:55.370> can<00:05:55.550> see<00:05:55.759> what<00:05:55.909> we've

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
in the helmet so we can see what we've

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.240 
in the helmet so we can see what we've
got<00:05:56.090> there<00:05:56.449> but<00:05:57.169> to<00:05:57.289> cut<00:05:57.469> them<00:05:57.620> about<00:05:57.680> a<00:05:57.860> bit<00:05:58.130> to

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
got there but to cut them about a bit to

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:04.119 
got there but to cut them about a bit to
fit<00:05:58.430> around<00:05:58.550> the<00:05:58.759> mechanics<00:06:02.500> so<00:06:03.500> these<00:06:03.800> are

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:04.129 
fit around the mechanics so these are

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:06.309 
fit around the mechanics so these are
obviously<00:06:05.000> lenses<00:06:05.419> which<00:06:05.569> cover<00:06:05.840> the<00:06:06.020> entire

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 
obviously lenses which cover the entire

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:08.260 
obviously lenses which cover the entire
hi<00:06:06.469> there<00:06:06.889> as<00:06:07.099> you<00:06:07.219> can<00:06:07.370> see<00:06:07.580> but<00:06:07.909> you<00:06:08.029> can<00:06:08.150> also

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
hi there as you can see but you can also

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.820 
hi there as you can see but you can also
see<00:06:08.599> straight<00:06:08.960> through<00:06:08.990> them<00:06:09.349> from<00:06:09.529> the<00:06:09.620> other

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
see straight through them from the other

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.700 
see straight through them from the other
side<00:06:10.539> and<00:06:11.539> that<00:06:11.719> is<00:06:11.930> because<00:06:12.319> they<00:06:12.650> are

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
side and that is because they are

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.740 
side and that is because they are
basically<00:06:13.129> made<00:06:13.400> from<00:06:13.669> mirror<00:06:13.909> sunglasses

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
basically made from mirror sunglasses

just thin strips of styrene plastic

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:43.389 
just thin strips of styrene plastic
glued<00:06:41.060> on<00:06:41.240> and<00:06:42.139> I've<00:06:42.229> got<00:06:42.380> some<00:06:42.560> LEDs<00:06:43.009> in<00:06:43.310> the

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:43.399

bottom line

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.980 
bottom line
turn<00:06:44.449> them<00:06:44.569> back<00:06:44.690> on<00:06:45.729> which<00:06:46.729> shine<00:06:47.330> across<00:06:47.750> the

turn them back on which shine across the
screen<00:06:48.139> fabric<00:06:48.650> to<00:06:48.770> diffuse<00:06:49.099> the<00:06:49.280> light<00:06:49.900> so

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
screen fabric to diffuse the light so

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.900 
screen fabric to diffuse the light so
basically<00:06:51.710> I<00:06:51.830> just<00:06:52.130> used<00:06:52.370> some<00:06:52.610> of<00:06:52.669> these

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.910 
basically I just used some of these

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.650 
basically I just used some of these
cheap<00:06:54.460> cheap<00:06:55.460> battery<00:06:55.819> lights<00:06:56.030> which<00:06:56.300> I<00:06:56.479> think

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660 
cheap cheap battery lights which I think

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.020 
cheap cheap battery lights which I think
were<00:06:56.720> $2.99<00:06:57.380> for<00:06:57.710> a<00:06:57.740> pair<00:06:57.979> on<00:06:58.220> ebay<00:06:58.580> with<00:06:58.789> free

were $2.99 for a pair on ebay with free

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.350 
were $2.99 for a pair on ebay with free
delivery<00:07:00.370> so<00:07:01.370> those<00:07:01.520> are<00:07:01.669> just<00:07:01.699> hot<00:07:01.970> glued<00:07:02.180> in

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.570 
delivery so those are just hot glued in
there<00:07:02.389> at<00:07:03.199> the<00:07:03.289> moment<00:07:03.620> I've<00:07:03.710> got<00:07:03.740> the<00:07:04.039> battery

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580 
there at the moment I've got the battery

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.159 
there at the moment I've got the battery
box<00:07:04.729> that<00:07:05.000> came<00:07:05.180> with<00:07:05.360> it<00:07:05.389> which<00:07:05.660> is<00:07:05.780> just<00:07:05.810> two

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:06.169 
box that came with it which is just two

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:09.670 
box that came with it which is just two
double-a<00:07:06.530> batteries<00:07:07.599> but<00:07:08.599> eventually<00:07:08.900> I'm

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 
double-a batteries but eventually I'm

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.999 
double-a batteries but eventually I'm
going<00:07:10.069> to<00:07:10.310> be<00:07:10.490> replacing<00:07:11.030> that<00:07:11.710> with<00:07:12.710> the

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:13.009 
going to be replacing that with the

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:14.200 
going to be replacing that with the
power<00:07:13.220> supply<00:07:13.400> they've<00:07:13.759> already<00:07:13.880> got<00:07:14.180> over

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.210 
power supply they've already got over

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.120 
power supply they've already got over
here<00:07:14.750> and<00:07:14.900> then<00:07:15.169> as<00:07:15.289> I<00:07:15.410> said<00:07:15.470> I'm<00:07:15.710> going<00:07:15.919> to<00:07:15.949> why

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.130 
here and then as I said I'm going to why

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.850 
here and then as I said I'm going to why
those<00:07:16.370> two<00:07:16.909> a<00:07:17.449> spare<00:07:17.810> Channel<00:07:18.259> configured<00:07:18.740> as

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
those two a spare Channel configured as

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.439 
those two a spare Channel configured as
a<00:07:18.919> digital<00:07:19.099> out<00:07:19.430> so<00:07:19.729> I<00:07:19.759> can<00:07:19.970> turn<00:07:20.150> them<00:07:20.300> on<00:07:20.389> and

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:20.449 
a digital out so I can turn them on and

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:22.839 
a digital out so I can turn them on and
off<00:07:20.630> so<00:07:21.620> I<00:07:21.650> still<00:07:21.979> only<00:07:22.130> have<00:07:22.310> to<00:07:22.430> send<00:07:22.639> data

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:22.849 
off so I still only have to send data

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:25.180 
off so I still only have to send data
along<00:07:23.180> one<00:07:23.419> Y<00:07:23.599> to<00:07:23.659> the<00:07:23.900> helmet<00:07:24.289> and<00:07:24.919> I<00:07:25.009> can

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.190 
along one Y to the helmet and I can

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.800 
along one Y to the helmet and I can
control<00:07:25.490> the<00:07:25.639> lights<00:07:25.880> and<00:07:26.210> I<00:07:26.330> can<00:07:26.509> control

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:26.810 
control the lights and I can control

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.050 
control the lights and I can control
everything<00:07:27.400> so<00:07:28.400> I<00:07:28.430> think<00:07:28.520> that's<00:07:28.819> all<00:07:28.940> I<00:07:29.030> have

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:29.060 
everything so I think that's all I have

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.390 
everything so I think that's all I have
for<00:07:29.210> now<00:07:29.330> let's<00:07:29.659> just<00:07:29.720> have<00:07:29.930> one<00:07:30.169> quick<00:07:30.409> demo

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 
for now let's just have one quick demo

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.070 
for now let's just have one quick demo
over<00:07:31.520> the<00:07:31.580> helmet<00:07:31.880> again<00:07:32.180> and<00:07:32.479> that<00:07:32.630> will<00:07:32.960> be

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.080 
over the helmet again and that will be

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:48.339 
over the helmet again and that will be
all<00:07:46.090> yes<00:07:47.090> it<00:07:47.240> still<00:07:47.419> fits<00:07:47.630> on<00:07:47.750> my<00:07:47.870> head<00:07:48.050> I've

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:48.349 
all yes it still fits on my head I've

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:49.719 
all yes it still fits on my head I've
had<00:07:48.530> to<00:07:48.620> disconnect<00:07:49.009> the<00:07:49.130> electronics<00:07:49.610> for

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:49.729 
had to disconnect the electronics for

00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:52.629 
had to disconnect the electronics for
now<00:07:49.849> but<00:07:50.469> if<00:07:51.469> it's<00:07:51.740> quite<00:07:51.979> well<00:07:52.130> despite<00:07:52.400> the

00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 
now but if it's quite well despite the

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.240 
now but if it's quite well despite the
servo<00:07:53.120> in<00:07:53.270> the<00:07:53.300> forehead<00:07:53.599> and<00:07:53.930> if<00:07:54.889> I<00:07:54.979> put<00:07:55.159> the

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:55.250 
servo in the forehead and if I put the

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.420 
servo in the forehead and if I put the
faceplate<00:07:55.460> down<00:07:56.440> you<00:07:57.440> know<00:07:57.590> you<00:07:58.070> know<00:07:58.130> my<00:07:58.310> eyes

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:58.430 
faceplate down you know you know my eyes

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.830 
faceplate down you know you know my eyes
are<00:07:58.460> in<00:07:58.729> the<00:07:58.820> right<00:07:58.969> place<00:07:59.210> and<00:07:59.389> I<00:07:59.449> can<00:07:59.630> see

00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 
are in the right place and I can see

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.080 
are in the right place and I can see
fine
