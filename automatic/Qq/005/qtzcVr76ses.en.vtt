00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.550
 Hi, I'm David Perez and today I want 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.980
 continue talking about three glasses 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.960
 central tilting shift subtle as the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.020
 24 millimeters of canon that I have mounted 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.090
 here on my 5d and on this occasion I 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.770
 I want to talk about the one that 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.930
 probably the concept is a tad 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.140
 harder to understand what is the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.670
 movement of weighing or kiel 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.480
 basically it consists 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.280
 from entering 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.110
 the mind of centering the lens on this in 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.629
 this sense we are basically 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.559
 tilting the lens up or towards 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:58.110
 down and this time I want to talk to you 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.670
 of this movement as the goal 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.519
 use it in landscape photography 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.540
 where are we going to want to use this 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.640
 movement to get 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.100
 everything is focused without having to 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.610
 resort to very closed openings like 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.050
 It can be a 22 axis or a f-16 starting 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.390
 which we already have problems with 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.790
 distraction in our image as all 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.670
 you know a lens usually a 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.170
 Full frame camera usually depends a bit 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.360
 of the specific goal that we use 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.350
 It is usually optimal if we use it around 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.360
 of an axis 85 with 6 etc from there 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.120
 already begin to appear problems of 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.490
 diffraction 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.410
 as much as we close yes we will have 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.050
 greater depth of field but we will see 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.620
 how things are not so clear 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.620
 like before 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.110
 how the movement works 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.300
 tilting or off- center in this 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.090
 occasion what we have basically is 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.990
 that in a normal lens I forgive what 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.049
 we have basically is that 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.670
 this is the plane of our sensor 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.500
 our users is here back and this 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.909
 is the plane of it then if 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.489
 we have focused for example that 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.810
 rock from there what we're going to have is that 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.950
 the plane on that rock will be in focus 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.890
 that is parallel to the sensor 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.810
 and depending on how much more or less 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.910
 let's close the lens so what we have 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.280
 later on the lens as more or 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.099
 less one third and two thirds towards 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.069
 behind the point I develop everything 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.959
 parallel to the plane that defines our 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.990
 sensor that would be a roughly flat 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.710
 thus cutting over the mouth 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.620
 The problem we have is that many 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.680
 times 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.450
 especially on this occasion where I have 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.620
 the very low chamber despite being a 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.340
 wide angle that we usually provide 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.610
 a lot to get this whole approach if 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.390
 we focused more or less that rock 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.709
 probably rocks good not 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.260
 you see right now in this video that are 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.909
 back there we will have them out of focus 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.950
 much that we even go to a 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:06.739
 closed opening of felicia 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.100
 For this, what is usually done is with 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.230
 a decentral bleu lens like this 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.690
 we are inclining little by little always 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.370
 leaning in the direction of things 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.340
 that we have to have focus in this case 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.080
 is the plane that goes horizontal to the ground and 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.200
 we are tilting it little by little with 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.370
 be very careful because it is very easy 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.170
 pass us 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.730
 until we get so much what we have 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.709
 closer to the camera like that what 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.480
 we have farther are perfectly 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.890
 focused that is the goal we want 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.890
 do on this occasion 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.510
 we can also get this using what 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.040
 which is called 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.470
 the focus is here that is pretty much 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.180
 we took a focused photo here and we took 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.920
 Another photo of exposed a normal lens 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.709
 focused on the rocks that are most 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.120
 back the problem we have for 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.430
 example here in this case that where 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.680
 we have things in motion this technique 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.909
 can give us rare artifacts 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.579
 once we join with the photos in 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:05.549
 photoshop why some people prefer 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:08.220
 use a lens like this even though 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.629
 the focus is that almost does not come out 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.939
 quite economic we already have a 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.319
 software usually photoshop of a 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:14.750
 difference with which we can do 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.840
 this 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.989
 however, a lens of these is usually 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.960
 quite expensive let's see just a little bit like 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.390
 we get 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.770
 focusing the lens with tilting the 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.280
 it contains how everything gets 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.620
 focused for this I will use the life bio of 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.150
 the camera the system other forms of 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.040
 do it through equations 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.440
 mathematics with ground clearance 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.120
 etcetera but personally if our 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.100
 camera allows me to let light new 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.290
 let's get many better 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.450
 results as I was commenting to adjust 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.370
 the tilting of the lens or tilting of 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.140
 the lens I personally the course is 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.150
 light new then we enter the live 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.120
 view of the camera in this model in 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:59.090
 concrete is entered using this button and what 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.300
 What we do is focus more or less on a 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.090
 third of the image for it by 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.980
 example we use the guides that shows us 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.160
 the light view itself and selected a 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:15.250
 point to a third of the image and I make a 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.250
 small tour in that area and focus 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.849
 then if we look 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:22.999
 if I go is that at the end of the image and 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:25.099
 I do zuma here even if we press the 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:27.739
 Focus preview button 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:30.169
 we see that 8 that area there 

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:32.779
 it really is not focused at all the 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.419
 zone of the rocks those that we have at 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:37.370
 end of the image for it what 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.050
 we do right now is 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.569
 we zoom in on that area 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.479
 Y 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:47.449
 let's loose whoever is using the right one 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.520
 and I'm going down very slowly it's not going to 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:52.729
 you need a lot of grade two tilt 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.520
 degrees in this case until you get that 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:58.399
 that area is focused I've spent 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.500
 it's a tad backwards and I think that 

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:02.960
 more or less there 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.820
 is perfectly more or less focused 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.420
 we do not need much because now 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:10.190
 same as you know in live view the lens 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.600
 it is completely open, it would be necessary to press 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.350
 the depth of field button to 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.600
 close it then in the back 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:21.260
 here I used the til so that now this 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.990
 is focused but when using the til what 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.400
 happens to us is that the front area is 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.600
 has unfocused us with what here 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.220
 that we have to go back is to correct a 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.420
 tint the focus 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:34.520
 and it's already a bit of nothing and now 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.680
 back to check back all that 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.090
 everything is more or less focused I think that 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.190
 yes 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.530
 if you want to adjust a tad again 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:46.040
 film you release when the screw that 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.600
 you are looking for now jce highlights 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.660
 another tad about past styles what 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.300
 we adjust perfectly and now more 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:56.720
 or less I think we should have 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:07:00.190
 almost everything focused and keep in mind that 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.540
 we have almost everything focused on being 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.110
 effectors with 5 what this has 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.449
 lens 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:09.699
 we closed the opening this we 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:11.770
 we have enough depth button 

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:14.770
 of field you see that I have everything 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:18.680
 perfectly focused 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:21.020
 and I am able to make this photo using 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.840
 Efe 8 instead of having to resort to a 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.759
 f-16 would burn that the image was a 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.139
 tad softer we would not have that 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:30.780
 detail tan 

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:32.189
 good that is not excellent to efe 8 and 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.080
 with this we would have our image 

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:36.230
 now it would simply have to wait 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.450
 a while before 

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.100
 the movement of water we like 

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:43.970
 all of them would have to put a filter 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:46.730
 in which we are efe 12 has forgiven 

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.290
 112 of exposure speed and there not 

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.660
 we will have the water very moved as 

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:53.100
 you see is going to stay more or less and I do 

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.110
 a picture 

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.990
 but I would like it to have more 

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:59.760
 movement now I will show you the photo 

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:03.420
 final that I have done but I will put a 

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:06.500
 filter in the front one and that will already be 

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.500
 a story with 7000
