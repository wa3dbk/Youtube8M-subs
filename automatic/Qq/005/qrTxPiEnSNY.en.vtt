five high school boys who pretty much do
nothing<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.039> remember<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.910> times<00:00:54.120> when<00:00:54.480> they

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
nothing and remember the times when they

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.510 
nothing and remember the times when they
did<00:00:54.930> stuff<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.710> really<00:00:55.890> amounted<00:00:56.489> to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
did stuff that really amounted to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.520 
did stuff that really amounted to
nothing<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.300> really<00:00:57.510> nice<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.109> relaxing

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.900 
nothing it's a really nice and relaxing
slice-of-life<00:00:58.800> show<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.670> i<00:00:59.730> definitely

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
slice-of-life show and i definitely

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.880 
slice-of-life show and i definitely
think<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.480> first<00:01:00.719> episode<00:01:00.870> was<00:01:01.199> better<00:01:01.500> than

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
think this first episode was better than

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.889 
think this first episode was better than
most<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.370> season<00:01:02.699> 1<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.090> few<00:01:03.329> things<00:01:03.570> i<00:01:03.690> noticed

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
most of season 1 a few things i noticed

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.539 
most of season 1 a few things i noticed
as<00:01:04.260> well<00:01:04.470> with<00:01:04.680> things<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:05.010> there<00:01:05.369> was

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
as well with things like there was

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.130 
as well with things like there was
background<00:01:06.030> music<00:01:06.360> where<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.570> thought<00:01:06.930> there

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
background music where I thought there

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.140 
background music where I thought there
wasn't<00:01:07.320> any<00:01:07.710> before<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.159> think<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> character

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
wasn't any before I think the character

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.700 
wasn't any before I think the character
interactions<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:09.960> series<00:01:10.140> are<00:01:10.409> really

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
interactions in this series are really

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.859 
interactions in this series are really
quite<00:01:10.920> interesting<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.640> funny<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.270> parts<00:01:12.540> and

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
quite interesting and funny in parts and

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.109 
quite interesting and funny in parts and
number<00:01:13.470> three<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:13.950> really<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
number three is I really like the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.210 
number three is I really like the
artwork<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.840> didn't<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:16.799> much<00:01:16.830> as<00:01:17.009> I

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
artwork I didn't like it as much as I

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.219 
artwork I didn't like it as much as I
like<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.580> now<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.759> don't<00:01:18.030> know<00:01:18.240> why<00:01:18.479> maybe<00:01:19.080> I

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
like it now I don't know why maybe I

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.780 
like it now I don't know why maybe I
just<00:01:19.470> miss<00:01:19.619> Kim<00:01:19.799> etobicoke<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.460> that's<00:01:20.610> why

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
just miss Kim etobicoke and that's why

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.249 
just miss Kim etobicoke and that's why
I'm<00:01:20.939> certainly<00:01:21.270> thinking<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.810> great<00:01:22.049> show

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
I'm certainly thinking it's a great show

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.810 
I'm certainly thinking it's a great show
basically<00:01:22.770> oh<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.250> more<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.580> first

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820

basically oh this is more of the first
season<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.840> saw<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.170> first<00:01:25.500> season

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.600 
and liked it watch season two if you saw
the<00:01:28.080> first<00:01:28.200> season<00:01:28.590> didn't<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.549> much

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the first season didn't like it so much

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.280 
the first season didn't like it so much
skip<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.450> one<00:01:30.659> there's<00:01:30.869> nothing<00:01:31.140> different

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
skip this one there's nothing different

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.410 
skip this one there's nothing different
and<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.009> want<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.430> see<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.729> show<00:01:32.970> you

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.940 
and if you want to see the show you
don't<00:01:33.600> need<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.960> watch<00:01:34.079> season<00:01:34.380> run<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:34.920> you

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
don't need to watch season run but you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.649 
don't need to watch season run but you
probably<00:01:35.220> should<00:01:35.640> go<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:35.909> watch<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.299> anyway

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
not quite sure why but the art style

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.750 
not quite sure why but the art style
which<00:02:32.380> was<00:02:32.530> fantastic<00:02:32.680> made<00:02:33.310> me<00:02:33.430> think<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.730> was

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
which was fantastic made me think it was

an<00:02:33.940> artistic<00:02:34.450> choice<00:02:34.480> rather<00:02:35.140> than<00:02:35.380> something

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
an artistic choice rather than something

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.530 
an artistic choice rather than something
