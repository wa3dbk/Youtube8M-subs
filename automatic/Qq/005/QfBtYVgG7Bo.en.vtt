00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.979

 that is the time that I am in the 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.680
 study and practically made a break 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.960
 in the studio to do these labors 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.680
 of promotion and I liked how you sound like 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.680
 recipe word 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:04.420
 and well, preparing the new topics 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:09.080
 for my nomad camel project of 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.060
 camel to see how you were born because the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.890
 the titles of the psalms because they speak 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.230
 much of what's inside the camel 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.530
 of Dreams 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.690
 Well hair of dreams is like 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.190
 he calls in Spain those who are 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.510
 traffickers of something camel to which it is 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.600
 dealer of something then in this 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.640
 song 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.780
 in an imaginary world where is 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.020
 forbidden to dream if this traffickers of 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.040
 dreams dream paths struggle to do 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.630
 reach people who do not have not 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.009
 stop dreaming that you have your dreams that 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.170
 live with your dreams and that many 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.460
 professions important the reason for not 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.460
 it means work 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:06.729
 do it but I think very good very 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.729
 good ones 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:22.220
 I think it's important because this 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.290
 Your proposal is a disc that is not 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.330
 closed that is still about the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.620
 march and say not all is simple 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.930
 and the songs that are going to be in that 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.630
 compiled and the last word because 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.269
 Well there do so because 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.579
 see I have and I have as a kind of 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.230
 challenge to prove myself and 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.560
 prove to many colleagues 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.780
 profession that the internet is a friend is not 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.609
 an enemy of the artists and I think it's 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.190
 a very good tool that knowing 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:54.170
 the use makes you get all bad 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:57.010
 memory and well I decided to use 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.859
 this format that I look like disk 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.390
 because it also allows me to be able to add 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.370
 with very well you said before going 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.079
 adding any songs as you 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.660
 have the artistic need 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:15.980
 is that this Friday a closed tree is 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:17.630
 an open but you connected there 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.570
 how did this connection with 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.980
 Colombia did not come for a very reason 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.980
 simple I married a girl 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.579

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.859

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.030
 friends we seem something very special that 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.330

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:44.470

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.470

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.650
