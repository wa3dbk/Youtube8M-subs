subject<00:00:29.619> for<00:00:29.890> me<00:00:30.099> I<00:00:30.130> think<00:00:30.249> it's<00:00:30.579> an

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
subject for me I think it's an

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.609 
subject for me I think it's an
unacceptable<00:00:31.569> number<00:00:31.630> and<00:00:32.050> I<00:00:32.110> think<00:00:32.140> the<00:00:32.470> VA

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
unacceptable number and I think the VA

00:00:32.619 --> 00:01:00.410 
unacceptable number and I think the VA
sucks<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.780> that's<00:00:35.080> just<00:00:35.260> my<00:00:35.380> opinion
