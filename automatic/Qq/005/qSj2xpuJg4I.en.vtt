any day night or day low level

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.099 
any day night or day low level
all<00:00:28.439> weather<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.580> that's<00:00:30.179> primarily<00:00:30.630> what<00:00:30.990> we

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
all weather and that's primarily what we

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.979 
all weather and that's primarily what we
did<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.439> did<00:00:31.619> about<00:00:32.189> 85%<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:33.059> our<00:00:33.180> missions<00:00:33.870> at

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
did we did about 85% of our missions at

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.560 
did we did about 85% of our missions at
night<00:00:34.170> usually<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.130> B<00:00:35.280> end<00:00:35.460> John<00:00:36.210> would<00:00:36.420> be

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
night usually the B end John would be

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.360 
night usually the B end John would be
trying<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.050> acquire<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.559> target<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> radar

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
trying to acquire the target on a radar

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.100 
trying to acquire the target on a radar
so<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.700> was<00:00:39.000> basically<00:00:39.480> heads<00:00:39.809> out<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
so I was basically heads out of the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.220 
so I was basically heads out of the
cockpit<00:00:40.350> because<00:00:41.809> they<00:00:42.809> had<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> lot<00:00:43.200> of

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
cockpit because they had a lot of

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.260 
cockpit because they had a lot of
heat-seeking<00:00:44.040> missiles<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.850> there's<00:00:44.969> no<00:00:45.090> ray

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
heat-seeking missiles and there's no ray

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.880 
heat-seeking missiles and there's no ray
there's<00:00:45.600> no<00:00:45.750> warning<00:00:45.989> inside<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.500> cockpit

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
there's no warning inside the cockpit

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.170 
there's no warning inside the cockpit
for<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.760> see<00:00:47.940> him<00:00:48.030> visually

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
for that so I have to see him visually

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.110 
for that so I have to see him visually
and<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:49.020> had<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> advantage<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:50.129> flying<00:00:50.940> at

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
and we had the advantage of flying at

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.639 
and we had the advantage of flying at
night<00:00:51.300> where<00:00:51.539> everything<00:00:51.930> lights<00:00:52.170> up<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> sky

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
night where everything lights up the sky

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.010 
night where everything lights up the sky
so<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.370> could<00:00:53.789> see<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.180> triple-a<00:00:54.570> coming<00:00:54.899> up

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
so I could see the triple-a coming up

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.540 
so I could see the triple-a coming up
out<00:00:55.170> off<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.410> ground<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.860> could<00:00:55.920> see<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.250> SAM

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
out off the ground I could see a SAM

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.250 
out off the ground I could see a SAM
missile<00:00:56.940> coming<00:00:57.120> up<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.629> could<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:57.960> dodge

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
missile coming up and I could just dodge

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.200 
missile coming up and I could just dodge
him<00:00:58.469> just<00:00:58.649> go<00:00:58.770> around<00:00:59.039> them<00:00:59.219> but<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
him just go around them but the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.549 
him just go around them but the
disadvantage<00:01:00.780> was<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.050> had<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.289> come<00:01:01.440> back

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
disadvantage was that I had to come back

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.650 
disadvantage was that I had to come back
and<00:01:01.620> land<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> carrier<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:02.640> night<00:01:02.789> most<00:01:03.480> of

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
and land on the carrier at night most of

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.299 
and land on the carrier at night most of
the<00:01:03.809> pressures<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.530> guy<00:01:04.710> he's<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.189> one

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the pressures on this guy he's the one

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.219 
the pressures on this guy he's the one
that<00:01:05.430> has<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.760> land<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.570> ship<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.930> land<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
that has to land the ship and land the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.219 
that has to land the ship and land the
aircraft<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:08.130> board<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.700> at<00:01:08.970> night<00:01:09.240> without

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
aircraft on board and at night without

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.560 
aircraft on board and at night without
any<00:01:10.560> visual<00:01:11.220> reference<00:01:11.640> except<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
any visual reference except for just the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.020 
any visual reference except for just the
lights<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> carrier<00:01:13.320> deck<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.740> yeah

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
lights on the carrier deck it's yeah

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.120 
lights on the carrier deck it's yeah
imagine<00:01:15.030> taking<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:16.200> know<00:01:16.320> thirty<00:01:16.920> five

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
imagine taking a you know thirty five

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.980 
imagine taking a you know thirty five
thousand<00:01:17.640> pound<00:01:17.790> aircraft<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> dead<00:01:18.750> stop

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
thousand pound aircraft to a dead stop

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.480 
thousand pound aircraft to a dead stop
in<00:01:19.049> two<00:01:19.350> seconds<00:01:19.799> when<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.920> hit<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.460> that's

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
in two seconds when you hit and that's

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.640 
in two seconds when you hit and that's
quite<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> thrill<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.439> see

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
quite a thrill and you can see

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.260 
quite a thrill and you can see
everything<00:01:22.860> around<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.520> day<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.939> in

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
everything around you in the day and in

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.499 
everything around you in the day and in
the<00:01:24.390> day<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> cat<00:01:24.960> shot<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:26.100> know<00:01:26.330> 55,000<00:01:27.330> pound

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
the day a cat shot you know 55,000 pound

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.170 
the day a cat shot you know 55,000 pound
cat<00:01:27.750> shot<00:01:28.049> zero<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.500> 150<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:29.759> about<00:01:29.939> two

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
cat shot zero to 150 in just about two

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.179 
cat shot zero to 150 in just about two
seconds<00:01:30.630> there<00:01:31.290> isn't<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.650> car<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.070> world

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
seconds there isn't a car in the world

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.880 
seconds there isn't a car in the world
that<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:34.259> there's

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
that can do that to you so it's there's

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.190 
that can do that to you so it's there's
no<00:01:35.189> better<00:01:35.640> ride<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.210> world<00:01:36.390> but<00:01:36.840> at<00:01:36.990> night

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
no better ride in the world but at night

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.050 
no better ride in the world but at night
is<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> whole<00:01:37.920> different<00:01:38.100> story<00:01:38.310> because<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
is a whole different story because the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.300 
is a whole different story because the
night<00:01:39.240> time<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.560> acceleration<00:01:40.890> of

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
night time you have the acceleration of

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.920 
night time you have the acceleration of
the<00:01:41.369> catapult<00:01:41.729> shot<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.270> two<00:01:42.479> seconds

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
the catapult shot for that two seconds

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.969 
the catapult shot for that two seconds
and<00:01:43.049> at<00:01:43.110> night<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.350> don't<00:01:43.439> see<00:01:43.649> anything<00:01:43.829> past

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
and at night you don't see anything past

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.069 
and at night you don't see anything past
the<00:01:44.310> end<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.579> deck<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.689> punch

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
the end of the deck so you just punch

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.649 
the end of the deck so you just punch
out<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.530> black<00:01:46.920> hole<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.479> you've<00:01:48.479> lost

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
out in this black hole and you've lost

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.030 
out in this black hole and you've lost
all<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.990> sense<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.259> acceleration<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:49.950> you

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
all the sense of acceleration so you

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.710 
all the sense of acceleration so you
just<00:01:50.189> feel<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.460> everything<00:01:50.729> quit<00:01:51.030> you're

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
just feel like everything quit you're

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.520 
just feel like everything quit you're
not<00:01:51.840> going<00:01:52.170> anywhere

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
not going anywhere

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.980 
not going anywhere
and<00:01:52.680> your<00:01:53.520> brain<00:01:53.759> takes<00:01:54.000> about<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.509> second<00:01:54.930> and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
and your brain takes about a second and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.469 
and your brain takes about a second and
a<00:01:55.049> half<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.229> wreak<00:01:55.560> age<00:01:55.770> itself<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:57.240> plane

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
a half to wreak age itself and the plane

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.209 
a half to wreak age itself and the plane
is<00:01:57.659> trimmed<00:01:57.899> up<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.200> rotate<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.860> fly<00:01:59.100> away

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
is trimmed up to rotate and fly away

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.399 
is trimmed up to rotate and fly away
from<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.579> water<00:01:59.820> hopefully<00:02:00.090> we<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.259> rat

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
from the water hopefully we have the rat

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.800 
from the water hopefully we have the rat
out<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.890> radar<00:02:02.070> altimeter<00:02:02.460> set<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.299> 40<00:02:03.600> feet

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
out the radar altimeter set for 40 feet

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.749 
out the radar altimeter set for 40 feet
because<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> deck<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.619> about<00:02:04.829> 65<00:02:05.399> feet<00:02:05.430> off

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
because the deck is about 65 feet off

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.580 
because the deck is about 65 feet off
the<00:02:05.909> water<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.659> if<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.020> Deedle<00:02:07.469> Deedle

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
the water so if it Deedle Deedle

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.749 
the water so if it Deedle Deedle
something's<00:02:08.099> wrong<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.459> we're<00:02:08.550> going<00:02:08.670> to

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
something's wrong and we're going to

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.190 
something's wrong and we're going to
punch<00:02:08.940> out<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.239> plane

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
punch out of the plane

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.290 
punch out of the plane
we're<00:02:11.099> standing<00:02:11.610> at<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.849> aft<00:02:11.970> end<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.240> the
