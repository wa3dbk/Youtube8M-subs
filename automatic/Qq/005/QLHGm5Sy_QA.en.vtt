00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.839
 Zombies are not just since 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.000
 current altitude flight of the us series the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.380
 walking dead again big in fashion 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.540
 after all, the sleeping ones are in here 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.299
 mostly guarantors for bloody and 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.619
 crazy entertainment 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.720
 In 2010, we were in dead Iceland 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.490
 not bad , though 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.439
 gloomy hallways or mansions must 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.300
 we are on a tropical island with 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.189
 to fight the undead around you 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.849
 horror holiday of the special kind too 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.250
 escape 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.529
 with dead island gets the title 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.570
 Successor of the reason taken exactly 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.730
 the same ingredients as the first link has 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.310
 if that is still contemporary and above all 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.830
 also fun 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:44.630
 test video that's a classic 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.490
 Case of stupid run 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.170
 the survivors of dead island 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.550
 disaster on the island railway new 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.380
 have it just so in the 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.610
 rescue helicopter made and choose 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.040
 getting in on a ship 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.300
 security 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.160
 Unfortunately , it happens instead 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.720
 home with the next madness on 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.490
 the group is captured and 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.260
 should be on the ship as a research object 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.630
 Finally , the survivors serve 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.700
 against the zombie plague in the lower deck 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.170
 the pressure on newcomer john der 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.540
 Also held on the ship 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.850
 and how should it be otherwise 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.950
 Ship device in a storm and on and 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.540
 below deck breaks the zombie plague 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.160
 you can almost be happy 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.070
 that the barge after the prologue against the 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.590
 coast of an island thunders as I said 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.690
 Actually, of course, they also waver 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.640
 palazzo is the name of the island in the 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.220
 Part time every amount of zombies 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.840
 around and somehow the whole thing goes 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.700
 survive schnitzel horror again from 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.350
 the protagonists are going on in the front 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.360
 actually wanted to escape 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.070
 run stupid in comparison to 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.869
 predecessor has shares in rib 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.789
 Gameplay technically not changed 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.500
 our task is pretty simple 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.070
 namely as soon as possible from the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.119
 free to explore island panay 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.890
 For this we choose at the beginning of the game 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.810
 our character is four of them 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.520
 old familiar from dead island 19 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.679
 The already mentioned has been added 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.509
 john all characters are different 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.310
 favor in various attributes 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.690
 certain weapon types have 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.940
 special resistance forces or 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.259
 Special attacks who share one of 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.220
 score has its character 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.110
 easy to import around in panama 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.880
 we have to get ahead with ours 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.650
 Character different main and 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.420
 Side quests we usually meet 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.040
 get from other survivors 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.620
 These tasks are usually pretty 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.270
 simple and not very imaginative most of the time 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.090
 are you busy with anything? 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.100
 for someone to get or somewhere 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.410
 to look something over then 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.310
 any information or any 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.310
 to get something 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.570
 there it is almost a real one 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.890
 highlight if you like a boat with here 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.170
 make an outboard motor afloat again 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.470
 and sneak through zombie territory 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.870
 got to 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.970
 apropos the crashes are actually 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.790
 just decorative decoration because what you where 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.730
 really in a nice game right 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.070
 lots of zombies the musty size 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.690
 beat out of the cap and you have to 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.640
 in the parts, again, each shares 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.350
 opportunity, especially the game 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.060
 again countless objects in the 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.430
 Hands are with whom we then neat 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.810
 can thresh it 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.400
 much of what we find in parallel 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.950
 can be misused as a weapon 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.360
 however, caution commanded according 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.220
 at one time the murder tools have 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.930
 namely worn and must 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.820
 workbenches to be repaired 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.620
 There are also practical ones 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.270
 upgrades for the weapons around the zombies 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.610
 to inflict even more harm 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.440
 Of course there is not that for nothing 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.420
 is quite practical that now all over 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.880
 The island benefits in the form of money 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.720
 lying around the initially make fights 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.640
 pretty moody 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.620
 At least until you get the whole principle 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.030
 most of the time you have to internalize 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.560
 namely a zombie with a kick 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.680
 push back and then on him 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.510
 beat so far almost dead dead 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.100
 with enemy attacks one remains 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.320
 something back accordingly and then goes 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.940
 the shit always keep an eye on back 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.190
 However, you should be the stamina 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.720
 bar is the fact must be used up 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.880
 our character a few seconds 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.410
 catch 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.450
 this principle is then exhausted 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.370
 the initial euphoria sometime in the 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.410
 notorious action keys hammer 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.270
 sleepy and the whole again from 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.190
 ahead 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.900
 you need different tactics 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.640
 almost not some, he acts like this 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.120
 between boss are just stronger than 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.010
 other 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.960
 accordingly, you have to spend more time on it 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.150
 to bludgeon that is neither special 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.150
 demanding even more demanding 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.090
 the rage mode only provides 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.070
 we have little remedy by good 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.110
 actions we can fill a bar 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.669
 in rage mode especially effective on 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.150
 The tommys beat and earn 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.310
 accordingly more points of experience 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.660
 because the roleplaying is also impact 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.730
 moves preserved 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.080
 for zombies and of course, too 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.880
 Completed quest Collect the 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.230
 Experience points then from one 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.260
 certain number to a level rise 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.520
 lead for april points received 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.170
 we divide to a total of three 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.250
 talent trees and switch for example 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.280
 more harm with certain weapons 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.360
 increased regeneration or 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.280
 special attacks free the 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.440
 Role playing elements fit in well 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.300
 and take care of the series' own trick 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.030
 even if the rest of the game is quiet more 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.190
 could have tolerated that, too 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.210
 because the innovations are in trouble 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.300
 keep borders 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.600
 Of course the island is new but well it is 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.820
 stop just a tropical island a 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.100
 some new enemy varieties are also available, for example 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.780
 the drowned the first inconspicuous 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.230
 drowned water then suddenly play 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.270
 as bild comes to agree with us and 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.330
 because you are not so good in the water 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.070
 The bread is new territory on foot 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.750
 There are vehicles such as chips 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.400
 you still get to the bottom 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.010
 but also comfortable over the 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.660
 Waterways being comfortable 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.340
 exaggerated because the control is 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.200
 pretty hakelig and the boats stay 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.270
 thanks to the large turning circle very much 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.750
 times in the reeds hang but if you then 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.760
 surrounded by zombies 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.090
 after all, there is a practical turbo 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.090
 mode 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:54.650
 Up to four players can play in the 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.600
 diamond rich cooperative on zombie hunt 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.460
 you either go for it directly 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.080
 a game with friends or stripes 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.970
 just over the island and knight up 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.160
 button pressure on how to play in the 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.690
 Nearby are the lures a system 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.340
 works very well so that you look 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.479
 theoretically anytime internet 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.520
 can get support 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:12.350
 In addition, items can be shared 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.850
 exchange and in general he makes a 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:19.850
 website with human players 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:21.889
 significantly more fun than alone palais is 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.449
 in principle quite pretty the island 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:25.220
 setting is behind for a zombie game 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.350
 how pretty interesting the 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.240
 cozy atmosphere is however of 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.250
 some serious flaws clearly 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.199
 for example, there are strong clouds 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.370
 starring faulty animations or 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:36.110
 isolated stuttering 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.090
 At all , the sharing reptile feels 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.229
 technically somehow unfinished and strong 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.270
 to improve 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:43.400
 after all, the gore and splatter tune 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.870
 Effects in a zombie game is that 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.590
 yes a light is to be underestimated 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:50.120
 criterion and reset youku.com unity of 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.979
 Sound is moving on average 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.599
 level is somewhat negative on some 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:55.610
 put the English speakers on the 

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:57.289
 now and then something bored and act 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.360
 some yell samples of zombies 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:01.900
 repeat themselves so often that it 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.900
 gets annoying 

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:13.599
 is we make it short of all hits 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.879
 he's an addon as a completely new one 

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:17.770
 Game mechanics and roleplaying 

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:19.479
 Impact are identical and the zombie 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.919
 maps basic principle with the steady 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:23.169
 Level up also works 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:24.669
 followers still annoying that 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:26.770
 boring missionsdesign the 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:28.779
 interchangeable characters on a permanent basis 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.849
 stupid fighting system and the technical 

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:32.110
 work so hard that the sunny haag 

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:34.930
 Pieces a bitter taste 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.610
 also gets the fun co- op mode 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.409
 does not save the title from the staid 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:41.169
 mediocre and therefore we can currently 

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:42.009
 only real hardcore fans of the first 

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.839
 partly recommend 

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:47.279
 for all the others worth the trip 

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:47.279
 not according to plan
