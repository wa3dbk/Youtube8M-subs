ovation<00:04:08.810> it's<00:04:09.349> very<00:04:09.590> difficult<00:04:10.069> to<00:04:10.250> meet<00:04:10.370> that

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
ovation it's very difficult to meet that

beat<00:04:10.819> of<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.090> music<00:04:11.180> because<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.379> music<00:04:12.769> is

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
beat of the music because the music is

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.250 
beat of the music because the music is
not<00:04:13.099> geared<00:04:13.519> towards<00:04:14.060> creating<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:15.019> last

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
not geared towards creating the last

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.870 
not geared towards creating the last
point<00:04:15.739> of<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:16.010> and<00:04:16.190> when<00:04:16.609> you're<00:04:16.730> in<00:04:16.790> the

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
point of it and when you're in the

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.159 
point of it and when you're in the
middle<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.239> spin<00:04:17.540> like<00:04:17.750> that<00:04:17.959> it's<00:04:18.109> very

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
middle of a spin like that it's very

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.800 
middle of a spin like that it's very
tough<00:04:18.829> to<00:04:19.070> do<00:04:19.220> that<00:04:19.459> but<00:04:20.209> I<00:04:20.299> think<00:04:20.329> she<00:04:20.630> should

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
tough to do that but I think she should

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.330 
tough to do that but I think she should
be<00:04:20.840> satisfied<00:04:21.200> with<00:04:21.709> that<00:04:21.739> performance

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
be satisfied with that performance

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.270 
be satisfied with that performance

the<00:04:27.200> major<00:04:27.530> question<00:04:27.919> mark<00:04:28.430> with<00:04:28.639> her<00:04:28.820> coming

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
the major question mark with her coming

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.150 
the major question mark with her coming
in<00:04:29.419> was<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:30.260> fact<00:04:30.530> that<00:04:30.620> she<00:04:30.889> had<00:04:31.010> not

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
in was the fact that she had not

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.340 
in was the fact that she had not
competed<00:04:31.520> very<00:04:31.880> often<00:04:32.210> this<00:04:32.360> year<00:04:32.419> a<00:04:32.810> couple

competed very often this year a couple

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.469 
competed very often this year a couple
of<00:04:33.440> competitions<00:04:34.070> that<00:04:34.400> is<00:04:34.580> it<00:04:34.940> but<00:04:35.180> she's

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
of competitions that is it but she's

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.930 
of competitions that is it but she's
pretty<00:04:35.840> sharp<00:04:36.139> we're<00:04:36.979> not<00:04:37.130> having<00:04:37.460> competed

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
pretty sharp we're not having competed

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.659 
pretty sharp we're not having competed
much<00:04:38.180> Michelle<00:04:38.900> Kwan<00:04:39.290> can<00:04:39.800> she<00:04:40.040> top<00:04:40.280> sasha

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669

Cohen<00:04:41.300> Cohen<00:04:41.810> was<00:04:42.139> extremely<00:04:42.800> good<00:04:42.950> up<00:04:43.130> to

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
Cohen Cohen was extremely good up to

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.850 
Cohen Cohen was extremely good up to
five<00:04:43.490> nine<00:04:43.790> in<00:04:44.210> both<00:04:44.660> sets<00:04:45.139> for<00:04:45.410> Cohen<00:04:45.830> Wilson

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.950 

now<00:04:51.860> this<00:04:52.040> double<00:04:52.580> axel<00:04:53.090> is<00:04:53.240> always<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.810> most

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
now this double axel is always the most

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.230 
now this double axel is always the most
dangerous<00:04:54.380> because<00:04:54.590> the<00:04:55.190> forward<00:04:55.520> edge<00:04:55.910> is

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
dangerous because the forward edge is

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.260 
dangerous because the forward edge is
not<00:04:56.750> secure<00:04:57.350> ever<00:04:57.680> it's<00:04:58.250> always<00:04:58.729> treacherous

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
not secure ever it's always treacherous

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.480 
not secure ever it's always treacherous
right<00:04:59.810> here<00:05:00.050> but<00:05:00.380> she<00:05:00.590> does<00:05:00.770> that<00:05:00.919> very<00:05:01.250> well

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
right here but she does that very well

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.730 
right here but she does that very well
goes<00:05:01.820> up<00:05:02.030> and<00:05:02.240> does<00:05:02.450> it<00:05:02.600> completely<00:05:03.080> but<00:05:03.440> right

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
goes up and does it completely but right

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.710 
goes up and does it completely but right
there<00:05:04.010> doesn't<00:05:04.460> check<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.330> landing<00:05:05.690> that

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
there doesn't check the landing that

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.080 
there doesn't check the landing that
means<00:05:06.050> the<00:05:06.200> right<00:05:06.470> arm<00:05:06.830> was<00:05:07.400> not<00:05:07.700> back

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
means the right arm was not back

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.920 
means the right arm was not back
stopping<00:05:08.780> the<00:05:09.110> rotation<00:05:10.150> and<00:05:11.150> of<00:05:11.570> course<00:05:11.810> your

stopping the rotation and of course your

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.260 
stopping the rotation and of course your
spiral<00:05:12.320> just<00:05:12.830> shows<00:05:13.130> that<00:05:13.370> look<00:05:13.820> on<00:05:14.030> her<00:05:14.210> face

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270

spiral just shows that look on her face
I<00:05:14.780> mean<00:05:15.169> you<00:05:15.260> can<00:05:15.440> read<00:05:15.710> her<00:05:16.280> heart<00:05:16.669> it's<00:05:16.940> right

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
I mean you can read her heart it's right
