00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
it again and you can see it's a bit

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.510 
it again and you can see it's a bit
sloppy<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.809> tried<00:00:40.350> not<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.590> take<00:00:40.890> any<00:00:41.160> rest

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
sloppy I tried not to take any rest

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.250 
sloppy I tried not to take any rest
between<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.090> muscle<00:00:42.390> up<00:00:42.480> any<00:00:42.660> pull-up<00:00:43.020> which

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
between you muscle up any pull-up which

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.799 
between you muscle up any pull-up which
actually<00:00:43.710> isn't<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.100> hard<00:00:44.460> however<00:00:45.180> going

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
actually isn't that hard however going

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.299 
actually isn't that hard however going
from<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> pull<00:00:46.410> up<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> chin<00:00:47.010> up<00:00:47.129> is

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
from the pull up to the chin up is

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.340 
from the pull up to the chin up is
pretty<00:00:47.579> difficult<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.079> change

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
pretty difficult and I have to change

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.010 
pretty difficult and I have to change
the<00:00:49.530> grip<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.950> then<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.850> take<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> little<00:00:51.449> bit<00:00:51.899> of

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the grip and then I take a little bit of

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.170 
the grip and then I take a little bit of
rest<00:00:52.289> because<00:00:52.469> otherwise<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.610> pull<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
rest because otherwise you pull the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.029 
rest because otherwise you pull the
chin-ups<00:00:54.570> will<00:00:54.780> be<00:00:54.930> even<00:00:55.379> sloppier

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
chin-ups will be even sloppier

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.130 
chin-ups will be even sloppier
throughout<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.090> week<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.390> hope<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.780> increase

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
throughout the week I hope to increase

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
bodyweight depth I've tried to perform

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.999 
bodyweight depth I've tried to perform
three<00:02:07.330> sets<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:07.810> twelve<00:02:08.140> repetitions<00:02:08.470> and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
hard to do that so it's definitely

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.990 
hard to do that so it's definitely
enough<00:02:14.160> repetitions<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.790> right
