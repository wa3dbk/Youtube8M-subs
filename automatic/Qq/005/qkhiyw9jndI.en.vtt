and video games in previous videos I've

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.540 
and video games in previous videos I've
talked<00:00:36.570> about<00:00:36.719> how<00:00:37.170> video<00:00:37.680> games<00:00:38.100> can

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550

influence<00:00:39.120> our<00:00:39.390> thinking<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.620> exactly<00:00:41.190> how

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
influence our thinking but exactly how

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.030 
influence our thinking but exactly how
that<00:00:41.940> influence<00:00:42.510> manifests<00:00:43.170> itself<00:00:43.410> depends

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
that influence manifests itself depends

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.729 
that influence manifests itself depends
on<00:00:44.160> who<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.820> are<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.120> what<00:00:46.079> sort<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.440> games

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
on who we are and what sort of games

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.580 
on who we are and what sort of games
were<00:00:47.010> playing<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.730> how<00:00:48.149> we<00:00:48.210> see<00:00:48.930> those<00:00:49.230> games

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
were playing and how we see those games

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.180 
were playing and how we see those games
it's<00:00:50.520> not<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:51.000> there<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.300> any<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:52.260> way<00:00:52.829> that

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
it's not like there is any one way that

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.369 
it's not like there is any one way that
video<00:00:53.460> games<00:00:53.789> influence<00:00:54.539> our<00:00:54.690> thinking<00:00:54.899> at

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
video games influence our thinking at

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.740 
video games influence our thinking at
least<00:00:55.860> according<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.699> all<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.329> science

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
least according to all of the science

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.470 
least according to all of the science
that's<00:00:57.840> been<00:00:58.320> done<00:00:58.590> thus<00:00:58.829> far<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.399> seems<00:01:00.030> like

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
that's been done thus far it seems like

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.630 
that's been done thus far it seems like
at<00:01:00.840> best<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.440> say<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.920> video<00:01:02.160> games<00:01:02.430> are

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
at best you can say that video games are

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.640 
at best you can say that video games are
similar<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.329> things<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.660> television<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
similar to things like television and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.840 
similar to things like television and
films<00:01:05.220> however<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.960> fact<00:01:07.650> does<00:01:08.070> not<00:01:08.310> seem<00:01:08.670> to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
films however that fact does not seem to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.420

and also there's nothing to suggest that
those<00:01:52.500> kids<00:01:52.799> wouldn't<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.220> equally<00:01:53.790> bad<00:01:53.970> off
