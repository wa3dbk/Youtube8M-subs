either on on any of the websites that

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.440 
either on on any of the websites that
have<00:02:18.630> been<00:02:18.690> on<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:20.400> they're<00:02:20.640> any<00:02:20.910> kind

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
have been on that that they're any kind

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.780 
have been on that that they're any kind
of<00:02:21.650> special<00:02:22.650> treble<00:02:22.950> hook<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:23.280> they<00:02:23.400> must<00:02:23.610> make

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
of special treble hook so they must make

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.370 
of special treble hook so they must make
their<00:02:23.820> own<00:02:24.200> but<00:02:25.200> they<00:02:25.590> are<00:02:25.710> pretty<00:02:25.980> sticky<00:02:26.190> so

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
their own but they are pretty sticky so

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.570 
their own but they are pretty sticky so
I<00:02:28.380> think<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:29.040> they<00:02:29.160> use<00:02:29.310> black

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
I think that they use black

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.090 
I think that they use black
nickel-plated<00:02:30.300> hooks<00:02:30.480> now<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.710> this

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
nickel-plated hooks now so this is this

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.590 
nickel-plated hooks now so this is this
was<00:02:32.280> in<00:02:32.400> an<00:02:32.490> older<00:02:32.760> package<00:02:33.120> this<00:02:33.240> was<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:33.540> a

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
was in an older package this was in a

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.270 
was in an older package this was in a
black<00:02:33.840> package<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.560> think<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:34.980> was<00:02:35.100> just

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
black package so I think it was just

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.090 
black package so I think it was just
just<00:02:36.270> an<00:02:36.930> older<00:02:37.230> one<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.410> body<00:02:37.740> is<00:02:37.890> still

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
just an older one the body is still

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.800 
just an older one the body is still
exactly<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.820> same<00:02:39.030> as<00:02:39.210> any<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.630> newer

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
exactly the same as any of the newer

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.660 
exactly the same as any of the newer
ones<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:41.390> but<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:43.260> thing<00:02:43.440> is<00:02:43.560> beautiful<00:02:43.980> a

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
ones so but this thing is beautiful a

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.510 
ones so but this thing is beautiful a
little<00:02:45.060> bit<00:02:45.270> about<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.600> color<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:46.620> chose<00:02:47.310> this

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
little bit about the color I chose this

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.430 
little bit about the color I chose this
red<00:02:47.820> color<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.300> is<00:02:48.420> their<00:02:48.570> Aurora<00:02:49.020> crawl

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
red color this is their Aurora crawl

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.229 
red color this is their Aurora crawl
because<00:02:51.350> number<00:02:52.350> one<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.920> don't<00:02:53.310> have<00:02:53.520> any<00:02:53.850> kind

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
because number one I don't have any kind

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.530 
because number one I don't have any kind
of<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.510> red<00:02:55.130> pattern<00:02:56.130> like<00:02:56.700> this<00:02:56.910> inside<00:02:57.270> of<00:02:57.420> my

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
of a red pattern like this inside of my

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.910 
of a red pattern like this inside of my
tackle<00:02:57.810> box<00:02:57.989> for<00:02:58.350> jerkbaits

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
tackle box for jerkbaits

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.850 
tackle box for jerkbaits
and<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.760> saw<00:03:00.420> this<00:03:00.600> on<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.810> peg<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.709> knew<00:03:01.830> I

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
and I saw this on the peg and I knew I

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.250 
and I saw this on the peg and I knew I
needed<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.250> have<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.580> because<00:03:02.970> it's<00:03:03.510> like<00:03:04.200> I

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
needed to have it because it's like I

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.570 
needed to have it because it's like I
said<00:03:04.320> it's<00:03:04.560> beautiful

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
said it's beautiful

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.280 
said it's beautiful
I<00:03:05.610> think<00:03:06.120> it'll<00:03:06.270> it'll<00:03:06.690> catch<00:03:06.930> some<00:03:07.110> fish

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
I think it'll it'll catch some fish

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.390 
I think it'll it'll catch some fish
especially<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.040> springtime<00:03:08.420> so<00:03:10.400> let's

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
especially in the springtime so let's

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.670 
especially in the springtime so let's
get<00:03:11.520> a<00:03:11.580> closer<00:03:11.820> look<00:03:11.940> at<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:12.450> this<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.320> like<00:03:13.620> I

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
get a closer look at it this is like I

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.670 
get a closer look at it this is like I

the<00:03:56.340> four<00:03:56.640> main<00:03:56.850> ones<00:03:57.090> are<00:03:57.300> the<00:03:57.360> pointer<00:03:57.900> the

one<00:04:33.330> ounce<00:04:33.540> so<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:35.220> think<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.880> two<00:04:36.090> main<00:04:36.330> ones

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
one ounce so I think the two main ones

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.290 
one ounce so I think the two main ones
are<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:36.870> 100<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.650> 78<00:04:38.250> you<00:04:38.490> have<00:04:38.640> the<00:04:38.790> 100

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
are the 100 and the 78 you have the 100

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.950 
are the 100 and the 78 you have the 100
which<00:04:39.419> is<00:04:39.479> this<00:04:39.810> one<00:04:40.370> in<00:04:41.370> this<00:04:41.610> one<00:04:41.790> is<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.300> 4

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
which is this one in this one is the 4

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.830 
which is this one in this one is the 4
inch<00:04:42.990> 5/8<00:04:43.560> ounce<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:44.130> then<00:04:44.729> the<00:04:44.910> 78<00:04:45.479> which<00:04:45.690> is

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
inch 5/8 ounce and then the 78 which is

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.469 
inch 5/8 ounce and then the 78 which is
the<00:04:45.990> 3<00:04:46.350> inch<00:04:46.610> 3/8<00:04:47.610> ounce<00:04:47.760> which<00:04:48.060> is<00:04:48.210> kind<00:04:48.419> of

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
the 3 inch 3/8 ounce which is kind of

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.930 
the 3 inch 3/8 ounce which is kind of
like<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:50.660> Excalibur<00:04:51.979> this<00:04:52.979> is<00:04:53.160> the

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
like the the Excalibur this is the

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.490 
like the the Excalibur this is the
Excalibur<00:04:54.419> insists<00:04:54.720> 3/8<00:04:54.990> of<00:04:55.110> an<00:04:55.229> ounce<00:04:55.350> I

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
Excalibur insists 3/8 of an ounce I

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.730 
Excalibur insists 3/8 of an ounce I
think<00:04:55.680> it's<00:04:55.800> maybe<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.580> little<00:04:56.729> over<00:04:56.880> 3<00:04:57.180> inches

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
think it's maybe a little over 3 inches

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.200 
think it's maybe a little over 3 inches
since<00:04:58.740> I<00:04:58.860> have<00:04:58.979> this<00:04:59.160> out<00:04:59.340> I<00:04:59.610> think<00:05:00.030> that<00:05:00.120> the

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
since I have this out I think that the

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.840 
since I have this out I think that the
Excalibur's<00:05:00.810> are<00:05:00.960> pretty<00:05:01.140> similar<00:05:01.610> in<00:05:02.610> their

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
Excalibur's are pretty similar in their

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.350 
Excalibur's are pretty similar in their
look<00:05:03.150> maybe<00:05:03.840> not<00:05:04.080> in<00:05:04.290> in<00:05:05.190> anything<00:05:05.790> else<00:05:06.090> other

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
look maybe not in in anything else other

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.140 
look maybe not in in anything else other
than<00:05:06.479> look<00:05:06.870> but<00:05:07.340> they<00:05:08.340> look<00:05:08.610> pretty<00:05:08.880> similar

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
than look but they look pretty similar

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.409 
than look but they look pretty similar
if<00:05:09.450> you<00:05:09.539> hold<00:05:09.750> them<00:05:09.870> in<00:05:09.960> your<00:05:09.990> hand<00:05:11.390> they<00:05:12.390> are

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
if you hold them in your hand they are

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.960 
if you hold them in your hand they are
very<00:05:12.570> very<00:05:13.050> similar<00:05:13.380> looking<00:05:13.950> so<00:05:14.370> I'm<00:05:14.820> not

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
very very similar looking so I'm not

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.270 
very very similar looking so I'm not
going<00:05:15.120> to<00:05:15.180> go<00:05:15.270> into<00:05:15.570> the<00:05:16.220> Excalibur<00:05:17.220> because

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
going to go into the Excalibur because

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.860 
going to go into the Excalibur because
already<00:05:17.490> did<00:05:17.669> a<00:05:17.700> review<00:05:17.970> on<00:05:18.120> that<00:05:18.150> one<00:05:18.419> but<00:05:18.919> the

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
already did a review on that one but the

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.310 
already did a review on that one but the
or<00:05:21.870> the<00:05:22.080> Lucky<00:05:22.650> Craft<00:05:22.770> has<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:24.320> casting

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
or the Lucky Craft has the the casting

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.620 
or the Lucky Craft has the the casting
chamber<00:05:25.710> inside<00:05:26.010> of<00:05:26.190> it<00:05:26.310> so<00:05:26.700> when<00:05:27.330> it<00:05:27.450> rolls

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
chamber inside of it so when it rolls

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.810 
chamber inside of it so when it rolls
backwards<00:05:27.930> you<00:05:28.289> can<00:05:28.440> hear<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:28.830> ball<00:05:29.100> well

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
backwards you can hear the ball well

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.029 
backwards you can hear the ball well
backwards<00:05:30.780> so<00:05:30.990> when<00:05:31.140> you<00:05:31.229> cast<00:05:31.470> it<00:05:31.680> it'll<00:05:31.919> get

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
backwards so when you cast it it'll get

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.820 
backwards so when you cast it it'll get
that<00:05:32.220> centrifugal<00:05:32.669> force<00:05:33.060> get<00:05:33.870> all<00:05:33.990> the<00:05:34.260> all

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
that centrifugal force get all the all

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.440 
that centrifugal force get all the all
the<00:05:35.130> weight<00:05:35.280> towards<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.700> rear<00:05:35.910> and<00:05:36.180> help<00:05:36.360> you

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
the weight towards the rear and help you

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.430 
the weight towards the rear and help you
cast<00:05:36.660> it<00:05:36.810> out<00:05:36.870> there<00:05:36.930> further

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
cast it out there further

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.590 
cast it out there further
when<00:05:37.830> it<00:05:37.920> starts<00:05:38.130> to<00:05:38.160> dive<00:05:38.400> it<00:05:39.150> just<00:05:39.360> rolls

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
when it starts to dive it just rolls

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.230 
when it starts to dive it just rolls
forward<00:05:40.730> so<00:05:42.650> so<00:05:43.650> anyway<00:05:43.800> there<00:05:44.190> it<00:05:44.280> is

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
forward so so anyway there it is

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.050 
forward so so anyway there it is
very<00:05:45.900> excited<00:05:46.350> about<00:05:46.410> this<00:05:46.710> thing<00:05:46.950> I<00:05:47.670> don't

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
very excited about this thing I don't

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.490 
very excited about this thing I don't
own<00:05:48.180> any<00:05:48.390> Lucky<00:05:48.690> crafts<00:05:48.960> because<00:05:49.290> they<00:05:49.380> are<00:05:49.470> a
