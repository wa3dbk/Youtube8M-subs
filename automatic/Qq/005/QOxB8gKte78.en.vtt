00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We are dependent on our planet for our food, our water and our energy.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Yet the way we live has a dramatic impact on these natural resources.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
As humans, we are responsible for the loss of tropical rainforests and contribute to climate change and the melting arctic ice.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We’re also responsible for the other carbon dioxide problem: the acidification of our oceans.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The more carbon dioxide we produce, the more our seas absorb. And for the marine life who call the ocean home, their future is far from certain.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:18.000
At the University of Bristol, members of the Cabot Institute are leading the way in understanding how carbon dioxide affects the creatures that live in the sea

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the very creatures on which so many animals, and humans, depend.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Scientists at Bristol are providing world-leaders and policymakers with the information they need to save our biggest and most important natural resource – our oceans.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And save them we must.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Thousands of students need financial help to make university accessible – just like I did.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Some need help even earlier to realise that we all have potential, we just need to believe it.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Studying at Bristol changed my life. If I hadn’t received a sports scholarship and been able to train as I did while studying for my degree

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I wouldn’t be where I am now, playing rugby for England.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Supporting students at Bristol isn’t just about offering bursaries and scholarships. It’s about making sure study spaces are comfortable,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:50.000
that the books in the library are up-to-date, and that students have opportunities to flourish in societies, sports clubs and enterprise activities.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It’s about creating an environment where students think anything is possible.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
When you study medicine, you do so with a very clear idea of what you want to achieve.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
You want to help others, and save lives.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000
That’s why I’m so pleased to tell you how groundbreaking research at Bristol is giving thousands of people the chance of a brighter future.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
An estimated 44 million people suffer with dementia around the world.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Scientists at the University are investigating whether drugs more commonly used to treat high blood pressure could improve the quality of life for those affected by this debilitating condition.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Around one in 180 babies in the UK is born with congenital heart disease.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:14.020
And thanks to scientists at Bristol, those children may soon need just one operation – not several – so they spend less time in hospital and more time at home.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.000
With every day and every donation, Bristol is making a big difference to children, adults, and families, around the world.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Thank you.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Thank you.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Thank you.
