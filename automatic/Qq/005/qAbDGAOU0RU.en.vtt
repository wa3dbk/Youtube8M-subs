more about about that relationship to

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.450 
more about about that relationship to
fear<00:00:20.880> because<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.210> think<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.600> lot<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.840> people<00:00:22.460> are

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
fear because I think a lot of people are

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.070 
fear because I think a lot of people are
crippled<00:00:23.880> by<00:00:23.910> fear<00:00:24.060> at<00:00:24.420> different<00:00:24.720> points<00:00:24.990> in

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
crippled by fear at different points in

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.109 
crippled by fear at different points in
their<00:00:25.140> life<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:26.250> can<00:00:26.699> be<00:00:26.789> very<00:00:26.820> difficult

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
their life and it can be very difficult

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.750 
their life and it can be very difficult
to<00:00:27.449> overcome<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:28.289> think<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:29.220> might<00:00:29.490> have<00:00:29.550> been

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
to overcome I think it might have been

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.269 
to overcome I think it might have been
an<00:00:30.330> intuitive<00:00:31.019> thing<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.529> us<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.830> we<00:00:32.040> may

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
an intuitive thing for us and we may

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.350 
an intuitive thing for us and we may
have<00:00:32.399> not<00:00:32.550> been<00:00:32.669> able<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.880> put<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.000> into<00:00:33.149> words

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
have not been able to put it into words

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.389 
have not been able to put it into words
in<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.050> past<00:00:34.260> but<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.620> think<00:00:34.829> through<00:00:35.280> our

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
in the past but I think through our

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.700 
in the past but I think through our
recent<00:00:35.820> experiment<00:00:36.420> ations<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.870> studies<00:00:37.290> at

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
recent experiment ations the studies at

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.280 
recent experiment ations the studies at
our<00:00:38.129> retreats<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.000> just<00:00:39.210> these<00:00:39.870> social

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
our retreats and just these social

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.650 
our retreats and just these social
experiments<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.100> did<00:00:41.280> at<00:00:41.460> work<00:00:41.670> always

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
experiments that we did at work always

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.770 
experiments that we did at work always
just<00:00:42.780> like<00:00:42.930> pushing<00:00:43.860> her<00:00:44.040> our<00:00:45.000> own<00:00:45.149> envelopes

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
just like pushing her our own envelopes

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.270 
just like pushing her our own envelopes
and<00:00:45.960> like<00:00:46.110> going<00:00:46.410> past<00:00:46.649> what<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.010> were<00:00:47.100> exactly

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
and like going past what we were exactly

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.310 
and like going past what we were exactly
comfortable<00:00:47.969> with<00:00:48.059> whether<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.780> was<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.930> gig

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
comfortable with whether it was the gig

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.990 
comfortable with whether it was the gig
at<00:00:49.530> time<00:00:49.800> whether<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.219> was<00:00:50.309> like<00:00:50.430> traveling<00:00:50.879> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
at time whether it was like traveling to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.930 
at time whether it was like traveling to
a<00:00:51.030> foreign<00:00:51.090> country<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.809> kind<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.039> learned

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
a foreign country I kind of a learned

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.740 
a foreign country I kind of a learned
that<00:00:54.800> focusing<00:00:55.800> more<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.039> sensory<00:00:56.430> level

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
that focusing more on a sensory level

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.770 
that focusing more on a sensory level
that<00:00:57.750> being<00:00:58.620> scared<00:00:59.070> or<00:00:59.489> being<00:01:00.149> fearful<00:01:00.449> it

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
that being scared or being fearful it

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.450 
that being scared or being fearful it
was<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.020> same<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.469> felt<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> same<00:01:02.100> as<00:01:02.280> when<00:01:02.430> I

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
was the same I felt the same as when I

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.850 
was the same I felt the same as when I
was<00:01:02.609> excited<00:01:03.030> when<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.270> was<00:01:03.390> happy<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.049> when<00:01:04.830> I

was excited when I was happy and when I

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.410 
was excited when I was happy and when I
came<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> those<00:01:05.519> moments<00:01:05.760> where<00:01:06.060> maybe<00:01:06.210> my

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
came to those moments where maybe my

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.140 
came to those moments where maybe my
mind<00:01:06.659> kick<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.229> or<00:01:07.920> my<00:01:08.189> mind<00:01:08.430> continues<00:01:08.970> if

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
mind kick in or my mind continues if

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.030 
mind kick in or my mind continues if
this<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.540> happens<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:09.960> day<00:01:10.140> I'll<00:01:10.799> feel

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040

scared<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.760> feel<00:01:11.820> frightened<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.570> think<00:01:12.840> our

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
scared I feel frightened I think our

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.350 
scared I feel frightened I think our
mind<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.549> originally<00:01:14.549> was<00:01:14.909> used<00:01:15.150> for<00:01:15.240> our

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
mind is originally was used for our

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.270 
mind is originally was used for our
survival<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.049> could<00:01:16.200> protect<00:01:16.470> our<00:01:16.590> body<00:01:16.770> right

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
survival I could protect our body right

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.270 
survival I could protect our body right
but<00:01:17.850> now<00:01:18.000> that's<00:01:18.960> not<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> huge<00:01:19.770> factor<00:01:19.979> for

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
but now that's not a huge factor for

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.460 
but now that's not a huge factor for
most<00:01:20.430> people<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.759> United<00:01:21.030> States<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.470> not

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
most people in the United States is not

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.469 
most people in the United States is not
trying<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.890> survive<00:01:23.189> from<00:01:23.430> wild<00:01:23.729> animals<00:01:23.880> or

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
trying to survive from wild animals or

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.179 
trying to survive from wild animals or
anything<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.259> more<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.560> now

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
anything like that it's more that now

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.219 
anything like that it's more that now
are<00:01:26.340> being<00:01:26.520> used<00:01:26.700> by<00:01:26.850> our<00:01:26.880> minds<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.450> when<00:01:27.659> if

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
are being used by our minds so when if

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.960 
are being used by our minds so when if
it's<00:01:28.380> something<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:28.710> I'm<00:01:29.070> charging<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.759> big

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
it's something like I'm charging a big

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.399 
it's something like I'm charging a big
wave<00:01:30.150> surfing<00:01:30.479> where<00:01:30.840> I'm<00:01:30.900> gonna<00:01:30.990> go<00:01:31.110> talk<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
wave surfing where I'm gonna go talk to

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.039
