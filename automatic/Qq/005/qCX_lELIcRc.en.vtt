00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
has an ice cream consistency now you can

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.880 
has an ice cream consistency now you can
get<00:02:39.510> rid<00:02:39.569> of<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:39.720> banana<00:02:39.900> chunks<00:02:40.260> like<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.650> said

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
get rid of the banana chunks like I said

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.259 
get rid of the banana chunks like I said
by<00:02:41.069> stirring<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.519> up<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.670> little<00:02:41.760> bit<00:02:41.910> more<00:02:42.060> if

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
by stirring it up a little bit more if

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.640 
by stirring it up a little bit more if
you<00:02:42.360> want<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.569> add<00:02:42.660> some<00:02:42.930> milk<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.290> thin<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.500> out

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
you want to add some milk to thin it out

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.199 
you want to add some milk to thin it out
you<00:02:43.799> can<00:02:43.860> also<00:02:44.069> do<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.459> but<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.090> would

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
you can also do that but that would

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.910 
you can also do that but that would
defeat<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.480> purpose<00:02:45.569> of<00:02:46.019> us<00:02:46.170> having<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.709> milk

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
defeat the purpose of us having the milk

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.650 
defeat the purpose of us having the milk
free<00:02:47.099> ice<00:02:47.250> cream<00:02:47.519> wouldn't<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.879> so<00:02:48.360> this<00:02:48.510> right

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
free ice cream wouldn't it so this right

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.520 
free ice cream wouldn't it so this right
