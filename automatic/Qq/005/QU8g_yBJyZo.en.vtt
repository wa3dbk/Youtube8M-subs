00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.650 

slow<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.030> wheel<00:02:05.180> down<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.479> bit

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.880 

really<00:02:09.380> currency<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:10.070> these

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890
