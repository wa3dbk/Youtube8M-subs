00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.319 
the s for all the indicators I agree
that<00:00:29.480> it<00:00:30.480> can<00:00:30.660> be<00:00:30.779> kind<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.140> subjective<00:00:31.880> I<00:00:32.880> also

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
that it can be kind of subjective I also

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.090 
that it can be kind of subjective I also
agree<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.710> should<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.010> an

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
agree that you should have an

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.850 
agree that you should have an
opportunity<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.670> present<00:00:36.000> evidence<00:00:36.360> if<00:00:36.930> you

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
opportunity to present evidence if you

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.680 
opportunity to present evidence if you
disagree<00:00:38.309> with<00:00:38.340> your<00:00:38.550> evaluator<00:00:39.000> score<00:00:39.480> I

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
disagree with your evaluator score I

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.660 
disagree with your evaluator score I
would<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.649> say<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.190> would<00:00:41.460> also

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
would just like to say that I would also

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.580 
would just like to say that I would also
think<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.210> those<00:00:42.719> luxuries<00:00:43.290> should<00:00:43.469> be

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
think that those luxuries should be

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.799 
think that those luxuries should be
afforded<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.010> our<00:00:44.219> teachers<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:45.570> right

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
afforded to our teachers because right

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.290 
afforded to our teachers because right
now<00:00:45.920> there's<00:00:46.920> two<00:00:47.250> places<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.120> rubric

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
now there's two places on that rubric

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.450 
now there's two places on that rubric
the<00:00:48.539> two<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.870> four<00:00:49.110> there<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.129> no

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the two and the four there is no

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.060 
the two and the four there is no
specific<00:00:51.379> guidelines<00:00:52.379> for<00:00:52.620> how<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> meet

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
specific guidelines for how to meet

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.840 
specific guidelines for how to meet
those<00:00:53.100> it's<00:00:53.670> completely<00:00:54.629> subjective<00:00:54.870> our

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
those it's completely subjective our

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.979 
those it's completely subjective our
evaluations<00:00:56.850> are<00:00:57.030> subjective<00:00:57.570> based<00:00:57.809> on

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
evaluations are subjective based on

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.900 
evaluations are subjective based on
who's<00:00:58.170> evaluating<00:00:58.829> them<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.219> then<00:00:59.640> when<00:00:59.760> we

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
who's evaluating them and then when we

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.880 
who's evaluating them and then when we
do<00:01:00.059> our<00:01:00.090> scores<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.899> evaluator<00:01:01.410> comes<00:01:01.710> with

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
do our scores the evaluator comes with

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.709 
do our scores the evaluator comes with
the<00:01:02.010> score<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.399> no<00:01:02.550> matter<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:03.359> get<00:01:03.570> to

the score and no matter what we get to

the score and no matter what we get to
put<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.580> how<00:01:05.580> we've<00:01:05.790> evaluated<00:01:06.030> ourselves

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
put in as how we've evaluated ourselves

the<00:01:07.229> score<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.680> valuer<00:01:07.979> always<00:01:08.490> goes<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:09.000> was<00:01:09.810> I

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the score the valuer always goes I was I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.050 
the score the valuer always goes I was I
had<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.350> specific<00:01:10.920> situation<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.700> first<00:01:11.909> time

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
had a specific situation the first time

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.730 
had a specific situation the first time
I<00:01:12.090> was<00:01:12.299> evaluated<00:01:12.869> where<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.020> had<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.590> evidence

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
I was evaluated where I had the evidence

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.399 
I was evaluated where I had the evidence
proving<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:15.270> deserved<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.780> certain<00:01:16.080> score

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
proving that I deserved a certain score

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.910 
proving that I deserved a certain score
and<00:01:16.909> I<00:01:17.909> gave<00:01:18.390> myself<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.869> five<00:01:19.110> my<00:01:19.380> evaluation

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
and I gave myself a five my evaluation

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.320 
and I gave myself a five my evaluation
me<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> three<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.700> said<00:01:20.850> well<00:01:20.970> let's<00:01:21.150> quit

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
me a three and I said well let's quit

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.820 
me a three and I said well let's quit
the<00:01:21.479> difference<00:01:21.869> because<00:01:22.590> she<00:01:22.710> had<00:01:22.799> a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
the difference because she had a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.620 
the difference because she had a
different<00:01:23.159> interpretation<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:24.210> didn't

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
different interpretation it didn't

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.050 
different interpretation it didn't
happen<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:25.310> think<00:01:26.310> those<00:01:26.520> things<00:01:26.729> should

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
happen I think those things should

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.600 
happen I think those things should
absolutely<00:01:27.390> happen<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> think<00:01:29.189> in

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
absolutely happen for you but I think in

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.920 
absolutely happen for you but I think in
order<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.060> those<00:01:30.420> things<00:01:30.659> need<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.840> be

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
order to do so those things need to be

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.210 
order to do so those things need to be
happening<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:31.530> our<00:01:31.650> teachers<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:32.189> well

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
happening for our teachers as well

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:44.660 
happening for our teachers as well
things

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.960 

just<00:01:45.320> if<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.560> mask<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.610> for<00:01:47.759> clarity

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
just if I mask just just for clarity

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.730 
just if I mask just just for clarity
because<00:01:48.150> I<00:01:48.270> believe<00:01:49.080> I<00:01:49.200> know<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.439> answer<00:01:49.530> this

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
because I believe I know the answer this

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.260 
because I believe I know the answer this
