hi<00:00:01.319> my<00:00:01.530> name<00:00:01.680> is<00:00:01.770> John<00:00:02.040> from<00:00:02.280> Japanese<00:00:02.669> knife

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hi my name is John from Japanese knife

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.460 
hi my name is John from Japanese knife
imports<00:00:03.330> and<00:00:03.449> today<00:00:03.659> I'm<00:00:03.750> here<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.140> talk<00:00:04.290> to

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
imports and today I'm here to talk to

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.680 
imports and today I'm here to talk to
you<00:00:04.560> about<00:00:04.770> stone<00:00:05.700> surfaces<00:00:06.390> while

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
you about stone surfaces while

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.960 
you about stone surfaces while
sharpening<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.890> is<00:00:08.010> something<00:00:08.309> I<00:00:08.429> get<00:00:08.580> asked

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
sharpening this is something I get asked

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.730 
sharpening this is something I get asked
a<00:00:09.030> lot<00:00:09.059> about<00:00:09.420> when<00:00:09.870> people<00:00:10.139> come<00:00:10.290> in<00:00:10.410> here<00:00:10.559> for

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
a lot about when people come in here for

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.810 
a lot about when people come in here for
sharpening<00:00:11.099> lessons<00:00:11.490> or<00:00:11.610> when<00:00:11.730> they're

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
sharpening lessons or when they're

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.430 
sharpening lessons or when they're
asking<00:00:12.179> about<00:00:12.420> different<00:00:12.750> stones<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.259> how<00:00:13.380> to

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
asking about different stones and how to

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.410 
asking about different stones and how to
use<00:00:13.620> them<00:00:13.769> appropriately<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.059> figured

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
use them appropriately and so I figured

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.450 
use them appropriately and so I figured
that<00:00:15.450> I'd<00:00:15.660> make<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.809> video<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:17.010> explain<00:00:17.160> a

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
that I'd make a video and explain a

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.490 
that I'd make a video and explain a
little<00:00:17.670> bit<00:00:17.880> about<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.210> differences<00:00:18.690> in

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
little bit about the differences in

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.200 
little bit about the differences in
stone<00:00:19.830> surfaces<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.520> how<00:00:20.609> they<00:00:20.789> can<00:00:20.850> affect

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
stone surfaces and how they can affect

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.269 
stone surfaces and how they can affect
your<00:00:21.330> sharpening<00:00:21.689> what<00:00:22.439> do<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.560> mean<00:00:22.769> by<00:00:22.800> stone

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
your sharpening what do I mean by stone

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.759 
your sharpening what do I mean by stone
surface<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.750> what<00:00:25.109> I'm<00:00:25.199> talking<00:00:25.500> about<00:00:25.529> with

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
surface so what I'm talking about with

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.529 
surface so what I'm talking about with
stone<00:00:25.949> surface<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.670> top<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.210> stone

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
stone surface is the top of the stone

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.849 
stone surface is the top of the stone
that<00:00:27.750> you're<00:00:27.900> going<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.170> be<00:00:28.260> flattening<00:00:28.680> on

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
that you're going to be flattening on

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.009 
that you're going to be flattening on
and<00:00:29.070> when<00:00:29.939> I'm<00:00:30.029> talking<00:00:30.359> about<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
and when I'm talking about the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.749 
and when I'm talking about the
conditioning<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.650> stone<00:00:31.859> surface<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.460> mean

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
conditioning of the stone surface I mean

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.240 
conditioning of the stone surface I mean
do<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.510> use<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.079> directly<00:00:34.350> after<00:00:34.800> flattening

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
do you use it directly after flattening

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.639 
do you use it directly after flattening
when<00:00:35.969> there's<00:00:36.149> deep<00:00:36.420> gouges<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.500> you

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
when there's deep gouges in it do you

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.770 
when there's deep gouges in it do you
clean<00:00:38.190> up<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.489> surface<00:00:38.640> using<00:00:39.149> an<00:00:39.239> auger<00:00:39.390> or<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
clean up the surface using an auger or a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.139 
clean up the surface using an auger or a
small<00:00:40.050> diamond<00:00:40.260> plate<00:00:40.790> do<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.879> rub<00:00:42.120> two

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
small diamond plate do you rub two

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.700 
small diamond plate do you rub two
different<00:00:42.690> stones<00:00:42.899> together<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.440> make<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
different stones together to make the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.340 
different stones together to make the
surface<00:00:43.890> more<00:00:44.250> smooth<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.690> how<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.260> you

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
surface more smooth and how do you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.340 
surface more smooth and how do you
approach<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.710> kind<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.160> thing<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.690> so<00:00:48.690> it

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
approach that kind of thing and so it

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.290 
approach that kind of thing and so it
will<00:00:49.530> vary<00:00:49.559> between<00:00:49.980> synthetic<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.149> natural

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
will vary between synthetic and natural

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.569 
will vary between synthetic and natural
stones<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> way<00:00:52.170> things<00:00:52.230> work<00:00:52.739> as

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
stones and the way things work as

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.979 
stones and the way things work as
natural<00:00:54.090> stones<00:00:54.300> don't<00:00:54.449> really<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.780> any

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
natural stones don't really have any

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.660 
natural stones don't really have any
binder<00:00:55.440> abrasive<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:55.980> are<00:00:56.190> separate<00:00:56.520> it's

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
binder abrasive that are separate it's

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.939 
binder abrasive that are separate it's
all<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.210> mishmash<00:00:57.780> together<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.649> they're<00:00:58.739> kind

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
all a mishmash together and they're kind

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.979 
all a mishmash together and they're kind
of<00:00:58.980> one<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.340> same<00:00:59.579> but<00:01:00.210> synthetic<00:01:00.570> stones

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
of one of the same but synthetic stones

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.439 
of one of the same but synthetic stones
have<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> binding<00:01:01.710> agent<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.190> abrasive<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.940> so

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
have a binding agent and abrasive and so

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.060 
have a binding agent and abrasive and so
the<00:01:03.570> way<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.199> stone<00:01:04.409> surface<00:01:04.830> works

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
the way that the stone surface works

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.320 
the way that the stone surface works
will<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.400> little<00:01:05.670> bit<00:01:05.790> different<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.240> so

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
will be a little bit different and so

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.640 
will be a little bit different and so
first<00:01:06.570> I'm<00:01:06.750> gonna<00:01:06.869> start<00:01:06.960> with<00:01:07.170> synthetic

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
first I'm gonna start with synthetic

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.899 
first I'm gonna start with synthetic
stones<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.070> I'm<00:01:08.130> gonna<00:01:08.280> move<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
stones and I'm gonna move on to the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.420 
stones and I'm gonna move on to the
natural<00:01:09.270> stones<00:01:09.830> later<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.100> video

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
natural stones later in this video

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.690 
natural stones later in this video
so<00:01:12.240> with<00:01:12.689> synthetic<00:01:13.229> stones<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
so with synthetic stones one of the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.670 
so with synthetic stones one of the
things<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.119> you'll<00:01:15.270> notice<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.930> when

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
things that you'll notice is that when

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.010 
things that you'll notice is that when
you<00:01:16.799> flatten<00:01:17.159> your<00:01:17.369> stone<00:01:17.670> using<00:01:18.360> for<00:01:18.689> example

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
you flatten your stone using for example

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.359 
you flatten your stone using for example
a<00:01:19.049> diamond<00:01:19.380> flattening<00:01:19.740> plate<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.130> really

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
a diamond flattening plate but really

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.999 
a diamond flattening plate but really
any<00:01:20.549> kind<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.850> coarse<00:01:21.090> flattening<00:01:21.479> device<00:01:22.009> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
any kind of coarse flattening device the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.890 
any kind of coarse flattening device the
flattening<00:01:23.460> device<00:01:23.790> leaves<00:01:24.060> deep<00:01:24.509> scratches

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
flattening device leaves deep scratches

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.420 
flattening device leaves deep scratches
in<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.259> surface<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.799> stone<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.040> lot<00:01:26.310> of

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
in the surface of the stone a lot of

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.679 
in the surface of the stone a lot of
people<00:01:26.670> are<00:01:26.759> scared<00:01:27.090> by<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.630> they

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
people are scared by this and they

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.600 
people are scared by this and they
wonder<00:01:28.020> well<00:01:28.530> what's<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.920> gonna<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:29.369> how<00:01:29.549> is

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
wonder well what's this gonna do how is

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.390 
wonder well what's this gonna do how is
it<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.030> affect<00:01:30.119> my<00:01:30.750> sharpening<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.470> so

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
it going to affect my sharpening and so

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.240 
it going to affect my sharpening and so
here's<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.270> answer<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:34.650> deeper<00:01:35.040> scratches

on your stone will create better tactile
feedback<00:01:38.369> help<00:01:39.240> your<00:01:39.420> stone<00:01:39.689> cut<00:01:40.049> more

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
feedback help your stone cut more

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.280 
feedback help your stone cut more
quickly<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.100> help<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.150> rinse<00:01:42.420> away<00:01:42.600> swarf<00:01:43.110> a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
quickly and help it rinse away swarf a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.080 
quickly and help it rinse away swarf a
little<00:01:43.560> bit<00:01:43.680> more<00:01:43.829> easily<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.280> swarf<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
little bit more easily and swarf is the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.510 
little bit more easily and swarf is the
mixture<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.479> metal<00:01:45.810> that's<00:01:46.770> being<00:01:47.070> abraded

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
mixture of metal that's being abraded

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.840 
mixture of metal that's being abraded
away<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.210> stone<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:50.009> downside<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.820> that

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
away and the stone the downside is that

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.359 
away and the stone the downside is that
it<00:01:51.240> also<00:01:51.420> reduces<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.409> level<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.799> polish<00:01:53.340> that

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
it also reduces the level of polish that

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.209 
it also reduces the level of polish that
you<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:53.970> from<00:01:54.420> your<00:01:54.600> stone<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.649> it's<00:01:55.829> it's<00:01:56.100> a

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
you get from your stone so it's it's a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.999 
you get from your stone so it's it's a
little<00:01:56.460> bit<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.729> trade<00:01:57.000> off<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.799> when<00:01:58.799> you're

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
little bit of a trade off so when you're

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.590 
little bit of a trade off so when you're
thinking<00:01:59.040> about<00:01:59.700> how<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.850> want<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.149> condition

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
thinking about how you want to condition

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.120 
thinking about how you want to condition
your<00:02:00.719> stone<00:02:00.960> surface<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.619> have<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.860> figure

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
your stone surface you have to figure

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.490 
your stone surface you have to figure
out<00:02:02.159> what's<00:02:02.579> important<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.570> also<00:02:04.259> you

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
out what's important to you and also you

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.139 
out what's important to you and also you
can<00:02:04.740> use<00:02:04.920> your<00:02:05.130> stone<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.369> variety<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.850> ways<00:02:06.030> so

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
can use your stone a variety of ways so

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.429 
can use your stone a variety of ways so
you<00:02:06.240> may<00:02:06.360> start<00:02:06.420> out<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.079> with<00:02:07.229> deep

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
you may start out with it with deep

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.199 
you may start out with it with deep
scratches<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.160> then<00:02:08.280> refine<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:08.970> try<00:02:09.179> and

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
scratches and then refine it and try and

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.790 
scratches and then refine it and try and
push<00:02:09.479> up<00:02:09.660> your<00:02:09.780> level<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.110> refinement<00:02:10.379> out<00:02:10.709> of

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
push up your level of refinement out of

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.180 
push up your level of refinement out of
that

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
that

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.880 
that
the<00:02:12.000> reason<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.810> stone<00:02:13.080> surface<00:02:13.620> works

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the reason that the stone surface works

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.380 
the reason that the stone surface works
this<00:02:14.100> way<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.850> deep<00:02:15.060> scratches

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
this way is that the deep scratches

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.070 
this way is that the deep scratches
create<00:02:15.960> valleys<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:17.640> on<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.420> stone<00:02:18.630> surface

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
create valleys in on the stone surface

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.410 
create valleys in on the stone surface
and<00:02:19.320> at<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.160> tops<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.550> those<00:02:20.640> valleys<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.150> see

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
and at the tops of those valleys you see

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.820 
and at the tops of those valleys you see
little<00:02:21.690> ridges<00:02:22.050> where<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.380> top<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.710> your

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
little ridges where the top of your

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.520 
little ridges where the top of your
stone<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.840> when<00:02:24.840> you're<00:02:25.020> sharpening

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
stone is and when you're sharpening

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.230 
stone is and when you're sharpening
those<00:02:25.800> areas<00:02:26.220> are<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.430> little<00:02:26.610> bit<00:02:26.820> weaker<00:02:27.120> and

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
those areas are a little bit weaker and

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.790 
those areas are a little bit weaker and
so<00:02:27.390> they<00:02:27.540> break<00:02:27.930> off<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.170> little<00:02:28.410> bit<00:02:28.740> more

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
so they break off a little bit more

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.650 
so they break off a little bit more
easily<00:02:30.950> creating<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.220> more<00:02:32.730> aggressive

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
easily creating a more aggressive

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.330 
easily creating a more aggressive
I<00:02:33.890> guess<00:02:34.890> grinding<00:02:36.110> surface<00:02:37.110> as<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.710> get<00:02:38.040> more

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
I guess grinding surface as you get more

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.060 
I guess grinding surface as you get more
abrasive<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:39.210> there<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.320> abrasive<00:02:40.800> fresh

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
abrasive in there and the abrasive fresh

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.190 
abrasive in there and the abrasive fresh
abrasive<00:02:41.520> is<00:02:41.610> released<00:02:41.940> more<00:02:42.180> easily<00:02:42.540> you

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
abrasive is released more easily you

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.690 
abrasive is released more easily you
also<00:02:43.320> get<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.590> little<00:02:43.830> bit<00:02:43.920> more<00:02:44.070> surface<00:02:44.340> area

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
also get a little bit more surface area

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.880 
also get a little bit more surface area
out<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.690> stone<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:45.930> way<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.530> again

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
out of the stone that way and so again

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.680 
out of the stone that way and so again
more<00:02:47.160> abrasive<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:47.850> released<00:02:48.180> more<00:02:48.420> easily

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
more abrasive is released more easily

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.910 
more abrasive is released more easily
and<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.870> more<00:02:49.020> abrasive<00:02:49.470> that<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.710> have<00:02:49.830> in

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
and the more abrasive that you have in

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.380 
and the more abrasive that you have in
your<00:02:50.010> mix<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.490> quicker<00:02:50.700> your<00:02:50.880> stone<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.120> going

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
your mix the quicker your stone is going

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.900 
your mix the quicker your stone is going
to<00:02:51.480> cut<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.110> also<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.010> texture<00:02:53.460> of<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.670> stone

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
to cut and also the texture of the stone

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.670 
to cut and also the texture of the stone
when<00:02:54.600> it<00:02:54.720> has<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.050> scratches<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.590> will

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
when it has the scratches and it will

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.350 
when it has the scratches and it will
help<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:55.920> get<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.280> extra<00:02:56.580> kind<00:02:56.850> of<00:02:56.940> tactile

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
help you get that extra kind of tactile

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
tactile sensation as you're sharpening

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.110 
tactile sensation as you're sharpening
that<00:03:01.710> tells<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.160> what's<00:03:02.400> going<00:03:02.730> on<00:03:02.820> in<00:03:03.000> your

may be a good idea to clean up your

may be a good idea to clean up your

a negara or a diamond plate that's a

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.520 
a negara or a diamond plate that's a
higher<00:03:28.800> great<00:03:29.100> thing<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.940> reduces<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:31.110> size

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
higher great thing it reduces the size

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.770 
higher great thing it reduces the size
and<00:03:31.920> number<00:03:32.100> of<00:03:32.370> those<00:03:32.580> those<00:03:33.030> deep<00:03:33.330> valleys

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
and number of those those deep valleys

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.199 
and number of those those deep valleys
those<00:03:34.020> deep<00:03:34.200> gouges<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.700> way<00:03:35.940> then

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
those deep gouges and that way then

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.660 
those deep gouges and that way then
you're<00:03:36.990> not<00:03:37.170> releasing<00:03:37.620> abrasive<00:03:38.280> as<00:03:38.430> quickly

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
you're not releasing abrasive as quickly

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.449 
you're not releasing abrasive as quickly
and<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:38.940> gives<00:03:39.120> things<00:03:39.300> a<00:03:39.510> chance<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:40.020> kind<00:03:40.230> of

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
and it gives things a chance to kind of

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.920 
and it gives things a chance to kind of
break<00:03:41.459> down<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.880> also<00:03:42.030> makes<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.540> the

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
break down and also makes the the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.410 
break down and also makes the the
binding<00:03:43.380> agent<00:03:43.470> more<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.310> part<00:03:44.640> of<00:03:44.760> your

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
binding agent more a part of your

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.970 
binding agent more a part of your
sharpening<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.050> so<00:03:46.200> what<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:46.470> can<00:03:46.620> get<00:03:46.800> is<00:03:46.950> a

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
sharpening and so what you can get is a

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.380 
sharpening and so what you can get is a
little<00:03:47.190> bit<00:03:47.280> better<00:03:47.400> refinement<00:03:48.000> out<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.209> your

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
little bit better refinement out of your

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.440 
little bit better refinement out of your
stone<00:03:48.600> that<00:03:48.810> way<00:03:49.340> my<00:03:50.340> personal<00:03:50.880> preference<00:03:51.270> is

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
stone that way my personal preference is

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.680 
stone that way my personal preference is
to<00:03:51.930> leave<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.770> stones<00:03:52.980> with<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.690> deeper

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
to leave the stones with the deeper

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.590 
to leave the stones with the deeper
gouges<00:03:55.050> from<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.290> flattening<00:03:55.709> as<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:57.150> can<00:03:57.420> move

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
gouges from the flattening as I can move

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.449 
gouges from the flattening as I can move
up<00:03:57.780> in<00:03:57.900> refinement<00:03:58.260> as<00:03:58.560> necessary<00:03:59.100> but<00:03:59.280> again

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
up in refinement as necessary but again

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.580 
up in refinement as necessary but again
for<00:03:59.640> kitchen<00:03:59.970> knives<00:04:00.150> being<00:04:00.840> super<00:04:01.440> super

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
for kitchen knives being super super

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.800 
for kitchen knives being super super
refined<00:04:02.040> is<00:04:02.310> not<00:04:02.459> necessarily<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.570> best

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
refined is not necessarily the best

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.390 
refined is not necessarily the best
thing<00:04:03.989> for<00:04:04.140> you<00:04:04.500> still<00:04:04.800> want<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.010> retain<00:04:05.220> that

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
thing for you still want to retain that

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.890 
thing for you still want to retain that
kind<00:04:05.580> of<00:04:05.640> bite<00:04:05.820> and<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.120> can<00:04:06.300> do<00:04:06.450> that<00:04:06.600> a

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
kind of bite and so you can do that a

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.479 
kind of bite and so you can do that a
little<00:04:07.440> bit<00:04:07.530> more<00:04:07.650> easily<00:04:07.920> by<00:04:08.070> leaving<00:04:08.400> those

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
little bit more easily by leaving those

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.100 
little bit more easily by leaving those
deeper<00:04:08.820> gouges<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.209> then<00:04:09.540> again<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:09.840> get<00:04:10.080> the

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
deeper gouges and then again I get the

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.380 
deeper gouges and then again I get the
faster<00:04:10.620> cutting<00:04:10.950> speed<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.459> better<00:04:11.940> tactile

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
faster cutting speed and better tactile

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.810 
faster cutting speed and better tactile
feedback<00:04:12.660> out<00:04:12.989> of<00:04:13.080> my<00:04:13.170> stones<00:04:13.440> with<00:04:14.340> natural

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
feedback out of my stones with natural

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.550 
feedback out of my stones with natural
stones<00:04:15.090> it's<00:04:15.270> a<00:04:15.360> little<00:04:15.570> bit<00:04:15.690> different<00:04:16.109> with

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
stones it's a little bit different with

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.830 
stones it's a little bit different with
natural<00:04:16.980> stones<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:18.030> way<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.359> they<00:04:18.480> work<00:04:18.660> is

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
natural stones the way that they work is

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.510 
natural stones the way that they work is
that<00:04:19.080> as<00:04:19.200> you<00:04:19.410> sharpen<00:04:19.859> you<00:04:19.979> start<00:04:20.250> off<00:04:20.340> with<00:04:20.489> a

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
that as you sharpen you start off with a

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.610 
that as you sharpen you start off with a
little<00:04:20.729> bit<00:04:20.910> harder<00:04:21.270> pressure<00:04:21.539> and<00:04:21.840> then<00:04:22.350> work

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
little bit harder pressure and then work

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.840 
little bit harder pressure and then work
to<00:04:22.800> lighter<00:04:23.010> pressure<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.460> you're<00:04:23.550> trying<00:04:23.789> to

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
to lighter pressure and you're trying to

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.560 
to lighter pressure and you're trying to
create

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
create

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.950 
create
mud<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:25.080> then<00:04:25.590> refine<00:04:26.040> the<00:04:26.220> mud<00:04:26.400> and<00:04:26.670> so<00:04:27.570> when

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
mud and then refine the mud and so when

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.670 
mud and then refine the mud and so when
you<00:04:28.050> have<00:04:28.230> those<00:04:28.470> deeper<00:04:28.950> valleys<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.180> gouges

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
you have those deeper valleys and gouges

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.050 
you have those deeper valleys and gouges
frescia<00:04:31.680> bracelet<00:04:32.160> is<00:04:32.280> being<00:04:32.490> released<00:04:32.850> but

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
frescia bracelet is being released but

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.340 
frescia bracelet is being released but
you<00:04:33.210> don't<00:04:33.360> necessarily<00:04:33.480> want<00:04:33.930> fresh

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
you don't necessarily want fresh

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.320 
you don't necessarily want fresh
abrasive<00:04:34.860> you<00:04:34.890> want<00:04:35.220> to<00:04:35.310> release<00:04:35.760> abrasive<00:04:36.240> in

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
abrasive you want to release abrasive in

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.940 
abrasive you want to release abrasive in
the<00:04:36.390> beginning<00:04:36.660> and<00:04:36.930> then<00:04:37.410> lighten<00:04:37.770> up<00:04:37.830> your

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
the beginning and then lighten up your

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.350 
the beginning and then lighten up your
pressure<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:38.310> spend<00:04:38.640> time<00:04:38.820> working<00:04:39.090> it<00:04:39.330> down

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
pressure and spend time working it down

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.930 
pressure and spend time working it down
so<00:04:40.200> with<00:04:40.320> natural<00:04:40.740> stones<00:04:41.010> you<00:04:41.340> never<00:04:41.610> want<00:04:41.880> to

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
so with natural stones you never want to

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.570 
so with natural stones you never want to
leave<00:04:42.180> deep<00:04:42.630> flattening<00:04:43.470> scratches<00:04:44.280> in<00:04:44.400> there

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
leave deep flattening scratches in there

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.880 
leave deep flattening scratches in there
and<00:04:44.790> in<00:04:45.090> fact<00:04:45.270> often<00:04:45.540> times<00:04:45.870> you<00:04:46.080> really<00:04:46.320> want

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
and in fact often times you really want

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.200 
and in fact often times you really want
to<00:04:46.950> try<00:04:47.130> and<00:04:47.160> flatten<00:04:47.460> your<00:04:47.640> stone<00:04:47.880> as<00:04:48.060> you

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
to try and flatten your stone as you

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.940 
to try and flatten your stone as you
sharpen<00:04:48.630> by<00:04:48.780> using<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.290> entire<00:04:49.530> stone

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
sharpen by using the entire stone

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.470 
sharpen by using the entire stone

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
surface a little bit more evenly so when

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.970 
surface a little bit more evenly so when
you<00:04:51.540> see<00:04:51.690> high<00:04:51.900> spots<00:04:52.260> you<00:04:52.410> sharpen<00:04:52.740> on<00:04:52.830> them

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
you see high spots you sharpen on them

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.490 
you see high spots you sharpen on them
and<00:04:53.250> so<00:04:53.640> on<00:04:53.820> but<00:04:54.690> if<00:04:54.810> you<00:04:54.930> do<00:04:55.050> need<00:04:55.170> to<00:04:55.230> flatten

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
and so on but if you do need to flatten

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.260 
and so on but if you do need to flatten
your<00:04:55.710> stone<00:04:55.920> I<00:04:56.100> highly<00:04:56.490> recommend<00:04:56.940> that<00:04:57.090> you

refine the surface of this stone the

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.700 
refine the surface of this stone the
cleaner<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.270> surface<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:16.320> better<00:05:16.530> your

cleaner the surface the better your

cleaner the surface the better your
natural<00:05:17.100> stone<00:05:17.340> will<00:05:17.460> work<00:05:17.610> for<00:05:17.820> you<00:05:17.880> is<00:05:18.000> it

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
natural stone will work for you is it

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.210 
natural stone will work for you is it
gives<00:05:18.270> you<00:05:18.390> a<00:05:18.420> nice<00:05:18.690> surface<00:05:18.990> on<00:05:19.320> which<00:05:19.500> to<00:05:19.740> to

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
gives you a nice surface on which to to

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.090 
gives you a nice surface on which to to
refine<00:05:20.670> that<00:05:20.970> grit<00:05:21.210> and<00:05:21.330> help<00:05:21.510> it<00:05:21.630> break<00:05:21.840> down

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
refine that grit and help it break down

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.350 
refine that grit and help it break down
the<00:05:23.100> the<00:05:23.340> main<00:05:23.550> reason<00:05:23.940> that<00:05:23.970> this<00:05:24.210> is

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
the the main reason that this is

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.880 
the the main reason that this is
important<00:05:24.780> is<00:05:24.870> because<00:05:24.900> with<00:05:25.410> synthetic

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
important is because with synthetic

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.590 
important is because with synthetic
abrasives<00:05:26.430> they're<00:05:26.670> not<00:05:26.850> friable<00:05:27.300> they<00:05:27.420> don't

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
abrasives they're not friable they don't

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.180 
abrasives they're not friable they don't
break<00:05:27.870> down<00:05:27.930> they<00:05:28.290> don't<00:05:28.440> get<00:05:28.590> finer<00:05:28.860> but<00:05:29.100> with

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
break down they don't get finer but with

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.880 
break down they don't get finer but with
natural<00:05:29.580> abrasives<00:05:30.060> they<00:05:30.270> do<00:05:30.330> and<00:05:30.870> so<00:05:31.410> that's

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
natural abrasives they do and so that's

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.620 
natural abrasives they do and so that's
one<00:05:32.130> of<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:32.310> ways<00:05:32.460> that<00:05:32.520> you<00:05:32.880> get<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:33.390> best

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
one of the ways that you get the best

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.450 
one of the ways that you get the best
out<00:05:33.810> of<00:05:33.840> your<00:05:34.020> stone<00:05:34.230> is<00:05:34.260> by<00:05:34.560> working<00:05:35.100> down<00:05:35.280> the

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
out of your stone is by working down the

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.980 
out of your stone is by working down the
abrasive<00:05:35.910> and<00:05:36.060> making<00:05:36.360> it<00:05:36.420> finer<00:05:36.690> and<00:05:36.960> finer

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
abrasive and making it finer and finer

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.380 
abrasive and making it finer and finer
as<00:05:37.380> you<00:05:37.530> go<00:05:37.740> and<00:05:38.010> so<00:05:38.460> it's<00:05:38.580> a<00:05:38.640> function<00:05:39.030> of<00:05:39.120> time

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
as you go and so it's a function of time

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.820 
as you go and so it's a function of time
and<00:05:39.630> it's<00:05:39.720> a<00:05:39.810> function<00:05:40.020> of<00:05:40.230> pressure<00:05:40.440> and<00:05:40.650> it's

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
and it's a function of pressure and it's

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.100 
and it's a function of pressure and it's
a<00:05:40.920> function<00:05:41.100> of<00:05:41.340> stone<00:05:41.610> hardness<00:05:42.120> but<00:05:42.780> more

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
a function of stone hardness but more

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.420 
a function of stone hardness but more
than<00:05:43.230> anything<00:05:43.470> it's<00:05:43.740> a<00:05:43.830> function<00:05:44.160> of<00:05:44.220> your

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
than anything it's a function of your

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.310 
than anything it's a function of your
ability<00:05:44.820> to<00:05:44.850> condition<00:05:45.450> the<00:05:45.600> stone<00:05:45.840> surface

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
ability to condition the stone surface

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.620 
ability to condition the stone surface
to<00:05:47.070> be<00:05:47.220> appropriate<00:05:47.700> for<00:05:47.730> natural<00:05:48.210> stone<00:05:48.420> use

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
to be appropriate for natural stone use

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.480 
to be appropriate for natural stone use
