00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
them another good thing to know is that

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.110 
them another good thing to know is that
when<00:00:55.590> you're<00:00:55.800> playing<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.730> lot<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.000> these

when you're playing a lot of these

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.840 
when you're playing a lot of these
players<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.770> not<00:00:59.070> always<00:00:59.280> best<00:00:59.670> to

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
players that it's not always best to

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.639 
players that it's not always best to
strike<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.480> them<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.140> can<00:01:01.260> see<00:01:01.410> how<00:01:01.559> I'm

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
don't want to do because you get into

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.560 
don't want to do because you get into
like<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> coin<00:01:22.680> flip<00:01:22.890> where<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.670> any<00:01:23.909> point<00:01:24.240> one

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
like a coin flip where at any point one

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.990 
like a coin flip where at any point one
person<00:01:24.990> could<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.290> rocked<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.100> not<00:01:26.400> too

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
person could get rocked so it's not too

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.300 
person could get rocked so it's not too
much<00:01:27.479> base<00:01:27.930> around<00:01:28.170> skill<00:01:29.570> but<00:01:30.920> here<00:01:31.920> where

going for the trademark Jon Jones elbows

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.440 
going for the trademark Jon Jones elbows
here<00:01:41.369> trying<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.360> knock<00:01:42.720> him<00:01:42.750> out<00:01:44.299> as<00:01:45.299> you

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
here trying to just knock him out as you

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.600 
here trying to just knock him out as you
can<00:01:45.570> see<00:01:45.720> there<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.170> nice<00:01:46.530> fake<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.490> what

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
can see there I do a nice fake and what

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.090 
can see there I do a nice fake and what
I<00:01:47.640> actually<00:01:47.820> did<00:01:48.210> there<00:01:48.450> was<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.920> fainted<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
I actually did there was I fainted the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.399 
I actually did there was I fainted the
strike<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> ground<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.630> look<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.290> I

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
strike on the ground so I look like I

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.560 
strike on the ground so I look like I
was<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.619> faked<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.340> was<00:01:53.670> going<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.850> elbow<00:01:54.149> then<00:01:54.509> I

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
was I faked I was going to elbow then I

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.980 
was I faked I was going to elbow then I
came<00:01:54.630> back<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.229> elbowed<00:01:55.439> him<00:01:55.829> again<00:01:56.990> that's

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
came back and I elbowed him again that's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.870 
came back and I elbowed him again that's
a<00:01:58.290> technique<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.310> really<00:01:59.729> useful

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
a technique that is really useful

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.910 
a technique that is really useful
against<00:02:00.390> top<00:02:00.570> players<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.259> lot<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.770> people

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
against top players a lot of people

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.530 
against top players a lot of people
aren't<00:02:02.159> used<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.490> seeing<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.299> when<00:02:03.420> they

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
aren't used to seeing that so when they

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.990 
aren't used to seeing that so when they
see<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.840> come<00:02:04.079> up<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.290> elbow<00:02:04.770> they<00:02:04.979> they<00:02:05.640> look

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
see you come up to elbow they they look

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.580 
see you come up to elbow they they look
to<00:02:06.149> block<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.600> transition<00:02:07.049> right<00:02:07.170> after<00:02:07.500> it

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
to block and transition right after it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.229 
to block and transition right after it
so<00:02:07.710> if<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.890> fake<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.550> then<00:02:09.000> come<00:02:09.209> down

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
so if you fake it and then come down

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.940 
so if you fake it and then come down
