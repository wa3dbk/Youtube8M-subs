you've ever gone into a corner too hot
on<00:02:15.170> one<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.069> these<00:02:16.190> old<00:02:16.489> r<00:02:16.850> well<00:02:17.450> that's<00:02:17.690> last

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
on one of these old r well that's last

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.740 
on one of these old r well that's last
wives<00:02:18.290> or<00:02:18.530> slot<00:02:18.830> sixes<00:02:19.459> they<00:02:20.060> really<00:02:20.239> start<00:02:20.600> to

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
wives or slot sixes they really start to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.570 
wives or slot sixes they really start to
flex<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.410> start<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.739> wallow<00:02:22.040> through<00:02:22.190> the

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
flex and you start to wallow through the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.020 
flex and you start to wallow through the
corners<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.920> so<00:02:24.920> we're<00:02:25.040> going<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.250> stiffen<00:02:25.940> up

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
corners and so we're going to stiffen up

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.410 
corners and so we're going to stiffen up
the<00:02:26.209> frame<00:02:26.560> as<00:02:27.560> well<00:02:27.680> as<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.940> swing<00:02:29.239> arm

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
the frame as well as the the swing arm

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.390 
the frame as well as the the swing arm
and<00:02:29.720> that's<00:02:30.620> going<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.800> take<00:02:30.890> all<00:02:31.220> that

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
and that's going to take all that

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.759 
and that's going to take all that
wallowing<00:02:31.940> out<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.300> she'll<00:02:32.630> really<00:02:32.870> steer

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
wallowing out and she'll really steer

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.180 
wallowing out and she'll really steer
real<00:02:34.069> precise<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.800> it's<00:02:36.800> still<00:02:37.010> that

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
real precise and and it's still that

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.800 
real precise and and it's still that
much<00:02:37.400> more<00:02:37.610> confidence<00:02:38.209> in<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.569> know<00:02:38.630> when

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
much more confidence in you know when

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.610 
much more confidence in you know when
you're<00:02:38.989> when<00:02:39.319> you're<00:02:39.410> taking<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.830> corner<00:02:40.250> I

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
you're when you're taking a corner I

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.680 
you're when you're taking a corner I
guess<00:02:42.620> Aaron's<00:02:43.280> offset<00:02:43.730> here<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:44.000> go<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:44.420> he's

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
guess Aaron's offset here to go so he's

00:02:44.690 --> 00:03:35.710 
guess Aaron's offset here to go so he's
going<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.900> make<00:02:45.050> some<00:02:45.200> sparks
