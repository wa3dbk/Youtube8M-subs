00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.500 

okay<00:00:01.979> lab<00:00:02.190> number<00:00:02.490> three<00:00:02.700> now<00:00:02.850> we're<00:00:03.330> ready

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
okay lab number three now we're ready

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.990 
okay lab number three now we're ready
for<00:00:03.600> that<00:00:03.750> we're<00:00:04.140> going<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.470> calibrate<00:00:05.190> for

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
for that we're going to calibrate for

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.020 
for that we're going to calibrate for
distance<00:00:06.629> using<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.740> iOW<00:00:08.130> block<00:00:08.460> okay

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
distance using the iOW block okay

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.860 
distance using the iOW block okay
there's<00:00:09.780> our<00:00:09.960> iaw<00:00:10.559> block<00:00:10.800> just<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:11.580> you

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
there's our iaw block just so you

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.150 
there's our iaw block just so you
believe<00:00:12.870> me<00:00:13.200> what<00:00:13.410> I'm<00:00:13.530> telling<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:13.920> there

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
believe me what I'm telling you there

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.070 
believe me what I'm telling you there
then<00:00:15.059> we're<00:00:15.179> going<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.360> use<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:15.780> shear<00:00:16.049> wave

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
then we're going to use this shear wave

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.900 
then we're going to use this shear wave
transducer<00:00:16.890> right<00:00:17.100> here<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> 70<00:00:19.350> degree

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
transducer right here it is a 70 degree

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.230 
transducer right here it is a 70 degree
shear<00:00:20.910> wave<00:00:21.090> transducer<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.960> took<00:00:22.859> the

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
shear wave transducer I took the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.370 
shear wave transducer I took the
transducer<00:00:24.240> out<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.660> want<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.050> put<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> little

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
transducer out I want to put a little

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.230 
transducer out I want to put a little
coupling<00:00:25.830> between<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.310> transducer<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
coupling between the transducer and the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.799 
coupling between the transducer and the
wedge<00:00:28.849> come<00:00:29.849> back<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.119> our<00:00:30.179> screen<00:00:30.539> here

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.440 

here's<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.989> wedge<00:00:34.610> here's<00:00:35.610> our<00:00:35.790> transducer

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
here's the wedge here's our transducer

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.180 
here's the wedge here's our transducer
instead<00:00:37.230> I'll<00:00:37.320> put<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> little<00:00:37.680> couple<00:00:38.070> between

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
instead I'll put a little couple between

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.670 
instead I'll put a little couple between
the<00:00:38.520> two<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.750> I'm<00:00:39.809> going<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:39.989> take<00:00:40.170> my<00:00:40.320> bottle

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
the two so I'm going to take my bottle

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.630 
the two so I'm going to take my bottle
cup<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.430> drop<00:00:41.760> don't<00:00:42.480> need<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.750> lot

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
cup on just a drop don't need a lot

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
cup on just a drop don't need a lot
okay<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:44.700> just<00:00:44.850> put<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> little<00:00:45.180> drop<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.450> couple

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
okay so just put a little drop a couple

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.590 
okay so just put a little drop a couple
up<00:00:45.870> there<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.760> that's<00:00:47.760> just<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.090> couple<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
up there and that's just a couple the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.229 
up there and that's just a couple the
transducer<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:50.250> wedge<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.120> it

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
transducer to the wedge and you see it

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.520 
transducer to the wedge and you see it
squeezed<00:00:51.600> out<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.780> little<00:00:51.960> coupling<00:00:52.379> right

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
squeezed out a little coupling right

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.600 
squeezed out a little coupling right
there<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.760> get<00:00:53.940> rid<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:55.399> we're<00:00:56.399> going

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
there so get rid of that and we're going

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.950 
there so get rid of that and we're going
to<00:00:57.059> go<00:00:57.570> step<00:00:57.809> by<00:00:57.870> step<00:00:59.359> and<00:01:00.359> I'm<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.690> back

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
to go step by step and I'm going to back

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.070 
to go step by step and I'm going to back
out<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.520> actually<00:01:02.699> see<00:01:03.149> what's<00:01:03.989> going

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
out so you can actually see what's going

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.340 
out so you can actually see what's going
on<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.439> want<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> kind<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.920> back<00:01:05.100> off<00:01:06.229> to<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
on I want to kind of back off to the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.830 
on I want to kind of back off to the
side<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> little<00:01:07.950> bit<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.540> you<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.600> actually

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
side a little bit so you can actually

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.660 
side a little bit so you can actually
see<00:01:10.200> what's<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.549> make

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
see what's going on it's going to make

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.719 
see what's going on it's going to make
it<00:01:11.790> kind<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.030> difficult<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.540> see<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.840> screen

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
it kind of difficult to see the screen

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:21.080 
it kind of difficult to see the screen
but<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.060> think<00:01:16.369> to<00:01:17.369> manage<00:01:17.790> all<00:01:18.600> right<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:20.090> part

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
but I think to manage all right so part

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.440 
but I think to manage all right so part
number<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.630> step<00:01:22.049> one<00:01:22.350> says<00:01:22.650> verify<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:24.210> beam

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
number one step one says verify the beam

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.940 
number one step one says verify the beam
exit<00:01:24.900> point<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.409> need<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.619> couple<00:01:25.740> our

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
exit point so we need a couple our

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.999 
exit point so we need a couple our
transducer<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.700> probe<00:01:27.590> sorry<00:01:28.590> couple<00:01:28.920> our

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
transducer to the probe sorry couple our

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.249 
transducer to the probe sorry couple our
transducer<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> scope<00:01:30.210> I'm<00:01:30.930> not<00:01:31.049> going<00:01:31.200> to

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
transducer to the scope I'm not going to

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.780 
transducer to the scope I'm not going to
do<00:01:31.350> any<00:01:31.500> couple<00:01:31.890> couple<00:01:32.280> up<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> probe

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
do any couple couple up to the probe

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.510 
do any couple couple up to the probe
that's<00:01:32.939> not<00:01:33.150> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.299> do<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.509> good<00:01:34.520> that's

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
that's not going to do is good that's

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.469 
that's not going to do is good that's
what<00:01:35.640> happens<00:01:35.939> when<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.119> get<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.390> these

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
what happens when you get on these

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.620 
what happens when you get on these
videos<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.049> guess<00:01:37.110> your<00:01:37.439> mind<00:01:37.770> quits<00:01:38.040> working

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
videos I guess your mind quits working

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.889 
videos I guess your mind quits working
or<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:40.259> quit<00:01:40.530> working<00:01:40.829> long<00:01:41.009> ago<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:41.549> I

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
or it's quit working long ago but I

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.870 
or it's quit working long ago but I
managed<00:01:42.899> all<00:01:43.140> right<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.610> there's<00:01:44.759> a

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
managed all right so there's a

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.260 
managed all right so there's a
transducer<00:01:45.240> hooked<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.810> scope<00:01:46.409> now<00:01:47.270> we're

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
transducer hooked to the scope now we're

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.510 
transducer hooked to the scope now we're
going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.450> go<00:01:48.540> back<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.869> our<00:01:48.960> base<00:01:49.229> menu<00:01:49.829> which

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
going to go back to our base menu which

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.200 
going to go back to our base menu which
you<00:01:50.670> can't<00:01:50.909> really<00:01:51.060> see<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.509> now<00:01:51.750> base<00:01:52.619> menu

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
you can't really see that now base menu

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.639 
you can't really see that now base menu
range<00:01:54.210> we're<00:01:54.689> going<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.869> run<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.170> range<00:01:55.439> out

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
range we're going to run this range out

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.340 
range we're going to run this range out
to<00:01:55.770> 10<00:01:56.040> inches<00:01:56.630> I'm<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> run<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.079> out<00:01:58.170> to

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
to 10 inches I'm going to run it out to

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.520 
to 10 inches I'm going to run it out to
10

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.709 

quicker<00:02:04.530> way<00:02:04.969> alright<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.119> there<00:02:06.299> weren't<00:02:06.479> ten

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
quicker way alright so there weren't ten

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.160 
quicker way alright so there weren't ten
now<00:02:07.469> since<00:02:07.710> we're<00:02:07.859> switching<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.369> shear-wave

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
now since we're switching to shear-wave

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.350 
now since we're switching to shear-wave
we're<00:02:10.170> going<00:02:10.530> half<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.670> longitudinal

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
we're going half the longitudinal

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.119 
we're going half the longitudinal
velocity<00:02:12.980> okay

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
velocity okay

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.380 
velocity okay
delays<00:02:14.430> we're<00:02:14.610> going<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.790> leave<00:02:14.910> alone<00:02:15.030> for

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
delays we're going to leave alone for

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.729 
delays we're going to leave alone for
now<00:02:15.590> we<00:02:16.590> have<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:17.250> new<00:02:18.110> transducer<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.349> is<00:02:19.530> two

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
now we have a new transducer that is two

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.350 
now we have a new transducer that is two
and<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> quarter<00:02:20.129> megahertz<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:20.940> we<00:02:21.090> should<00:02:21.330> be

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
and a quarter megahertz so we should be

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.910 
and a quarter megahertz so we should be
actually<00:02:21.840> pretty<00:02:21.989> close<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.500> where<00:02:22.620> we<00:02:22.769> were

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
actually pretty close to where we were

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.729 
actually pretty close to where we were
before<00:02:23.540> all<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:25.049> stuff<00:02:25.349> we're<00:02:25.500> just<00:02:25.530> going

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
before all that stuff we're just going

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.110 
before all that stuff we're just going
to<00:02:25.769> leave<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.069> alone<00:02:26.160> for<00:02:26.459> now<00:02:26.519> to<00:02:26.670> see<00:02:26.940> what

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
to leave it alone for now to see what

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.920 
to leave it alone for now to see what
happens<00:02:27.769> okay<00:02:28.769> so<00:02:29.700> I'm<00:02:29.940> going<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.120> go<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.269> my<00:02:30.360> iw

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
happens okay so I'm going to go to my iw

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.890 
happens okay so I'm going to go to my iw
block<00:02:31.489> part<00:02:32.489> one<00:02:32.640> says<00:02:32.879> verify<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.330> beam<00:02:33.569> exit

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
block part one says verify the beam exit

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.020 
block part one says verify the beam exit
point<00:02:34.080> which<00:02:34.230> means<00:02:34.640> put<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.760> transducer

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
point which means put the transducer

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.250 
point which means put the transducer
over<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.569> zero<00:02:36.840> point<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:38.150> aim<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.260> towards

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
over the zero point and aim it towards

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.830 
over the zero point and aim it towards
this<00:02:40.500> edge<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.040> block<00:02:41.250> over<00:02:41.459> here<00:02:41.629> so<00:02:42.629> I

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
this edge of the block over here so I

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.089 
this edge of the block over here so I
put<00:02:43.019> a<00:02:43.049> little<00:02:43.170> coupling<00:02:44.129> on<00:02:46.790> like<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:49.099> get

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
put a little coupling on like that get

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.460 
put a little coupling on like that get
back<00:02:50.280> over<00:02:50.489> here<00:02:53.299> park<00:02:54.299> over<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.840> zero<00:02:55.230> there

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
back over here park over the zero there

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.229 
back over here park over the zero there
you<00:02:55.709> should<00:02:55.769> see<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:56.129> signal<00:02:56.459> start<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:56.940> spike

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
you should see a signal start to spike

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.410 
you should see a signal start to spike
up<00:02:57.650> which<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.859> do<00:02:59.099> bring<00:02:59.790> my<00:02:59.970> gain<00:03:00.180> down<00:03:00.390> a

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
up which you do bring my gain down a

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.930 
up which you do bring my gain down a
little<00:03:00.629> bit<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.079> all<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.370> doing<00:03:02.609> is

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
little bit and all this is doing is

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.349 
little bit and all this is doing is
seeing<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.989> line<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:05.400> predetermined

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
seeing that the line the predetermined

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:07.670 
seeing that the line the predetermined
beam<00:03:06.510> exit<00:03:06.870> point<00:03:07.109> on<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.349> side<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:07.560> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
beam exit point on the side of the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:16.099 
beam exit point on the side of the
transducer<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:12.079> where<00:03:13.079> it<00:03:13.230> should<00:03:13.410> be<00:03:14.269> okay<00:03:15.269> so

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
transducer is where it should be okay so

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.009 
transducer is where it should be okay so
we<00:03:16.200> peak<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.560> signal<00:03:17.010> up<00:03:17.690> look<00:03:18.690> right<00:03:18.989> over

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
we peak that signal up look right over

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.199 
we peak that signal up look right over
the<00:03:19.319> side<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.709> block<00:03:19.950> here<00:03:20.310> which<00:03:21.000> I'm

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
the side of the block here which I'm

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.690 
the side of the block here which I'm
going<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.359> take<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.690> loose<00:03:21.870> for<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.139> second<00:03:22.700> so

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
going to take you loose for a second so

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.890 
going to take you loose for a second so
we<00:03:23.730> look<00:03:23.940> right<00:03:24.090> over<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.359> side<00:03:24.510> of<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.660> block

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
we look right over the side of the block

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.199 
we look right over the side of the block
to<00:03:25.139> see<00:03:25.290> if<00:03:25.380> that<00:03:25.560> beam<00:03:25.709> exit<00:03:26.040> point<00:03:26.280> is<00:03:26.849> right

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
to see if that beam exit point is right

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.280 
to see if that beam exit point is right
over<00:03:27.359> that<00:03:27.599> zero<00:03:27.900> which<00:03:28.829> it's<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.220> little<00:03:29.849> past

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
over that zero which it's a little past

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.089 
over that zero which it's a little past
but<00:03:31.290> not<00:03:31.410> too<00:03:31.650> horrible<00:03:32.780> okay<00:03:33.780> wipe<00:03:34.500> cup<00:03:34.919> one

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
but not too horrible okay wipe cup one

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.839 
but not too horrible okay wipe cup one
off<00:03:35.220> make<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:35.609> a<00:03:35.639> little<00:03:35.730> easier<00:03:35.849> to<00:03:36.150> see<00:03:37.849> all

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
off make it a little easier to see all

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.430 
off make it a little easier to see all
right<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:39.569> we're<00:03:39.660> pretty<00:03:39.810> close<00:03:40.019> there<00:03:40.230> that's

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
right so we're pretty close there that's

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.650 
right so we're pretty close there that's
harder<00:03:41.419> okay

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
harder okay

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.809 
harder okay

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.240 
back going to come down again and we're
going<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:12.959> get<00:04:13.079> a<00:04:13.139> signal<00:04:13.350> at<00:04:13.590> four<00:04:13.829> and<00:04:13.949> nine

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
going to get a signal at four and nine

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.460 
going to get a signal at four and nine
so<00:04:15.910> let's<00:04:16.840> do<00:04:17.200> that<00:04:18.900> give<00:04:19.900> it<00:04:20.019> a<00:04:20.049> little<00:04:20.079> gain

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
so let's do that give it a little gain

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.370 
so let's do that give it a little gain
here<00:04:21.090> here's<00:04:22.090> our<00:04:22.240> 4-inch<00:04:22.660> signal<00:04:23.020> here's<00:04:23.230> our

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
here here's our 4-inch signal here's our

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.830 
here here's our 4-inch signal here's our
9<00:04:23.560> inch<00:04:23.770> signal<00:04:24.160> we're<00:04:24.850> not<00:04:25.150> quite<00:04:25.570> where<00:04:25.810> we

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
9 inch signal we're not quite where we

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.230 
9 inch signal we're not quite where we
need<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.110> be<00:04:26.350> so<00:04:27.190> now<00:04:27.370> we<00:04:27.430> go<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.700> our<00:04:27.790> probe

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
need to be so now we go to our probe

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.270 
need to be so now we go to our probe
delay<00:04:29.790> turn<00:04:30.790> the<00:04:30.970> scope<00:04:31.240> a<00:04:31.360> little<00:04:31.390> bit<00:04:32.280> toward

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
delay turn the scope a little bit toward

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:40.500 
delay turn the scope a little bit toward
that's<00:04:33.430> at<00:04:33.550> 4<00:04:33.850> inches<00:04:39.150> okay<00:04:40.150> there's<00:04:40.450> four

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
that's at 4 inches okay there's four

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.050 
that's at 4 inches okay there's four
inches<00:04:40.960> and<00:04:41.200> we're<00:04:42.100> pretty<00:04:42.280> close<00:04:42.580> to<00:04:42.640> nine

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
inches and we're pretty close to nine

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.280 
inches and we're pretty close to nine
but<00:04:43.690> not<00:04:43.870> perfect<00:04:45.480> so<00:04:46.480> I'm<00:04:46.660> going<00:04:46.840> to<00:04:46.900> try<00:04:47.140> and

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
but not perfect so I'm going to try and

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.350 
but not perfect so I'm going to try and
make<00:04:47.410> that<00:04:47.560> as<00:04:47.710> perfect<00:04:48.130> as<00:04:48.250> possible<00:04:51.270> give<00:04:52.270> it

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
make that as perfect as possible give it

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:00.540 
make that as perfect as possible give it
a<00:04:52.420> little<00:04:52.600> gain<00:04:53.550> move<00:04:54.550> our<00:04:54.730> delay<00:04:55.060> back<00:04:59.550> all

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
a little gain move our delay back all

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.640 
a little gain move our delay back all
right<00:05:00.760> keep<00:05:01.630> coming<00:05:01.930> in<00:05:02.050> just<00:05:02.230> a<00:05:02.350> little<00:05:02.560> bit

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
right keep coming in just a little bit

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:11.400 
right keep coming in just a little bit
more

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.220 

all<00:05:12.410> right<00:05:13.330> that<00:05:14.330> looks<00:05:14.360> pretty<00:05:14.720> close<00:05:14.930> four

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
all right that looks pretty close four

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.830 
all right that looks pretty close four
nine<00:05:15.560> I<00:05:19.120> would<00:05:20.120> say<00:05:20.330> so

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
nine I would say so

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.000 
nine I would say so
peaked<00:05:21.830> up<00:05:22.040> looks<00:05:22.370> good<00:05:22.669> that's<00:05:23.419> part<00:05:23.870> two<00:05:24.010> now

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
peaked up looks good that's part two now

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.250 
peaked up looks good that's part two now
part<00:05:25.400> three<00:05:25.610> sets<00:05:25.880> verify<00:05:26.449> the<00:05:26.510> refraction

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
part three sets verify the refraction

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.950 
part three sets verify the refraction
angle<00:05:27.380> which<00:05:27.650> is<00:05:27.800> on<00:05:27.979> this<00:05:28.400> side<00:05:28.790> so<00:05:29.750> we're

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
angle which is on this side so we're

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.159 
angle which is on this side so we're
going<00:05:30.080> to<00:05:30.169> set<00:05:30.470> that<00:05:30.500> thing<00:05:30.979> over<00:05:31.760> the<00:05:32.750> 70

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
going to set that thing over the 70

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.350 
going to set that thing over the 70
degree<00:05:33.470> mark<00:05:33.500> let's<00:05:34.340> turn<00:05:34.580> it<00:05:34.699> around<00:05:34.760> here

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
degree mark let's turn it around here

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.950 
degree mark let's turn it around here
there's<00:05:36.169> 60<00:05:36.860> 65<00:05:37.340> 70<00:05:37.400> and<00:05:38.180> point<00:05:38.479> it<00:05:38.600> towards

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
there's 60 65 70 and point it towards

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.219 
there's 60 65 70 and point it towards
this<00:05:39.199> Plexiglas<00:05:39.650> disc<00:05:40.840> okay<00:05:41.840> so<00:05:41.900> we're<00:05:42.110> doing

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
this Plexiglas disc okay so we're doing

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.260 
this Plexiglas disc okay so we're doing
that<00:05:42.530> we're<00:05:43.220> just<00:05:43.310> looking<00:05:43.610> at<00:05:43.729> this<00:05:43.880> signal

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
that we're just looking at this signal

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.680 
that we're just looking at this signal
here<00:05:44.570> doesn't<00:05:44.900> have<00:05:44.990> to<00:05:45.139> be<00:05:45.260> perfect<00:05:45.889> okay<00:05:46.690> we

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
here doesn't have to be perfect okay we

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.080 
here doesn't have to be perfect okay we
can<00:05:47.840> bring<00:05:48.320> the<00:05:48.440> gain<00:05:48.650> down<00:05:48.950> some<00:05:52.090> just

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
can bring the gain down some just

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.250 
can bring the gain down some just
looking<00:05:53.300> at<00:05:53.389> where<00:05:53.510> this<00:05:53.660> thing<00:05:53.870> is<00:05:53.900> picking

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
looking at where this thing is picking

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.810 
looking at where this thing is picking
up<00:05:54.410> at<00:05:56.169> excuse<00:05:57.169> me

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
up at excuse me

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.120 
up at excuse me
pick<00:05:58.820> it<00:05:58.850> up<00:05:59.000> about<00:05:59.210> right<00:05:59.270> there<00:05:59.889> look<00:06:00.889> down

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
pick it up about right there look down

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.940 
pick it up about right there look down
it<00:06:01.460> needs<00:06:02.060> to<00:06:02.120> be<00:06:02.210> right<00:06:02.360> over<00:06:02.419> the<00:06:02.720> 70<00:06:03.200> which

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
it needs to be right over the 70 which

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.400 
it needs to be right over the 70 which
it's<00:06:04.190> pretty<00:06:04.430> close<00:06:04.729> so<00:06:05.060> now<00:06:05.960> we<00:06:06.020> know<00:06:06.260> our

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
it's pretty close so now we know our

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.560 
it's pretty close so now we know our
transducer<00:06:07.010> is<00:06:07.070> refracting<00:06:07.669> out<00:06:07.820> at<00:06:08.030> 70

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
transducer is refracting out at 70

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.700 
transducer is refracting out at 70
degrees<00:06:09.130> which<00:06:10.130> is<00:06:10.310> good<00:06:11.020> then<00:06:12.020> the<00:06:12.229> last<00:06:12.410> part

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
degrees which is good then the last part

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.330 
degrees which is good then the last part
part<00:06:13.190> four<00:06:13.750> says<00:06:14.750> check<00:06:15.470> your<00:06:15.650> transducer<00:06:16.310> or

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
part four says check your transducer or

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.440 
part four says check your transducer or
set<00:06:16.880> your<00:06:17.600> sensitivity<00:06:18.340> using<00:06:19.340> a<00:06:19.430> 60,000<00:06:20.240> hole

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
set your sensitivity using a 60,000 hole

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.820 
set your sensitivity using a 60,000 hole
we're<00:06:21.380> going<00:06:21.530> to<00:06:21.590> do<00:06:21.740> that<00:06:21.919> right<00:06:22.160> now<00:06:22.220> so<00:06:23.830> set

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
we're going to do that right now so set

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.250 
we're going to do that right now so set
our<00:06:28.150> right<00:06:29.150> there<00:06:29.389> will<00:06:29.570> this<00:06:29.840> plenty<00:06:30.200> of

our right there will this plenty of

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.409 
our right there will this plenty of
coupling<00:06:30.760> okay<00:06:31.760> we're<00:06:32.030> going<00:06:32.120> to<00:06:32.180> set<00:06:32.330> our

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
coupling okay we're going to set our

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.180 
coupling okay we're going to set our
sensitivity<00:06:32.960> so<00:06:33.110> I<00:06:33.139> like<00:06:33.410> to<00:06:33.560> start<00:06:33.770> past<00:06:34.010> the

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
sensitivity so I like to start past the

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.600 
sensitivity so I like to start past the
edge<00:06:34.280> of<00:06:34.430> the<00:06:34.490> block<00:06:35.770> okay<00:06:36.770> looking<00:06:37.370> at<00:06:37.490> the

the<00:06:46.190> two<00:06:46.370> back<00:06:47.180> up<00:06:48.190> there's<00:06:49.190> our<00:06:49.370> signal<00:06:49.760> right

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
the two back up there's our signal right

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.420 
the two back up there's our signal right
there<00:06:50.090> about<00:06:50.270> two<00:06:50.510> inches<00:06:50.889> okay<00:06:51.889> which<00:06:52.099> should

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.430 
there about two inches okay which should

00:06:52.430 --> 00:07:00.980 
there about two inches okay which should
coincide<00:06:53.419> with<00:06:53.660> a<00:06:53.840> 70

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.930 

on<00:07:01.990> the<00:07:02.500> block<00:07:02.710> but<00:07:02.949> the<00:07:03.190> 70s<00:07:03.610> on<00:07:03.699> the<00:07:03.729> other

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940 
on the block but the 70s on the other

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:11.189 
on the block but the 70s on the other
side<00:07:04.180> over<00:07:04.300> here<00:07:09.750> alright<00:07:10.750> so<00:07:10.930> there<00:07:11.080> it<00:07:11.110> is

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 
side over here alright so there it is

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:14.040 
side over here alright so there it is
about<00:07:11.380> two<00:07:11.650> inches<00:07:11.680> and<00:07:12.330> now<00:07:13.330> to<00:07:13.389> set<00:07:13.870> that

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
about two inches and now to set that

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.050 
about two inches and now to set that
sensitivity<00:07:14.560> I'm<00:07:14.889> going<00:07:15.069> to<00:07:15.130> run<00:07:15.310> my<00:07:15.520> gain<00:07:15.819> up

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:16.060 
sensitivity I'm going to run my gain up

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.680 
sensitivity I'm going to run my gain up
to<00:07:16.090> where<00:07:16.960> the<00:07:17.110> signal<00:07:17.500> is<00:07:17.849> at<00:07:18.849> 50%<00:07:19.120> screen

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:19.690 
to where the signal is at 50% screen

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.680 
to where the signal is at 50% screen
height<00:07:19.900> so<00:07:20.800> once<00:07:21.009> it<00:07:21.130> is<00:07:21.190> is<00:07:21.400> it<00:07:21.789> a<00:07:21.849> 50%<00:07:22.449> screen

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:22.690 
height so once it is is it a 50% screen

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.279 
height so once it is is it a 50% screen
height<00:07:22.870> I<00:07:23.080> have<00:07:23.830> set<00:07:24.210> my<00:07:25.210> signal<00:07:25.660> set<00:07:26.169> my

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:26.289 
height I have set my signal set my

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:29.100 
height I have set my signal set my
sensitivity<00:07:27.030> okay<00:07:28.030> and<00:07:28.240> the<00:07:28.539> next<00:07:28.599> part<00:07:28.990> of

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.110 
sensitivity okay and the next part of

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.670 
sensitivity okay and the next part of
that<00:07:29.259> tells<00:07:30.190> me<00:07:30.370> that<00:07:30.400> I<00:07:30.610> need<00:07:30.639> to<00:07:30.819> add<00:07:31.229> 8<00:07:32.229> DB

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 
that tells me that I need to add 8 DB

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.089 
that tells me that I need to add 8 DB
and<00:07:33.190> scan<00:07:34.090> a<00:07:34.120> weld<00:07:34.419> plate<00:07:34.599> so<00:07:35.560> we'll<00:07:35.710> scan<00:07:35.949> the

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:36.099 
and scan a weld plate so we'll scan the

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:40.460 
and scan a weld plate so we'll scan the
weld<00:07:36.280> plate<00:07:36.430> in<00:07:36.729> the<00:07:36.849> next<00:07:37.530> section<00:07:38.530> okay

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:40.470 
weld plate in the next section okay

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:44.189 
weld plate in the next section okay
anyway<00:07:41.819> using<00:07:42.819> that<00:07:43.120> now<00:07:43.360> we<00:07:43.419> have<00:07:43.599> calibrated

00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:44.199 
anyway using that now we have calibrated

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:48.059 
anyway using that now we have calibrated
to<00:07:45.190> d11<00:07:45.789> on<00:07:46.060> an<00:07:46.210> iaw<00:07:46.780> block<00:07:46.960> for<00:07:47.470> ultrasonics

00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:48.069 
to d11 on an iaw block for ultrasonics

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:50.789 
to d11 on an iaw block for ultrasonics
using<00:07:48.400> sheer<00:07:48.610> wave
