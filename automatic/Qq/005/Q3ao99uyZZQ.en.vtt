00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659 
have easily pushed that one white but

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:54.149 
have easily pushed that one white but
instead<00:05:52.900> he<00:05:53.080> just<00:05:53.110> pushed<00:05:53.500> it<00:05:53.620> into<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:54.009> back

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
instead he just pushed it into the back

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:55.469 
instead he just pushed it into the back
of<00:05:54.190> the<00:05:54.339> net<00:05:54.520> and<00:05:54.669> that<00:05:54.849> made<00:05:55.029> it<00:05:55.060> free<00:05:55.330> to

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
of the net and that made it free to

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.300 
of the net and that made it free to
before<00:05:55.839> he<00:05:55.870> went<00:05:56.020> in<00:05:56.199> at<00:05:56.319> halftime<00:05:56.349> and<00:05:56.919> it

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
before he went in at halftime and it

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.459 
before he went in at halftime and it
wasn't<00:05:57.580> looking<00:05:57.669> good<00:05:57.879> because<00:05:58.509> he<00:05:59.199> just

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469 
wasn't looking good because he just

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:01.050 
wasn't looking good because he just
seemed<00:05:59.650> to<00:05:59.740> have<00:05:59.860> the<00:05:59.979> edge<00:06:00.099> like<00:06:00.129> in<00:06:00.699> terms<00:06:00.879> of

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
seemed to have the edge like in terms of

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.490 
seemed to have the edge like in terms of
actual<00:06:01.449> goal<00:06:01.629> scorer<00:06:01.870> and<00:06:01.960> I<00:06:02.020> was<00:06:02.169> the<00:06:02.319> better

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
actual goal scorer and I was the better

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.140 
actual goal scorer and I was the better
of<00:06:02.740> the<00:06:02.860> two<00:06:03.039> like<00:06:03.279> getting<00:06:03.550> shots<00:06:03.819> and<00:06:04.000> stuff

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
of the two like getting shots and stuff

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.029 
of the two like getting shots and stuff
but<00:06:04.599> my<00:06:04.779> goalie<00:06:05.020> wasn't<00:06:05.379> doing<00:06:05.560> very<00:06:05.589> well<00:06:05.889> and

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
but my goalie wasn't doing very well and

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:07.350 
but my goalie wasn't doing very well and
he<00:06:06.129> was<00:06:06.370> just<00:06:06.400> scouring<00:06:06.879> every<00:06:07.000> shot<00:06:07.300> he

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
he was just scouring every shot he

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.240 
he was just scouring every shot he
seemed<00:06:07.539> to<00:06:07.569> have<00:06:07.779> but<00:06:08.020> as<00:06:08.259> I<00:06:08.589> say<00:06:08.740> that<00:06:08.919> marker

felt<00:06:46.750> like<00:06:46.870> I'd<00:06:47.050> been<00:06:47.080> the<00:06:47.319> better<00:06:47.470> of<00:06:47.590> the<00:06:47.650> two

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
felt like I'd been the better of the two

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.189 
felt like I'd been the better of the two
players<00:06:48.099> but<00:06:48.460> I<00:06:48.490> lost<00:06:48.879> it<00:06:49.060> 5-4<00:06:49.719> I<00:06:49.750> show<00:06:50.080> the

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 
players but I lost it 5-4 I show the

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:51.570 
players but I lost it 5-4 I show the
stats<00:06:50.439> in<00:06:50.560> a<00:06:50.650> second<00:06:51.009> i<00:06:51.069> think<00:06:51.280> i<00:06:51.370> had<00:06:51.460> more

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580 
stats in a second i think i had more

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.010 
stats in a second i think i had more
shots<00:06:51.819> and<00:06:52.000> bushels<00:06:52.270> some<00:06:52.419> target<00:06:52.780> but<00:06:52.960> of

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
shots and bushels some target but of

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.779 
shots and bushels some target but of
course<00:06:53.229> that<00:06:53.379> doesn't<00:06:53.860> matter<00:06:54.099> the<00:06:54.219> only<00:06:54.490> stat

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:54.789 
course that doesn't matter the only stat

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.700 
course that doesn't matter the only stat
that<00:06:54.819> really<00:06:55.210> matters<00:06:55.569> is<00:06:55.719> the<00:06:56.139> goals<00:06:56.530> and

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
that really matters is the goals and

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.409 
that really matters is the goals and
obviously<00:06:57.039> he<00:06:57.430> scored<00:06:57.729> with<00:06:57.849> five<00:06:58.060> of<00:06:58.240> his

00:06:58.409 --> 00:06:58.419 
obviously he scored with five of his

00:06:58.419 --> 00:06:59.760 
obviously he scored with five of his
seven<00:06:58.659> shots<00:06:58.840> on<00:06:59.020> target<00:06:59.050> whereas<00:06:59.500> i<00:06:59.590> only

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770
