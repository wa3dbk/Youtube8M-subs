this
okay<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:21.080> you're<00:01:21.890> also<00:01:22.010> going<00:01:22.160> to<00:01:22.340> want<00:01:22.400> to<00:01:22.520> add

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
a little bit of soil and soil is great

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.160 
a little bit of soil and soil is great
because<00:01:25.280> it<00:01:25.430> has<00:01:25.630> microorganisms<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:27.050> it

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
because it has microorganisms and it

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.500 
because it has microorganisms and it
helps<00:01:27.350> everything<00:01:27.620> decompose<00:01:28.370> if<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:29.180> layer

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
helps everything decompose if you layer

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.050 
helps everything decompose if you layer
that<00:01:29.720> on<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.170> then<00:01:30.800> once<00:01:31.130> again<00:01:31.220> keep<00:01:31.760> up<00:01:31.910> with

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
that on and then once again keep up with

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.030 
that on and then once again keep up with
your<00:01:32.180> layering<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.750> one<00:01:33.050> part<00:01:33.290> green<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.890> two

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
your layering the one part green the two

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.370 
your layering the one part green the two
parts<00:01:34.400> brown<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.330> keep<00:01:35.810> in<00:01:35.960> mind<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.260> your

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
parts brown and keep in mind that your

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.320 
parts brown and keep in mind that your
compost<00:01:36.890> needs<00:01:37.370> to<00:01:37.520> be<00:01:37.610> turned<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.060> mixed

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
compost needs to be turned and mixed

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.840 
compost needs to be turned and mixed
regularly<00:01:38.840> in<00:01:39.020> your<00:01:39.410> bin<00:01:39.620> in<00:01:39.830> fact<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.670> more

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
regularly in your bin in fact the more

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.820 
regularly in your bin in fact the more
you<00:01:41.000> mix<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.660> faster<00:01:42.050> your<00:01:42.200> compost<00:01:42.650> we're

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
you mix the faster your compost we're

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.800 
you mix the faster your compost we're
ready<00:01:43.040> to<00:01:43.190> use<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:43.760> then<00:01:44.270> you'll<00:01:44.390> just<00:01:44.540> know

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
ready to use and then you'll just know

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.450 
ready to use and then you'll just know
it's<00:01:45.140> ready<00:01:45.440> when<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.710> looks<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.070> feels<00:01:46.310> like

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
it's ready when it looks and feels like

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.440 
it's ready when it looks and feels like
potting<00:01:46.940> soil

potting soil

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.960 
potting soil
so<00:01:48.050> try<00:01:48.260> composting<00:01:48.920> it's<00:01:49.400> a<00:01:49.520> great<00:01:49.760> way<00:01:49.940> to

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
so try composting it's a great way to

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.970 
so try composting it's a great way to
recycle<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:51.110> great<00:01:51.380> way<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.620> feed<00:01:51.950> your
