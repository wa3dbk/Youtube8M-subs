up and some testing and fitment issues

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.299 
up and some testing and fitment issues
with<00:00:13.580> the<00:00:13.670> other<00:00:13.820> panels<00:00:14.950> I've<00:00:15.950> got<00:00:16.160> this

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
with the other panels I've got this

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
hanging in place and I think you can see

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.460 
hanging in place and I think you can see
the<00:00:22.759> gap<00:00:22.970> that<00:00:23.390> I<00:00:23.450> had<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:23.840> problem<00:00:23.990> with<00:00:24.290> it

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
the gap that I had the problem with it

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.890 
the gap that I had the problem with it
from<00:00:24.830> side<00:00:25.070> to<00:00:25.099> side<00:00:25.250> is<00:00:25.700> better<00:00:26.090> but<00:00:26.750> still

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
from side to side is better but still

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.450 
from side to side is better but still
not<00:00:27.140> perfect<00:00:29.020> I'm<00:00:30.020> going<00:00:30.199> to<00:00:30.260> have<00:00:30.380> to<00:00:30.500> still

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
not perfect I'm going to have to still

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.700 
not perfect I'm going to have to still
play<00:00:31.640> with<00:00:31.670> it<00:00:31.970> this<00:00:32.119> side<00:00:32.360> is<00:00:33.290> going<00:00:33.530> to<00:00:33.590> be

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
play with it this side is going to be

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.960 
play with it this side is going to be
fine<00:00:33.949> and<00:00:35.080> this<00:00:36.080> side<00:00:36.670> I'll<00:00:37.670> be<00:00:37.730> able<00:00:37.850> to

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
fine and this side I'll be able to

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.910 
fine and this side I'll be able to
adjust<00:00:38.510> some<00:00:38.930> of<00:00:38.960> this<00:00:39.170> like<00:00:39.320> this<00:00:39.470> gap<00:00:39.680> up

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920

here it's hard to see I'll be able to

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.560 
here it's hard to see I'll be able to
tighten<00:00:42.290> that<00:00:42.469> up<00:00:42.530> some<00:00:43.270> but<00:00:44.270> I'm<00:00:44.360> still

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.959 
here now on another car that I did I
sectioned<00:00:51.980> a<00:00:52.780> quarter<00:00:53.780> inch<00:00:54.039> out<00:00:55.039> of<00:00:55.100> the

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969

quarter panel from top to bottom

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.910 
quarter panel from top to bottom
and<00:00:58.340> I<00:00:58.670> brought<00:00:58.910> this<00:00:59.120> forward<00:00:59.600> to<00:01:00.590> make<00:01:00.739> up

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
and I brought this forward to make up

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
you're going to think I'm crazy but the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.069 
you're going to think I'm crazy but the
wheelhouse<00:01:41.600> I<00:01:42.189> can<00:01:43.189> see<00:01:43.400> it<00:01:43.490> very<00:01:43.520> well<00:01:43.700> I<00:01:44.079> had

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
wheelhouse I can see it very well I had

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.730 
wheelhouse I can see it very well I had
a<00:01:45.110> problem<00:01:45.380> with<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.799> gap<00:01:46.009> now<00:01:46.420> up<00:01:47.420> front<00:01:47.740> it's

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
a problem with the gap now up front it's

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.620 
a problem with the gap now up front it's
really<00:01:48.890> pretty<00:01:49.729> close<00:01:50.030> where<00:01:50.329> it<00:01:50.390> should<00:01:50.600> be

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
really pretty close where it should be

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.990 
really pretty close where it should be
and<00:01:51.470> also<00:01:52.100> in<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.340> back<00:01:52.520> as<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:53.360> can<00:01:53.600> see<00:01:55.000> hope

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
and also in the back as you can see hope

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.850 
and also in the back as you can see hope
you<00:01:56.119> can<00:01:56.270> see<00:01:56.420> that<00:01:57.110> it's<00:01:57.409> making<00:01:57.710> good

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
you can see that it's making good

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.539 
you can see that it's making good

but<00:01:59.149> along<00:01:59.360> these<00:01:59.630> this<00:02:00.560> radius<00:02:01.750> it's<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:03.079> gap

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
but along these this radius it's the gap

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.700 
but along these this radius it's the gap
is<00:02:03.470> wrong<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:04.610> believe<00:02:05.060> it<00:02:05.180> or<00:02:05.270> not<00:02:05.409> because<00:02:06.409> I

like the details I'm going to cut and

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:11.770 
like the details I'm going to cut and
I've<00:02:10.700> already<00:02:10.820> cut<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.150> loose<00:02:11.299> for<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.600> most

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
I've already cut it loose for the most

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.370 
I've already cut it loose for the most
part<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:13.040> lip<00:02:13.760> that's<00:02:14.540> inside<00:02:14.989> here<00:02:15.260> on<00:02:15.350> the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
part the lip that's inside here on the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.470 
part the lip that's inside here on the
wheelhouse<00:02:15.560> I'm<00:02:16.430> going<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.670> cut<00:02:16.880> it<00:02:16.970> off<00:02:17.120> and

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
wheelhouse I'm going to cut it off and

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.220 
wheelhouse I'm going to cut it off and
bring<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.410> down<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:19.430> that<00:02:19.520> it<00:02:19.640> mates<00:02:19.940> here<00:02:20.420> to

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
bring it down so that it mates here to

and<00:02:23.950> then<00:02:24.400> I'll<00:02:24.490> make<00:02:24.700> an<00:02:24.850> axillary<00:02:25.630> that'll

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
and then I'll make an axillary that'll

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.170 
and then I'll make an axillary that'll
run<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.800> all<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.430> way<00:02:27.490> around<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:28.090> I'll

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
run that all the way around and I'll

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.470

show<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:28.570> when<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:28.810> get<00:02:28.870> this<00:02:29.050> back<00:02:29.230> off

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
show you that when I get this back off

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.370 
show you that when I get this back off
but<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.510> think<00:02:31.750> I'm<00:02:31.840> going<00:02:31.990> to<00:02:32.050> much<00:02:32.230> better

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.720 
fit I would get everything set as far as
the<00:04:13.750> quarters<00:04:14.140> tail<00:04:14.950> panel<00:04:15.190> everything<00:04:15.610> that

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
the quarters tail panel everything that

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.180 
the quarters tail panel everything that
I<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:16.120> I<00:04:16.150> want<00:04:16.479> do<00:04:17.260> my<00:04:17.410> mock-ups<00:04:17.890> with<00:04:18.070> the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
I that I want do my mock-ups with the

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.280 
I that I want do my mock-ups with the
deck<00:04:18.340> lid<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:19.180> determine<00:04:19.660> if<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.930> lengths<00:04:20.169> are

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
deck lid to determine if the lengths are

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.020 
deck lid to determine if the lengths are
correct<00:04:20.590> and<00:04:20.859> the<00:04:21.070> angles<00:04:21.430> are<00:04:21.519> correct<00:04:21.790> and

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
correct and the angles are correct and

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.210 
correct and the angles are correct and
if<00:04:22.780> I<00:04:22.900> needed<00:04:23.169> to<00:04:23.229> make<00:04:23.320> some<00:04:23.500> adjustments<00:04:24.070> I

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
if I needed to make some adjustments I

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.190 
if I needed to make some adjustments I
could<00:04:24.729> actually<00:04:24.940> take<00:04:25.419> the<00:04:25.570> deck<00:04:25.750> lid<00:04:25.930> and

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
could actually take the deck lid and

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.170 
could actually take the deck lid and
twist<00:04:26.740> it<00:04:26.919> and<00:04:27.400> you<00:04:27.460> can<00:04:27.669> actually<00:04:27.850> you<00:04:28.150> can

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
twist it and you can actually you can

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.409 
twist it and you can actually you can
feel<00:04:28.510> it<00:04:28.660> slip<00:04:29.020> inside<00:04:29.620> of<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.250> shell<00:04:31.150> let's

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
feel it slip inside of the shell let's

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.339 
feel it slip inside of the shell let's
say<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:32.680> in<00:04:33.070> preparation<00:04:33.430> for<00:04:33.729> that<00:04:33.910> I<00:04:34.349> would

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
say and in preparation for that I would

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:36.409 
say and in preparation for that I would
do

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
do

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.510 
do
bears<00:04:36.840> some<00:04:37.080> metal<00:04:37.380> around<00:04:38.100> this<00:04:38.220> perimeter

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
bears some metal around this perimeter

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.700 
bears some metal around this perimeter
on<00:04:38.970> both<00:04:39.570> sides<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:40.110> inner<00:04:40.259> shell<00:04:40.350> on<00:04:40.620> the

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
on both sides the inner shell on the

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.129 
on both sides the inner shell on the
outer<00:04:40.860> shell<00:04:41.539> manipulate<00:04:42.539> it<00:04:42.690> get<00:04:42.870> it<00:04:42.990> where<00:04:43.110> I

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
outer shell manipulate it get it where I

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.560 
outer shell manipulate it get it where I
wanted<00:04:43.500> it<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:43.740> gently<00:04:44.490> open<00:04:44.970> it<00:04:45.060> back<00:04:45.150> up<00:04:45.210> and

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
wanted it and gently open it back up and

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.020 
wanted it and gently open it back up and
throw<00:04:46.169> some<00:04:46.380> tack<00:04:46.560> welds<00:04:46.979> on<00:04:47.130> those<00:04:47.820> little

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
throw some tack welds on those little

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.420 
throw some tack welds on those little
spots<00:04:48.320> then<00:04:49.320> I'd<00:04:49.470> mock<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:49.889> up<00:04:49.949> again<00:04:50.250> and

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
spots then I'd mock it up again and

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.120 
spots then I'd mock it up again and
check<00:04:50.610> it<00:04:50.789> if<00:04:51.270> everything<00:04:51.570> it<00:04:52.380> lines<00:04:52.680> up<00:04:52.830> good

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
check it if everything it lines up good

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.370 
check it if everything it lines up good
and<00:04:53.400> I'm<00:04:53.669> happy<00:04:53.820> with<00:04:54.120> it<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:54.419> will<00:04:55.020> add<00:04:55.139> more

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
and I'm happy with it I will add more

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.170 
and I'm happy with it I will add more
tack<00:04:55.650> welds<00:04:56.100> all<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.759> way<00:04:56.820> around<00:04:57.090> the

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
tack welds all the way around the

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.350 
tack welds all the way around the
perimeter<00:04:57.600> and<00:04:57.720> make<00:04:57.810> that<00:04:58.500> deck<00:04:58.979> lid<00:04:59.360> rigid

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
perimeter and make that deck lid rigid

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.790 
perimeter and make that deck lid rigid
so<00:05:00.690> I<00:05:00.720> can't<00:05:00.960> flex<00:05:01.229> it<00:05:01.350> any<00:05:01.470> more

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
so I can't flex it any more

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.040 
so I can't flex it any more
and<00:05:01.940> in<00:05:02.940> doing<00:05:03.120> so<00:05:03.240> that<00:05:03.570> saves<00:05:03.780> you<00:05:03.840> a<00:05:03.900> lot<00:05:03.990> of

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
and in doing so that saves you a lot of

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.990 
and in doing so that saves you a lot of
trouble<00:05:04.380> now<00:05:04.410> in<00:05:04.620> this<00:05:04.740> case<00:05:04.949> I'm<00:05:05.669> using<00:05:05.729> the

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
trouble now in this case I'm using the

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.779 
trouble now in this case I'm using the
original<00:05:06.210> deck<00:05:06.539> lid<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:07.020> it's<00:05:07.800> away<00:05:08.250> you<00:05:08.520> know

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
original deck lid and it's away you know

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.089

I<00:05:32.669> wanted<00:05:32.970> I<00:05:33.210> know<00:05:33.930> it's<00:05:34.139> it's<00:05:34.349> kind<00:05:34.620> of<00:05:34.650> a<00:05:34.770> you

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
I wanted I know it's it's kind of a you

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.219 
I wanted I know it's it's kind of a you
know<00:05:35.160> cheap<00:05:35.460> way<00:05:35.639> to<00:05:35.699> do<00:05:35.880> it<00:05:36.030> but<00:05:36.630> it<00:05:36.810> sure

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
know cheap way to do it but it sure

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.110 
know cheap way to do it but it sure
beats<00:05:37.490> replacing<00:05:38.490> a<00:05:38.550> deck<00:05:38.699> lid<00:05:38.880> you<00:05:38.970> don't

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
beats replacing a deck lid you don't

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.800 
beats replacing a deck lid you don't
need<00:05:39.270> to<00:05:39.479> and<00:05:40.580> you<00:05:41.580> know<00:05:41.669> damaging<00:05:42.630> the<00:05:42.720> one

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 
you have if you do it right it won't

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.420 
you have if you do it right it won't
hurt<00:05:44.880> it<00:05:45.030> at<00:05:45.120> all<00:05:45.300> so<00:05:46.050> now<00:05:46.229> that<00:05:47.070> I've<00:05:47.220> gotten

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
hurt it at all so now that I've gotten

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.670 
hurt it at all so now that I've gotten
the<00:05:47.550> deck<00:05:47.699> lid<00:05:47.909> fitting<00:05:48.870> the<00:05:48.990> quarters<00:05:49.320> a<00:05:49.349> lot

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
the deck lid fitting the quarters a lot

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.000 
the deck lid fitting the quarters a lot
better

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
better

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.920 
better
and<00:05:50.159> again<00:05:50.789> this<00:05:50.909> left<00:05:51.150> quarter<00:05:51.419> is<00:05:51.510> not<00:05:51.659> fully

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
and again this left quarter is not fully

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.600 
and again this left quarter is not fully
installed<00:05:52.349> yet<00:05:52.590> I<00:05:52.800> wanted<00:05:53.250> to<00:05:53.370> show<00:05:53.520> you

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
installed yet I wanted to show you

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.640 
installed yet I wanted to show you
something<00:05:53.970> else<00:05:54.090> I<00:05:54.419> talked<00:05:55.260> earlier<00:05:55.409> about

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
something else I talked earlier about

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.710 
something else I talked earlier about
how<00:05:56.010> the<00:05:56.070> fact<00:05:56.370> that<00:05:56.520> I<00:05:56.789> had<00:05:57.000> to<00:05:57.030> shorten<00:05:57.479> up<00:05:57.539> a

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
how the fact that I had to shorten up a

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.750 
how the fact that I had to shorten up a
panel<00:05:58.080> by<00:05:58.560> cutting<00:05:58.949> it<00:05:59.039> back<00:05:59.159> here<00:05:59.400> somewhere

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
panel by cutting it back here somewhere

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.939 
panel by cutting it back here somewhere
now<00:06:00.630> I'll<00:06:01.169> show<00:06:01.680> you<00:06:01.740> again<00:06:02.960> the<00:06:03.960> skin<00:06:04.289> is

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949 
now I'll show you again the skin is

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:07.610 
now I'll show you again the skin is
tight<00:06:05.310> on<00:06:05.460> the<00:06:05.550> jamb<00:06:05.820> it's<00:06:06.780> correct<00:06:07.199> down<00:06:07.409> here

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
tight on the jamb it's correct down here

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.710 
tight on the jamb it's correct down here
in<00:06:07.680> the<00:06:07.770> bottom<00:06:07.979> where<00:06:08.490> it<00:06:08.580> needs<00:06:08.699> to<00:06:08.849> be<00:06:08.970> I<00:06:09.180> had

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
in the bottom where it needs to be I had

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.029 
in the bottom where it needs to be I had
a<00:06:09.750> little<00:06:09.900> issue<00:06:10.080> with<00:06:10.259> the<00:06:10.409> wheelhouse<00:06:10.650> which

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
a little issue with the wheelhouse which

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.980 
a little issue with the wheelhouse which
I<00:06:11.190> I'm<00:06:11.490> going<00:06:11.729> to<00:06:11.820> correct<00:06:12.030> that<00:06:12.240> but

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
I I'm going to correct that but

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.510 
I I'm going to correct that but
everything<00:06:13.289> else<00:06:13.440> is<00:06:13.620> lining<00:06:13.979> up<00:06:14.070> if<00:06:14.250> you<00:06:14.340> look

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
everything else is lining up if you look

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.580 
everything else is lining up if you look
here<00:06:14.789> you<00:06:15.419> can<00:06:15.539> see<00:06:15.720> that<00:06:15.870> it<00:06:15.990> lines<00:06:16.169> up<00:06:16.380> on<00:06:16.530> the

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
here you can see that it lines up on the

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.460 
here you can see that it lines up on the
sail<00:06:17.039> panel<00:06:17.430> and<00:06:18.210> it<00:06:18.750> all<00:06:18.840> fits<00:06:19.139> snug<00:06:20.130> into<00:06:20.580> the

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
sail panel and it all fits snug into the

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.469 
sail panel and it all fits snug into the
deck<00:06:22.470> filler<00:06:22.740> panel<00:06:23.130> here's<00:06:24.090> the<00:06:24.300> interesting

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
deck filler panel here's the interesting

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.879 
deck filler panel here's the interesting
part<00:06:25.669> this<00:06:26.669> is<00:06:26.729> a<00:06:26.909> simple<00:06:27.180> measurement

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:27.889 
part this is a simple measurement

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.960 
part this is a simple measurement
I'm<00:06:28.889> putting<00:06:29.099> the<00:06:29.159> tape<00:06:29.310> measure<00:06:29.430> up<00:06:29.789> there

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
I'm putting the tape measure up there

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.950 
I'm putting the tape measure up there
against<00:06:30.300> that<00:06:30.830> flange<00:06:31.830> or<00:06:32.130> that<00:06:32.280> Bend<00:06:32.960> come

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
against that flange or that Bend come

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.689 
against that flange or that Bend come
back<00:06:34.110> here<00:06:34.880> my<00:06:35.880> measurement<00:06:36.389> is<00:06:37.460> just<00:06:38.460> under

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
back here my measurement is just under

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:42.080 
back here my measurement is just under
24<00:06:39.360> let's<00:06:40.289> say<00:06:40.409> it's<00:06:40.560> you<00:06:40.860> know<00:06:40.979> around<00:06:41.190> 24<00:06:41.789> and

24 let's say it's you know around 24 and

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.390 
24 let's say it's you know around 24 and
7/8<00:06:43.070> here's<00:06:44.070> the<00:06:44.219> fun<00:06:44.400> part

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
7/8 here's the fun part

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.360

let me show you this real quick same

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:54.090 
let me show you this real quick same
location<00:06:49.020> same<00:06:50.020> position<00:06:50.760> same<00:06:51.760> deal<00:06:53.100> this

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100 
location same position same deal this

00:06:54.100 --> 00:07:02.060

one<00:06:54.389> is<00:06:57.660> hard<00:06:58.660> to<00:06:58.720> read<00:06:58.900> 24<00:06:59.740> and<00:07:00.100> about<00:07:01.060> a<00:07:01.090> half

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.070 
one is hard to read 24 and about a half

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.920 
one is hard to read 24 and about a half
so<00:07:03.070> that<00:07:03.100> tells<00:07:03.490> me<00:07:03.610> as<00:07:04.180> I<00:07:04.360> said<00:07:04.570> before<00:07:04.900> that

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 
there's something wrong with the way to

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.060 
there's something wrong with the way to
make<00:07:07.180> these<00:07:07.330> quarter<00:07:07.600> panels<00:07:07.930> and<00:07:08.110> that's<00:07:08.889> why

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
make these quarter panels and that's why

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.090 
make these quarter panels and that's why
I<00:07:09.130> had<00:07:09.310> to<00:07:09.340> shorten<00:07:09.610> up<00:07:09.820> the<00:07:09.940> last<00:07:10.120> one<00:07:11.100> that

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:12.100 
I had to shorten up the last one that

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.770 
I had to shorten up the last one that
being<00:07:12.340> said<00:07:12.580> I'm<00:07:12.729> going<00:07:12.880> to<00:07:12.940> drive<00:07:13.210> on<00:07:13.419> and

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780 
being said I'm going to drive on and

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.650 
being said I'm going to drive on and
make<00:07:14.020> it<00:07:14.169> fit<00:07:14.410> I<00:07:15.270> hope<00:07:16.270> you<00:07:16.389> got<00:07:16.510> some

make it fit I hope you got some

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.900 
make it fit I hope you got some
information<00:07:16.750> out<00:07:17.229> of<00:07:17.260> that<00:07:17.470> one<00:07:17.650> and<00:07:17.910> stay

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:18.910
