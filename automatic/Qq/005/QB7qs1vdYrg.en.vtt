00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.059
 there is a place where the intoxicating 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.000
 scent of hot dogs accompany yours 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.770
 walk step by step and just think 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.540
 that no other cart is finished 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.550
 will satisfy your nose for at least others 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.650
 five blocks with this intoxicating 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.349
 perfume every day 8 million people 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.509

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.850
 people means 8 million stories from 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.380
 tell love stories stories from 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.110
 good or bad success 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.149
 I decided to tell you my what 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:46.800
 obviously it is among the ugly ones and 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:48.690
 very boring like every morning 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.700
 the appetite is felt 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.400
 I decide to make refined and try 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.040
 something new I didn't think was so 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.180
 expensive but now it's done that I can 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.910
 do 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.620
 we are in the suburbs we give the background 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.960
 milano centro which it is a plus or minus 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.620
 I already watch maybe you fucking tell us 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.130

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:16.120
 I don't know Brooklyn or to put it in language 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:19.630
 original broccolino we are in the area 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:24.300
 more hipster than this fucking city that 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:29.080

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.460

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.380
 we are in their home 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.050
 there they almost see snap bikes 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:41.620
 fixed markets vintage indie productions 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:45.280
 mustache mustache impractical I am ready 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:50.590
 I obviously wear a sign of 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.580
 hipster field recognition we hope to 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.780
 see some blood 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.780
 if that of new york 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.060
 chievo 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:13.330
 we already see scum hipster everywhere 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.970
 graphic hipster everywhere madonna hens 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.550
 look at him ugly 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.800
 but almost never 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.540
 and the thing is not bad but so that the 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.910
 market with things to eat first 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.430
 what to test for a post e 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.470
 not even a little 4 dollars 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.710
 michael frenzel and then he says it read like this 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.020
 it looks cool it's a rolled-up price 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.370
 a slice of bacon looks 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.370
 according to me yes if eat from some water 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.330
 a price is rolled up a slice of 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.540
 capua bread and porchetta 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.540
 Yes No 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.150
 along the bacon and done well 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.590
 let's try something else 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.110
 this one is stuff at the Canadian donut 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.010
 homemade lemonade and this with 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:21.629
 maple juice if you don't die today like the 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.629
 donut and nothing sugary strong 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:32.990
 but the thing to watch 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:32.990
 wives as well but now we do 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.120
 lemon does not feel completely the 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:47.359
 good Umbrian maple juice among the 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.900
 Canadian campaigns are the best 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.900
 other for tuscany 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.250
 to watch 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.250
 and arrived 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.850
 today i want to tell you about brooklyn the real 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.590
 new york an old story claims that 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.550
 if in these parts he admits to being a 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.190
 dangerous type 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.170
 you should really be one though 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.260
 around now I see only bicycles 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.060
 there is the ridiculous chef rubio mustache here 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.609
 a place we all saw 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.519
 millions of times but that always leaves a 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.710
 immense amazement I'm here in a while 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.630
 meeting with a person to talk 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.960
 of the famous bridge construction on 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:32.010
 tight you see behind me 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:36.000
 we would like to transport to lengthen a 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.490
 pochettino and put it we say on soil 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.780
 national Italian soil 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.810
 the bullshit we are under the bridge of 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.810
 brooklyn 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.940
 thank goodness not under that of a barrack 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:55.800
 at least from the author does not seem the 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:59.070
 neighborhood is called a bit like 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.320
 the long elephant turn for brooklyn or 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.660
 like me, I like to call it broccolino ti 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.610
 away from the chaos of manhattan 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.890
 here everything is more peaceful more livable 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.660
 shame about this hipster patina that 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.880
 it covers a bit of everything 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.110
 but the patinas can be removed if not 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.040
 I remember badly 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.660
 now it's true that who we are 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.729
 that is 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.300
 you were taking off 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:31.759
 but someone should explain that 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.710
 this is a cat in charge a 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.860
 testimonials that we are in the neighborhood 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.009
 here hipster of the world 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:43.289
 even the walls I will also say the walls 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:43.289
 the walls say it speaks 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.300
 they did well only to charge the 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:53.300
 concert just the concept 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.760
 okay 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.920
 and when the sun greets you and goes to 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.080
 sleep and time to find yours 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.020
 childhood and maybe drowning sorrows 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.550
 in a bit of nostalgia from the bottom of the 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.500
 my experience let me 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.110
 advise you a nice place to take 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:16.400
 a hangover are in front of one of the 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:19.520
 the densest places in the world is a bar though 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.700
 sti cocks x kibar are everywhere full of 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.670
 80s and 90s videogames the cabinets 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:28.910
 There is just around the donkey kong 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.950
 ninja turtles everything is so another 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.860
 day is spent between snap bikes 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:36.590
 fixed horrible mustaches and too much food 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.180
 expensive and here among the original hipsters 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.190
 and too long coffee that takes place 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.960
 also my story that I will tell you 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.600
 episode after episode for how long 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.000
 useless ugly it is to the next 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.510

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.510
 big Apple
