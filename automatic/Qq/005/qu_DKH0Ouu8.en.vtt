 we also have a mission here and 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.539
 although now you can start going 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.250
 we have been founded in december 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.130
 start up we produce vegan 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.730
 food with outstanding empty 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.470
 become 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.240
 We have the products based on 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.039
 pushes back and we want to prove 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.199
 vegan food can be sexy and 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.400
 Massive want pure herbal 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.530
 Nutrition important for the brand 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.260
 that is why we are not us 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.500
 are as we are 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.480
 on the way to the council to describe in detail 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.089
 we are just happy that the and 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.250
 delicious products like many argue like 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.809
 So looks original from I will 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.909
 Never get the structure too often 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.739
 Looks like that and I'll try that now 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.510
 again I have a whole bowl 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.960
 eaten 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:04.700
 the abolition exactly 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.700
 if the camera once kita 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.370
 The products are really very pure in 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.640
 the recipe that means we at the harbor 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.200
 flee gluten free are lactose free 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.480
 currently on 05 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.640
 a saturated fatty acid where you find him 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.320
 if calories are enough, that's exactly what they have 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.060
 she needs me he would be quite 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.720
 no animal has to be sustainable 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.420
 to die 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.620
 we have produce the water show and 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.080
 we just have a product without 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.450
 allergens that really no compensation whether 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.430
 test 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.670
 or lactose insolvent products for 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.790
 all 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.200
 I do it very shamefully so then 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.630
 I'm not allowed to do that right now 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.220
 did you say it is not 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.270
 animal already died with me already me 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.869
 have already a turkey on the grill 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.090
 threw 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.890
 but would I have known that 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.960
 in any case, the hut on the way somehow 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.369
 we are flexitarian that means we 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.460
 for us these alternatives besides 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.500
 flexitarian with the part-time vegan 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.149
 part time vegetarian so you must be 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.380
 exception we absolutely make in the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.850
 ideologically we really want one 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.850
 represent valuable alternative 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.869
 So it tastes great 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.780
 chicken meat because who does not care 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.430
 have come taste great too 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.590
 her spiced up again or gets 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.780
 the meat quasi products are like that 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.340
 ready to be purchased in retail 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.170
 every freezer you can come 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.630
 at kaiser's tengelmann or tv 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.300
 less'm always our website had 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.710
 From the market on a search the Nazis 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.380
 drove a pack 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.670
 is in a batch of 38 grams of protein 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:37.050
 as two euro 9m fry salads finished 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.000
 super super delicious super horny 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.319
 that was the keyword ne super juicy now 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.319
 come to you again because we both 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.739
 as a fitness athlete we know how 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.569
 very much we are spreading and that 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.989
 Are you really not that way anymore? 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.430
 all 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.590
 but what are you still preparing 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.280
 but you know, such a lok is defensive 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.790
 So, then , as well as meat is ours 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.700
 300 or at result so far 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.049
 just over a kilo so it lies 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.450
 I say so roughly between a and 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.549
 two kilos probably if you have that 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.319
 chicken or acute or beef 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.549
 ever so priceless somewhere like that 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.090
 every day just can the same 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.680
 to eat 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.709
 you think how much 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.299
 steal quantities 34 if you 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.440
 see actually more looking for 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.100
 alternative 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.100
 guests there are 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.530
 that's really how it is I have so 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:30.139
 I have never tried this before 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.469
 tested and sometimes quite interesting 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.569
 Thing 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:33.859
 see my well-known bodybuilder frank 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.780
 were yes or too 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.609
 we still have such under the 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.680
 current bodybuilders or youtube 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.590
 Some people feed them completely vegan 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.819
 and that's a cool thing 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.170
 will pursue this in any case 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.909
 I thank you ever for your time 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.230
 unfortunately have now directly in connection 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.239
 a meeting and need to continue directly 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.810

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.130
 hunger comes after the success of this 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.510

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.510

 namely his contract 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:44.020

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.340
 place ten 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.340
