00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
thinking that Samsung was just going to

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.750 
thinking that Samsung was just going to
go<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.680> extra<00:02:02.710> step<00:02:02.979> because<00:02:03.369> everybody's

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
go the extra step because everybody's

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.219 
go the extra step because everybody's
already<00:02:03.850> doing<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.180> fingerprint<00:02:04.600> scan<00:02:04.810> but

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
already doing the fingerprint scan but

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.330 
already doing the fingerprint scan but
no<00:02:05.380> that's<00:02:05.590> not<00:02:05.740> going<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.040> be<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.159> case

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
no that's not going to be the case

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.639 
no that's not going to be the case
because<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:07.150> iris<00:02:07.450> scanning<00:02:07.750> technology<00:02:08.440> is

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
because the iris scanning technology is

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.650 
because the iris scanning technology is
still<00:02:08.890> in<00:02:09.130> its<00:02:09.220> early<00:02:09.429> stages<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:10.270> never<00:02:10.420> talk

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
still in its early stages to never talk

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.460 
still in its early stages to never talk
about<00:02:10.810> fingerprints

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
about fingerprints

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.630 
about fingerprints
Danny<00:02:11.650> but<00:02:11.860> it's<00:02:11.980> not<00:02:12.100> going<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.310> be<00:02:12.430> on<00:02:12.610> that

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
Danny but it's not going to be on that

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.120 
Danny but it's not going to be on that
you<00:02:12.970> know<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.270> one<00:02:13.480> dedicated<00:02:13.830> button<00:02:14.830> that

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
you know that one dedicated button that

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.010 
you know that one dedicated button that
you<00:02:15.400> know<00:02:15.520> like<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:15.910> iPhone<00:02:16.180> 5s<00:02:16.420> Oh<00:02:16.720> talk

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
you know like the iPhone 5s Oh talk

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.180 
you know like the iPhone 5s Oh talk
about<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.290> fingerprint<00:02:17.710> scanner<00:02:17.920> being

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
about the fingerprint scanner being

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.340 
about the fingerprint scanner being
embedded<00:02:18.520> on<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.850> whole<00:02:19.120> display<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:19.600> then<00:02:20.050> if

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
embedded on the whole display so then if

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.930 
embedded on the whole display so then if
you<00:02:20.470> just<00:02:20.680> swipe<00:02:20.950> down<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.460> scans<00:02:21.790> your

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
you just swipe down it scans your

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.610 
you just swipe down it scans your
fingerprint<00:02:22.510> just<00:02:22.720> like<00:02:22.870> that<00:02:24.720> cool<00:02:25.720> it's<00:02:26.500> a

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
fingerprint just like that cool it's a

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.810 
fingerprint just like that cool it's a
little<00:02:26.830> different<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.220> course<00:02:27.250> Samsung

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
little different of course Samsung

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.700 
little different of course Samsung
they'd<00:02:28.000> like<00:02:28.240> to<00:02:28.270> always<00:02:28.570> set<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.230> bar<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.680> the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
they'd like to always set the bar to the

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.530 
they'd like to always set the bar to the
next<00:02:30.040> level<00:02:30.340> but<00:02:30.460> I<00:02:30.670> still<00:02:31.060> don't<00:02:31.180> see<00:02:31.300> the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
next level but I still don't see the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.060 
next level but I still don't see the
necessity<00:02:31.630> for<00:02:32.110> having<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.590> fingerprint

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
necessity for having a fingerprint

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.320 
necessity for having a fingerprint
scanner<00:02:33.100> I'm<00:02:33.640> going<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.850> you<00:02:33.910> guys<00:02:34.090> think

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
scanner I'm going to you guys think

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.550 
scanner I'm going to you guys think
though<00:02:34.480> about<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.960> I<00:02:35.140> think<00:02:35.320> it's<00:02:35.410> pretty

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
though about that I think it's pretty

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.780 
though about that I think it's pretty
cool<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:35.890> you're<00:02:36.100> going<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.250> embed<00:02:36.550> it<00:02:36.670> in

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
cool that you're going to embed it in

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.280 
cool that you're going to embed it in
the<00:02:36.850> display<00:02:37.120> as<00:02:37.330> opposed<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.720> having<00:02:37.900> on<00:02:38.110> that

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
the display as opposed to having on that

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.810 
the display as opposed to having on that
one<00:02:38.440> button<00:02:38.770> let<00:02:39.100> me<00:02:39.190> know<00:02:39.280> down<00:02:39.430> below<00:02:39.550> in<00:02:39.760> the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
one button let me know down below in the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.100 
one button let me know down below in the
balls<00:02:40.000> here<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.570> we're<00:02:40.690> still<00:02:40.720> talking<00:02:40.930> about

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
balls here and we're still talking about

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.630 
balls here and we're still talking about
the<00:02:41.230> galaxy<00:02:41.560> s5<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:41.980> seems<00:02:42.130> that<00:02:42.250> eldar

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
the galaxy s5 it seems that eldar

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.730 
the galaxy s5 it seems that eldar
something<00:02:43.540> tweeted<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:44.290> out<00:02:44.500> right<00:02:44.680> here

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
something tweeted this out right here

something tweeted this out right here
yeah<00:02:45.540> looks<00:02:46.540> like<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.780> galaxy<00:02:47.320> s5<00:02:47.650> will<00:02:47.680> be

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
yeah looks like the galaxy s5 will be

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.330 
yeah looks like the galaxy s5 will be
unveiled<00:02:48.550> in<00:02:48.850> Barcelona<00:02:49.660> at<00:02:49.830> mwc<00:02:50.830> then<00:02:51.250> it

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
unveiled in Barcelona at mwc then it

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.800 
unveiled in Barcelona at mwc then it
also<00:02:51.459> mentions<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:52.000> launch<00:02:52.180> will<00:02:52.390> be<00:02:52.510> at<00:02:52.660> the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
also mentions the launch will be at the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.990 
also mentions the launch will be at the
end<00:02:52.990> of<00:02:53.200> April<00:02:53.740> and<00:02:54.070> we<00:02:54.250> are<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.520> earth<00:02:54.640> specs

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
end of April and we are in earth specs

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.520 
end of April and we are in earth specs
and<00:02:55.240> the<00:02:55.540> fact<00:02:55.780> that<00:02:55.900> it's<00:02:56.080> going<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.350> have<00:02:56.500> a

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
and the fact that it's going to have a

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.710 
and the fact that it's going to have a
new<00:02:56.709> TouchWiz<00:02:57.130> probably<00:02:57.580> that<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.240> that<00:02:58.630> we

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
new TouchWiz probably that you I that we

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.120 
new TouchWiz probably that you I that we
saw<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:58.990> beginning<00:02:59.320> of<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.470> show<00:02:59.680> that's

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
saw the beginning of the show that's

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.980 
saw the beginning of the show that's
interesting<00:03:00.550> stuff<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.940> lot<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.240> galaxy<00:03:01.630> s5

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
interesting stuff a lot of galaxy s5

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.380 
interesting stuff a lot of galaxy s5
well<00:03:02.380> confirmed<00:03:02.920> things<00:03:03.520> it<00:03:03.820> seems<00:03:04.000> like<00:03:04.270> the

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
well confirmed things it seems like the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.840 
well confirmed things it seems like the
galaxy<00:03:04.720> s5<00:03:04.990> is<00:03:05.020> going<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.500> show<00:03:05.620> up<00:03:05.800> and<00:03:05.950> mwc

just like a lot of people speculated
it's<00:03:08.500> going<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.680> be<00:03:08.800> running<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.130> new<00:03:09.400> TouchWiz

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
it's going to be running a new TouchWiz

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.449
