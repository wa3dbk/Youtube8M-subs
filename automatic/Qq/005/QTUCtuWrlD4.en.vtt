00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello you love today, there is that 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.379
 recipe from the homemade photos 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.320
 that I already have you in the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.400
 have shown before days as the first take 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.320
 we boiled about 250 grams 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.970
 chickpeas I have this over then 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.270
 soaked and then the next night 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.730
 cooked for 45 minutes a day 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.180
 I personally notice that rather than the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.119
 finish cooking out of the can while doing that 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.309
 of course now like some time in 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.710
 demanding increases 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:38.660
 then I'll give you the juice first 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.660
 add half a lemon 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.170
 Part 2 garlic cloves that's one now 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.190
 very big and a medium you have to 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.210
 Do not cut her short now either 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.210
 because it is tried immediately 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.770
 At about yes, I would say one 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.420
 half teaspoon communen that it 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.979
 of course, I like taste now 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.960
 really like it when not 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:23.130
 quite as much is there but needs even 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:25.040
 decide how much you want to live then 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.290
 I take some pepper from the mill 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.280
 also a matter of taste I will 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:38.160
 then also to taste again 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:40.050
 and then spice things up then take it 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.920
 I have some salt that should now good one 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.920
 be teaspoon 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.349
 then come two teaspoons of the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.940
 sweet peppers if you sheep 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.080
 Of course you can also get some of that 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.080
 add sharp 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:33.319
 then I'll take about 200 now 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:36.220
 Milliliters of water to watch first 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.390
 the consistency of those must then 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.980
 I like it or keep it halfway 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.079
 But I would like to have liquid water 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.019
 You can give the technique afterwards 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:47.349
 then I take four tablespoons now 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.349
 olive oil 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.040
 The whole thing is now synonymous for neat 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.040
 cures 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:29.470
 I still give about 100 meters of water 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.470
 because that means something too tight 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.230
 that again 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:53.950
 Now finally I know that 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:53.950
 Tallinn, of which three teaspoons 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.530
 read that it is better first 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.560
 to add afterwards 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.560
 because that is so bad mashed 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:23.449
 then just share everything with problems and 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.060
 would it then stop something like 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:29.570
 the field is a matter of taste like 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.830
 I would like to have something intense for that and myself 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.830
 I'm still a bit rubbery 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.179
 hmm 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.749
 but soon also salt 

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:03.369
 paprika 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.190
 but stir everything well again 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.520
 and, as the case may be, it's more fluid 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.129
 would like to have something else then 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.899
 add water if you have something firmer 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:32.939
 would like to just let some water 

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:35.689
 away and so does the whole of then 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:37.830
 but some fresh parsley 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:39.689
 added hole has the paprika powder 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.699
 or you can do the whole thing too 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:44.159
 Serve fried mushrooms or 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:46.139
 as I showed in the beginning with the 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:48.990
 feature bread i hope you have that 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.460
 I wish you much fun 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.939
 imitate and say to the 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.939
 next time
