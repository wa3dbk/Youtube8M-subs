teleport you up now by any means this
isn't<00:01:02.160> easy<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.640> does<00:01:02.850> take<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.239> little<00:01:03.510> bit<00:01:03.660> of

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
isn't easy it does take a little bit of

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.929 
isn't easy it does take a little bit of
practice<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.470> get<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.769> hang<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.670> once<00:01:05.820> you

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
practice to get the hang of but once you

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.030 
practice to get the hang of but once you
guys<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.299> figured<00:01:06.540> out<00:01:06.780> how<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> blink<00:01:07.680> jump

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
guys have figured out how to blink jump

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.580 
guys have figured out how to blink jump
/<00:01:08.460> 3<00:01:08.790> times<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.180> then<00:01:09.299> blink<00:01:09.600> again<00:01:09.750> it'll<00:01:10.470> be

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
/ 3 times and then blink again it'll be

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.440 
/ 3 times and then blink again it'll be
really<00:01:10.860> really<00:01:11.070> easy<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.700> do<00:01:11.820> took<00:01:12.090> me<00:01:12.240> about

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
really really easy to do took me about

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.090 
really really easy to do took me about
five<00:01:12.720> or<00:01:12.900> six<00:01:13.049> tries<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.560> actually<00:01:13.890> get<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
five or six tries to actually get the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.010 
five or six tries to actually get the
hang<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:15.330> once<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.600> guys<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.930> it

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
hang of this but once you guys have it

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.690 
hang of this but once you guys have it
down<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.409> going<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.619> be<00:01:16.710> pretty<00:01:16.950> easy<00:01:17.340> so

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
down it's going to be pretty easy so

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.219 
down it's going to be pretty easy so
from<00:01:17.909> there<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.180> your<00:01:18.360> solar<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:18.990> go<00:01:19.140> ahead

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
from there if your solar just go ahead

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.109 
from there if your solar just go ahead
kill<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> enemies<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> ogre<00:01:20.520> spawn<00:01:20.820> and

kill the enemies to the ogre spawn and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.940

then kill the ogres and then you're done

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.410 
then kill the ogres and then you're done
with<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.729> teammates<00:01:23.970> with<00:01:24.299> you
