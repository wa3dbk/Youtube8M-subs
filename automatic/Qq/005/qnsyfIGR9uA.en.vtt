everything else a good strong tripod is

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:31.089 
everything else a good strong tripod is
extremely<00:02:24.660> important

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.589 

okay<00:02:31.579> one<00:02:31.730> of<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.879> most<00:02:32.000> important<00:02:32.450> things

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
okay one of the most important things

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.199 
okay one of the most important things
also<00:02:33.079> is<00:02:33.739> a<00:02:33.799> cable<00:02:34.280> release<00:02:34.549> a<00:02:34.730> good<00:02:34.969> cable

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
also is a cable release a good cable

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.119 
also is a cable release a good cable
release<00:02:35.599> just<00:02:36.200> about<00:02:36.409> every<00:02:36.620> company<00:02:36.769> makes

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
ones for their cameras I don't like

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.630 
ones for their cameras I don't like
infrared<00:02:39.290> cable<00:02:39.799> releases<00:02:40.219> because<00:02:40.519> they

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
infrared cable releases because they

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.030 
infrared cable releases because they
have<00:02:40.730> batteries<00:02:41.120> in<00:02:41.150> them<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.659> I<00:02:42.469> just<00:02:42.500> don't

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
have batteries in them and I just don't

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.170 
have batteries in them and I just don't
like<00:02:43.159> things<00:02:43.400> with<00:02:43.549> batteries<00:02:43.909> in<00:02:44.030> them

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
like things with batteries in them

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.910 
like things with batteries in them
because<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.659> will<00:02:44.780> invariably<00:02:45.379> always<00:02:45.739> going

wire cable release really really really

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.380 
wire cable release really really really
important

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
important

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.569 
important
I<00:02:50.420> like<00:02:50.870> them<00:02:51.079> a<00:02:51.140> lot<00:02:51.530> any<00:02:51.709> kind<00:02:52.069> of<00:02:52.159> vertical

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
I like them a lot any kind of vertical

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.280 
I like them a lot any kind of vertical
movement<00:02:52.609> on<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.209> camera<00:02:53.599> or<00:02:53.629> any<00:02:53.959> kind<00:02:54.230> of

movement on the camera or any kind of

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.530 
movement on the camera or any kind of
movement<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.769> just<00:02:55.010> gets<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.340> away<00:02:55.760> from<00:02:55.819> any

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
movement it just gets you away from any

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
with movement in the camera you want to

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.129 
with movement in the camera you want to
stop<00:03:00.980> all<00:03:01.219> the<00:03:01.400> movement<00:03:01.849> another<00:03:02.569> really

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.139 
stop all the movement another really

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.599 
stop all the movement another really
important<00:03:03.590> thing<00:03:03.650> is<00:03:04.120> mirror<00:03:05.120> lock-up<00:03:06.549> 99%<00:03:07.549> of

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
important thing is mirror lock-up 99% of

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.429 
important thing is mirror lock-up 99% of
most<00:03:07.849> of<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.180> modern<00:03:08.359> cameras<00:03:08.900> have<00:03:09.079> mirror

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
most of the modern cameras have mirror

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.099 
most of the modern cameras have mirror
lock-up<00:03:09.739> mirror<00:03:10.340> lock-up<00:03:10.519> is<00:03:10.939> another<00:03:11.419> step

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
lock-up mirror lock-up is another step

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.280 
lock-up mirror lock-up is another step
towards<00:03:13.069> getting<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.519> good<00:03:14.090> solid<00:03:14.659> focus<00:03:15.109> and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
towards getting you good solid focus and

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.500 
towards getting you good solid focus and
no<00:03:15.590> camera<00:03:16.040> movement<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:16.639> locks<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.150> mirror

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
no camera movement it locks the mirror

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.949 
no camera movement it locks the mirror
up<00:03:17.629> so<00:03:18.109> there's<00:03:18.379> no<00:03:19.180> vibration<00:03:20.180> when<00:03:20.750> that

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
up so there's no vibration when that

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.349 
up so there's no vibration when that
shutter<00:03:21.260> goes<00:03:21.530> off<00:03:21.769> especially<00:03:22.639> it's<00:03:23.120> slower

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
shutter goes off especially it's slower
