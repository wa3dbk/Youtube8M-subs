still heading downhill you could easily
lose<00:03:26.510> it<00:03:26.690> here<00:03:26.870> when<00:03:27.050> it's<00:03:27.170> wet<00:03:28.630> then<00:03:29.630> we<00:03:29.810> go

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
lose it here when it's wet then we go

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.200 
lose it here when it's wet then we go
into<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.500> last<00:03:30.710> turn<00:03:31.330> quick<00:03:32.330> tie<00:03:32.540> chains<00:03:34.210> we
