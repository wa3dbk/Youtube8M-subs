00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.300
 a child looked not to write a letter 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.770
 at one point he asked 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.329
 if writing a story about us 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:12.329
 I'm sorry for that 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.829
 nana stopped skype and substitutes and drawings. 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.820
 indeed 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.369
 I'm writing about you 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.730
 however more important than the bass 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.640
 used mattress 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.999
 I would love to be so honest 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:28.730
 mail 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.899
 the computer virus. 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.030
 special ingredients 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.030
 the identity all a ticketone felt my 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.380
 it depends on the way you look at things 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.790
 there are 5 qualities in it that you will be able to maintain 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.390
 they will always make you a man at peace with the world 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.950
 Prime quality 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.890
 you can do great things 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.020
 but you must never forget that there is a hand who guides ikea pax 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.400
 this hand in the tip 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.620
 and he 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.620
 tidore always direct towards his will 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.670
 second quality 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.670
 from time to time I have to interrupt what I'm writing 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.980
 and use the mat 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.090
 this causes the pencil on the fantabook 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.170
 But in the end 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.170
 it will be sharper 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.560
 know how to bear a little pain 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.560
 because some will make a person better 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.780
 poor quality 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.860
 the pencil always allows us to use an eraser to erase mistakes 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.140
 you understand that to correct something we have done 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.470
 it's not necessarily bad 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.760
 but something fundamental to keep us on the right path 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.570
 fourth quality 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.960
 what is really important in the pencil is not the wood or the shape 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.890
 outward 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.650
 but the graphics inside 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.970
 therefore 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.970
 always pay attention to what's going on inside you 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.780
 finally the fifth quality of the pencil 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.369
 always leave a gentleman 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.819
 probably 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.810
 know that everything you do in life bearshare attack us 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:23.419
 kitchen 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:27.610
 and if we know each other of everything here, 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.490
 caution
