directly<00:00:10.830> straight<00:00:11.190> into<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.580> Sun<00:00:11.790> so<00:00:12.300> it's

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
directly straight into the Sun so it's

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.170 
directly straight into the Sun so it's
backlight<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.260> the<00:00:13.890> sky<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.640> the<00:00:14.970> area

landscape<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.300> have<00:00:19.230> four<00:00:19.650> exposures<00:00:20.070> but

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
landscape I have four exposures but

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.649 
landscape I have four exposures but
three<00:00:21.239> of<00:00:21.359> them<00:00:21.570> are<00:00:21.869> for<00:00:22.230> dynamic<00:00:22.650> range<00:00:22.890> and

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:23.659 
three of them are for dynamic range and

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:27.079 
three of them are for dynamic range and
two<00:00:24.659> of<00:00:24.810> them<00:00:24.989> are<00:00:25.259> the<00:00:26.039> same<00:00:26.279> exposure<00:00:26.669> value

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:27.089 
two of them are the same exposure value

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.720 
two of them are the same exposure value
for<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.359> background<00:00:27.810> one<00:00:28.499> with<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.339> Sun

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
for the background one with this Sun

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.690 
for the background one with this Sun
flare<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.419> then<00:00:31.050> another<00:00:31.289> with<00:00:31.919> my<00:00:32.369> thumb

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
flare and then another with my thumb

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.310 
flare and then another with my thumb
over<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.149> Sun<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.840> something<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.199> a

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
over the Sun and this something I do a

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.459 
over the Sun and this something I do a
lot<00:00:34.559> I'll<00:00:35.550> put<00:00:36.030> my<00:00:36.180> thumb<00:00:36.420> over<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> Sun<00:00:37.050> to

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
lot I'll put my thumb over the Sun to

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.860 
lot I'll put my thumb over the Sun to
take<00:00:37.859> out<00:00:38.039> the<00:00:38.219> flare<00:00:38.519> and<00:00:38.760> then<00:00:39.179> I<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.480> decide

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
take out the flare and then I can decide

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.410 
take out the flare and then I can decide
later<00:00:40.469> how<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.309> blend<00:00:41.579> those<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.179> where<00:00:42.390> I

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
later how to blend those and where I

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.880 
later how to blend those and where I
want<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.840> flare<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.230> be<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.500> where<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.739> don't

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
want the flare to be in where I don't

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.650 
want the flare to be in where I don't
want<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.429> be<00:00:44.550> also<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:45.480> you'll<00:00:45.600> notice

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
want it to be also if you'll notice

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.410 
want it to be also if you'll notice
between<00:00:46.170> those<00:00:46.559> two<00:00:46.829> later<00:00:47.070> exposures<00:00:47.730> these

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
between those two later exposures these

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.329 
between those two later exposures these
lupine<00:00:48.870> are<00:00:48.960> really<00:00:49.469> blowing<00:00:49.739> around<00:00:49.949> a<00:00:50.190> lot

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
lupine are really blowing around a lot

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.729 
lupine are really blowing around a lot
even<00:00:50.609> though<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.059> almost<00:00:51.449> windless<00:00:52.079> so

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
even though it was almost windless so

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.959 
even though it was almost windless so
some<00:00:53.489> have<00:00:54.530> sharper<00:00:55.530> lupine<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.100> some<00:00:56.640> areas

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
some have sharper lupine in some areas

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.759 
some have sharper lupine in some areas
and<00:00:57.269> some<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.929> the<00:00:58.019> others<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.440> hopefully

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
and some of the others so hopefully

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.529 
and some of the others so hopefully
between<00:00:59.070> those<00:00:59.249> two<00:00:59.460> exposures<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.359> get

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
between those two exposures I can get

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.030 
between those two exposures I can get
all<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.379> my<00:01:01.460> my<00:01:02.460> Lupin<00:01:02.820> sharp<00:01:03.260> then<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.739> next

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
all of my my Lupin sharp then the next

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.230 
all of my my Lupin sharp then the next
exposure<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.850> correct<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.870> most<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.440> the<00:01:07.560> sky

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
exposure is correct for most of the sky

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
around the Sun and then this darkest

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.180 
around the Sun and then this darkest
exposure<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.810> area<00:01:16.140> around<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.920> Sun

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.570 
exposure is for the area around the Sun
you'll<00:01:18.090> notice<00:01:18.480> that<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:19.290> exact<00:01:19.740> Sun<00:01:20.070> itself

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
you'll notice that the exact Sun itself

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.620 
you'll notice that the exact Sun itself
is<00:01:21.140> still<00:01:22.190> overexposed<00:01:23.190> this<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.330> always<00:01:24.510> a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
is still overexposed this is always a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.540 
is still overexposed this is always a
challenge<00:01:25.050> for<00:01:25.230> me<00:01:25.410> to<00:01:25.440> decide<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.310> know<00:01:26.400> how

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
challenge for me to decide you know how

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.900 
challenge for me to decide you know how
far<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.850> go<00:01:26.970> with<00:01:27.440> pulling<00:01:28.440> back<00:01:28.620> the<00:01:28.830> Sun<00:01:29.070> to

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
far to go with pulling back the Sun to

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.580 
far to go with pulling back the Sun to
my<00:01:30.060> eye<00:01:30.090> when<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.570> look<00:01:30.840> at<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.080> Sun<00:01:31.290> that's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
my eye when I look at the Sun that's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.550 
my eye when I look at the Sun that's
about<00:01:32.190> what<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.700> see<00:01:32.940> if<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.660> behind<00:01:33.990> some

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
about what I can see if it's behind some

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.140 
about what I can see if it's behind some
cloud<00:01:34.770> layers<00:01:35.070> which<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.670> behind<00:01:35.940> some

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
cloud layers which this is behind some

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.300 
cloud layers which this is behind some
thin<00:01:36.360> clouds<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:37.620> it's<00:01:37.740> behind<00:01:37.920> some

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
thin clouds but if it's behind some

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.890 
thin clouds but if it's behind some
strong<00:01:38.730> cloud<00:01:39.060> layers<00:01:39.330> I<00:01:39.480> might<00:01:39.630> be<00:01:39.750> able<00:01:39.840> to

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
strong cloud layers I might be able to

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.540 
strong cloud layers I might be able to
see<00:01:40.080> more<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.620> with<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> naked<00:01:41.160> eye<00:01:41.280> but

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
see more of it with the naked eye but

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.640 
see more of it with the naked eye but
getting<00:01:42.510> it<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.750> look<00:01:43.080> right<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.500> look

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
getting it to look right and look

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.170 
getting it to look right and look
natural<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.250> having<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.700> right<00:01:44.880> amount<00:01:45.120> of

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
natural and having the right amount of

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.400 
natural and having the right amount of
brightness<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.660> the<00:01:45.780> Sun<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.140> always<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
brightness in the Sun is always a

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.500 
brightness in the Sun is always a
question<00:01:46.800> so<00:01:47.180> potentially<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.210> could<00:01:48.240> have

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
question so potentially I could have

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.660 
question so potentially I could have
gone<00:01:48.660> even<00:01:49.050> a<00:01:49.260> few<00:01:49.620> more<00:01:49.740> exposures<00:01:50.220> darker

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
gone even a few more exposures darker

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.280 
gone even a few more exposures darker
and<00:01:50.820> maybe<00:01:50.970> tried<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.330> get<00:01:51.450> an<00:01:51.540> actual<00:01:51.660> disc<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
and maybe tried to get an actual disc of

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.400 
and maybe tried to get an actual disc of
the<00:01:52.320> Sun<00:01:52.620> but<00:01:53.460> we're<00:01:54.000> also<00:01:54.180> not<00:01:54.410> unaccustomed

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
the Sun but we're also not unaccustomed

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.350 
the Sun but we're also not unaccustomed
to<00:01:55.500> seeing<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:56.280> know<00:01:56.400> a<00:01:56.430> white<00:01:56.760> ball<00:01:57.000> for<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
to seeing you know a white ball for the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.560 
to seeing you know a white ball for the
Sun<00:01:57.570> either<00:01:58.550> okay<00:01:59.550> let's<00:01:59.850> work<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.270> blend

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
Sun either okay let's work this blend

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.600 
Sun either okay let's work this blend
the<00:02:01.170> first<00:02:01.470> thing<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.770> want<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.010> do<00:02:02.190> I<00:02:02.220> think

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
the first thing I want to do I think

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.980 
the first thing I want to do I think
from<00:02:02.910> this<00:02:03.420> darker<00:02:03.960> exposure

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
from this darker exposure

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.350 
from this darker exposure
yeah<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:05.770> think<00:02:05.979> from<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.370> darkest<00:02:06.880> exposure

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
yeah I think from the darkest exposure

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.490 
yeah I think from the darkest exposure
and<00:02:07.570> we'll<00:02:07.659> see<00:02:07.869> if<00:02:07.960> that's<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.319> right<00:02:08.470> choice

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
and we'll see if that's the right choice

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.630 
and we'll see if that's the right choice
later<00:02:09.069> but<00:02:09.459> I<00:02:09.700> need<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:10.330> make<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:11.310> selection<00:02:12.310> for

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
later but I need to make a selection for

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.490 
later but I need to make a selection for
that<00:02:12.790> skyline<00:02:13.330> that<00:02:13.569> hard<00:02:13.810> skyline<00:02:14.350> is

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
that skyline that hard skyline is

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.010 
that skyline that hard skyline is
something<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.069> I<00:02:15.280> may<00:02:15.910> end<00:02:16.150> up<00:02:16.240> needing<00:02:16.510> and

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
something that I may end up needing and

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:25.760 
something that I may end up needing and
using<00:02:17.500> later<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:19.270> let's<00:02:19.600> zoom<00:02:19.690> in<00:02:20.080> on<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:22.739> and

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.000 

refine<00:02:26.770> it

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
refine it

00:02:28.010 --> 00:04:30.960 
refine it
