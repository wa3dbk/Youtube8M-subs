00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
know the program already that it's a oh

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.690 
know the program already that it's a oh
it's<00:00:33.180> an<00:00:33.300> overclocker

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
it's an overclocker

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.490 
it's an overclocker
yes<00:00:35.700> that's<00:00:36.059> what<00:00:36.270> its<00:00:36.420> primary<00:00:36.780> purpose<00:00:37.380> is

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
yes that's what its primary purpose is

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.810 
yes that's what its primary purpose is
but<00:00:37.890> inside<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.940> has<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.660> ability<00:00:39.809> to

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
but inside it it has the ability to

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.560 
but inside it it has the ability to
record<00:00:41.820> your<00:00:42.329> gameplay<00:00:42.540> at<00:00:43.219> high<00:00:44.570> high

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
record your gameplay at high high

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.979 
record your gameplay at high high
quality<00:00:45.649> with<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.969> close<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.120> no<00:00:48.239> lat<00:00:48.510> actually

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
quality with a close to no lat actually

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.350 
quality with a close to no lat actually
I'd<00:00:49.260> say<00:00:49.469> no<00:00:49.649> lag<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.129> haven't<00:00:50.550> experienced<00:00:51.270> any

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
I'd say no lag I haven't experienced any

this<00:01:23.520> zoom<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.119> basically<00:01:24.479> how<00:01:24.750> big<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.200> want

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
this zoom is basically how big you want

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.289 
this zoom is basically how big you want
the<00:01:25.619> thing<00:01:25.860> at<00:01:26.070> your<00:01:26.189> corner<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.150> i

the thing at your corner to be and i

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.620 
the thing at your corner to be and i
usually<00:01:27.450> keep<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.930> about<00:01:28.200> their<00:01:29.390> viewport<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
usually keep it about their viewport and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.690 
usually keep it about their viewport and
on<00:01:32.390> okay<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.450> keep<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.439> open<00:01:34.710> actually<00:01:35.070> hit

keep it away from your screen if you do

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.930 
keep it away from your screen if you do
just<00:02:15.960> figure<00:02:16.620> around<00:02:16.920> with<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.190> now<00:02:17.730> here's

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
just figure around with that now here's

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.270 
just figure around with that now here's
where<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.180> magic<00:02:18.660> comes<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:19.110> video<00:02:19.770> capture

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
where the magic comes in video capture

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.680 
where the magic comes in video capture
this<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.640> going<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.880> be<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.090> button<00:02:21.330> that

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
this is going to be the button that

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.500 
this is going to be the button that

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
less space frame size full frame would

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.540 
less space frame size full frame would
be<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.450> full<00:02:54.750> frame<00:02:55.140> or<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.710> can<00:02:56.070> choose<00:02:56.280> to

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
be the full frame or you can choose to

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.040 
be the full frame or you can choose to
readjust<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:58.130> 1080p<00:02:59.130> or<00:02:59.160> 720p<00:02:59.870> 720p<00:03:00.870> is

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
readjust it to 1080p or 720p 720p is

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.660 
readjust it to 1080p or 720p 720p is
really<00:03:01.560> useful<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:01.980> some<00:03:02.190> people<00:03:02.400> because<00:03:02.550> you
