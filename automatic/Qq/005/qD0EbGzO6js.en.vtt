 we will try to go up to division 6 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.119
 so I always have the same team 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.880
 the barclays first league to two hundred 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.800
 thousand 250 mines credit apart from a new 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.350

 showed all the best moments of 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.030
 the video because otherwise it would be too much 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.100
 long video to last at least 20 minutes 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.690
 so here are the opponents it's a 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:53.190
 Bundesliga wen slick team with ea 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:58.050
 mobile is 20 brunette farfan does not see 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.969
 not very good sub otish nald oh ok 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.000
 so here we start live with actually 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.189
 sequences on my defense that I you 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.790
 had spoken manga the company really 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.830
 a huge defense here since 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.600
 the first half was not so good 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.729
 I put these sequences for you 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.340
 fill in a little bit otherwise there would be even 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.990
 not had a first half so there will be 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.240
 full of small sequences with in 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.060
 defense and attack right now 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.590
 with the first chance of the match at the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.720
 second minute of the excellent that makes 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.530
 the pass to ramsey that marks the opening 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.939
 of the score 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.409
 ramsey I told you a middle 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.210
 defensive which marks a lot that goes up 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.970
 which is projected high enough and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:41.939
 the openness of ramsey's score is 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.350
 still and that's still the defense the 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.259
 airline dueling defense 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.399
 untouchable again there I you 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.460
 show some of the sequences of 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:54.149
 company that recovers who plays well who 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.829
 cut the trajectory well and who can 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.140
 to be as technical as we can 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.170
 see him who is able to eliminate 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.170
 opponents 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.170
 when I told you dogfights 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.880
 really huge 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.860
 here he was feet enough 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.120
 up and has it directly houellebecq 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.940
 houellebecq you said he was 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.040
 monstrous who manages to eliminate any 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.690
 the defense individually it is very 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.940
 very very much attention houellebecq who 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.300
 present themselves to this goal a second goal 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.870
 goal where she beck who signs his 35th goal 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.510
 out of 22 games this is really a 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.780
 huge ratio houellebecq is really 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.610
 simply monstrous for the price 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.950
 70.8 general but really huge 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.570
 she sent a huge action yet 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.980
 once that limits the whole defense he 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.019
 come to this goal the lob 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.760
 and that's the crossbar ah 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.380
 I was really very of when 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.830
 I saw that so it's half-time 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.370
 a bit boring game but good 2 0 it's 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.239
 what matters 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.130
 we want the rise again a new 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.600
 occasion attention wahlbeck call balloon 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.090
 who replay with ozil that's it should 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.540
 throw his two players are really 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.130
 enormous 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.410
 this is tension I present I eliminate the 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.769
 Guardian I Eliminate The Guardian Game Lobe The 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.959
 goalkeeper and not the opposing player saved 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.870
 on the line 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:19.079
 and there a small center of a small center 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.209
 and the farfan's head 2 to 2.1 it's going to be 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.579
 very very very very tight from 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:28.079
 now he in the reverse we will try 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:29.459
 to push in attack but I did not say 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.260
 my last word with ericsson who is going 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.209
 take a free- kick a free-kick 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.560
 attention you'll see and boom again 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.510
 the room presence still the cross 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.560
 for the second time the first time 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.290
 it was with houellebecq and his lob 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.549
 alas eric sehn his free kick 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.739
 and watch out and keep pushing 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:53.640
 continues to push the head that goes to 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:55.459
 dick side of the post mattich mcit who is going 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.810
 look for a solution his side with 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.150
 ericsson ericsson for his bad match 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.769
 which is huge clichÃ© that goes between 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.480
 the two who mine them and 2 who does the 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:08.190
 pass to houellebecq houellebecq not 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.690
 quits for ozil and the defense that 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.700
 recovers the ball and firs 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.620
 in counter attack but company 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.049
 always present with mangal really 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.130
 huge 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.989
 and that's it plays frankly that plays at 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.489
 200 per hour a pool of 1 attention 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.540
 houellebecq who will be facing the 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:29.520
 goalkeeper eliminates opponent and that's the 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:32.140
 purpose against his unfortunate side payment 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.910
 here we can see in slow motion he has 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.240
 really bad luck but hey it stays 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.610
 a goal 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.550
 this is actually the touch of the knee and 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.470
 is this the five-year-old mekong eric sehn for 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.870
 houellebecq houellebecq who will be 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.160
 present facing the guardian and not then 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.150
 it's going to be a free kick draw of 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.530
 pet shirt 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.630
 second free kick is what we are going to 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.890
 to succeed will we succeed it 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.440
 we're going to mark it, are we going 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:59.140
 still make a crossbar 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:03.100
 you will see that with the eric always sehn 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:06.460
 xl and cases are ripe and it's on the 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:10.080
 guardian and there I leave you a moment 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.080
 live live and live it's good 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.980
 what it will 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.660
 the supporters are already in the process of 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.700
 jump on they know that their team 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.170
 is only in turn on the note and 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.430

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:40.530
 I tell you I 'm going to pass that I 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.640
 will pass to ramsey who will score 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.890
 that's wonderful 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:51.490
 four hours is beautiful 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:53.530
