00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
and streetwalker look so this will help

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.940

fix that this is labeled as a concealer
but<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.160> consider<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.790> more<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.150> highlighting

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
but I consider it more of a highlighting

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.449 
but I consider it more of a highlighting
or<00:02:46.900> brightening<00:02:47.410> product<00:02:47.830> since<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.190> doesn't

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
or brightening product since it doesn't

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.330 
or brightening product since it doesn't
really<00:02:48.580> provide<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:49.000> lot<00:02:49.120> of<00:02:49.300> coverage<00:02:53.340> then

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
really provide a lot of coverage then
