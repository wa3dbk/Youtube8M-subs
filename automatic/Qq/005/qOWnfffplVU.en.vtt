00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.180
 hello ultimate from the gt side yours 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.650
 talking games or the very voice 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.060
 ringing because I woke up there 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.730
 eight and a half in the morning to study 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.400
 since tomorrow tomorrow at the now lady 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.480
 of maturity and I'm doing a 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.500
 commentary now because essentially 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.210
 milan 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.880
 our very dear very good friend 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.320
 Milan yesterday at half past midnight 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.579
 writes days we can make a comment 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.280
 technical 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.320
 no I can not I have to sleep but that's nothing 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.050
 anyway it is doing so now 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.019
 so much just to free up a little 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.800
 mind from the bullshit that in physics art 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.530
 history 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.730
 never mind by then anyway guys 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.519
 to what we propose today is 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.469
 the introduction of our jts never that 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.940
 actually before we had raven now 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.850
 we have never enough nothing 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.890
 are 151 kg on workstations the only one on new 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.019
 town as you can see there is also inside 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.640
 a nuclear is the weapon and the star 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.170
 silenced but if you have any questions 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.370
 on the class on the study of game like 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.890
 I always tell you to write it in the comments 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.620
 which will certainly be for sure 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.060
 glad to answer you there maybe explains 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.000
 okay except bullshit guys 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.860
 I would like to talk to you today, let's say the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.110
 behavior that boys have underneath 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.910
 exam because there are guys like one 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.220
 lot of my friends who are taken 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.610
 bad but not bad for these 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.500
 exams 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.720
 which on Saturday at 11 and a half 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.420
 they were still studying Saturday 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.920
 when they had the proof on Monday, me 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.120
 I ask Saturday is sacrosanct on Saturday 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.460
 even more evening you can't go wrong 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.800
 so much and then maybe they will do too 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.970
 not disgust but still fail to 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.730
 have those results that you 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.770
 they would wait because the tension plays 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.230
 bad jokes I tell you guys me 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.260
 instead I am one of those people who do 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.610
 it is relatively studied but I am not 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.930
 taken down so badly 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.030
 and in any case good results 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.550
 members have arrived but not because 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.980
 I'm smart not because I am 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.280
 something strange are abnormal 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.140
 a pen at this moment and why 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.600
 essentially most guys in my opinion is 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.520
 the more you can take we say with 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.980
 very quietly philosophy things 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.240
 the more the results are able to give true 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.750
 better because if the predisposed 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.130
 mentally working and let's say 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.620
 quietly and therefore manages to 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.830
 think better while staring at yourself 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.330
 say on a so appearance or no lo 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.280
 will go wrong or in any case I have to study a 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.560
 handcuff because I don't know anything 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.210
 then ideas get confused as you study 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.100
 too much all in one 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.980
 instant then of all the ideas yes 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.110
 confuse therefore it is on a beautiful one 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.600
 biscuit a nice shed and what I 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.890
 I tried to avoid it of course but 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.660
 because essentially exams guys 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.580
 they look more at knowledge than at 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.230
 skills that a person has managed to 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.680
 acquire over the years 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.360
 therefore it is useless to study with so much you 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.950
 james is not that nothing should be given 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.380
 this I am not saying absolutely 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.380
 This will happen anyway and you can 61 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.380
 he was able to study a step for 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.360
 step during the year almost useless 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.459
 pass the whole thing over at the end 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.120
 of the year because of the things you have 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.350
 acquired the acquired and the examinations 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.270
 we say I don't know don't ask you things 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.070
 specific TVs ask the general a bit 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.489
 and they ask you to understand the capacity 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.100
 sorry to know how to connect the various 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.890
 things therefore still more than buy 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.470
 knowledge is based on the skills of 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.450
 exams and that's why my friends got me 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.890
 they did the bales because Saturday 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.020
 if I asked and siliqua new I have to 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.150
 study and tell us no I have to study but 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.209
 theme first take a little less pain 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.739
 urgent even writing to me no 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.230
 I am in crisis 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.110
 hi how are you calm there is only the script 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.180
 and oh well is a bit so the other hand outfit 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.250
 but essentially guys what 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.260
 I want to tell you 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.180
 don't be too fixated if you have 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.040
 the middle school exams there 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.670
 you have already finished anyway or anyway 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.400
 also in the future 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.110
 don't worry because they are easy 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.220
 they are really easy if you succeed in 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.720
 take with philosophy 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.400
 that is, not with philosophy now it is not that 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.650
 you have to get there that in smoking a 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.860
 nice cannon first and write things though 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.870
 however I swear to you I found them 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.030
 even the members are really simple 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.610
 then I saw a couple of hours at the oral gods 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.530
 my companions and in any case having 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.650
 self-presentation your thesis nava 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.980
 expose manages to prepare at the beginning 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.160
 professors and can also direct them 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.320
 on the questions that can then do you 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.100
 therefore it is essentially not 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.300
 difficult 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.010
 I mean, I was really surprised how 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.570
 it has studied relatively little 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.980
 for these exams and if he has succeeded 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.630
 have pretty good results 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.040
 certainly not that it will now take 80 though 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.510
 anyway my 70 or from high school 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.610
 scientific I can pull it off if 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.400
 They do a good oral tomorrow go 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.510
 I already told you tomorrow, among other things 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.540
 that's what I saw these 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.840
 guys don't focus too much on 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.660
 on the notions because the world is not 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.690
 fact of notions is not made of facts 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.030
 that is, it is not made of facts but it is if yes 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.060
 can manage to develop 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.800
 above all the skills are everything 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.610
 all much simpler and 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.699
 emas essentially that I wanted to tell you 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.960
 because I tell you not only not only that 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.509
 boy who has never studied so much 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.310
 this year I have worked very little 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:23.650
 but the right one could 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.930
 indeed affect the results to 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.970
 end , however, boys are administered 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.199
 and now I have one minute left 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.150
 nothing to always say this beginning 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.680
 greet you then if the gameplay is there 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.060
 liked passed by the never channel 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.830
 because it really has to grow because it is 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.930
 just at the beginning then bam bam bam 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.240
 send subscribe to his channel because 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.080
 however since the gameplay is 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.030
 lots of stuff 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.949
 and if the comment is long and well liked 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.199
 I hope you enjoyed it a little more though 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:50.229
 morally reflective 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.580
 ethical and please pass by mine 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.520
 channel to be held in description 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.410
 boys and 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.389
 and essentially what I wanted is enough 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.550
 tell it is precisely this is I leave the 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:01.289
 last 30 seconds of gameplay here since 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.819
 your professionally we play everything 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.819
 peace love and infinite joy 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:39.440
 you don't like igt and piled up arrival
