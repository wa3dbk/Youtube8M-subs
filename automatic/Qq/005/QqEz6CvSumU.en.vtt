 Hello everyone, today we will go with you 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.680
 to the airport, the traditional hears 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.080
 such cases wishes a good flight 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.670
 we won't be able to planes there for a long time 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.919
 fly a runway overgrown with grass 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.240
 Airport in Ussuriisk appeared at the beginning 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.400
 the sixties he was not far from 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.529
 cities a little further than the area saw settlement and 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.570
 short of Baranovsky to the airport 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.640
 it was possible to take a regular trip 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.710
 he walked once an hour but was keen on him 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.660
 leave not only airport passengers but 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.340

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.560
 always filled to sit on it was 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.400
 it was difficult to get by taxi but 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.200
 as known 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.540
 our people don't go to the bakery by taxi 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.750
 therefore often go to the airport 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.750
 on foot 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.660
 a small airport building could 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.800
 buy a ticket to relax waiting room or 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.600

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:06.920

 aircraft fleet airport consisted of 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.240
 aircraft yak-40 and an-2 passengers are not 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.310
 always been sure they would fly away day 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.770
 on the day the planes rose low and 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.929
 We are very dependent on the weather conditions are 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.509
 the days of hearing were the words non-flying 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.100
 weather this meant the flight was canceled tomorrow 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.959

 during flights it was not possible in those 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.360
 times it did not pay much 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.520
 Attention 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.650

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.150
 light multipurpose aircraft we had 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:39.080
 metal runway but she doesn't 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.080

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.849
 shipments 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:53.180
 greeted passengers made out on flights 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:55.130
 and see off to fly the example of Khabarovsk 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.200
 it was possible for 20 rubles at an average 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.210
 a salary of about 100 rubles worked and 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.410
 also a tour of Ussuriysk from a height 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.180
 bird's flight 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.250
 half an hour in the sky on an airplane was given 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.170
 the possibility of such a city to find 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.420
 your home such air travel 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.790
 enjoyed great popularity 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.960
 maybe so it would be and still minutes 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.590
 at 30-40 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:19.010
 while he lights up while here he flies 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.410
 over the city everything is like the houses there 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.720
 everything is so beautiful 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.530
 great here it would be and given to them and 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.030
 Now if it was all for the children 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.700

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.330
 planes that served Ussuri 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.700
 the airport was universally filmed in 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.950
 operating the same in the 90s japanese 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.870
 auto industry began to conquer the market all 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.000
 fewer people wanted to fly to the nearest 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.970
 villages it is logical that to repair the airport 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.950
 no money was allocated in 1992 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.050
 livelihoods and reports gone 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.210
 only a plane on the building so far 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.210
 recalls the past air past 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:10.610
 will come strangers inferior to the owners 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.380

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.150
 you were at the airport 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.070

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.100
 open the site do not open with us 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.020
