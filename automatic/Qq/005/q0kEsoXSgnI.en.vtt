hundred and fifty-five dollars I believe
it<00:00:24.449> was<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.840> Mac<00:00:25.109> Lancome<00:00:25.920> today<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.869> which

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
it was that Mac Lancome today you which

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.019 
it was that Mac Lancome today you which
is<00:00:28.080> pretty<00:00:28.349> cheap<00:00:28.740> considering<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.640> went<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.000> a

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
is pretty cheap considering I went to a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
going to charge $300 for RAM and that

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.940 
going to charge $300 for RAM and that
didn't<00:00:35.550> even<00:00:35.640> include<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.300> installation

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
didn't even include the installation

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.100 
didn't even include the installation
anyhow<00:00:37.950> let's<00:00:38.190> get<00:00:38.370> stuck<00:00:38.579> into<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.809> have

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
anyhow let's get stuck into it so I have

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.979 
anyhow let's get stuck into it so I have
got<00:00:40.350> my<00:00:40.559> iMac<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.610> soft<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.149> surface<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:42.840> my

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
got my iMac on a soft on surface on my

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:43.430 
got my iMac on a soft on surface on my
bed

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
bed

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.250 
bed
I<00:00:43.910> believe<00:00:44.910> that's<00:00:45.059> as<00:00:45.270> far<00:00:45.450> up<00:00:45.629> as<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.960> stand

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
I believe that's as far up as the stand

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.350 
I believe that's as far up as the stand
can<00:00:46.590> go<00:00:46.800> though<00:00:47.190> underneath<00:00:47.820> here<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.239> will

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
can go though underneath here you will

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.720 
can go though underneath here you will
see<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> bit<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.989> panel<00:00:49.320> with<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.800> three

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
see a bit of a panel with on three

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.689 
see a bit of a panel with on three
screws<00:00:51.410> this<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.590> where<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.949> van<00:00:53.100> was<00:00:53.309> located

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
screws this is where the van was located

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.779 
screws this is where the van was located
I've<00:00:54.690> got<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> bit<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.379> screwdriver<00:00:56.039> here<00:00:56.460> so

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
I've got a bit of a screwdriver here so

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.590 
I've got a bit of a screwdriver here so
I<00:00:56.820> am<00:00:57.090> just<00:00:57.300> going<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:58.190> unscrew<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.760> don't

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
I am just going to unscrew it and don't

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.660 
I am just going to unscrew it and don't
worry<00:01:00.809> about<00:01:00.930> losing<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> screws<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.430> I

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
worry about losing the screws and I

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.630 
worry about losing the screws and I
believe<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.059> they<00:01:03.539> are<00:01:04.159> you<00:01:05.159> know<00:01:05.339> I'm

believe that they are you know I'm
soldered<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> actual<00:01:07.140> bit<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.590> plastic

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
soldered on to the actual bit of plastic

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.640 
soldered on to the actual bit of plastic
as<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.549> when<00:01:09.450> she<00:01:09.630> runs<00:01:09.720> Grudem<00:01:10.260> they<00:01:10.470> run

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
as in when she runs Grudem they run

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.950 
as in when she runs Grudem they run
actually<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.210> for<00:01:12.479> loud<00:01:12.689> or<00:01:12.930> anything

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
actually you know for loud or anything

so you know it's pretty easy to and get
out<00:01:19.579> see<00:01:19.880> all<00:01:19.969> the<00:01:20.119> screws<00:01:21.369> sorry<00:01:22.369> all<00:01:22.640> the

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
out see all the screws sorry all the

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.880 
out see all the screws sorry all the

you might or might not be able to see we
have<00:01:31.909> two<00:01:32.240> lamb<00:01:32.509> modules<00:01:33.110> already<00:01:33.350> in<00:01:33.710> here

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
have two lamb modules already in here

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.899 
have two lamb modules already in here
payable<00:01:35.119> from<00:01:35.329> two<00:01:35.750> gigabyte<00:01:36.259> modules<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.729> I'm

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
payable from two gigabyte modules so I'm

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.740 
payable from two gigabyte modules so I'm
going<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.360> add<00:01:38.509> three<00:01:38.840> modules<00:01:39.380> underneath<00:01:40.750> so

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
going to add three modules underneath so

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.499 
going to add three modules underneath so
I'm<00:01:42.020> going<00:01:42.259> to<00:01:42.409> have<00:01:42.619> 12<00:01:42.979> gigabytes<00:01:43.549> which

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
I'm going to have 12 gigabytes which

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.410 
I'm going to have 12 gigabytes which
should<00:01:44.869> be<00:01:45.079> okay<00:01:45.469> it's<00:01:46.459> a<00:01:46.640> different<00:01:47.090> size

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
should be okay it's a different size

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.639 
should be okay it's a different size
obviously<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.950> two<00:01:49.429> four<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.090> two<00:01:50.299> twos

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
obviously the two four and the two twos

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.289 
obviously the two four and the two twos
however<00:01:51.649> I'm<00:01:51.950> running<00:01:52.459> in<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:52.789> know<00:01:52.909> dowel

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
however I'm running in you know dowel

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.210 
however I'm running in you know dowel
channel<00:01:53.840> memory<00:01:53.989> it<00:01:54.380> should<00:01:54.590> be<00:01:54.709> fine

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
channel memory it should be fine

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.660 
channel memory it should be fine
so<00:01:55.369> I'm<00:01:55.520> just<00:01:55.700> going<00:01:55.939> to<00:01:56.090> run<00:01:57.069> carefully<00:01:58.069> cut

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
so I'm just going to run carefully cut

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.789 
so I'm just going to run carefully cut
open<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.209> packet<00:01:59.630> I<00:01:59.840> obviously<00:02:00.319> don't<00:02:00.649> want

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
open the packet I obviously don't want

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.609 
open the packet I obviously don't want
to<00:02:00.950> damage<00:02:01.159> on<00:02:01.579> the<00:02:01.880> RAM<00:02:02.390> inside<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:06.500> it

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
to damage on the RAM inside and it

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.150 
to damage on the RAM inside and it
should<00:02:06.770> fall<00:02:07.009> right<00:02:07.039> out<00:02:07.479> obviously<00:02:08.479> have<00:02:08.810> to

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
should fall right out obviously have to

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.460 
should fall right out obviously have to
be<00:02:10.160> careful<00:02:10.729> with<00:02:10.819> handling<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.690> RAM<00:02:11.870> or

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
be careful with handling the RAM or

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.380 
be careful with handling the RAM or
let's<00:02:12.829> handle<00:02:13.160> it<00:02:13.250> by<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.459> sides<00:02:13.760> don't<00:02:14.090> touch

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
let's handle it by the sides don't touch

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.880 
let's handle it by the sides don't touch
the<00:02:14.629> top<00:02:14.810> pins<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:17.420> if<00:02:17.690> I'm<00:02:17.870> not<00:02:17.930> mistaken<00:02:18.079> ago

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
the top pins and if I'm not mistaken ago

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.789 
the top pins and if I'm not mistaken ago
thin<00:02:19.190> arm<00:02:19.489> this<00:02:19.730> way<00:02:19.810> I'm<00:02:20.810> as<00:02:21.109> you<00:02:21.350> I'll<00:02:21.650> just

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
thin arm this way I'm as you I'll just

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.520 
thin arm this way I'm as you I'll just
put<00:02:21.980> this<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.310> side<00:02:22.400> for<00:02:22.609> a<00:02:22.880> second<00:02:23.359> as<00:02:23.780> you

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
put this to the side for a second as you

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.670 
put this to the side for a second as you
can<00:02:24.709> see<00:02:24.920> there<00:02:25.130> were<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.280> couple<00:02:25.519> of<00:02:25.819> tabs<00:02:26.060> here

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
can see there were a couple of tabs here

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.759 
can see there were a couple of tabs here
which<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.920> used<00:02:28.220> on<00:02:28.579> to<00:02:28.819> pull<00:02:29.030> out<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.389> RAM<00:02:32.769> yeah

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
which I used on to pull out the RAM yeah

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.680 
which I used on to pull out the RAM yeah
that's<00:02:34.010> usually<00:02:34.280> used<00:02:34.700> them<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.209> pull<00:02:35.389> out<00:02:35.510> the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
that's usually used them to pull out the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.319 
that's usually used them to pull out the
RAM<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.590> I'm<00:02:36.739> just<00:02:36.920> going<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:37.220> pull<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:38.090> tab

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
RAM so I'm just going to pull the tab

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:44.170 
RAM so I'm just going to pull the tab
out<00:02:40.239> and<00:02:41.239> I'm<00:02:42.230> just<00:02:42.500> gonna<00:02:42.680> try<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.180> carefully

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
out and I'm just gonna try and carefully

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.670 
out and I'm just gonna try and carefully
flock<00:02:45.139> the<00:02:45.349> RAM<00:02:45.530> in<00:02:45.859> as<00:02:46.160> so<00:02:48.849> and<00:02:50.230> I'm<00:02:51.230> gonna<00:02:51.410> put

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
flock the RAM in as so and I'm gonna put

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.080 
flock the RAM in as so and I'm gonna put
a<00:02:51.709> little<00:02:51.859> bit<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.160> pressure<00:02:52.370> on<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:53.060> just

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
a little bit of pressure on it it just

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.780 
a little bit of pressure on it it just
jumps<00:02:53.690> lot<00:02:53.930> Edina<00:02:54.319> could<00:02:54.500> do<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.889> you<00:02:55.579> have<00:02:55.760> to

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
jumps lot Edina could do it you have to

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.420 
jumps lot Edina could do it you have to
push<00:02:56.090> reasonably<00:02:56.810> hard<00:02:57.049> until<00:02:57.829> you<00:02:58.220> actually

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
push reasonably hard until you actually

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.390 
push reasonably hard until you actually
am<00:02:58.910> few<00:02:59.239> let<00:02:59.419> go<00:02:59.569> in<00:02:59.750> and<00:03:00.709> then<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.040> aren't

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
am few let go in and then you aren't

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.270 
am few let go in and then you aren't
just<00:03:01.609> put<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.060> ribbon<00:03:02.269> back<00:03:02.630> in<00:03:02.870> as<00:03:03.139> so<00:03:03.440> the

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
just put the ribbon back in as so the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.069 
just put the ribbon back in as so the
ribbon<00:03:04.579> is<00:03:04.700> used<00:03:04.730> um<00:03:05.209> for<00:03:05.480> pulling<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.930> RAM

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
ribbon is used um for pulling the RAM

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.129 
ribbon is used um for pulling the RAM
out<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.940> now<00:03:08.120> I'm<00:03:08.359> just<00:03:08.510> going<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.840> quickly

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
out and now I'm just going to quickly

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.289 
out and now I'm just going to quickly
take<00:03:09.530> my<00:03:09.769> second<00:03:10.280> module<00:03:10.430> out<00:03:10.790> I'm<00:03:11.030> going<00:03:11.269> to

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
take my second module out I'm going to

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:18.129 
take my second module out I'm going to
pull<00:03:11.540> out<00:03:11.690> this<00:03:11.930> ribbon<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:17.090> I<00:03:17.780> should<00:03:17.989> be

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
pull out this ribbon and I should be

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.930 
pull out this ribbon and I should be
able<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.410> just<00:03:18.620> push<00:03:18.919> it<00:03:19.099> in<00:03:19.250> as<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.299> firmly

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
able to just push it in as so firmly

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.680 
able to just push it in as so firmly
need<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.090> make<00:03:23.239> sure<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:24.709> hear<00:03:24.889> it<00:03:25.040> click<00:03:25.690> you

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
need to make sure you hear it click you

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.400 
need to make sure you hear it click you
wouldn't<00:03:27.049> have<00:03:27.139> heard<00:03:27.350> that<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.590> don't<00:03:27.919> think

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.250 

so<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.500> looks<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.770> be<00:03:31.920> in<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.460> will<00:03:32.640> need<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:33.260> now

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
so it looks to be in I will need to now

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.430 
so it looks to be in I will need to now
screw<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:34.800> bottom<00:03:35.220> part<00:03:35.460> back<00:03:35.670> on<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:36.230> then<00:03:37.230> I

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
screw the bottom part back on and then I

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.250 
screw the bottom part back on and then I
will<00:03:37.470> um<00:03:37.980> turn<00:03:38.460> it<00:03:38.670> on<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.240> see<00:03:39.870> whether<00:03:40.140> or

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
will um turn it on and see whether or

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.230 
will um turn it on and see whether or
not<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.710> memory<00:03:41.070> is<00:03:41.160> recognized<00:03:41.670> hopefully

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
not the memory is recognized hopefully

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.360 
not the memory is recognized hopefully
it<00:03:42.330> is<00:03:42.480> okay<00:03:42.960> so<00:03:43.020> my<00:03:43.470> computer<00:03:43.950> has<00:03:44.100> now<00:03:44.310> turned

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
it is okay so my computer has now turned

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.660 
it is okay so my computer has now turned
on<00:03:44.960> I'm<00:03:45.960> just<00:03:46.170> going<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.530> click<00:03:46.950> on<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.430> Apple
