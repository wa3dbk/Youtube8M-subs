go over anchor places but our main focus

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.610 
go over anchor places but our main focus
isn't<00:00:12.480> gonna<00:00:12.630> be<00:00:12.780> on<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.960> actual<00:00:13.110> anchor

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
isn't gonna be on the actual anchor

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.350 
isn't gonna be on the actual anchor
itself<00:00:14.009> it's<00:00:14.190> gonna<00:00:14.280> be<00:00:14.490> on<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.940> rock<00:00:15.150> around

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.690 
the only thing bad about this is again
the<00:00:35.340> rock<00:00:35.550> what<00:00:35.790> we're<00:00:35.880> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.030> talk<00:00:36.180> about

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
the rock what we're going to talk about

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.299 
the rock what we're going to talk about
you<00:00:38.700> want<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.940> listen<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.420> rock<00:00:39.600> this

you want to listen to the rock this
sound<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.610> compared<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:44.309> rocks

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
sound here compared with it the rocks

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.040 
sound here compared with it the rocks
Hollow<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.120> right<00:00:45.270> away<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.510> know<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:45.809> right

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
Hollow so right away you know it's right

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.190 
Hollow so right away you know it's right
but<00:00:46.950> sometimes<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.550> rock<00:00:47.730> doesn't<00:00:48.030> always

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
but sometimes the rock doesn't always

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.720 
but sometimes the rock doesn't always
make<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.350> type<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.590> sound<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.489> want<00:00:50.670> to

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
make that type of sound so you want to

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.400 
make that type of sound so you want to
look<00:00:50.850> around<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.449> cracks<00:00:51.780> look<00:00:52.050> at<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> hole

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
look around for cracks look at the hole

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.250 
look around for cracks look at the hole
the<00:00:53.250> rock<00:00:53.520> system<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.270> structural<00:00:54.750> geology

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the rock system the structural geology

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.990 
the rock system the structural geology
of<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.649> don't<00:00:55.949> work<00:00:56.160> around<00:00:56.520> your<00:00:56.730> anchor

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
of this don't work around your anchor

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.540 
of this don't work around your anchor
placement<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.770> piece<00:00:59.039> right<00:00:59.250> here<00:00:59.460> you

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
placement like this piece right here you

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.360 
placement like this piece right here you
can<00:00:59.699> see<00:00:59.730> there's<00:01:00.230> fractures<00:01:01.230> all<00:01:01.500> around<00:01:02.010> so

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
can see there's fractures all around so

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.950 
can see there's fractures all around so
if<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.850> were<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.120> take<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.300> fall<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.660> this

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
if you were to take a fall on this

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.899 
if you were to take a fall on this
actual<00:01:04.350> Lake<00:01:04.739> here<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.400> whole<00:01:05.549> thing<00:01:05.790> would

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
actual Lake here the whole thing would

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.570 
actual Lake here the whole thing would
probably<00:01:06.119> pop<00:01:06.600> off<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.619> may<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.860> when<00:01:08.369> you're

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
probably pop off it may be when you're

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.280 
probably pop off it may be when you're
testing<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.360> like<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.630> all<00:01:09.930> that's<00:01:10.140> an

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
testing it like this all that's an

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.140 
testing it like this all that's an
awesome<00:01:10.500> placement<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.520> not<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> good<00:01:11.939> place

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
awesome placement it's not a good place

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.080 
awesome placement it's not a good place
but<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.450> rock<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.840> no<00:01:13.020> good<00:01:13.790> you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:14.939> even

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
but the rock is no good you can even

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.399 
but the rock is no good you can even
look<00:01:15.210> at<00:01:15.360> some<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.600> these<00:01:15.659> other<00:01:15.720> cracks<00:01:16.259> that

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
look at some of these other cracks that

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.910 
look at some of these other cracks that
we<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.890> rock<00:01:17.100> here

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.270 

again<00:01:24.920> another<00:01:25.300> bomber<00:01:26.300> replacement

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
again another bomber replacement

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.660 
again another bomber replacement
multi-directional<00:01:28.300> I'll<00:01:29.300> part<00:01:29.600> an<00:01:29.690> outward

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
multi-directional I'll part an outward

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.690 
multi-directional I'll part an outward
down<00:01:31.670> um<00:01:32.410> but<00:01:33.410> we<00:01:33.710> still<00:01:33.980> this<00:01:34.310> is<00:01:34.490> still

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
down um but we still this is still

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.940 
down um but we still this is still
another<00:01:34.910> flake<00:01:35.270> system<00:01:35.750> it's<00:01:36.170> got<00:01:36.350> a<00:01:36.380> crackle

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
another flake system it's got a crackle

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.040 
another flake system it's got a crackle
and<00:01:37.070> all<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.460> way<00:01:37.580> up<00:01:37.760> and<00:01:37.970> coming<00:01:38.210> around<00:01:38.300> you

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
and all the way up and coming around you

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.300 
and all the way up and coming around you
really<00:01:39.320> have<00:01:39.620> to<00:01:39.740> make<00:01:39.860> your<00:01:40.040> anchor

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
really have to make your anchor

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.610 
really have to make your anchor
placements<00:01:40.790> focus<00:01:41.150> them<00:01:41.330> more<00:01:41.540> on<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:42.350> rock

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
placements focus them more on the rock

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.580 
placements focus them more on the rock
then<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.340> anchor<00:01:43.700> cuz<00:01:43.940> 80%<00:01:44.930> of<00:01:45.020> climbing

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
then the anchor cuz 80% of climbing

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.300 
then the anchor cuz 80% of climbing
accidents<00:01:46.040> happened<00:01:46.370> from<00:01:46.490> rock<00:01:46.790> failure<00:01:47.300> um

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
accidents happened from rock failure um

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.170 
accidents happened from rock failure um
it's<00:01:49.310> something<00:01:49.370> you<00:01:49.550> want<00:01:49.670> to<00:01:49.730> look<00:01:49.820> for<00:01:50.000> when

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
it's something you want to look for when

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.410 
it's something you want to look for when
you're<00:01:50.270> placing<00:01:50.600> anchors

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
you're placing anchors

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.030 
you're placing anchors
it's<00:01:53.420> about<00:01:53.600> it<00:01:53.810> again<00:01:54.680> I'm<00:01:54.830> Joe<00:01:55.010> from
