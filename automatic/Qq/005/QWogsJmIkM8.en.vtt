00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
with the locking mechanism installed you

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.160 
with the locking mechanism installed you
can<00:01:59.729> see<00:02:00.000> right<00:02:00.570> now<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.870> open<00:02:00.960> position

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
can see right now in the open position

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.350 
can see right now in the open position
the<00:02:01.890> inner<00:02:02.040> workings<00:02:02.400> of<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.580> tailgate<00:02:02.940> are

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the inner workings of the tailgate are

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.100 
the inner workings of the tailgate are
allowed<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.720> work<00:02:03.840> freely<00:02:05.479> we<00:02:06.479> rotate<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.900> into

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
allowed to work freely we rotate it into

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.430 
allowed to work freely we rotate it into

the lock position the the armen locking

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.990 
the lock position the the armen locking
mechanism<00:02:10.860> comes<00:02:11.040> up<00:02:11.280> into<00:02:11.459> position<00:02:11.850> and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
mechanism comes up into position and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.290 
mechanism comes up into position and
prevents<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:13.790> prevents<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.880> handle<00:02:15.180> from

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
prevents it prevents the handle from

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.090 
prevents it prevents the handle from
opening<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:17.070> install<00:02:17.610> our<00:02:17.730> new<00:02:17.760> bezel<00:02:19.100> and

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
opening and install our new bezel and

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.220 
opening and install our new bezel and
again<00:02:20.340> we<00:02:20.430> want<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.640> make<00:02:20.730> sure<00:02:20.850> we<00:02:21.060> place<00:02:22.050> the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
again we want to make sure we place the

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.720 
again we want to make sure we place the
clips<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:22.620> properly<00:02:23.070> we<00:02:23.250> want<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.550> go<00:02:23.610> ahead

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
clips in properly we want to go ahead

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.790 
clips in properly we want to go ahead
put<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.880> bottom<00:02:24.209> clips<00:02:24.420> in<00:02:24.570> first<00:02:24.870> into<00:02:25.709> the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
put the bottom clips in first into the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.280 
put the bottom clips in first into the
holes<00:02:26.010> we'll<00:02:26.580> rotate<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:27.060> up<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:28.140> go<00:02:28.230> ahead

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
holes we'll rotate it up and go ahead

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.880 
holes we'll rotate it up and go ahead
and<00:02:28.530> set<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.910> other<00:02:29.910> ones<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.269> position<00:02:30.890> you

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
and set the other ones in position you

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.199 
and set the other ones in position you
can<00:02:32.040> see<00:02:32.190> we've<00:02:32.310> got<00:02:32.340> perfect<00:02:32.640> alignment<00:02:33.000> with

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
can see we've got perfect alignment with

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.380 
can see we've got perfect alignment with
the<00:02:33.360> locking<00:02:33.540> mechanism<00:02:34.140> below<00:02:35.239> that's<00:02:36.239> all

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
the locking mechanism below that's all

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.120 
the locking mechanism below that's all
there<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.959> just<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.530> couple<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.830> minutes

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
there is to it just a couple of minutes

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.009 
there is to it just a couple of minutes
we've<00:02:38.400> got<00:02:38.519> our<00:02:38.640> new<00:02:38.760> locking<00:02:39.180> handle<00:02:39.450> into

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
we've got our new locking handle into

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.229 
we've got our new locking handle into
position<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:41.160> has<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.280> great<00:02:41.489> OEM<00:02:41.880> look<00:02:41.910> to

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239

it<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:43.080> will<00:02:43.170> conclude<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.530> review<00:02:43.860> and
