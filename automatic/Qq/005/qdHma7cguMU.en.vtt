this<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.240> my<00:01:06.770> well<00:01:07.770> objective<00:01:08.400> playing

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
this for my well objective playing

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.510 
this for my well objective playing
standpoint<00:01:09.320> there's<00:01:10.320> there's<00:01:10.770> two<00:01:11.010> factors

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
standpoint there's there's two factors

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.700 
standpoint there's there's two factors
for<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.729> reason<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.210> go<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.659> such<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.229> long<00:01:13.409> kill

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
for the reason I go on such a long kill

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.219 
for the reason I go on such a long kill
streak<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.760> think<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.299> an<00:01:15.479> acog<00:01:15.810> site<00:01:16.080> on

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
streak I I think this is an acog site on

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.590 
streak I I think this is an acog site on
this<00:01:16.380> gun<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.860> really<00:01:17.369> dislike<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.119> why

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
this gun and I really dislike it why

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.429 
this gun and I really dislike it why
would<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.900> put<00:01:19.080> an<00:01:19.170> ache<00:01:19.290> off<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> oh<00:01:20.119> but

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
would you put an ache off on it oh but

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.780 
would you put an ache off on it oh but
it's<00:01:22.439> two<00:01:22.650> main<00:01:22.830> factors<00:01:23.130> where<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.490> went<00:01:23.640> on

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
it's two main factors where I went on

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.170 
it's two main factors where I went on
