00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
nuclear riddle and if you don't watch

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.369 
nuclear riddle and if you don't watch
the<00:00:37.500> last<00:00:37.680> one<00:00:38.239> it<00:00:39.239> was<00:00:39.420> pretty<00:00:39.690> similar<00:00:40.020> as

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
the last one it was pretty similar as

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.190 
the last one it was pretty similar as
the<00:00:40.790> jointly<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.090> was<00:00:42.690> using<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.640> dsr-50<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
the jointly I was using the dsr-50 and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.170 
the jointly I was using the dsr-50 and
it<00:00:46.200> was<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> exact<00:00:46.829> same<00:00:47.039> map<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:47.730> that

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
it was on the exact same map but that

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.240 
it was on the exact same map but that
see<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.899> much<00:00:49.410> more<00:00:49.469> entertaining

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
see this one is much more entertaining

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.389 
see this one is much more entertaining
mainly<00:00:50.610> because<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:51.300> know<00:00:52.230> I'm<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.559> rushing

you are using scavenge on facts but the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.090 
you are using scavenge on facts but the
main<00:01:33.479> reason<00:01:33.509> I'm<00:01:33.930> using<00:01:34.140> extended<00:01:34.799> clip

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
main reason I'm using extended clip

main reason I'm using extended clip
instead<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.520> fast<00:01:35.790> Magnus<00:01:36.270> game<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.570> because

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
instead of fast Magnus game is because

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.510 
instead of fast Magnus game is because
you<00:01:38.100> know<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.400> just<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.790> can<00:01:39.020> take<00:01:40.020> those
