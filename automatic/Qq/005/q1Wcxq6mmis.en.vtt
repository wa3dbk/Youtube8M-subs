the<00:00:13.110> efforts<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.590> Chris<00:00:13.889> Wilcox<00:00:14.370> who<00:00:14.670> played

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
the efforts of Chris Wilcox who played

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.470 
the efforts of Chris Wilcox who played
just<00:00:15.269> under<00:00:15.540> four<00:00:16.049> minutes<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.619> thought<00:00:17.480> we

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
just under four minutes I thought we

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.390 
just under four minutes I thought we
played<00:00:18.510> for<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.020> first<00:00:19.230> five<00:00:19.439> minutes<00:00:19.740> great

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
played for the first five minutes great

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.779 
played for the first five minutes great
and<00:00:20.730> then<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.300> went<00:00:21.510> back<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:22.039> old<00:00:23.039> habits<00:00:23.160> I

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
and then we went back to old habits I

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.370 
and then we went back to old habits I
thought<00:00:24.390> our<00:00:24.480> energy<00:00:24.779> was<00:00:24.900> terrible<00:00:25.289> I

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
thought our energy was terrible I

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.410 
thought our energy was terrible I
thought<00:00:25.560> Chris<00:00:25.710> Wilcox<00:00:26.220> saved<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.970> game<00:00:27.090> for

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
thought Chris Wilcox saved the game for

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.779 
thought Chris Wilcox saved the game for
us<00:00:27.539> single<00:00:28.380> handedly<00:00:28.500> with<00:00:28.830> his<00:00:28.949> effort<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.429> I

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
us single handedly with his effort and I

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.859 
us single handedly with his effort and I
thought<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.090> was<00:00:30.150> obvious<00:00:30.330> he<00:00:30.599> didn't<00:00:30.779> do

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
thought it was obvious he didn't do

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.870 
thought it was obvious he didn't do
anything<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.410> play<00:00:31.590> hard<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.460> play<00:00:32.759> with

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
anything to play hard and play with

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.479 
anything to play hard and play with
great<00:00:33.120> effort<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.899> thought<00:00:34.170> that

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
great effort and I thought that

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.080 
great effort and I thought that
leadership<00:00:35.489> led<00:00:35.969> everybody<00:00:36.420> else<00:00:37.790> into<00:00:38.790> doing

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
leadership led everybody else into doing

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.280 
leadership led everybody else into doing

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
happen yeah Wilcox really changed the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.799 
happen yeah Wilcox really changed the
game<00:00:50.760> for<00:00:51.030> us<00:00:51.059> somebody<00:00:51.329> was<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.600> tie<00:00:51.780> game

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
game for us somebody was a tie game

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.779 
game for us somebody was a tie game
until<00:00:52.320> he<00:00:52.440> came<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.829> there<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.070> then<00:00:53.399> once<00:00:53.610> he

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
until he came in there and then once he

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.060 
until he came in there and then once he
I<00:00:54.000> think<00:00:54.600> he<00:00:54.629> plays<00:00:54.809> off<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.320> five<00:00:55.860> straight

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
I think he plays off for five straight

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.619 
I think he plays off for five straight
minutes<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.730> push<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> lead<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.510> like

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
minutes and you push the lead to like

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.970 
minutes and you push the lead to like
six<00:00:57.930> or<00:00:58.050> eight<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.440> with<00:00:58.559> his<00:00:58.649> energy

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
six or eight just with his energy
