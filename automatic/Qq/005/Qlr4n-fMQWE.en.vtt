00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:11.650
 so she winked at exactly five 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.820
 years to pc games hardware 8 2004 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.740
 In any case, the winner was among us 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.050
 because who could afford one 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.970
 to invest more euros 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.070
 there was not with the cd version 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.439
 satisfied no, she chose the meantime 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.199
 regular luxury alternative in 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.480
 form the dvd version with gold 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.429
 misted sides platinum dust city 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.030
 printer black and especially with a 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:37.760
 dvd filled with 250 tools and 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.950
 full versions but no matter if cheap 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.379
 version or bolt variant both 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.010
 screamed and now her title theme was 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.230
 against pc check behind it hid itself 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.270
 a multipage practice article with a 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.579
 trillion benchmarks several example 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.760
 systems with which the reader his own 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.500
 System could test its system 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.030
 did not reach specified values 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.800
 He obviously had a hard 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.449
 or software problems and had to 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.910
 decide between a quick one 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.220
 suicide and pc error analysis 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.720
 for one of these two solutions found 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.799
 even the right tools on the 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.630
 dvd and for the stingy also on the cd 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.400
 but enough of the practice shows what she does 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.500
 really want to know what is 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.780
 hardware was currently what 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.100
 Ridiculous antediluvian technique applied 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.100
 at that time still as new 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.570
 for example this one here nv 45 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.820
 graphics card with pci express 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.460
 Interface more exciting than the chip 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.369
 itself hardly alias of the mv 40 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.439
 However, Geforce 6800 is different 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.240
 this little socket on the board 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.189
 she demands her own 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.530
 Power plug from the power supply 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.470
 yes, this was the birth of the pci 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.270
 express power plug not only that 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.950
 graphics cards were now so big 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.369
 that they are considered as their own continent 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.229
 could 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.299
 it was not enough that she was so loud 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.619
 were like the big bang no steal now 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.840
 they also give us the last ones 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.740
 energy reserves how should that be possible 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.600
 go on 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.700
 We also have the responsible ones 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.649
 asked in a big special called 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.619
 the hardware future 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.969
 wait there as the four were then 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.300
 There are still four main hardware 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.930
 manufacturer ati nvidia intel and amd to 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.820
 rapport 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.400
 Ok questions about the impending energy crisis 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.530
 because of too gluttonous graphics cards 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.150
 were not there but we were holes 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.210
 gpu manufacturer with questions about the 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.250
 state-of-the-art 110 nanometer process over 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.760
 filter cheating in the driver and over 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.530
 multi gpu systems multiple graphics cards 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.130
 to pair to match the game performance 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.770
 increase 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.230
 that was with pci-express yes again 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.500
 possible and the pc manufacturer alienware 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.030
 That's exactly what the review video was about 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.400
 has seen white in the last month 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.280
 but that did not come to that 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.050
 ate did not believe in the idea 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.820
 hardly give any practical benefit 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.530
 the coupling of two graphics cards was called it 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.750
 but not for much longer than us 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.180
 Ati came to know a few years later 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.870
 with crossfire your own multi gpu 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.810
 Solve out what nvidia thought of it 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.650
 not to be experienced because too 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.150
 unopened products want one 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.400
 do not take a position 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.600
 aha so there is a corresponding 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.450
 product just is not 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.850
 Of course, there is the dsl 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.690
 technology but that left a little on 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.180
 to wait 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.160
 the coupling of 2 chip would come along 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.200
 by the way, just before the processors 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.510
 because amd had for the server processor 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.210
 Opteron just a variant with two 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.240
 announced that was not less 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.010
 as the beginning of the multi core era yet 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.140
 more in a later issue 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.120
 we come back to the interview where it is 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.770
 not just exciting new processors 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.440
 but also a lot 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.800
 profane the processor socket the 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.630
 home of the cpu on the mainboard amd 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.420
 just had the third socket 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.460
 in consequence brought out only the 754th 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.490
 then the new 40 and finally the 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.590
 But now this pedestal should be 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.990
 really be the platform which the 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.180
 next years existence has promised us 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.460
 all ds spokesman and that were 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.370
 not even lied because it took whole 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.950
 two years to the base am2 the 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.480
 successor came out 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.920
 Intel was not quite as fast as that 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.460
 At that time one was not different from them 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.970
 used 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.290
 intel just had the socket 775 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.479
 presented and this should be 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.759
 actually over five years on the market 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.320
 keep new cpu there is for it 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:23.090
 finally, even today 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.160
 but the industry was not 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.320
 excited about the new socket of the 775 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.960
 it is well known that relocated the small pins 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.470
 the contact pins from the processor to the 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.900
 base 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.460
 mainboards and this system is like that 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.770
 sensitive that it is only a limited 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.160
 number of processor keeps switching off 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.290
 but how many exactly this question drew 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.000
 through the whole hardware world and 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:48.620
 so also by the pc games hardware 8 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.780
 2004 only several changes to the 775 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.340
 survival on page 9 where we are 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.750
 even a lawyer on this 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.550
 ask sensitive topic 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.880
 more changeable yes of course this can 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.040
 everything is called from two change up to 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.200
 72,000 an average of twelve changes 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.700
 be it here on page 17 im 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.550
 report on the computer fair computex 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.080
 on which the mainboard manufacturers 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.070
 collectively about this fragile technology 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.680
 upset 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.230
 only three to four processor change 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.120
 his to the socket is defective complained 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.550
 a part manufacturer on page 30 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.310
 where we have the socket 775 a whole 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.380
 Articles dedicate a sentence later may 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.690
 intel, however, appease the pedestal 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.910
 keep at least 20 processor changes 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.370
 out and in the interview this number becomes 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:34.280
 confirmed at least 20 changes 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.520
 predecessor yes what's wrong then it is 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.370
 three or over 20 or 72,000 processor 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.960
 Change 20 was the cdu change that 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.240
 makes some colleague in the pcgh 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.700
 editorial between breakfast and noon 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.860
 chosen direction chief editorial staff stood us 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.890
 So a huge wear sockel 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.290
 775 mainboards before or meant this 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.240
 even the end for the upgrade of the cpu 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.990
 and thus life on earth like 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.440
 we know it 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.240
 now it was all so wild all 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.220
 worries were unfounded on the pedestal 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.260
 exploded after the 30 change 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.419
 not if you do not use the processor 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.570
 The jack used the jack 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:14.600
 775 proved to be in every respect 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:18.440
 durable platform so everything pink 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.690
 not quite with the socket 775 became 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.940
 also introduced another innovation 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.370
 the us in misjudgment of the historical 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.120
 Just dimension this little note 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.360
 was worth 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.340
 since the socket 775 intel 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.979
 Processor cooler with small plastic 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.350
 pins on the board attached to the 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:38.539
 not only are they unreliable 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.610
 also often inaccessible and often so difficult 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:42.340
 in the bracket to press that one 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.840
 almost the thumb falls off 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.350
 you may already know what it is 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.060
 This was the birth of the push 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.740
 pins 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.080
 what a dark hour in the 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:07:01.780
 history of processor cooling ever since 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:07:04.449
 follow me these little ones and into it 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.910
 Tomb was I 've got enough for today 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:09.100
 We prefer to play games and there 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.169
 We encounter a joint operations 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.460
 multiplayer shooter in the modern scenario 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:15.280
 of a big competitor 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.229
 Battlefield 2 came before and not at all 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.750
 looked so good the game was 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:22.510
 quite solid and allowed huge 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:25.180
 slaughter with up to 150 players in 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:27.340
 a part of well noticed that are already 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.979
 almost fair for multiplayer dimensions 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:35.740
 world of warcraft with tanks, so to speak 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:38.979
 just different and that's it 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:41.260
 with the pc games hardware 8 2004 though 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:43.270
 pay attention there was something right in 

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.760
 an article about games programming 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:48.130
 on page 150 is still something that 

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.350
 I would like to show him, namely one 

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:53.080
 example for the use of wörz ex 

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:55.960
 portray in modern 3d engines and 

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.650
 this example could make him known 

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.740
 occurrence 

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:01.419
 it is the nvidia phaeton and i will 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:04.599
 Say goodbye to them now and 

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:07.479
