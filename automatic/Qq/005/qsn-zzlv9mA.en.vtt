00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.490
 hi to all guys and well found in 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.439
 this new world heads today I'm here 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.689
 to present you the set of t mega 25 and a 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.689
 wagon that you do not need for collection 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.179
 of wheat and anything else but for the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.710
 transport of pigs and eibs 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.649
 that you will need for example 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.770
 also in the next map that I will go 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.270
 present you useful point wagon this is 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.070
 the version that precisely accepts i 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.070
 chickens because there are previous versions 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:49.170
 only pigs or just bits happen 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.820
 and nothing to 23 animations however you give 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.930
 we'll see later 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.489
 now we focus on the mega and nothing 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.340
 I must say that it is done anyway 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.920
 also good as a texture too 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.970
 as details we have a few tubes e 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.299
 the air the oil tube e 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.580
 headlights behind even beautiful work 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.580
 the only thing I noticed was missing pistons 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.040
 of lifting that just are n't there 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.320
 therefore also all their animation 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.060
 whatever 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.670
 nothing for the rest, however, goes a lot 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.320
 also good as mechanical transport 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.830
 let's say mechanics works anyway 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.880
 very well it does not swerve too much 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:42.630
 tractor is usually just a fan of that 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:47.850
 however not excessively brakes on 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.890
 verse headlights upwards and arrows 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.380
 these also work with the ati 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.050
 reverse and turn on practically 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.319
 the other two lighthouses that also make light 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:03.200
 they are not only for bike capacity 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.200
 as I told you about 3 of the 38 thousand 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.430
 accept vegetare also in yarn and other 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:15.939
 in short, a normal wagon 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.980
 filling with the usual thing you do 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.980
 filled giarty points bla bla bla 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.629
 here it is 38 thousand liters round and round 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.379
 even with thirty abs instead 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:43.280
 attracting quite well has no problems 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:45.940
 shoot or whatever else you guys this 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.130
 so fast I saw it I said it is 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.959
 something decent compared for sure 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.180
 to something else therefore said but give yourself 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.450
 we also do this the same way too 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.990
 because anyway a nice alternative wagon 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.630
 seas rather than using those of the 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.480
 the original ones you have understood by now 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.960
 use this tipper also works 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:13.500
 well I piston would prefer a little higher 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.840
 lights of truth that casey the opaque 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.020
 however as true without good indeed 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.230
 the pistons are missing 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.470
 lifting for the rest we say that 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.410
 suspension wheels and very well also 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:32.590
 whatever else moves everything muy bien 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.590
 let's go to jogging backing max 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.570
 always fantastic fender review 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.820
 yes dear that see so it seems a bit 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.390
 oddly enough, however, it is for transportation 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.580
 of chickens and so on 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.920
 we have with the n key we can remove 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.330
 the cover above if it does not rain 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:04:00.670
 already varied because otherwise excuse me 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:04.280
 flashing 2003 2015 sorry works 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.670
 arrows and also beautiful I must say well 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.200
 bright make the brakes and therefore we have 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.660
 all the functions also the headlights 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.970
 of the invention of the plaque 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.760
 as you can see belen that these 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.859
 German plate with the aics then open it 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.180
 but first let's say the two doors will be up 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.190
 ramp and then you can go to load 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.080
 of course you can have a machine 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.530
 you have a little something you can throw 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.360
 inside then whatever some photos or 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.409
 video too 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.969
 put in mar the pick up could 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.969
 never being able to get into it anyway 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.900
 it works then obviously you approach 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:50.349
 at the right points of load and now there 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.210
 automatically loads the map you need 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:54.710
 press the button to load 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.020
 in short, take away 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:02.250
 it seems to me a fact to see also in the xiii 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.630
 and therefore in short, that is still there 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.850
 I'll do I'll show you up and running 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.340
 always on the map I will go to 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.710
 present them also because I will have to make gods 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.910
 tutorial regarding the fox trot 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.830
 and other fashions let's say a little bit like this 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.650
 I will show the inclusion of fashion 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:26.570
 but let's say what it consists of and how 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:30.170
 works and why wheels trailer board 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:33.450
 no textures yes they are not bad 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.900
 we have some lucidity in some 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.900
 points 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.900
 nothing the kids leave you the link in 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.530
 descriptions I recommend you remember 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.890
 this test test and mode because precisely 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.840
 could be useful for maps that 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:53.230
 they need sales 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.470
 of various things with no comment 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.300
 subscribe leave a nice like I go 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.080
 forward to baton witness boys 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.419
 until you set up the internet and 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.600
 let's start with the Venice series 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:06.600
 next
