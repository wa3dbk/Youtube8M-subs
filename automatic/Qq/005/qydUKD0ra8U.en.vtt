00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.080
 have you ever encountered 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.530
 situations when you want to share 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.490
 photos or music and with others 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.519
 home network users but you 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.400
 don't know exactly how to do it 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.939
 hello my name is in the floor of the party I 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.820
 I work as a technical writer in a team 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.189
 developers the day before the meeting is not coming 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.840
 five minutes we will see 2 ways 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.539
 sharing 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.869
 files using shared folders and with 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.440
 home group 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.230
 both ways allows you to simplify the exchange 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.540
 files with other users 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.700
 home network users shared 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.730
 Folder windows expert system can 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.970
 keep working with them and brandon 7 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.400
 suppose you don't need to share 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.239
 photos and run with others 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:44.249
 family members 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:45.759
 which also uses this 

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:47.899
 computer Pindos they can just 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.639
 drag downloaded from camera 

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:51.899
 photos in the general folder and considerations 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.409
 now my family members can 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:54.999
 view images 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:57.209
 using your accounts for 

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:59.519
 this they just open the shared folder 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.859
 images shared folders useful but when 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:02.939
 FH benefits do not have to 

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:04.750
 transfer files that may be 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.069
 undesirable new feature pindos 7 

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:08.290
 homemade group 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.470
 allows you to share files 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.380
 without moving them to the shared folder, see 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.780
 how does it work 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.909
 if city from computer system 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.630
 windows 7 then homemade group might already be 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.740
 created to check exist 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.729
 and home groups we will develop 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.700
 homework group in this regard is not 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.500
 home group so I should 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.549
 create first select items 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.950
 which should be provided 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.070
 share access to others 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.850
 home group members access to 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.860
 libraries of music images and 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.790
 the video library is just a set of folders in 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.990
 which is stored music images and 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.479
 documents after submission 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.930
 sharing system windows like 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.800
 sample password you will need 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.460
 other users to join 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.520
 home group later if necessary 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.250
 password can be opened again 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.350
 on the options screen, you can change the set 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.830

 share and enable direct 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.920
 multimedia transmission 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.100
 program materials 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.210

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.890
 can also be viewed or 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.020
 change homegroup password so 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.039
 homemade group is set up now 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.039
 network users have access to my 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.529

 home group and can view 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:50.859
 files and device that others 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:52.739
 home group members provides 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.339

 so you donâ€™t have to look for them 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.030
 Consider being

 groups not limited 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.490
 file sharing 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.260
 it also allows direct transmission 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.170
 multimedia materials for example 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.730
 photos and music

 calls it streaming 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.870
 by setting the appropriate

 this is a homemade group box then photos 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.330
 music on my computer will become 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.379
 available to users 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.459
 home groups and will automatically 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.510
 displayed in the player 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.830
 Windows Medius with users not 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.190
 will have to add their own library 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.519
 manually homemade group significantly 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.959
 simplifies sharing 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.170
 multimedia material 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.980
 further information can be found in
