00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
e to the various ready position that we

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.050 
e to the various ready position that we
already<00:01:28.470> talked<00:01:28.860> about<00:01:29.009> first<00:01:29.670> drill<00:01:30.030> is

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
already talked about first drill is

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.630 
already talked about first drill is
going<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.720> guard<00:01:30.990> position<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:32.159> that

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
going to be the guard position I do that

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.760 
going to be the guard position I do that
in<00:01:32.820> point<00:01:33.210> 8<00:01:33.509> seconds<00:01:34.200> or<00:01:34.320> less

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.440 

there's<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.860> good<00:01:38.070> hit<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.460> pnz<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.270> this

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
there's a good hit in the pnz in this

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.289 
there's a good hit in the pnz in this
particular<00:01:39.780> case<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.440> was<00:01:40.640> 0.67<00:01:41.640> seconds<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.270> I

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
particular case it was 0.67 seconds so I

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.960 
particular case it was 0.67 seconds so I
made<00:01:42.570> my<00:01:42.750> standard<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.830> next<00:01:44.130> thing<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.460> do<00:01:44.520> is

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
made my standard the next thing I do is

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.450 
made my standard the next thing I do is
I<00:01:45.420> shoot<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.900> from<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.290> compress<00:01:46.890> low<00:01:47.190> ready

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
I shoot it from that compress low ready

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.890 
I shoot it from that compress low ready
or<00:01:47.640> what<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.820> call<00:01:48.150> the<00:01:48.299> third<00:01:48.479> eye<00:01:48.659> position

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
or what I call the third eye position

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.530 
or what I call the third eye position
and<00:01:49.500> because<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.430> takes<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.790> little<00:01:50.970> more<00:01:51.150> time

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
and because it takes a little more time

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.080 
and because it takes a little more time
to<00:01:51.750> do<00:01:51.900> that<00:01:52.110> when<00:01:52.170> my<00:01:52.800> standard<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.369> 1<00:01:53.580> second

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
to do that when my standard is 1 second

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
to do that when my standard is 1 second
let's<00:01:54.270> see<00:01:54.420> how<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:54.600> do<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:56.810> nice<00:01:57.810> good

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
let's see how we do on that nice good

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.499 
let's see how we do on that nice good
hit<00:01:58.440> right<00:01:58.649> there<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> pnz<00:01:59.790> in<00:02:00.000> that

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
hit right there in the pnz in that

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.080 
hit right there in the pnz in that
particular<00:02:00.810> case<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.740> was<00:02:01.770> point<00:02:02.159> 8<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.640> got

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
particular case it was point 8 so I got

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.780 
particular case it was point 8 so I got
my<00:02:03.270> one-second<00:02:03.930> standard<00:02:04.350> no<00:02:04.649> problem<00:02:05.190> coming

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
my one-second standard no problem coming

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.210 
my one-second standard no problem coming
from<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.119> compress<00:02:07.020> low<00:02:07.259> ready<00:02:07.560> let's<00:02:08.009> go

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
from the compress low ready let's go

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.219 
from the compress low ready let's go
into<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.640> chest<00:02:09.000> ready<00:02:09.300> position<00:02:09.509> my

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
into that chest ready position my

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.440 
into that chest ready position my
standard<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.070> is<00:02:11.280> also<00:02:11.730> 1<00:02:11.970> second

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
standard on that is also 1 second

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.060 
standard on that is also 1 second
because<00:02:12.570> I<00:02:12.780> have<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.019> little<00:02:13.320> bit<00:02:13.410> more<00:02:13.560> travel

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
because I have a little bit more travel

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.979 
because I have a little bit more travel
distance<00:02:14.489> than<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.090> do<00:02:15.150> when<00:02:15.390> I'm<00:02:15.540> coming<00:02:15.750> from

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
distance than I do when I'm coming from

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.660 
distance than I do when I'm coming from
the<00:02:16.110> guard<00:02:17.840> again<00:02:18.840> 0.8<00:02:19.440> seconds<00:02:19.950> as<00:02:20.130> we<00:02:20.430> showed

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
the guard again 0.8 seconds as we showed

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.309 
the guard again 0.8 seconds as we showed
her<00:02:20.790> earlier<00:02:21.150> there's<00:02:21.480> really<00:02:21.750> not<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.110> much
