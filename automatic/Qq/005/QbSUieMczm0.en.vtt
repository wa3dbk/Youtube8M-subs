00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.170
 Have seen stadium and the 68 thousand 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.170
 in the stadium were from both teams the guest 

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:11.839
 Falconer unfortunately bayern-trainer decided to expect against Bernd Martin 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.019
 who would have liked to come to his first Bundesliga campaign for that 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.160
 Vomp part of the bavaria spd Sturmspitze Rent - and Rummenigge 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.480
 the g6 of the French had to be in the service of VfB 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.279
 annoyed to proceed to the verdict 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.579
 the VfB only with a gale 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.579
 what if there had been a hypothetical question 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.580
 Far missed this opportunity 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.540
 Minutes but that was symptomatic 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.440
 the Stuttgarters 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.150
 in the evaluation of chances 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.960
 the big difference 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.480
 According to me, just talk there that the Lyme disease Johnson the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.350
 she is open on the post 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.250
 and that we took advantage of the opportunities exploited the big difference 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.960
 Lockout and mood 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.160
 according to the rummenigge calls or our should have played 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.510
 would have the result 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.640
 Roest Rizzello the army with it believes 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.010
 it is a fact and the karl-heinz Rummenigge played in fact 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.020
 freed up 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.900
 his best game against Karlheinz Förster his old adversary 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.940
 However, it must say that Förster pauses for two weeks still does not love 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.860
 has old books and he had to get up 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.750
 he does not need to have any clumsiness he needs 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.550
 secret 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.560
 no chance 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.560
 for the Stuttgarter this duel 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.160
 then a scene in Dr 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.570
 two important duels from Munich SID 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.920
 Given problems 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.610
 Tönis against Bernd Förster the result was the 1 0 for Bayern 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.620
 From another perspective you can clearly see that both 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.160
 Stuttgarter namely namely Bernd Förster and also the goalkeeper Helmut 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
 Roleder not the mark of a devaluation 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.950
 Stuttgart with only one point so that was Reichert and five 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.220
 Midfielders could the encounter in the first half, at least 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.359
 open at any time, however 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:10.179
 as mentioned 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.519
 It works with the opportunity evaluation 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.929
 the bavarian defense certainly 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:17.929
 and above all, outstanding 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.009
 the Munich had 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.239
 introduced the politician and better opportunities 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.579
 by karl-heinz Rummenigge we tried is Bernd Doors 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.150
 who is against his direct 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.859
 the adversaries 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.859
 Shepherd could then but enforce on Oliver 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.739
 Pilot Bankhaus a quiet contemporary 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.519
 Nervousness high 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:59.389
 yes and it got worse for him than broke in the second half 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:00.889
 stopped 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.889
 although the TSX have for Kampa 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.689
 Watch the Bayern the game had the better condition 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.749
 this is defended with the six Norbert Nachtweih sitting on the grandstand 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:15.199
 he seemed to me 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:18.199
 a bit unsettled maybe ready to talk 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:22.389
 overall strong man 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.109
 soothing their benefits especially on the right side and for that 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.269
 responsible was Karl the Heidermann means 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.289
 Stocks are all pictures played 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:34.289
 for a lot more dangerous 

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:45.789
 if Haye is very effective this time 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:49.069
 Ludwig Beer Festival 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.249
 The only thing to treat him would be once 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:55.609
 I believe that it did not keep the chance open with this game 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.219
 also on Wednesday in Europe Cup 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.709
 the affected must 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.219
 then the scene leading to two to zero for the pre-deciding 2 0 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:05.150
 for the reform 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.189
 Rummenigge 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.429
 then comes the f left shot of Brother Osman 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:10.939
 and then 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.939
 a great scene of well-informed Hynes 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.549
 Seco announces his termination 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.849
 and then excitement 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.460
 15 15 I have to 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.770
 besides, we only have very short black sea 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.770
 on the Steiger is very often viewed and 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:42.499
 Heidelberg has not been touched by 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.020
 and as a signal generator 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.979
 complains 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.289
 In addition, referee Assenmacher offered to be mediated 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.599
 But then it leaves a corner but watch this scene now 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.949
 here would be a penalty 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.949
 can be given here Augenthaler 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.270
 So almost with your hand to the ball 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.029
 maybe the only wrong decision otherwise 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:07.029
 well-behaved franz-joseph Assenmacher 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.469
 then Rummenigge 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:14.469
 successful was not outstanding playing can 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:18.499
 and thus had the VfB 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:22.729
 no chance morale was gone I only played Bayern Munich and 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.749
 The Stuttgart had to thank Helmut Roleder that it was not 

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:28.749
 Debacle first out 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.360
 Rand Paul Breitner 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.370
 could put in the second half better and better in scene 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.259
 but 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.039
 at the great reflexes 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.770
 Chili also failed 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.770
 as in the next scene 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.539
 and the game started to zero by Cornwell Haie 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.050
 Rummenigge may very briefly speak «People» 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.050
 let me the ball and then this brilliant shot 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:05.690
 little children are waiting 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.839
 Florian Mayer is stuck in traffic 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:10.839
 but the players from Stuttgart maybe 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:14.619
 Sport should be documented from the place here in this scene 

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:17.749
 Karlheinz Förster and karl-heinz Rummenigge members 

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:19.030
 between Bernd Förster 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.060
 and the revolving swap
