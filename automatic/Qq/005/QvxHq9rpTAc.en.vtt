okay so for melody pretty much all I've

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.170 
okay so for melody pretty much all I've
done<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.640> gotten<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.300> pair<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.600> white<00:01:18.990> shorts<00:01:19.290> I

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
done is gotten a pair of white shorts I

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.580 
done is gotten a pair of white shorts I
actually<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.510> a<00:01:21.540> singlet<00:01:21.900> which<00:01:22.110> had<00:01:22.380> sung

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
actually have a singlet which had sung

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.870 
actually have a singlet which had sung
else<00:01:22.800> on<00:01:22.980> it<00:01:23.010> and<00:01:23.310> I've<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:23.580> turned<00:01:23.730> it

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
else on it and I've just turned it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.760 
else on it and I've just turned it
inside<00:01:24.180> out<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:24.660> a<00:01:24.720> plain<00:01:24.960> singlet<00:01:25.380> but

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
inside out so it's a plain singlet but

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.990 
inside out so it's a plain singlet but
if<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.980> have<00:01:26.160> a<00:01:26.190> plain<00:01:26.460> singlet<00:01:26.880> that

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
if you have a plain singlet that

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.720 
if you have a plain singlet that
probably<00:01:27.330> works<00:01:27.570> even<00:01:27.900> better<00:01:28.070> this<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.400> from

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
probably works even better this is from

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.150 
probably works even better this is from
a<00:01:29.940> shopping<00:01:30.420> bag<00:01:30.720> which<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.200> cut<00:01:31.410> up<00:01:31.440> and<00:01:31.800> tied

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
something beachy because it probably

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.740
