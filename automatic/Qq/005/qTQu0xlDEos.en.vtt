 with the habit of reclassification 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.580
 Mrs 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.469
 semester a little bit 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:01:06.300
 if we go for the first of the fillings 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.640
 of how is a little dried out dough with 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.649
 the drawing that is here nice 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.630
 we must also with a little egg 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:17.060
 the edges so that later they stick 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.060
 having film to make watermarks 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.230
 in the brush that work that is 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.870
 cleansed 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.680
 opens painted with brushes too 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:33.150
 for many questions of cement 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:36.380
 as she explains sheds in fact what 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.380
 placed membrane 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.080
 only marquito stretched mass let's go 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.600
 with the first and fill a classic 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.700
 ricotta dot ricota half kilo 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.550
 approximately and we're going to mix the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.400
 spinach tura I like 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.400
 or else the bullet will end this world 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.640
 I need to eat spinach for that 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.959
 I'm doing region at the end the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.209
 spinach 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.099
 and in the raw barite is not the going to 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.280
 sautÃ© and we will not steam it 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.750
 well he had nothing right lieutenant okay 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.599
 washed and cut in julienne 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.390

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.190
 Spinach wig along with the ricotta 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.900
 let's place if we talk about the corner 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.470
 we are talking about spinach we speak in 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.870
 an ambush make a mouth fan 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.970
 but I'm not crazy either, so 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.280
 little bit of an ambush comes in handy with 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.120
 the combination of ricotta and spinach 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.250
 perfect 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.989
 there is a bit of an ambush 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.829
 some salt that I have here and I 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:54.430
 we take everything and a little pepper yes 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.739
 mister very well freshly ground and is expensive 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.540
 a little bit of black pepper a little 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.220
 grated cheese and we have the first 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.760
 we have the first of the fillings 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.340
 ricotta and spinach 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.099
 perfect classic then how good 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.290
 simple because the ricotta salt pepper 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.269
 nutmeg spinach raw well 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.140
 previously washed she is simple where 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.360
 the squirting force of olive oil a 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.950
 trickle of olive oil nothing more than 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.780
 this and we have the first of the 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.940

 from the edges a little bit I love you so much 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.579
 filling for another other 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.069
 we mix we match a little there there 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.799
 and what we do is close the edges 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:49.930
 then in the armed does not feel anything like that 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:53.849
 the king sits down right there 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:59.200
 and we are all going to develop 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:03.010
 perfect that he valued that in the sixth no 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:07.480
 we close well we are successful successes or 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:10.480
 not very strong and oil 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.769

 fully incorporate these emissions 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.160
 another type 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.840
 Hong Kong 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.490
 you want to put this sector up 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.919

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.849
