00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.060 
launcher as opposed to the grapple it's
like<00:01:04.229> when<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.409> had<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> solve<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> buildings

come<00:01:05.189> like<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.369> grapple<00:01:05.729> when<00:01:05.909> like<00:01:06.119> you're

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
come like a grapple when like you're

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.270

using<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.619> like<00:01:07.770> go<00:01:07.890> across<00:01:08.040> buildings

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280

close<00:01:08.549> up<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> line<00:01:08.880> launcher<00:01:09.210> from<00:01:09.450> Batman

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
close up the line launcher from Batman

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.960 
close up the line launcher from Batman
and<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.950> really<00:01:11.310> useful<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.610> think<00:01:11.640> it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
and that is really useful I think it

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.789 
and that is really useful I think it
looked<00:01:12.240> useful<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:13.140> get<00:01:13.260> from<00:01:13.470> one<00:01:13.650> building

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
looked useful to get from one building

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.620 
looked useful to get from one building
to<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> other<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.670> kind<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.090> don't<00:01:15.330> like

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
to the other but I kind of don't like

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.480 
to the other but I kind of don't like

the way when you're running around the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.100 
the way when you're running around the
city<00:01:17.670> you're<00:01:18.180> just<00:01:18.330> getting<00:01:18.479> these<00:01:18.600> prompts

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
city you're just getting these prompts

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.990 
city you're just getting these prompts
constantly<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:19.860> hey<00:01:20.040> use<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.520> grapple<00:01:20.909> and

constantly like hey use the grapple and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
use the grapples don't climb the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.320 
use the grapples don't climb the
building<00:01:22.680> use<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.340> grapple<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.180> like

building use the grapple and it's like

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330 
building use the grapple and it's like
I've<00:01:24.479> done<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.990> one<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.920> big<00:01:26.040> parts<00:01:26.159> of

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
I've done like one of the big parts of

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.429 
I've done like one of the big parts of
Saturn's<00:01:26.640> Creed<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.600> free<00:01:27.960> running<00:01:28.200> and

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
Saturn's Creed is the free running and

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.109 
Saturn's Creed is the free running and
the<00:01:28.590> parkour<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.490> much<00:01:29.640> fun<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.030> and

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
the parkour it's so much fun to do and

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.210 
the parkour it's so much fun to do and
then<00:01:30.210> adding<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> grapple<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.200> feel<00:01:31.920> like<00:01:32.100> it

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
then adding the grapple I feel like it

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.319 
then adding the grapple I feel like it
takes<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.490> away<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.610> feel<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.000> makes<00:01:33.150> more

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
takes it away I feel like it makes more

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.490 
takes it away I feel like it makes more
lazy<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.869> we're<00:01:33.960> gonna<00:01:34.049> kind<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.350> be<00:01:34.439> like

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
lazy and we're gonna kind of be like

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.590 
lazy and we're gonna kind of be like
relying<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> entire<00:01:35.850> time<00:01:36.180> because<00:01:36.509> of

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
relying on it the entire time because of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.179 
relying on it the entire time because of
how<00:01:36.720> wide<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.259> streets<00:01:37.560> are<00:01:37.680> like<00:01:37.799> they're

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
how wide the streets are like they're

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.469 
how wide the streets are like they're
like<00:01:38.310> oh<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.729> added<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.090> new<00:01:39.240> feature

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
like oh we added this new feature

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.660 
like oh we added this new feature
because<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.320> new<00:01:40.560> setting<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.130> ours<00:01:41.430> doesn't

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
because this new setting of ours doesn't

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.850 
because this new setting of ours doesn't
actually<00:01:41.970> make<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.170> Assassin's<00:01:43.649> Creed

gameplay<00:01:44.250> work<00:01:44.490> at<00:01:44.759> all<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.299> we're<00:01:45.420> adding

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
gameplay work at all so we're adding

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.910 
gameplay work at all so we're adding
this<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.020> actually<00:01:46.170> make<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.590> game<00:01:46.740> works

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
this to actually make the game works

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.710 
this to actually make the game works
like<00:01:47.100> wait<00:01:47.520> what<00:01:47.759> wait<00:01:48.030> why<00:01:48.329> are<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.450> doing

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
like wait what wait why are you doing

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.880 
like wait what wait why are you doing
that<00:01:48.840> why<00:01:49.020> don't<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.320> pick<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> setting<00:01:49.860> that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
that why don't you pick a setting that

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.560 
that why don't you pick a setting that
makes<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.430> gameplay<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.850> Assassin's<00:01:51.030> Creed

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
makes the gameplay of Assassin's Creed

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.090 
makes the gameplay of Assassin's Creed
work<00:01:51.750> white<00:01:52.049> change<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.530> gameplay<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.890> fit

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
work white change the gameplay to fit

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.950 
work white change the gameplay to fit
the<00:01:53.220> setting<00:01:53.399> use<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.420> setting<00:01:54.840> to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the setting use the setting to

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.450 
the setting use the setting to
complement<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> gameplay<00:01:55.979> surely<00:01:56.310> that

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
complement the gameplay surely that

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.830 
complement the gameplay surely that
makes<00:01:56.670> more<00:01:56.850> sense<00:01:56.909> than<00:01:57.299> being<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.659> oh

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
makes more sense than being like oh

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.660 
makes more sense than being like oh
because<00:01:58.200> our<00:01:58.380> new<00:01:58.770> setting<00:01:59.009> doesn't<00:01:59.340> allow

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
because our new setting doesn't allow

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.399 
because our new setting doesn't allow
for<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.969> freerunning<00:02:00.420> how<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.659> used<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.930> we're

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
for the freerunning how it used to we're

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.719 
for the freerunning how it used to we're
just<00:02:01.560> adding<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.860> new<00:02:01.920> tool<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.490> make<00:02:02.579> it

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
just adding this new tool to make it

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.310 
just adding this new tool to make it
easy<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.390> we<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:03.960> setting

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
easy just so we can have this setting

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.230 
easy just so we can have this setting
like<00:02:04.469> think<00:02:05.219> about<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.610> Assassin's<00:02:06.030> Creed

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
like think about it in Assassin's Creed

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.300 
like think about it in Assassin's Creed
2<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.899> setting<00:02:07.350> was<00:02:07.469> made<00:02:07.649> perfectly<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:08.280> you

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
2 the setting was made perfectly so you

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.699 
2 the setting was made perfectly so you
could<00:02:08.610> free<00:02:08.819> run<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.479> then<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:09.750> Victorian

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
could free run but then in Victorian

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.440 
could free run but then in Victorian
London<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:11.129> Assassin's<00:02:11.550> Creed<00:02:11.700> syndicate<00:02:11.879> the

London in Assassin's Creed syndicate the

London in Assassin's Creed syndicate the
set

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
set

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.160 
set
doesn't<00:02:13.090> allow<00:02:13.360> for<00:02:13.390> free<00:02:13.810> running<00:02:13.959> because

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
doesn't allow for free running because

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.780 
doesn't allow for free running because
of<00:02:14.379> how<00:02:14.590> wide<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.099> streets<00:02:15.430> are<00:02:15.549> so<00:02:15.670> they've

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
of how wide the streets are so they've

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.550 
of how wide the streets are so they've
had<00:02:15.879> to<00:02:15.939> add<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.540> this<00:02:16.720> new<00:02:16.930> feature<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.439> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
had to add in this new feature of the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.500 
had to add in this new feature of the
rope<00:02:17.739> launcher<00:02:17.950> which<00:02:18.579> I<00:02:18.760> feel<00:02:19.030> like<00:02:19.269> it<00:02:19.480> is

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
rope launcher which I feel like it is

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.929 
rope launcher which I feel like it is
just<00:02:19.930> there<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:20.799> they<00:02:21.010> can<00:02:21.189> have<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.549> setting

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
just there so they can have the setting

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.759 
just there so they can have the setting
otherwise<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.599> would<00:02:22.720> be<00:02:22.840> impossible<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.530> free

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
otherwise it would be impossible to free

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.500 
otherwise it would be impossible to free
run<00:02:23.920> around<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.400> don't<00:02:24.730> know<00:02:24.909> only<00:02:25.299> know<00:02:25.390> what

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
run around I don't know only know what

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.970 
run around I don't know only know what
you<00:02:25.629> guys<00:02:25.780> think<00:02:26.110> in<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.439> comment<00:02:26.739> section

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
you guys think in the comment section

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.160 
you guys think in the comment section
below<00:02:27.010> because<00:02:27.459> personally<00:02:28.239> I<00:02:28.390> think<00:02:28.900> it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
below because personally I think it

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.420 
below because personally I think it
might<00:02:29.319> be<00:02:29.560> added<00:02:29.769> for<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.950> sake<00:02:30.129> of<00:02:30.159> it

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
might be added for the sake of it

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.920 
might be added for the sake of it
although<00:02:30.819> it<00:02:31.060> does<00:02:31.269> look<00:02:31.450> like<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.690> coming

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
although it does look like it coming

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.690 
although it does look like it coming
useful<00:02:32.200> in<00:02:32.290> some<00:02:32.470> some<00:02:32.769> instances<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:33.280> don't

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
useful in some some instances I don't
