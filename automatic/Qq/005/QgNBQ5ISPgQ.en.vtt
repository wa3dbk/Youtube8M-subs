00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.660
 and what are the top news of the 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.269
 Model railway manufacturer from Sonneberg 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.570
 we have very very wide program we 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:19.009
 think four track-wide starting from 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.710
 from the gauge n over tth 0 and g and 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.720
 I find it almost hard 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.970
 Of the 300 new products we have in total 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.520
 in the program some have to pick out 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.260
 we have in the area because if you are with 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.660
 start the smallest track width 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.850
 So we have two this year 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.890
 interesting stories once 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:43.220
 an electric railcar coradia br 440 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.080
 and on the other hand the dog's head for the 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.720
 Dutch market both are both 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.430
 are the novelties that will be this year 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.519
 be brought into the delivery and 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.220
 you can already be that first 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.110
 splash under the first pattern of the 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.850
 See korans here in the showcase 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.879
 then in the trade area 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.610
 What I particularly like ev 200 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.650
 diesel locomotives of the db we will 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.899
 bring out this year and shape 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.369
 are almost done which is also the 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.020
 next the extradition come 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.469
 there is another 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.979
 model the b 130 also a diesel locomotive and 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:21.259
 Last but not least, our great track the 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.950
 I think that's what I think 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:28.609
 most interesting model the steam locomotive br 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.039
 64 we also here as sdl model as 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:32.420
 to exhibit it in hand model where 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.609
 we will cram in formulas soon 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.369
 and overall, I think a pretty 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.719
 Good program what our customers tell us 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.719
 so far said they are so 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.070
 Relatively satisfied with what we do this 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.359
 year, and me 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.829
 believe it is important that we too 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:50.630
 can deliver everything that is next to it 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.969
 the one announcing it I believe that 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.229
 most important and in good quality and that 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.979
 we wanted to make last year 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.979
 We make them too
