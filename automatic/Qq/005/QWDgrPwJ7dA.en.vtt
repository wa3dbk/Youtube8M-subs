00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
want to rip off the front part of it yet

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.160

right<00:01:38.970> here<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.420> see<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.689> front<00:01:39.900> still

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
right here you can see the front still

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.280 
right here you can see the front still
on<00:01:40.350> because<00:01:41.250> uh<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.820> know<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.259> want<00:01:43.259> to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
on because uh you know you want to

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.780 
on because uh you know you want to
squeegee<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.710> down<00:01:43.920> before<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.520> so

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
squeegee it down before you do that so

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.980 
squeegee it down before you do that so
you<00:01:44.880> don't<00:01:45.060> scratch<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.689> glass

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.300 

so<00:01:52.990> it's<00:01:53.170> going<00:01:53.320> to<00:01:53.380> be<00:01:53.470> hard<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:53.890> get<00:01:54.040> all<00:01:54.159> the

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
so it's going to be hard to get all the

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.750 
so it's going to be hard to get all the
bubbles<00:01:54.490> down<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:56.979> what<00:01:57.250> I<00:01:57.280> got<00:01:57.520> so

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
bubbles down and this is what I got so

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.890 
bubbles down and this is what I got so
far<00:01:59.190> and<00:02:00.190> let's<00:02:00.610> go<00:02:00.729> and<00:02:00.909> see<00:02:01.000> how<00:02:01.240> responsive

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
far and let's go and see how responsive

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:09.570 
far and let's go and see how responsive
it<00:02:01.990> is<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.750> right<00:02:04.960> here<00:02:07.200> could<00:02:08.200> see<00:02:08.500> that<00:02:08.739> you

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
it is so right here could see that you

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.680

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.300 
perfectly fine and this is definitely a
hard<00:02:32.019> glass<00:02:32.380> it<00:02:32.739> almost<00:02:32.890> feels<00:02:33.250> like

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
hard glass it almost feels like

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.610 
hard glass it almost feels like
nothing's<00:02:33.820> on<00:02:34.030> there<00:02:34.269> actually<00:02:34.630> feels<00:02:35.410> like
