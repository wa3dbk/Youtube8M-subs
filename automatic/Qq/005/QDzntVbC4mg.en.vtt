know<00:00:21.630> their<00:00:21.930> looks<00:00:22.140> their<00:00:22.410> lip<00:00:22.619> glosses<00:00:22.859> or

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
know their looks their lip glosses or

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.980 
know their looks their lip glosses or
twenty<00:00:23.519> dollars<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> piece<00:00:24.060> take<00:00:24.720> me<00:00:24.810> with<00:00:24.930> him
