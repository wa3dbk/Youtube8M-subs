00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.140
 PD-task is that we are in the side boat located in reform 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.550
 in the city of mexico right now we are with the bartender tenor rafael who was 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.889
 one of the jurors in onton costs bartender 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.179
 bartender returned in 2011 from Madrid 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:18.949
 e by ter been by caracas 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.759
 so good media we're here because we want to know what are the cocktails 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.029
 Most chic and master in 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.419
 the moment there that defines them to prepare 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.129
 tamén to talcual make first basket preparas we will not be an attractive 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:31.869
 extra 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.750
 that is a drink of life of the one that has but is with pure we vote to be 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.510
 never an exclusive center 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.050
 it sounds a bit punchy not 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.989
 it was spoken for nothing is I think that all the measures you estimate themselves 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.550
 jokes how many you take in time also that you stay in the place you do not know 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.240
 taking 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.150
 the less than 10 minutes was the same effect as if you would take 20 to the best 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.320
 and a lot 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.949
 clear then good and you have the nea prepare them and take note the cinema 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.040
 feel here get ready let's make an act today and Pyrenees 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.490
 I won to be like it is a small one that vineyard good this rather is a 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.189
 version of the tta mataelpino scarlet and pineapple is a weakness 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.040
 the edition of brazil 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.299
 what is done with cane brandy we a small 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.069
 another ovation that was made in the United States since it does not take much 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:18.360
 that brandy loved the cocktail 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.100
 it said brand and shots 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.470
 it is the only one with that that has let's use macerated fruit 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.120
 and the only thing that we are going to change this time is going to be the place of 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.490
 brandy let's put mouth 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.110
 then well let's start with something very simple a glass this rocks or bags 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.120
 they are what they are usually called 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.130
 let's add some orange cubes 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.620
 and we have them already cut 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.149
 I can be great about everything I need the shell 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.380
 because the shell the house has all the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.420
 in essence this method the acids and apart has 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.320
 that is done and that is essential is that they have the in the the fruit 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.190
 it has all the flavor and aroma then I'm very interested in those 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.240
 these issues between the drink released when we go to massera 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.070
 although we are going to put a little strawberry 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.890
 to be a different combination p lasquetty two normal houses are 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.469
 pineapple press 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:14.909
 of lemon di I wanted to be a small puncture so it's a little bit more 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.619
 exotic is recorded by the freshest flavors and this one I think that's the 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:23.079
 essence of a cocktail enjoy it in a different way not and avoid above all 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.350
 that in Mexico and we still have a cocktail bar 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.399
 the presentation 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:29.300
 that will make us the difference 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.300
 this new one we are going to put two tablespoons of sugar 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:34.899
 is essential 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:37.239
 because that's what the sweet 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.330
 the Murcia your drink as we go filis arturo forest fossilize two 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:42.709
 spoons 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.559
 stressed that the Chinese dancers have at home can use 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:51.029
 the spoon type to coffee makers and impose two and a half tablespoon if with 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.379
 that will have the same amount still using me here 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:55.919
 then we used 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.009
 this is called macerated 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:03.019
 it is very important to use it this we have stone wood aede many 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.280
 inventions as if it were 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.760
 our or our little people there is no chemistry no stone 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.760
 but maybe he uses a lot for wood because he manages to extract all the flavors 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.819
 of fruits and that what we want 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.269
 let's go easy steps is nothing more than that inserted 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.359
 nostrum do something and squeeze 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:20.829
 we do not want 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.840
 pulverize the fruit the only thing that we will have the certainty 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.799
 simply 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.499
 that they extract their essences that their flavor of their juices that what we want not 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:32.799
 we have field hurry 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.819
 and we're going to stir it up with your house every time 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.569
 more grams than we do the movement to these moments herculanas to achieve 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.039
 take out these flavors 

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:43.449
 let's stir a little 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.449
 to create mixing with the sukkah 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.439
 Now what we are going to do is we are going to add 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:55.589
 this is our measuring cup of navarra that siam there 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:58.719
 we have two ounces of an ounce 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:03.969
 an 11 site to the entity to 30 thousand liters more or less speaking in our of the 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:04.769
 our 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.579
 this stadium to me I explain not this then 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.079
 what are we going to use those 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.289
 an ounce 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:16.289
 of pineapple juice 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.870
 then we are going to add ice 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.099
 This is very important 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.099
 so that when it comes to our distillate 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.860
 I arrived completely ferido to abás 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:35.659
 2 upi lizard two ounces 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.270
 this is going to be 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.050
 the base our drink 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.050
 totally 

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:44.819
 and as you see 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:48.219
 if he has an alcoholic base but when what happened in those cases 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:49.340
 to see that the taste 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.860
 it's excellent 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.689
 the truth is that the flavors are balanced very well, the fruit 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:58.910
 all the blame how cool we are doing 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.469
 in his opinion it is also fresh 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:04.469
 all these factors are going to help us so that we have a result 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.909
 amazing 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.919
 and especially taste will help us a lot 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.219
 simply 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:13.279
 we stir very carefully 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.689
 giving it a little laps in our step so that nothing that stays in 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:20.289
 the background is stuck even the super fan little do not want big 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.289
 lumps also down 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.469
 that would be all simply 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:29.259
 to enjoy 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.270
 ready then you have to be to go to the street equestrian is that if I'm not wrong 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.490
 then I can 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.280
 We are going to approve the label please check the flavors especially for 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.969
 let me tell systemic released or not 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:40.349
 efe 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:43.349
 such advantages 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.139
 the story indicates 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.400
 that is the flavors and another one that balanced that we have provokes 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.720
 I believe that among the fruit that is fresh, the courses are fresh, the 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.770
 difference the truth that vodka recent casinos like 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.069
 very fresh is very light then she is very rich who knows she is like german 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:06.069
 If I am I will recommend it a lot for an afternoon 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:10.399
 of sortu on hot days is done on the beach even if they have text can 

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:14.719
 to leave oriental field just march one of these with warm place and with your 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:18.429
 couple that you better not be very cool murray as above all 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.160
 after this he attended the text to which he will teach us to prepare other 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.770
 of more days
