episode we're gonna be talking a little
bit<00:00:27.820> about<00:00:28.150> traditional<00:00:28.869> nomenclature

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
bit about traditional nomenclature

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.100 
bit about traditional nomenclature
transitional<00:00:30.609> nomenclature<00:00:31.329> you<00:00:31.449> say<00:00:31.660> yes

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
transitional nomenclature you say yes

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.020 
transitional nomenclature you say yes
it's<00:00:32.470> like<00:00:32.980> nomenclature<00:00:33.850> that's

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
it's like nomenclature that's

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.869 
it's like nomenclature that's
transitional<00:00:34.809> I<00:00:34.870> take<00:00:35.170> it<00:00:35.350> it<00:00:35.589> is<00:00:35.769> by<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:36.670> way

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
transitional I take it it is by the way

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:38.460 
transitional I take it it is by the way
my<00:00:37.089> name<00:00:37.269> is<00:00:37.300> Kevin<00:00:37.720> Martin<00:00:37.989> and<00:00:38.290> we'll<00:00:38.379> be

presenting this episode for you guys
today<00:00:39.910> okay<00:00:40.329> so<00:00:40.750> why<00:00:41.680> do<00:00:41.739> we<00:00:41.920> need<00:00:41.980> this

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
today okay so why do we need this

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.939 
today okay so why do we need this
transitional<00:00:43.420> nomenclature<00:00:44.320> it<00:00:44.409> sounds

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
transitional nomenclature it sounds

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.060 
transitional nomenclature it sounds
magical<00:00:45.699> it<00:00:46.420> is<00:00:46.540> it's<00:00:46.809> very<00:00:47.019> mystical<00:00:47.500> okay

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
magical it is it's very mystical okay

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.860 
magical it is it's very mystical okay
okay<00:00:48.579> so<00:00:48.909> Kevin<00:00:49.210> you<00:00:49.360> remember<00:00:49.720> on<00:00:49.780> the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
okay so Kevin you remember on the

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.569 
okay so Kevin you remember on the
periodic<00:00:50.290> table<00:00:50.470> there's<00:00:51.100> all<00:00:51.370> those

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
periodic table there's all those

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.040 
periodic table there's all those
elements<00:00:51.760> in<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.180> middle<00:00:52.480> and<00:00:52.629> the<00:00:52.690> d-block

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
elements in the middle and the d-block

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.810 
elements in the middle and the d-block
and<00:00:53.440> they're<00:00:53.800> called<00:00:54.039> the<00:00:54.160> transitional

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
and they're called the transitional

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.660 
and they're called the transitional
elements<00:00:55.030> oh<00:00:55.570> yeah<00:00:56.410> it's<00:00:56.770> a<00:00:56.920> big<00:00:56.949> block<00:00:57.609> of

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
elements oh yeah it's a big block of

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.380 
elements oh yeah it's a big block of
Mills<00:00:58.149> that<00:00:58.539> are<00:00:58.960> weird<00:00:59.920> and<00:01:00.160> stuff<00:01:00.550> exactly

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
Mills that are weird and stuff exactly

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.670 
Mills that are weird and stuff exactly
it's<00:01:01.539> basically<00:01:01.899> a<00:01:01.989> whole<00:01:02.170> bunch<00:01:02.320> of<00:01:02.379> metals

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
it's basically a whole bunch of metals

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.959 
it's basically a whole bunch of metals
that<00:01:02.829> don't<00:01:03.129> know<00:01:03.219> what<00:01:03.370> their<00:01:03.489> charges

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
that don't know what their charges

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.120 
that don't know what their charges
they're<00:01:04.239> undecided<00:01:04.809> about<00:01:05.320> it<00:01:05.470> okay

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
they're undecided about it okay

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.560 
they're undecided about it okay
but<00:01:06.250> unfortunately<00:01:06.369> compounds<00:01:07.179> are<00:01:07.360> made

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
but unfortunately compounds are made

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.900 
but unfortunately compounds are made
with<00:01:07.810> them<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.380> as<00:01:08.920> such<00:01:09.190> we<00:01:09.369> got<00:01:09.520> a<00:01:09.550> daemon

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
with them and as such we got a daemon

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.830 
with them and as such we got a daemon
ah<00:01:10.619> hey<00:01:11.619> which<00:01:12.070> can<00:01:12.250> be<00:01:12.340> difficult<00:01:12.789> yeah<00:01:13.240> so

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
ah hey which can be difficult yeah so

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.999 
ah hey which can be difficult yeah so
it's<00:01:14.050> important<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.500> be<00:01:14.619> able<00:01:14.679> to<00:01:14.800> you<00:01:14.979> know

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
it's important to be able to you know

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.440 
it's important to be able to you know
know<00:01:15.490> some<00:01:15.729> of<00:01:15.789> the<00:01:15.850> different<00:01:15.940> techniques

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
know some of the different techniques

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.419 
know some of the different techniques
and<00:01:16.690> how<00:01:16.840> to<00:01:16.899> name<00:01:17.140> traditional<00:01:17.649> elements<00:01:18.130> so

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
and how to name traditional elements so

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.310 
and how to name traditional elements so
therefore<00:01:18.610> reddish<00:01:19.360> one<00:01:19.539> moment<00:01:19.780> click<00:01:19.869> okay

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
therefore reddish one moment click okay

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.249 
therefore reddish one moment click okay
so<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.770> is<00:01:20.830> important<00:01:21.460> yes<00:01:21.820> all<00:01:22.300> right<00:01:22.509> okay

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
so it is important yes all right okay

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.090 
so it is important yes all right okay
why<00:01:23.619> is<00:01:23.680> your<00:01:23.799> big<00:01:23.920> transitional<00:01:24.430> element

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
why is your big transitional element

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.109 
why is your big transitional element
let's<00:01:27.100> do<00:01:27.310> I<00:01:27.340> iron<00:01:28.119> very<00:01:28.630> good<00:01:28.930> iron<00:01:29.290> is<00:01:29.770> Fe<00:01:30.119> all

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
let's do I iron very good iron is Fe all

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.230 
let's do I iron very good iron is Fe all
right<00:01:31.329> okay<00:01:32.140> makes<00:01:32.770> complete<00:01:33.280> sense<00:01:33.310> I<00:01:33.909> know

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
right okay makes complete sense I know

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.690 
right okay makes complete sense I know
right<00:01:34.570> well<00:01:35.439> it's<00:01:35.560> actually<00:01:35.710> from<00:01:36.130> I<00:01:36.310> think<00:01:36.369> so

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
right well it's actually from I think so

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.100 
right well it's actually from I think so
that<00:01:36.729> route<00:01:37.119> fairness<00:01:37.540> or<00:01:37.689> something<00:01:37.990> like

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
that route fairness or something like

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.620 
that route fairness or something like
that<00:01:38.170> ah<00:01:38.500> which<00:01:39.340> I<00:01:39.460> believe<00:01:39.729> is<00:01:39.939> for<00:01:40.270> metal<00:01:40.570> or

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
that ah which I believe is for metal or

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.340 
that ah which I believe is for metal or
iron<00:01:40.689> or<00:01:40.990> something

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
iron or something

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.170 
iron or something
yeah<00:01:41.619> I'm<00:01:41.829> not<00:01:42.040> sure<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.549> know<00:01:42.579> that<00:01:42.700> ancient

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
yeah I'm not sure you know that ancient

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.359 
yeah I'm not sure you know that ancient
language<00:01:43.450> that<00:01:43.689> yeah<00:01:44.530> our<00:01:44.829> own<00:01:44.979> language<00:01:45.250> is

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
language that yeah our own language is

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.469 
language that yeah our own language is
based<00:01:45.549> on<00:01:45.759> yeah<00:01:46.659> all<00:01:47.110> right<00:01:47.350> so<00:01:47.680> iron<00:01:48.130> I<00:01:48.579> am<00:01:48.820> now

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
based on yeah all right so iron I am now

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.870 
based on yeah all right so iron I am now
the<00:01:49.810> thing<00:01:50.079> is<00:01:50.110> iron<00:01:50.890> has<00:01:51.040> no<00:01:51.310> idea<00:01:51.610> what<00:01:51.790> this

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
the thing is iron has no idea what this

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.749 
the thing is iron has no idea what this
charge<00:01:52.210> wants<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.600> be<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.890> needs<00:01:54.280> do<00:01:54.490> more

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
charge wants to be and needs do more

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.440 
charge wants to be and needs do more
decisive<00:01:55.329> it<00:01:55.509> does<00:01:55.719> okay<00:01:56.170> so<00:01:57.009> what<00:01:57.759> happens<00:01:58.180> a

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
decisive it does okay so what happens a

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.810 
decisive it does okay so what happens a
lot<00:01:58.840> of<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:58.990> times<00:01:59.229> is<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.860> except<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.700> an

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
lot of the times is that except to an

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.170 
lot of the times is that except to an
anion<00:02:01.659> or<00:02:01.990> a<00:02:02.020> negatively<00:02:02.530> charged<00:02:03.070> ion<00:02:03.369> to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
anion or a negatively charged ion to

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.880 
anion or a negatively charged ion to
come<00:02:04.390> in<00:02:04.570> and<00:02:04.810> bond<00:02:05.049> with<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.439> transitional

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
come in and bond with the transitional

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.039 
come in and bond with the transitional
element<00:02:06.340> and<00:02:06.670> it<00:02:06.820> will<00:02:06.969> decide<00:02:07.390> what<00:02:07.719> charge

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
element and it will decide what charge

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:09.810 
element and it will decide what charge
the<00:02:08.289> transitional<00:02:08.769> element<00:02:09.039> gets<00:02:09.160> so<00:02:09.700> it's

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
the transitional element gets so it's

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.060 
the transitional element gets so it's
like<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.299> guy<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.899> kind<00:02:11.049> of<00:02:11.140> makes<00:02:11.739> up<00:02:11.920> your

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
like the guy that kind of makes up your

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.780 
like the guy that kind of makes up your
mind

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
mind

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.860 
mind
pretty<00:02:13.420> much<00:02:13.540> exact<00:02:15.150> things<00:02:16.150> lightly<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.600> guess

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
pretty much exact things lightly I guess

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.330 
pretty much exact things lightly I guess
yeah<00:02:17.380> okay<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:18.489> picking<00:02:18.850> on<00:02:19.030> them

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.940 

phosphorus<00:02:23.340> phosphorus<00:02:23.850> okay<00:02:24.660> we<00:02:25.500> can<00:02:25.680> tack<00:02:25.920> a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
phosphorus phosphorus okay we can tack a

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.949 
phosphorus phosphorus okay we can tack a
phosphorus<00:02:26.580> onto<00:02:26.880> their<00:02:27.030> everything<00:02:27.510> simple

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
phosphorus onto their everything simple

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.300 
phosphorus onto their everything simple
mm-hmm<00:02:28.530> okay

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
mm-hmm okay

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.880 
mm-hmm okay
okay<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:30.240> there<00:02:30.450> we<00:02:30.540> go<00:02:30.569> we<00:02:31.050> had<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.350> iron<00:02:31.620> and

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
okay so there we go we had of iron and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.000 
okay so there we go we had of iron and
phosphorus<00:02:32.580> now<00:02:33.420> here's<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.900> thing<00:02:34.010> we're

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
phosphorus now here's the thing we're

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.920 
phosphorus now here's the thing we're
not<00:02:35.220> sure<00:02:35.490> what<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:35.910> charge<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.330> iron<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.750> you

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
not sure what the charge and iron is you

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.780 
not sure what the charge and iron is you
okay<00:02:37.530> well<00:02:37.650> we<00:02:37.740> do<00:02:37.890> know<00:02:38.070> if<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.340> charge<00:02:38.610> on

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
okay well we do know if the charge on

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.699 
okay well we do know if the charge on
phosphorus<00:02:39.180> since<00:02:39.450> it's<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.690> nonmetal<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:40.410> an

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
phosphorus since it's a nonmetal so an

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.130 
phosphorus since it's a nonmetal so an
anion<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:41.430> charge<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.790> always<00:02:42.120> fixed<00:02:42.330> so

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
anion is charge is always fixed so

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.720 
anion is charge is always fixed so
basically<00:02:43.530> what<00:02:43.740> you<00:02:43.860> do<00:02:44.010> when<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.370> see<00:02:44.550> the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
basically what you do when you see the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.250 
basically what you do when you see the
chemical<00:02:45.120> formulas<00:02:45.600> for<00:02:45.780> transitional

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
chemical formulas for transitional

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.770 
chemical formulas for transitional
elements<00:02:46.670> basically<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.880> find<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.209> nonmetal

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
elements basically you find the nonmetal

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.440 
elements basically you find the nonmetal
get<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.470> charge<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:50.280> work<00:02:50.400> backwards<00:02:50.850> okay

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
get the charge and work backwards okay

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.900 
get the charge and work backwards okay
okay<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.530> we<00:02:52.680> know<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:52.860> phosphorus<00:02:53.640> has<00:02:53.850> a

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
okay so we know that phosphorus has a

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.090 
okay so we know that phosphorus has a
negative<00:02:54.390> three<00:02:54.600> charge<00:02:54.870> all<00:02:55.500> right<00:02:55.680> right

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
negative three charge all right right

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.710 
negative three charge all right right
here<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:57.660> okay<00:02:58.310> yeah<00:02:59.310> we<00:02:59.489> know<00:02:59.700> that<00:03:00.060> since<00:03:00.390> the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
here so okay yeah we know that since the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.120 
here so okay yeah we know that since the
iron<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.200> phosphorus<00:03:01.500> are<00:03:01.739> bonded

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
iron and the phosphorus are bonded

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.220 
iron and the phosphorus are bonded
overall<00:03:02.550> it's<00:03:02.700> got<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:02.940> be<00:03:03.030> neutral<00:03:03.420> yeah<00:03:03.810> so

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
overall it's got to be neutral yeah so

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.990 
overall it's got to be neutral yeah so
because<00:03:04.560> phosphorus<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.430> negative<00:03:05.790> three

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
because phosphorus is a negative three

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.120 
because phosphorus is a negative three
charge<00:03:06.300> you<00:03:06.989> know<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:07.590> order<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:07.920> be

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
charge you know that in order to be

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.780 
charge you know that in order to be
neutral

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
neutral

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.850 
neutral
what<00:03:09.150> charges<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.690> don't<00:03:09.720> have<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.140> have<00:03:10.260> well

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
what charges I don't have to have well

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.680 
what charges I don't have to have well
if<00:03:11.100> there's<00:03:11.340> only<00:03:11.519> one<00:03:11.670> I<00:03:12.030> have<00:03:12.209> only<00:03:12.450> one

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
if there's only one I have only one

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.660 
if there's only one I have only one
phosphorus<00:03:13.410> then<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:13.890> guess<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.220> iron<00:03:14.400> would

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
phosphorus then I guess the iron would

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.520 
phosphorus then I guess the iron would
also<00:03:14.880> have<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.209> be<00:03:15.420> plus<00:03:15.660> what<00:03:16.019> happy<00:03:16.290> plus

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
also have to be plus what happy plus

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.580 
also have to be plus what happy plus
three<00:03:16.890> exactly<00:03:17.900> just<00:03:18.900> like<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.320> which

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
three exactly just like that which

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.850 
three exactly just like that which
bounces<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.160> out<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.550> you<00:03:20.610> get<00:03:20.730> f8p<00:03:21.269> okay<00:03:22.050> okay

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
bounces it out and you get f8p okay okay

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.819 
bounces it out and you get f8p okay okay
and<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.580> said<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:24.150> had<00:03:25.050> you<00:03:25.440> know<00:03:25.560> multiple

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
and I said I had you know multiple

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.830 
and I said I had you know multiple
charges<00:03:26.370> what<00:03:26.760> if<00:03:26.880> we<00:03:27.060> put<00:03:27.329> it<00:03:27.450> with<00:03:27.600> something

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
charges what if we put it with something

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.710 
charges what if we put it with something
like<00:03:27.959> sulfur<00:03:28.920> okay<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:30.030> would<00:03:30.150> change<00:03:30.480> it

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
like sulfur okay so that would change it

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.840 
like sulfur okay so that would change it
so<00:03:31.049> let's<00:03:31.709> go<00:03:31.890> ahead<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.280> actually<00:03:32.459> I'm<00:03:32.730> going

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
so let's go ahead and actually I'm going

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
so let's go ahead and actually I'm going
to<00:03:32.910> go<00:03:33.000> ahead<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.269> write<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.480> name<00:03:33.630> of<00:03:33.780> this

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
to go ahead and write the name of this

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.120 
to go ahead and write the name of this
first<00:03:34.049> that<00:03:34.320> would<00:03:34.440> contain<00:03:34.709> touch<00:03:34.890> from<00:03:35.040> that

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
first that would contain touch from that

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.740 
first that would contain touch from that
okay<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.610> then<00:03:35.730> I'll<00:03:35.790> be<00:03:35.910> kind<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.120> facto<00:03:36.630> on

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
okay and then I'll be kind of facto on

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.600 
okay and then I'll be kind of facto on
the<00:03:36.840> sulfur<00:03:37.049> so<00:03:37.620> whenever<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.220> name<00:03:38.430> these

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
the sulfur so whenever you name these

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.890 
the sulfur so whenever you name these
things<00:03:38.640> basically<00:03:39.150> going<00:03:39.329> from<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.570> chemical

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
things basically going from the chemical

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.750 
things basically going from the chemical
formula<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.410> actual<00:03:40.769> name<00:03:41.010> you're<00:03:41.549> going

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
formula to the actual name you're going

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.550 
formula to the actual name you're going
to<00:03:41.910> use<00:03:42.060> Roman<00:03:42.299> numerals<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.870> designate<00:03:43.410> the

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
to use Roman numerals to designate the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.699 
to use Roman numerals to designate the
charge<00:03:43.860> on<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.579> metal<00:03:44.970> okay<00:03:45.299> okay<00:03:45.959> so<00:03:46.500> we're

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
charge on the metal okay okay so we're

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.400 
charge on the metal okay okay so we're
basically<00:03:46.950> gonna<00:03:47.250> name<00:03:47.519> it<00:03:47.549> iron<00:03:48.290> since<00:03:49.290> the

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
basically gonna name it iron since the

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.020 
basically gonna name it iron since the
designer<00:03:49.709> obviously<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.730> then<00:03:50.820> we're<00:03:50.910> going

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
designer obviously and then we're going

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.140 
designer obviously and then we're going
to<00:03:51.060> do<00:03:51.150> parenthesis<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.400> Roman<00:03:53.730> numeral

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
to do parenthesis and the Roman numeral

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.880 
to do parenthesis and the Roman numeral
three<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.900> indicate<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:55.440> has<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.590> positive

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
three to indicate it has a positive

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.789 
three to indicate it has a positive
three<00:03:56.280> charge<00:03:56.310> okay<00:04:00.290> so<00:04:01.290> it's<00:04:01.530> a<00:04:01.590> lot<00:04:01.769> like

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
three charge okay so it's a lot like

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.440 
three charge okay so it's a lot like
naming<00:04:02.220> ionic<00:04:02.820> compound<00:04:03.329> you<00:04:03.510> just<00:04:03.690> need<00:04:03.900> that

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
naming ionic compound you just need that

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.259 
naming ionic compound you just need that
parenthesis<00:04:06.480> basically<00:04:07.079> that's<00:04:07.230> exactly<00:04:07.709> ah

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
parenthesis basically that's exactly ah

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.759 
parenthesis basically that's exactly ah
well<00:04:09.269> it's<00:04:09.420> not<00:04:09.540> too<00:04:09.810> bad

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
well it's not too bad

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.340 
well it's not too bad
make<00:04:10.980> sense<00:04:11.190> yeah<00:04:11.670> that<00:04:11.790> makes<00:04:11.970> sense<00:04:12.390> okay<00:04:12.900> so

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
make sense yeah that makes sense okay so

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.110 
make sense yeah that makes sense okay so
let's<00:04:13.650> go<00:04:13.769> ahead<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.549> want<00:04:14.579> to<00:04:14.820> pair<00:04:15.000> this

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
let's go ahead and you want to pair this

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.699 
let's go ahead and you want to pair this
thing<00:04:15.360> off<00:04:15.540> with<00:04:15.840> silver<00:04:16.289> right<00:04:16.470> yeah<00:04:16.650> let's

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
thing off with silver right yeah let's

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.550 
thing off with silver right yeah let's
see<00:04:17.190> what<00:04:17.549> happens<00:04:18.209> when<00:04:18.450> we<00:04:18.510> do<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:18.780> okay

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
see what happens when we do that okay

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.680 
see what happens when we do that okay
let's<00:04:20.190> go<00:04:20.310> ahead<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.760> get<00:04:20.910> Blues<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:21.450> way<00:04:21.600> we

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
let's go ahead and get Blues that way we

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.219 
let's go ahead and get Blues that way we
can<00:04:21.840> kind<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.169> designate<00:04:22.680> between<00:04:22.979> these<00:04:24.229> okay

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
can kind of designate between these okay

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.730 
can kind of designate between these okay
so<00:04:26.220> iron<00:04:26.640> again<00:04:28.130> paired<00:04:29.130> with<00:04:29.490> sulfur

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
so iron again paired with sulfur

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.160 
so iron again paired with sulfur
so<00:04:30.920> we<00:04:31.010> have<00:04:31.160> Fe<00:04:31.460> es<00:04:31.670> all<00:04:32.270> right<00:04:32.450> let<00:04:32.630> me<00:04:32.660> let<00:04:33.020> me

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
so we have Fe es all right let me let me

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.200 
so we have Fe es all right let me let me
try<00:04:33.380> this<00:04:33.500> okay<00:04:34.630> okay<00:04:35.630> so<00:04:36.430> sulfur<00:04:37.430> you<00:04:38.090> know

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
try this okay okay so sulfur you know

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.300 
try this okay okay so sulfur you know
where<00:04:38.510> is<00:04:38.810> in<00:04:39.170> here<00:04:39.410> on<00:04:39.560> a<00:04:39.590> table<00:04:39.920> that<00:04:40.070> has<00:04:40.280> a

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
where is in here on a table that has a

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.850 
where is in here on a table that has a
negative<00:04:40.670> charge<00:04:41.470> and<00:04:42.470> then<00:04:43.280> as<00:04:44.200> is<00:04:45.200> you<00:04:45.800> know

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
negative charge and then as is you know

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.770 
negative charge and then as is you know
the<00:04:46.100> whole<00:04:46.130> compound<00:04:46.880> has<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.240> be<00:04:47.330> neutral<00:04:47.780> so

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
the whole compound has to be neutral so

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.720 
the whole compound has to be neutral so
so<00:04:50.780> to<00:04:50.870> cancel<00:04:51.560> a<00:04:51.710> negative<00:04:52.100> two<00:04:52.310> we<00:04:52.580> need

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
so to cancel a negative two we need

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.930 
so to cancel a negative two we need
positive<00:04:53.120> two<00:04:53.630> from<00:04:54.050> going<00:04:54.380> and<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:55.580> since

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
positive two from going and so since

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.060 
positive two from going and so since
there's<00:04:56.120> only<00:04:56.210> one<00:04:56.480> iron<00:04:56.960> it's<00:04:57.590> going<00:04:57.830> to<00:04:57.890> be

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
there's only one iron it's going to be

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.980 
there's only one iron it's going to be
positive<00:04:59.000> -<00:04:59.510> exactly<00:05:00.350> okay<00:05:00.680> so<00:05:01.670> I<00:05:02.090> try<00:05:02.660> to<00:05:02.690> name

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
positive - exactly okay so I try to name

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:11.470 
positive - exactly okay so I try to name
it<00:05:04.660> iron<00:05:05.660> again<00:05:06.110> yep<00:05:07.390> then<00:05:09.580> parenthesis<00:05:10.580> has<00:05:11.420> a

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
it iron again yep then parenthesis has a

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.990 
it iron again yep then parenthesis has a
charge<00:05:11.870> of<00:05:12.080> plus<00:05:12.140> two<00:05:12.740> and<00:05:13.430> I<00:05:13.490> guess<00:05:13.670> we<00:05:13.850> need<00:05:13.940> a

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
charge of plus two and I guess we need a

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.280 
charge of plus two and I guess we need a
Roman<00:05:14.330> numeral<00:05:14.740> -<00:05:15.740> yep<00:05:16.580> and<00:05:17.030> then<00:05:17.290> sulphide

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
Roman numeral - yep and then sulphide

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.060 
Roman numeral - yep and then sulphide
just<00:05:19.250> like<00:05:19.400> so<00:05:19.580> ah<00:05:20.380> that's<00:05:21.380> pretty<00:05:21.920> easy

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
just like so ah that's pretty easy

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.770 
just like so ah that's pretty easy
actually<00:05:22.580> it<00:05:23.060> is<00:05:23.180> pretty<00:05:23.420> easy

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
actually it is pretty easy

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.110 
actually it is pretty easy
alright<00:05:24.620> that's<00:05:25.460> basically<00:05:25.850> how<00:05:26.090> you

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
alright that's basically how you

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.030 
alright that's basically how you
traditional<00:05:26.750> architecture<00:05:27.290> oh<00:05:27.470> really

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
traditional architecture oh really

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.620 
traditional architecture oh really
mm-hmm<00:05:28.520> that's<00:05:28.610> all<00:05:28.940> there<00:05:29.120> is<00:05:29.150> to<00:05:29.390> it<00:05:29.540> it's

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
mm-hmm that's all there is to it it's

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.720 
mm-hmm that's all there is to it it's
all<00:05:29.780> there<00:05:29.810> is<00:05:29.990> to<00:05:30.170> it<00:05:30.320> Wow<00:05:30.590> so<00:05:31.340> I<00:05:31.370> think<00:05:31.610> we'll

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
all there is to it Wow so I think we'll

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:32.950 
all there is to it Wow so I think we'll
probably<00:05:31.790> do<00:05:32.030> another<00:05:32.120> episode<00:05:32.480> of<00:05:32.630> give<00:05:32.810> some

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
probably do another episode of give some

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.570 
probably do another episode of give some
a<00:05:33.020> little<00:05:33.200> bit<00:05:33.410> more<00:05:33.530> complicated<00:05:33.830> examples

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
a little bit more complicated examples

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.100 
a little bit more complicated examples
because<00:05:34.730> you<00:05:35.000> know<00:05:35.090> obviously<00:05:35.180> I'm<00:05:35.840> okay<00:05:36.050> you

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
because you know obviously I'm okay you

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.750 
because you know obviously I'm okay you
can't<00:05:36.380> get<00:05:36.500> a<00:05:36.530> lot<00:05:36.680> trickier<00:05:36.890> but<00:05:37.250> yeah<00:05:37.580> of

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
can't get a lot trickier but yeah of

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.760 
can't get a lot trickier but yeah of
course<00:05:38.060> he<00:05:38.270> always<00:05:38.450> does<00:05:38.810> for<00:05:39.200> now<00:05:39.500> we<00:05:39.710> should

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
course he always does for now we should

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.530 
course he always does for now we should
probably<00:05:39.980> these<00:05:40.340> guys<00:05:40.580> you<00:05:40.880> know<00:05:40.970> think<00:05:41.390> about

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
probably these guys you know think about

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.060 
probably these guys you know think about
this<00:05:41.630> for<00:05:41.750> a<00:05:41.810> little<00:05:41.930> bit<00:05:42.080> lipstick<00:05:42.470> in<00:05:42.650> all

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
this for a little bit lipstick in all

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.040 
this for a little bit lipstick in all
right<00:05:43.220> fancy<00:05:43.670> stuff<00:05:44.210> because<00:05:44.540> I<00:05:44.570> mean<00:05:44.780> Roman

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
right fancy stuff because I mean Roman

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.210 
right fancy stuff because I mean Roman
numerals<00:05:45.410> they're<00:05:46.130> kind<00:05:46.400> of<00:05:46.430> weird<00:05:46.550> yeah<00:05:47.060> so

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
numerals they're kind of weird yeah so

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.170 
numerals they're kind of weird yeah so
just<00:05:49.220> remember<00:05:49.370> the<00:05:49.520> traditional<00:05:49.910> of<00:05:49.970> us<00:05:50.060> have

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
just remember the traditional of us have

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.720 
just remember the traditional of us have
no<00:05:50.270> idea<00:05:50.300> what<00:05:50.540> they<00:05:50.630> want<00:05:50.750> to<00:05:50.870> do<00:05:51.490> it's<00:05:52.490> up<00:05:52.580> to

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 
no idea what they want to do it's up to

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.270 
no idea what they want to do it's up to
the<00:05:52.850> anions<00:05:53.360> to<00:05:53.480> make<00:05:54.290> up<00:05:54.500> their<00:05:54.740> minds

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
the anions to make up their minds

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.170 
the anions to make up their minds
exactly

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
exactly

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.620 
exactly
okay<00:05:56.870> you<00:05:57.830> don't<00:05:57.890> want<00:05:58.160> to<00:05:58.220> do<00:05:58.280> today<00:05:58.400> I<00:05:58.730> have

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
okay you don't want to do today I have

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.350 
okay you don't want to do today I have
no<00:05:59.810> idea<00:06:00.200> I<00:06:00.470> don't<00:06:00.680> know<00:06:00.830> either<00:06:01.010> I<00:06:01.430> guess<00:06:02.240> I

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
no idea I don't know either I guess I

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.700 
no idea I don't know either I guess I
guess<00:06:02.660> I<00:06:02.780> can<00:06:02.900> understand<00:06:03.200> each<00:06:03.290> other<00:06:03.470> strong

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
guess I can understand each other strong

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.890 
guess I can understand each other strong
yeah<00:06:04.160> we<00:06:04.400> should<00:06:04.550> probably<00:06:04.580> find<00:06:05.090> some<00:06:05.330> anions

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
yeah we should probably find some anions

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.480 
yeah we should probably find some anions
or<00:06:06.020> something<00:06:06.380> to<00:06:06.470> make<00:06:06.650> up<00:06:06.830> our<00:06:06.980> minds<00:06:07.190> I

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
or something to make up our minds I

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.380 
or something to make up our minds I
think<00:06:07.700> so<00:06:07.790> let's<00:06:08.000> go<00:06:08.090> do<00:06:08.180> that

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
think so let's go do that

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.690 
think so let's go do that
yeah
