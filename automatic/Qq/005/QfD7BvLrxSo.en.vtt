 It is the river Kraus or 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.040
 one of the main parties already rose to the east the department of Casanare 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:18.130
 that supply water to both the capital city and rice farmers and ranchers 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.180
 this main source has been affected in the decrease of its flow 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.760
 as a consequence climate change in recent times affecting 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.190
 seriously those who benefit from it 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.230
 that is why we must protect the climate system for the benefit of 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.860
 present and future generations 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.410
 taking precautionary measures 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.410
 to minimize its effects 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.570
 from this point 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.530
 started the total river created south 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.440
 Two years ago 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.830
 we want to walk approximately 150 meters towards the east 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.760
 to reach the scarce flow of the river 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.020
 that these 150 meters only sand remains 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.780
 and we bushes 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.430
 following loans to Mr. Luis Alfonso Gonzalez LeguizamÃ³n this 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.360
 region 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.320
 who has been affected in the production of his farm could write 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.620
 drug free verses pedro de la rosa 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.040
 paschal 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.460
 the corregimiento of 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.670
 Well, since we came well, he and Arica called me in rainy weather where 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.700
 the river 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.040
 is at a maximum distance of 150 meters before 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.670
 we are entering at this moment 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.570
 i the judge by the dry season we have had 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.810
 in 2009 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.200
 the lack of water 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.450
 then the animals to come here to take only water present already buried 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.480
 in this afternoon

 then country the casino of panama 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.400
 It's our turn to lean on so many flowers 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.749
 again pretty good 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:10.869
 for this time 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.069
 since the pp have agreed 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.699
 therefore the spokesperson 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:16.150
 Practically nothing 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.359
 and is that the control of repsol 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.269
 So that 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.129
 the one that has affected us a lot 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.469
 also because of deforestation 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.060
 and the cti the heating climate change and can be loved 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:31.129

 you look so much like these 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.589
 and so test these things that is happening to me now 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:40.239
 As the parties said they also like a lot to do 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.479
 The time 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:45.479
