00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
hooked up to solar panels they gave me

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.530 
hooked up to solar panels they gave me
in<00:00:38.820> series<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:40.079> anyway<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:41.040> I'm<00:00:41.579> looking<00:00:42.450> on

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
nice box actually and this is going to

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.740 
nice box actually and this is going to
be<00:02:01.439> my<00:02:01.619> solar<00:02:01.890> charge<00:02:02.219> controller<00:02:02.700> what<00:02:03.630> I'm

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
be my solar charge controller what I'm

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.330 
be my solar charge controller what I'm
going<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.930> do<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.320> I'm<00:02:04.409> making<00:02:04.740> for<00:02:04.890> myself

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
I'm going to put a voltage ant meter up

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.609 
I'm going to put a voltage ant meter up
here<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.700> right<00:02:08.910> lights<00:02:09.330> up<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.869> read

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
here the right lights up and I read

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.339 
here the right lights up and I read
volts<00:02:11.009> blue<00:02:11.459> amps<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.060> then<00:02:12.720> down<00:02:12.900> here<00:02:12.930> I'm

and yeah I didn't do anything on the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.870 
and yeah I didn't do anything on the
swamp<00:02:31.860> cooler<00:02:32.130> because<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.490> getting<00:02:32.670> ready

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
swamp cooler because it's getting ready

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.700 
swamp cooler because it's getting ready
to<00:02:32.940> get<00:02:33.180> cold<00:02:33.510> out<00:02:33.780> here<00:02:34.050> as<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> matter<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.530> fact

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
to get cold out here as a matter of fact

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.680 
to get cold out here as a matter of fact
it<00:02:34.830> started<00:02:35.130> cooling<00:02:35.340> off<00:02:35.550> today<00:02:35.850> but<00:02:36.660> I

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
it started cooling off today but I

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.170 
it started cooling off today but I
started<00:02:37.080> getting<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.380> ready<00:02:37.530> this<00:02:38.520> is<00:02:38.580> right

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
started getting it ready this is right

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.830 
started getting it ready this is right
here<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.630> Walmart<00:02:39.900> fan<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.970> recommend<00:02:42.690> these

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
here a Walmart fan and I recommend these

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.840 
here a Walmart fan and I recommend these
because<00:02:43.200> they're<00:02:43.350> pretty<00:02:44.010> high<00:02:44.220> powered<00:02:44.610> what

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
because they're pretty high powered what

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.630 
because they're pretty high powered what
but<00:02:45.150> real<00:02:45.420> low<00:02:45.900> volts<00:02:46.290> here's<00:02:47.250> what<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.490> looks

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
but real low volts here's what it looks

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.820 
but real low volts here's what it looks
like<00:02:47.790> right<00:02:48.030> here<00:02:48.330> when<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.200> take<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.650> one

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
like right here when I take this one

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.710 
like right here when I take this one
apart<00:02:50.130> I'll<00:02:50.490> show<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.850> guys<00:02:51.060> how<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.330> did<00:02:51.600> it

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
apart I'll show you guys how I did it

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.110 
apart I'll show you guys how I did it
what<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:51.900> did<00:02:52.170> basically<00:02:52.530> was<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.370> just<00:02:53.880> took<00:02:54.000> it

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
what I did basically was I just took it

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.620 
what I did basically was I just took it
all<00:02:54.210> apart<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:55.730> but<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.850> can't<00:02:57.090> just<00:02:57.330> screw

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
all apart and I but you can't just screw

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.330 
all apart and I but you can't just screw
it<00:02:57.720> right<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:58.050> this<00:02:58.200> basket<00:02:58.770> here<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.040> got<00:02:59.190> to

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
it right to this basket here you got to

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.370 
it right to this basket here you got to
have<00:02:59.460> the<00:02:59.580> housing<00:02:59.970> part<00:03:00.210> so<00:03:00.990> I<00:03:01.050> took<00:03:01.140> the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
have the housing part so I took the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.530 
have the housing part so I took the
housing<00:03:01.710> part<00:03:01.950> back<00:03:02.130> there<00:03:02.400> as<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.150> can<00:03:03.210> see

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
housing part back there as you can see

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.320 
housing part back there as you can see
and<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:05.280> can<00:03:05.430> leave<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.700> on<00:03:05.790> if<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.060> wanted

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
and I you can leave it on if you wanted

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.120 
and I you can leave it on if you wanted
to<00:03:06.480> but<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.720> didn't<00:03:06.990> want<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.590> because<00:03:08.010> then

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
to but I didn't want to so because then

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.490 
to but I didn't want to so because then
I<00:03:08.220> can't<00:03:08.490> get<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.790> wires<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.270> stuff<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:10.470> I

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
I can't get to the wires and stuff so I

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.590 
I can't get to the wires and stuff so I
just<00:03:11.280> cut<00:03:11.490> that<00:03:11.640> housing<00:03:12.030> off<00:03:12.150> with<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.390> razor

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
just cut that housing off with the razor

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.040 
just cut that housing off with the razor
blade<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:13.740> do<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.130> be<00:03:14.880> real<00:03:15.240> careful<00:03:15.540> put<00:03:15.960> it

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
blade you do that be real careful put it

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.240 
blade you do that be real careful put it
on<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.170> table<00:03:16.410> or<00:03:16.650> something<00:03:16.710> to<00:03:17.070> make<00:03:17.190> sure

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
on a table or something to make sure

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.460 
on a table or something to make sure
that<00:03:17.550> blade<00:03:17.820> ain't<00:03:18.060> going<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.240> hit<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.570> anyway

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
that blade ain't going to hit you anyway

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.620 
that blade ain't going to hit you anyway
that's<00:03:20.220> how<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.490> looks<00:03:20.670> that's<00:03:20.940> one<00:03:21.180> that's

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
that's how it looks that's one that's

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.030 
that's how it looks that's one that's
number<00:03:21.840> one<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.350> reason<00:03:22.440> I'm<00:03:22.680> doing<00:03:22.740> this

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
number one and the reason I'm doing this

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.550 
number one and the reason I'm doing this
is<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:24.209> got<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.420> switch<00:03:24.750> on<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.080> swamp<00:03:25.350> cooler

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
is I got a switch on the swamp cooler

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.760 
is I got a switch on the swamp cooler
for<00:03:25.830> high/low<00:03:26.220> already<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.060> noticed<00:03:27.420> it

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
for high/low already and I noticed it

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.840 
for high/low already and I noticed it
sometimes<00:03:28.770> at<00:03:28.920> night<00:03:28.950> when<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.370> turn<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:29.670> off

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
sometimes at night when I turn it off

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.150 
sometimes at night when I turn it off
it's<00:03:30.060> hot<00:03:30.240> if<00:03:31.110> I<00:03:31.230> turn<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.530> back<00:03:31.650> on<00:03:31.800> it's<00:03:32.010> too
