and play around with the green I'm going
to<00:01:02.670> be<00:01:02.730> using<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.390> camera<00:01:03.750> calibration

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
to be using the camera calibration

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.250 
to be using the camera calibration
option<00:01:05.180> and<00:01:06.180> while<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.689> play<00:01:06.840> around<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.170> the

sliders<00:01:07.380> I'll<00:01:08.070> talk<00:01:08.310> about<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.760> bit<00:01:09.290> this<00:01:10.290> is

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
sliders I'll talk about it a bit this is

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.260 
sliders I'll talk about it a bit this is
just<00:01:10.650> another<00:01:10.860> useful<00:01:11.159> tool<00:01:11.460> which<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.090> don't

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
just another useful tool which I don't

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.520 
just another useful tool which I don't
use<00:01:12.420> for<00:01:12.600> anything<00:01:12.780> other<00:01:13.020> than<00:01:13.140> gig

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
use for anything other than gig

photography<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.270> deal<00:01:15.450> with

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
photography we have to deal with

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.780 
photography we have to deal with
absolutely<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.500> see<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.040> lighten<00:01:17.430> all<00:01:17.670> the

basically<00:01:19.439> all<00:01:19.710> cameras<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.430> different

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
basically all cameras have different

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.630 
basically all cameras have different
responses<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.180> colors<00:01:21.619> because<00:01:22.619> all<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
responses to colors because all the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.520 
responses to colors because all the
sensors<00:01:23.970> are<00:01:24.090> different<00:01:24.450> camera<00:01:25.350> calibration

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
sensors are different camera calibration

sensors are different camera calibration

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
the lights well the colors to the next

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.590 
the lights well the colors to the next
level<00:01:33.979> rather<00:01:34.159> than<00:01:34.250> just<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.640> change<00:01:35.329> in<00:01:35.509> the

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
option is shadows this affects the tint

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.859 
option is shadows this affects the tint

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
and blue these are what is clear about

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.870 
and blue these are what is clear about
the<00:01:50.810> colors<00:01:51.439> that<00:01:51.770> won't<00:01:52.159> capture<00:01:52.340> right<00:01:52.610> in

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
green to magenta as you just the hero of

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.300 
green to magenta as you just the hero of
one<00:02:09.049> color<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:09.319> may<00:02:09.530> affect<00:02:09.649> another<00:02:10.009> color

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
one color and may affect another color

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.140 
one color and may affect another color
so<00:02:10.519> keeping<00:02:10.880> in<00:02:11.030> mind<00:02:11.290> when<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.380> use<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.620> net<00:02:12.890> I

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
so keeping in mind when you use a net I

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.520 
so keeping in mind when you use a net I
usually<00:02:14.150> play<00:02:14.660> around<00:02:14.900> with<00:02:15.019> these<00:02:15.170> until<00:02:15.470> the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
usually play around with these until the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.160 
usually play around with these until the
colors<00:02:15.799> look<00:02:16.060> it's<00:02:17.060> natural<00:02:17.660> as<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:17.810> can<00:02:18.019> get

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
colors look it's natural as I can get

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.199 
colors look it's natural as I can get
them<00:02:18.379> and<00:02:18.709> I<00:02:19.370> could<00:02:19.549> play<00:02:19.700> around<00:02:19.849> with<00:02:20.060> these

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
them and I could play around with these

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.949 
them and I could play around with these
settings<00:02:20.269> for<00:02:20.890> absolutely<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:22.010> was<00:02:22.310> just

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
settings for absolutely I was just

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.780 
settings for absolutely I was just
fine-tuning<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.140> but<00:02:24.950> this<00:02:25.160> is<00:02:25.340> just<00:02:25.459> to<00:02:25.610> give

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
fine-tuning it but this is just to give

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.500 
fine-tuning it but this is just to give
you<00:02:26.060> an<00:02:26.569> idea<00:02:26.840> of<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:28.519> options<00:02:28.849> you<00:02:28.970> have<00:02:29.150> when

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
you an idea of the options you have when

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.770 
you an idea of the options you have when
it<00:02:29.569> comes<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:30.129> sorting<00:02:31.129> out<00:02:31.250> red<00:02:31.459> light

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
it comes to sorting out red light

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.590 
it comes to sorting out red light
usually<00:02:32.780> for<00:02:33.620> red<00:02:33.769> light<00:02:33.950> images<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.639> will<00:02:35.420> just

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
usually for red light images I will just

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.449 
usually for red light images I will just
tone<00:02:35.810> down<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.139> red<00:02:36.290> a<00:02:36.319> bit<00:02:36.530> but<00:02:37.130> keeping<00:02:37.340> it

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
tone down the red a bit but keeping it

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.670 
tone down the red a bit but keeping it
red<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.000> just<00:02:38.420> try<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:38.690> drag<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.200> detail<00:02:39.470> back

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
red and just try to drag the detail back

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.300 
red and just try to drag the detail back
in<00:02:39.859> which<00:02:40.519> I<00:02:40.700> was<00:02:40.880> sure<00:02:41.060> in<00:02:41.359> another<00:02:41.750> tutorial

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
in which I was sure in another tutorial

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.470 
in which I was sure in another tutorial
which<00:02:43.310> would<00:02:43.430> probably<00:02:43.519> be<00:02:43.700> with<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.090> JPEG

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
which would probably be with the JPEG

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.349 
which would probably be with the JPEG
one<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:45.609> but<00:02:46.609> some<00:02:46.790> people<00:02:47.000> wanted<00:02:47.209> to<00:02:47.269> know

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
one and but some people wanted to know

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.530 
one and but some people wanted to know
how<00:02:47.569> to<00:02:47.630> get<00:02:47.750> rid<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.109> red<00:02:48.260> completely

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
how to get rid of the red completely

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.670 
how to get rid of the red completely
yeah<00:02:50.540> I'm<00:02:50.630> just<00:02:50.810> adding<00:02:50.989> a<00:02:51.079> bit<00:02:51.200> more<00:02:51.230> warmth

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
yeah I'm just adding a bit more warmth

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.479 
yeah I'm just adding a bit more warmth
back<00:02:51.950> into<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.400> image<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:53.480> was<00:02:53.690> a<00:02:53.720> bit<00:02:53.900> green

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
back into the image it was a bit green

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.990 
back into the image it was a bit green
needs<00:02:55.489> it<00:02:55.849> does<00:02:56.269> need<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.480> bit<00:02:56.690> more<00:02:56.799> blue<00:02:58.000> or

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
needs it does need a bit more blue or

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.720 
needs it does need a bit more blue or
call<00:02:59.450> that<00:02:59.599> horns<00:03:00.019> because<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.130> is<00:03:01.220> really

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
call that horns because it is really

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.400 
call that horns because it is really
really<00:03:01.849> warm<00:03:02.120> but

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
really warm but

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.980 
really warm but
when<00:03:04.010> you<00:03:04.130> see<00:03:04.310> where<00:03:04.520> it's<00:03:04.640> come<00:03:04.910> from<00:03:04.990> to

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
when you see where it's come from to

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.480 
when you see where it's come from to
what<00:03:06.110> it<00:03:06.200> is<00:03:06.290> now<00:03:06.470> it's<00:03:06.650> a<00:03:06.770> huge<00:03:07.010> difference

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
what it is now it's a huge difference

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.310 
what it is now it's a huge difference
but<00:03:07.820> I<00:03:07.970> guess<00:03:08.150> see<00:03:08.300> playing<00:03:08.960> around<00:03:09.170> with

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
but I guess see playing around with

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.190 
but I guess see playing around with
these<00:03:09.440> settings<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:10.850> get<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.780> effect<00:03:12.080> that

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
these settings to get the effect that

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.970 
these settings to get the effect that
you<00:03:12.530> want

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
you want

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.520 
you want
and<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:14.210> got<00:03:14.390> literally<00:03:14.720> do<00:03:14.840> this<00:03:14.870> for<00:03:15.200> hours

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
and I got literally do this for hours

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.480 
and I got literally do this for hours
hours<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:16.550> hours<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:18.130> just<00:03:19.130> going<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.310> show

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
hours and hours and just going to show

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.790 
hours and hours and just going to show
you<00:03:19.520> the<00:03:19.760> before<00:03:20.320> there's<00:03:21.320> actually<00:03:21.710> an

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
you the before there's actually an

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.120 
you the before there's actually an
option<00:03:22.630> we<00:03:23.630> can<00:03:23.780> have<00:03:23.900> them<00:03:24.050> side<00:03:24.260> by<00:03:24.290> side<00:03:24.500> but

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
option we can have them side by side but

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.800 
option we can have them side by side but
I'm<00:03:25.940> just<00:03:26.030> going<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.270> show<00:03:26.330> you<00:03:26.420> that<00:03:26.660> was

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
I'm just going to show you that was

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.290 
I'm just going to show you that was
before<00:03:27.190> this<00:03:28.190> is<00:03:28.370> after<00:03:28.520> still<00:03:29.060> a<00:03:29.090> bit<00:03:29.270> too

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
before this is after still a bit too

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
before this is after still a bit too
greeny<00:03:29.930> yellowy<00:03:30.260> but<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:32.600> image<00:03:32.810> serves<00:03:33.140> its

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
greeny yellowy but the image serves its

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.040 
greeny yellowy but the image serves its
purpose<00:03:34.780> was<00:03:35.780> a<00:03:35.840> bit<00:03:36.080> more<00:03:36.260> tweaking<00:03:37.900> it<00:03:38.900> can

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
purpose was a bit more tweaking it can

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.360 
purpose was a bit more tweaking it can
be<00:03:39.170> saved<00:03:40.690> which<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:41.900> great<00:03:42.110> so<00:03:42.440> that's<00:03:43.130> it

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
be saved which is great so that's it

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.460 
be saved which is great so that's it
it's<00:03:43.520> as<00:03:43.640> simple<00:03:43.790> as<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.240> it<00:03:44.420> just<00:03:44.660> depends

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
it's as simple as that it just depends

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.900 
it's as simple as that it just depends
on<00:03:46.270> what<00:03:47.270> you<00:03:47.390> want<00:03:47.600> from<00:03:47.750> it
