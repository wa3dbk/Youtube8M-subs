you'll<00:02:02.530> start<00:02:02.800> to<00:02:02.860> see<00:02:02.950> in<00:02:03.369> street<00:02:04.360> furniture

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
you'll start to see in street furniture

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.270 
you'll start to see in street furniture
in<00:02:05.380> mall<00:02:06.250> kiosks<00:02:07.000> such<00:02:07.360> our<00:02:07.479> airports<00:02:08.280> well

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
in mall kiosks such our airports well

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.919 
in mall kiosks such our airports well
actually<00:02:09.729> starting<00:02:10.210> to<00:02:10.240> happen<00:02:10.390> know<00:02:10.630> that

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
actually starting to happen know that

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.900 
actually starting to happen know that
there's<00:02:11.440> cameras<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:12.069> can<00:02:12.190> see<00:02:12.340> in<00:02:12.610> three

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
there's cameras that can see in three

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.880 
there's cameras that can see in three
dimensions<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:13.990> you<00:02:14.050> could<00:02:14.290> just<00:02:14.440> do

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
dimensions and so you could just do

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.140 
dimensions and so you could just do
gestures<00:02:15.160> beforehand<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.970> trail
