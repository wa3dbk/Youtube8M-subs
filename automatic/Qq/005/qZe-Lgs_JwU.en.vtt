them the the string up to pitch before I
strike<00:02:05.300> it<00:02:05.440> so<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.530> listening<00:02:06.860> hole

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
strike it so the listening hole

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.080 
strike it so the listening hole
listening<00:02:07.850> is<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.420> release<00:02:08.780> of<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:09.140> bend

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
listening is is the release of the bend

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
could want to do that way but in this

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.619 
could want to do that way but in this
particular<00:02:17.860> we're<00:02:18.860> gonna<00:02:18.950> prepended

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
particular we're gonna prepended

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.809 
particular we're gonna prepended
and<00:02:21.079> after<00:02:21.439> that<00:02:21.560> mean<00:02:21.829> your<00:02:22.340> first<00:02:22.549> thing
