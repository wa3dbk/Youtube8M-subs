00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.450 

this<00:00:00.420> is<00:00:00.719> my<00:00:01.350> very<00:00:01.410> first<00:00:02.810> robot<00:00:04.460> not

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
this is my very first robot not

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.879 
this is my very first robot not
extraordinarily<00:00:06.000> impressive<00:00:07.130> but<00:00:08.130> it<00:00:08.519> works

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
extraordinarily impressive but it works

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.660 
extraordinarily impressive but it works
stupid<00:00:10.889> little<00:00:11.040> wheels<00:00:12.590> sent<00:00:13.590> from<00:00:13.740> micro

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
stupid little wheels sent from micro

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.029 
stupid little wheels sent from micro
controller<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.929> two<00:00:17.539> servos<00:00:18.539> with<00:00:19.380> an<00:00:19.529> LED<00:00:19.680> on

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
controller and two servos with an LED on

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:27.099 
controller and two servos with an LED on
top<00:00:21.680> little<00:00:22.680> tiny<00:00:23.060> rubber<00:00:24.060> foot<00:00:24.980> on<00:00:25.980> my<00:00:26.130> washer

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
top little tiny rubber foot on my washer

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.450 
top little tiny rubber foot on my washer
to<00:00:28.109> provide<00:00:28.470> grip<00:00:30.439> this<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.769> other<00:00:31.859> side<00:00:32.160> I

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
to provide grip this is the other side I

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.290 
to provide grip this is the other side I
wanted<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.270> see<00:00:33.480> if<00:00:34.100> I<00:00:35.100> could<00:00:35.160> get<00:00:36.030> something

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
wanted to see if I could get something

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.340 
wanted to see if I could get something
to<00:00:36.660> move<00:00:37.010> with<00:00:38.010> simply<00:00:38.550> two<00:00:38.790> servos<00:00:39.350> wrong

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
to move with simply two servos wrong

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.069 
to move with simply two servos wrong
with<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.590> servo<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.910> doesn't<00:00:42.420> spin<00:00:42.870> all

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
with the servo is it doesn't spin all

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.810 
with the servo is it doesn't spin all
the<00:00:43.110> way<00:00:43.230> around<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> motor<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.399> only<00:00:44.550> has

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the way around like a motor it only has

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.049 
the way around like a motor it only has
180<00:00:45.450> degrees<00:00:46.399> so<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:48.230> program<00:00:49.610> three<00:00:50.610> simple

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
180 degrees so I program three simple

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.569 
180 degrees so I program three simple
four<00:00:51.629> loops<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:54.620> glued<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.770> together<00:00:56.190> with

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
four loops and glued this together with

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.910 
four loops and glued this together with
hot<00:00:57.449> glue<00:00:57.690> gun<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.699> actually<00:00:59.969> goes<00:01:00.920> and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
hot glue gun and it actually goes and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.000 
hot glue gun and it actually goes and
press<00:01:02.449> this<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.629> my<00:01:03.809> first<00:01:04.080> keep<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.769> mind

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
press this is my first keep that in mind

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:26.730 
press this is my first keep that in mind
more<00:01:06.000> better<00:01:06.390> ones<00:01:06.630> will<00:01:06.840> come

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:55.800 

hey<00:01:27.740> you<00:01:27.800> stop<00:01:29.350> one<00:01:30.350> more<00:01:30.500> time

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:06.280 

ok<00:02:02.800> Hey<00:02:03.800> look<00:02:04.040> at
