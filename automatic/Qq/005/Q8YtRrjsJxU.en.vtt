here and I'll say the mint as a

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.930 
here and I'll say the mint as a
secondary<00:02:46.060> flavor<00:02:46.510> is<00:02:47.310> probably<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.670> most

much<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.310> see<00:04:19.550> really<00:04:19.820> it's<00:04:20.030> it's<00:04:20.480> this<00:04:20.720> same

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
much to see really it's it's this same

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.330 
much to see really it's it's this same

this is chocolate also on the inside um

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.220 
this is chocolate also on the inside um
it's<00:04:31.400> just<00:04:31.460> you<00:04:31.790> know<00:04:32.180> mint-infused<00:04:32.690> and

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
it's just you know mint-infused and

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.100 
it's just you know mint-infused and
green<00:04:34.010> colored<00:04:34.660> although<00:04:35.660> I've<00:04:35.780> heard<00:04:35.960> in

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
green colored although I've heard in

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.170 
green colored although I've heard in
some<00:04:36.320> versions<00:04:36.650> of<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.890> Aero<00:04:37.070> mint<00:04:37.370> they've

some versions of the Aero mint they've

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.140 
some versions of the Aero mint they've
removed<00:04:38.450> the<00:04:38.600> coloring<00:04:39.040> I<00:04:40.040> think<00:04:40.820> that's<00:04:40.970> a

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
removed the coloring I think that's a

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.670 
removed the coloring I think that's a
Nestle<00:04:42.160> corporate<00:04:43.750> decision<00:04:44.750> to<00:04:44.930> sort<00:04:45.530> of

phase out food coloring in their

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.110 
phase out food coloring in their

products beside the point though I like
the<00:04:50.270> coloring<00:04:50.570> I<00:04:50.780> think<00:04:51.110> it<00:04:51.200> looks<00:04:51.380> good<00:04:52.420> this

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
the coloring I think it looks good this

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.170 
the coloring I think it looks good this
is<00:04:53.630> a<00:04:53.660> bar<00:04:53.960> that's<00:04:54.320> all<00:04:54.500> about<00:04:54.650> texture<00:04:55.250> you

that's part of what it's all about which
you<00:05:03.680> know<00:05:03.770> you<00:05:03.830> need<00:05:04.190> that<00:05:04.220> if<00:05:04.550> you're<00:05:04.700> having

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
you know you need that if you're having

the<00:05:05.630> bar<00:05:05.840> that's<00:05:06.140> you<00:05:06.650> know<00:05:06.770> relying<00:05:07.310> solely

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
the bar that's you know relying solely

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.590 
the bar that's you know relying solely
on<00:05:07.910> chocolate

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
on chocolate

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.170 
on chocolate
it<00:05:08.720> better<00:05:08.930> be<00:05:09.050> creamy<00:05:09.500> and<00:05:09.620> smooth<00:05:10.040> but<00:05:10.880> the

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
it better be creamy and smooth but the

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.750 
it better be creamy and smooth but the
texture<00:05:11.660> of<00:05:11.690> the<00:05:12.050> bubbles<00:05:12.440> is<00:05:13.130> great<00:05:13.490> because

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
texture of the bubbles is great because

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.650 
texture of the bubbles is great because

it kind of these miniature collapsing in

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.020 
it kind of these miniature collapsing in
on<00:05:17.750> itself<00:05:17.810> it<00:05:18.680> really<00:05:18.710> does<00:05:19.220> have<00:05:19.490> a<00:05:19.520> kind<00:05:19.880> of

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
on itself it really does have a kind of

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.130 
on itself it really does have a kind of
airiness<00:05:20.570> to<00:05:20.600> it<00:05:20.780> a<00:05:20.930> lightness<00:05:21.380> to<00:05:21.410> it<00:05:21.650> now<00:05:22.550> I

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
know like I don't know does that does

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.930 
know like I don't know does that does
that<00:05:32.960> much<00:05:33.650> does<00:05:33.800> that<00:05:33.950> does<00:05:34.250> that<00:05:34.400> count<00:05:34.640> for

that much does that does that count for

how much does that cover that's kind of

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.990 
how much does that cover that's kind of
hard<00:05:36.680> to<00:05:36.710> say<00:05:36.980> I<00:05:37.190> think<00:05:37.280> that's<00:05:37.520> gonna<00:05:37.730> be<00:05:37.820> up

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
hard to say I think that's gonna be up

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.380 
hard to say I think that's gonna be up
to<00:05:38.120> the<00:05:38.150> individual<00:05:38.780> I<00:05:39.650> like<00:05:40.310> it<00:05:40.460> as<00:05:40.580> a<00:05:40.940> texture

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
to the individual I like it as a texture

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.260 
to the individual I like it as a texture
it's<00:05:41.570> definitely<00:05:41.930> an<00:05:42.050> interesting<00:05:43.270> an

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
it's definitely an interesting an

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.560 
it's definitely an interesting an
interesting<00:05:44.560> taste<00:05:46.030> an<00:05:47.030> interesting

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
interesting taste an interesting

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.960 
interesting taste an interesting
experience<00:05:48.200> more<00:05:49.070> I<00:05:49.100> suppose<00:05:49.400> I<00:05:49.580> should<00:05:49.760> say

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
experience more I suppose I should say

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.090 
experience more I suppose I should say
and<00:05:50.870> it's<00:05:51.230> something<00:05:51.380> that<00:05:51.590> I<00:05:51.620> think<00:05:51.890> people

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
and it's something that I think people

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.620 
and it's something that I think people
should<00:05:52.130> totally<00:05:52.790> try<00:05:53.000> I<00:05:53.450> won't<00:05:54.200> say<00:05:54.530> that<00:05:54.560> it's

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
should totally try I won't say that it's

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.460 
should totally try I won't say that it's
that<00:05:56.630> it's<00:05:56.810> like<00:05:57.050> you<00:05:58.010> know<00:05:59.200> defines<00:06:00.200> the

is one you should should go for

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:23.619 
is one you should should go for
certainly<00:06:16.720> the<00:06:17.720> mint<00:06:18.050> here<00:06:18.410> is<00:06:18.560> good<00:06:19.220> it's

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:28.339 

it's<00:06:24.629> strong<00:06:25.879> but<00:06:26.879> not<00:06:27.030> overpowering<00:06:27.349> it's

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
it's strong but not overpowering it's
