telescope but it is possible that you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.289 
telescope but it is possible that you

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
guess the combination by accident or you

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.210 
guess the combination by accident or you
can<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.570> what<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.750> did<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:37.080> simply<00:01:37.590> load<00:01:38.039> an

can do what I did and simply load an

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.940 
can do what I did and simply load an
earlier<00:01:38.490> safe<00:01:38.759> game<00:01:39.229> when<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.320> already<00:01:40.500> have

earlier safe game when you already have

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.810 
earlier safe game when you already have
the<00:01:41.250> combination

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.880 

not<00:01:46.390> much<00:01:46.540> happens<00:01:46.930> here<00:01:47.080> except<00:01:47.410> us<00:01:47.500> falling
