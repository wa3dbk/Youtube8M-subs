to control the camera view you can play

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.160 
to control the camera view you can play
around<00:01:09.460> with<00:01:09.910> it<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:11.350> do<00:01:11.500> full<00:01:11.770> flip<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.990> also

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
around with it can do full flip we also

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.920 
around with it can do full flip we also
can<00:01:14.530> zoom<00:01:14.860> in<00:01:15.160> for<00:01:16.150> instance<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:18.840> then<00:01:19.840> you

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
can zoom in for instance and then you

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.900 
can zoom in for instance and then you
will<00:01:20.080> also<00:01:20.229> be<00:01:20.380> able<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.950> freeze<00:01:21.700> the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
will also be able to freeze the

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.660 
will also be able to freeze the
animation<00:01:22.600> so<00:01:23.590> you<00:01:23.710> can<00:01:23.920> actually<00:01:24.130> better

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
animation so you can actually better
