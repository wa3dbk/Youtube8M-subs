put<00:02:50.100> them<00:02:50.250> on<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:53.670> first<00:02:53.820> way<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.060> can<00:02:54.239> do<00:02:54.360> it

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
put them on the first way you can do it

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.040 
put them on the first way you can do it
is<00:02:54.570> just<00:02:54.810> by<00:02:54.959> using<00:02:55.170> your<00:02:59.510> the<00:03:00.510> defuser<00:03:01.019> that

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
is just by using your the defuser that

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.259 
is just by using your the defuser that
you<00:03:01.200> have<00:03:01.350> on<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.739> actual<00:03:02.209> flash<00:03:03.209> itself<00:03:05.269> so

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
you have on the actual flash itself so

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:14.090 
you have on the actual flash itself so
you<00:03:06.360> can<00:03:10.670> stick<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.790> in<00:03:11.850> there<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:13.100> no

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
you can stick it in there and no

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.590 
you can stick it in there and no
problems<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.610> don't<00:03:14.730> slide<00:03:15.000> out<00:03:15.030> anything

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
problems you don't slide out anything

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.420 
problems you don't slide out anything
and<00:03:17.540> you<00:03:18.540> will<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.720> lot<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:18.959> people<00:03:19.430> talking

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
about the gels melting with the flash

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.870 
about the gels melting with the flash
but<00:03:26.519> so<00:03:26.730> far<00:03:28.130> none<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.160> them<00:03:29.280> have<00:03:29.459> melted<00:03:29.760> on

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
but so far none of them have melted on

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.289 
but so far none of them have melted on
me<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.860> mean<00:03:31.860> I'm<00:03:31.980> not<00:03:32.130> used<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.430> flash<00:03:32.730> on<00:03:32.940> full

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
me I mean I'm not used to flash on full

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.420 
me I mean I'm not used to flash on full
power<00:03:33.620> which<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.650> don't<00:03:34.920> really<00:03:34.950> need<00:03:35.250> to

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
power which you don't really need to

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:43.190 
power which you don't really need to
more<00:03:35.640> so<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:37.260> that's<00:03:37.709> first<00:03:37.950> we<00:03:38.190> can<00:03:38.430> do<00:03:38.519> it<00:03:42.200> or

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
more so so that's first we can do it or

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.190 
more so so that's first we can do it or
you<00:03:43.350> just<00:03:43.530> wait<00:03:43.829> across<00:03:44.810> front<00:03:45.810> of<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:45.959> flash

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
you just wait across front of the flash

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:57.340 
you just wait across front of the flash
there<00:03:49.400> then<00:03:50.400> sticky<00:03:50.880> gel<00:03:51.090> holder<00:03:51.450> on<00:03:52.019> top
