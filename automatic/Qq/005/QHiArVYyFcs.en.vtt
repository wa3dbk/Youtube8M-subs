00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.419
 hello everyone welcome once again my 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.459
 this card is that I have a makeup 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:09.680
 using the new smoky palette of urban di 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:11.840
 that I will be creating this makeup as 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.490
 for the night if you do not have the palette 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.290
 matter the truth is that I bought it 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.390
 only because I'm a fan of 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.039
 urban naked paddles and cake but the 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.810
 colors of the shadows I bet you 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.029
 you can have them in other palettes 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.710
 makeup let's start applying 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.659
 high first so that these shadows will 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.880
 be well stuck and be much more 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:30.769
 easy to blur we paste a little 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.809
 for the mobile eyelid and we distribute it 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.809
 all over the eyelid with the fingertip 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.330
 now let's put a little piece of ribbon 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.830
 in the corners of the eyes this is going 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.950
 to help our shadows and 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.510
 outlined are very well defined and 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.640
 now if we start applying the 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.620
 shadows let's take the color canvas 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.180
 blurring towards the top of the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.920
 eyelid this is going to help us that the 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.720
 next shadow are blurred well and 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.720
 also do the transition colors 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.210
 we're also going to take a little bit of a 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.070
 pencil color crisis we believe milestone for 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.660
 apply it here on the mobile eyelid and what 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.490
 let's blur very well with a 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.590
 synthetic brush this is the brush that 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.120
 comes in naked 3 this urban I gave that the 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.100
 I really do not know why they put this 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.660
 type of brushes in these palettes because 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.610
 I did not really occupy them to apply 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.860
 the shadows but to apply something that 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.880
 is cream or concealers 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.649
 all right 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.420
 then let's take a brush 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.399
 similar to this is the purchase in the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.229
 Target store and we will place our 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.840
 color of transition that will be the color 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.789
 password that is like an opaque gray both 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.280
 shadows that I have applied are in finish 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.049
 mate this color we will use it as 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.299
 the transition color in our basin 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.369
 we will blend well until 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.149
 at the edge of the pencil crisis we get well 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.149
 dissipated 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.290
 do not 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.979
 do not 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.010
 but we continue to apply the color black 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.810
 We will apply this market in the 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.490
 outer corner blurring a little 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.560
 inward to the middle of the eyelid 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.330
 mobile as this color is the darkest 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.300
 that is in the palette with this we are going to 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.740
 create depth in the eyes easily 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.720
 we stain from doing out in 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.550
 reaching to the middle of the eyelid 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.290
 mobile and with the previous brush that 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.450
 you used is to blur in the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.430
 basin with this same let's blur 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.740
 around here in the basin so there's no 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.840
 no cut between the shadows and everything is 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.660
 go mixing and this color comes 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.940
 being as something satiny almost nothing the 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.790
 it's really a little bit shiny but almost 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.099
 it is staying as mate 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.900
 and the protagonist of this makeup is 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.760
 the gray color we have in the center 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.640
 of the eyelid we are going to apply the color 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.980
 armor that is like a super satin gray 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.689
 with silver pigments is my favorite 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.790
 we are going to apply it here in the 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:57.379
 free space left and if 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.870
 you want to give it a little more brightness 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.760
 Apply a little bit of silver pigments 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.680
 through the center of the mobile eyelid but 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.480
 first nun your brochita with a spray 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.260
 of makeup so that these stay 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.260
 well pegaditos 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.310
 and with that we finish the shadows in the 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.410
 eyelid mobile 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.810
 now we are going to continue delineating with 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.970
 your favorite eyeliner and if you placed it is 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.620
 a ribbon on the outside the outlined you 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.620
 will be super finite at the end 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.299
 once ready the delineated then 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.129
 we started to make up the eyelashes is 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.900
 optional if you want to use tabs 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.760
 false but in this makeup it 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.129
 it requires a bit because the hoops look 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.829
 more precious in the end you have to 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.569
 to stay like this then here we jump to 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.700
 make up our face i will be 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.980
 applying the test is seen to face skins 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.930
 mudin face and I will also be applying my 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.150
 favorite basis of the moment of your face the 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.799
 new that drew points away in color 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.079
 sentence of this would be using 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.939
 just a drop as you can see the 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.680
 I will distribute to pat with my 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.209
 little finger all over my face that um 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.340
 I understand why there are girls who use 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.709
 more than one drop if this base has a 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.720
 excellent coverage and that helps your 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.060
 skin looks healthy covering all 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.400
 its imperfections is also free of 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.519
 oil is super easy to blur and 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.180
 apart it feels super light covering 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.180
 perfectly good your skin 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.600
 and now I'm going to be applying my 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.030
 corrector'll be applying for 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.310
 naked skin in a light mid-tone 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.440
 neutral and this I'm going to apply here in 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.090
 my dark circles triangular shaped by the 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.160
 middle of the eyebrows of the bridge of the 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.020
 very cupid nose at the corner of 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.120
 my lips simply to illuminate the 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.919
 skin and I'll be blurring it with the 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.840
 same synthetic brush that comes in the 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.910
 palette I love the brushes that 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.280
 they come here that's why I take them 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.820
 to blur correctors or products 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.820
 in cream 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.040
 after that I'm going to pass the viola and 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.380
 turn on all over my face giving 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.420
 little touches to make sure everything has 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.300
 well blurred and the application 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.950
 has been smooth now let's give it a 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.290
 little definition to the lower eyelid 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.760
 let's take a brown pencil and this what 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.320
 let's apply on the water line 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.480
 lower blurring a little bit towards 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.520
 outside between the tabs and we're going to 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.740
 take another brush in finite stitch and 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.030
 let's apply the wisky coffee color 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.030
 which is in matt finish 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:50.219
 and another small brush angled 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:51.689
 let's take the black market color the 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:53.939
 same as we apply in the corner 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:56.489
 outside of the mobile eyelid this we're going 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:58.709
 to apply in the corner of the eyelid 

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:59.999
 lower half way up what 

00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:01.769
 let's do with this brochita 

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:04.789
 skinny because we're just going to 

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:04.789
 apply between the tabs 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.430
 and the next step is optional I'm going to 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.500
 take this style eyeliner that 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.790
 It has a very finite point to delineate 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.790
 the corner of my eyes 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:34.229
 and to seal my concealer which is the 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.229
 banana power of the anastasia palette 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.570
 and also from that same palette use the 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.790
 'chava' to outline my face and here 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:46.120
 define a little bit more since I'm going to 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.920
 be using a very short plus and 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.870
 also with this same I use it for 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.210
 define my nose I'm using a 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.690
 this cosmetic strip fan brush and it's 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.670
 the number 116 and last of robert 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.800
 let's apply something very light I 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:03.910
 I'm using a pale rosy this is from 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.590
 mac and number 61 the name is mauve if 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.930
 The colors that you wear on your eyes are 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.880
 very heavy or very dark then in 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.890
 the rest of the makeup has to go very 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.140
 light we are going to apply a lipstick that is 

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.850
 neutral very low the names of the 

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.430
 lipsticks that I used I'm going to 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.020
 leave pointed below the video and this 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.670
 It is the result of makeup 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.650
 this is a make-up like for the night 

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.390
 because it looks very loaded in the eyes but 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.130
 if you want it even more loaded you can 

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.050
 apply a black pencil in the line of 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.520
 lower water and talking about the palette the 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.470
 true the colors do not look very 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.600
 originals since you can find them 

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:36.730
 in other types of pallets because the 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.590
 colors closely resemble others that do not 

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.810
 they cost as much as this palette but 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.849
 I'm a decision, I'm a lover of 

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:46.089
 naked and that's why I decided 

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:48.069
 and good if you like the look of hand 

00:07:46.089 --> 00:07:51.119
 above and you subscribe see you in 

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:51.119
 another chao tutorial 

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.790
