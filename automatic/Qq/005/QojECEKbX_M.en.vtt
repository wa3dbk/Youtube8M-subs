that<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.820> took<00:00:59.940> me<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.210> long<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.420> get<00:01:00.690> it

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
that it took me so long to get it

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.329 
that it took me so long to get it
because<00:01:00.989> I've<00:01:01.980> always<00:01:02.219> had<00:01:03.229> one<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> like

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
because I've always had one of the like

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.590 
because I've always had one of the like
back<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.850> guess<00:01:07.460> yeah<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.640> 10<00:01:08.909> years<00:01:09.119> ago<00:01:09.360> I

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
back I guess yeah like 10 years ago I

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.920 
back I guess yeah like 10 years ago I
got<00:01:09.960> bad<00:01:10.650> company<00:01:11.180> which<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.420> prequel<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
got bad company which is the prequel to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.020 
got bad company which is the prequel to
GTO<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.130> guess<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.490> took<00:01:14.610> like<00:01:14.790> 10

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
GTO and then I guess it took like 10

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.280 
GTO and then I guess it took like 10
years<00:01:15.270> for<00:01:15.479> me<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> finally<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:16.020> around<00:01:16.080> to
